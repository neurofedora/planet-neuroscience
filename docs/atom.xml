Response to acid stress is critical for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; to successfully complete its life-cycle by passing through the stomach to colonize the digestive tract. To develop a fundamental understanding of this response, we established a molecular mechanistic description of acid stress mitigation responses in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and integrated them with a genome-scale model of its metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-model). We considered three known mechanisms of acid stress mitigation: 1) change in membrane lipid fatty acid composition, 2) change in periplasmic protein stability over external pH and periplasmic chaperone protection mechanisms, and 3) change in the activities of membrane proteins. After integrating these mechanisms into an established ME-model, we could simulate their responses in the context of other cellular processes. We validated these simulations using RNA sequencing data obtained from five &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains grown under external pH ranging from 5.5 to 7.0. We found: i) that for the differentially expressed genes accounted for in the ME-model, 80% of the upregulated genes were correctly predicted by the ME-model, and ii) that these genes are mainly involved in translation processes (45% of genes), membrane proteins and related processes (18% of genes), amino acid metabolism (12% of genes), and cofactor and prosthetic group biosynthesis (8% of genes). We also demonstrated several intervention strategies on acid tolerance that can be simulated by the ME-model. We thus established a quantitative framework that describes, on a genome-scale, the acid stress mitigation response of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; that has both scientific and practical uses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Fr0qkVTH3w0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The goal of many single-cell studies on eukaryotic cells is to gain insight into the biochemical reactions that control cell fate and state. In this paper we introduce the concept of Effective Stoichiometric Spaces (ESS) to guide the reconstruction of biochemical networks from multiplexed, fixed time-point, single-cell data. In contrast to methods based solely on statistical models of data, the ESS method leverages the power of the geometric theory of toric varieties to begin unraveling the structure of chemical reaction networks (CRN). This application of toric theory enables a data-driven mapping of covariance relationships in single-cell measurements into stoichiometric information, one in which each cell subpopulation has its associated ESS interpreted in terms of CRN theory. In the development of ESS we reframe certain aspects of the theory of CRN to better match data analysis. As an application of our approach we process cytomery- and image-based single-cell datasets and identify differences in cells treated with kinase inhibitors. Our approach is directly applicable to data acquired using readily accessible experimental methods such as Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and multiplex immunofluorescence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r-HbVuPEIzs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The gut microbiota, the collection of microorganisms residing in intestines of vertebrates, was shown to have major effects on host physiology. The field has seen a renaissance due to advances in deep-sequencing. Recently, there is an explosion of studies on the physiological and therapeutic potential of the gut microbiota. These microbes are considered to reside in symbiosis with their hosts, and are termed ‘commensals’, originated from Latin — ‘at table together’. We provide the gut microbes nutrients and a living niche, and they in turn, provide us with essentially the same — nutrients derived from the food we eat, that we cannot digest, and essential functions for health and longevity. In the past few years it has been appreciated that gut microbes can even affect our brain, behavior, and neurological disorders, which we here review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Indeed, the meninges are an immunologically active compartment that communicates with the periphery via the (re)discovered meningeal lymphatic system. From its ties to both the periphery and the central nervous system, the meninges are becoming a prevalent organ to understand and modulate brain homeostasis. Here we will focus on current advances in our understanding of the meningeal compartment with an emphasis on the meningeal lymphatic network as a key regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Gut bacteria produce neuroactive compounds and can modulate neuronal function, plasticity and behavior. Furthermore, intestinal microorganisms impact the host’s metabolism and immune status which in turn affect neuronal pathways in the enteric and central nervous systems.

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Literally hundreds of statisticians have rightly called for an end to statistical significance testing (Amrhein et al., 2019; Wasserstein et al., 2019). But the practice of arbitrarily thresholding &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values is not only deeply embedded in statistical practice, it is also congenial to the human mind. It is thus not sufficient to tell our students, &quot;Don’t do this.&quot; We must vividly show them why the practice is wrong and its effects detrimental to scientific progress. I offer three teaching examples I have found to be useful in prompting students to think more deeply about the problem and to begin to interpret the results of statistical procedures as measures of how evidence should change our beliefs, and not as bright lines separating truth from falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The extraction of brain functioning features is a crucial step in the
definition of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In the last decade, functional
connectivity (FC) estimators have been increasingly explored based on their
ability to capture synchronization between multivariate brain signals. However,
the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms and the extent to which they can
improve performance in BCI-related tasks, is still poorly understood. To
address this gap in knowledge, we considered a group of 20 healthy subjects
during an EEG-based hand motor imagery (MI) task. We studied two
well-established FC estimators, i.e. spectral- and imaginary-coherence, and
investigated how they were modulated by the MI task. We characterized the
resulting FC networks by extracting the strength of connectivity of each EEG
sensor and compared the discriminant power with respect to standard power
spectrum features. At the group level, results showed that while
spectral-coherence based network features were increasing the controlateral
motor area, those based on imaginary-coherence were decreasing. We demonstrated
that this opposite, but complementary, behavior was respectively determined by
the increase in amplitude and phase synchronization between the brain signals.
At the individual level, we proved that including these network connectivity
features in the classification of MI mental states led to an overall
improvement in accuracy. Taken together, our results provide fresh insights
into the oscillatory mechanisms subserving brain network changes during MI and
offer new perspectives to improve BCI performance.

 &lt;p&gt;The objective of this work was to determine whether application of
subthreshold currents to the peripheral nerve increases the excitability of the
underlying nerve fibres, and how this increased excitability would alter neural
activity as it propagates through the subthreshold currents. Experiments were
performed on two Romney cross-breed sheep in vivo, by applying subthreshold
currents either at the stimulus site or between the stimulus and recording
sites. Neural recordings were obtained from nerve cuff implanted on the
peroneal or sciatic nerve branches, while stimulus was applied to either the
peroneal nerve or pins placed through the lower hindshank. Results showed that
subthreshold currents applied to the same site as stimulus increased excitation
of underlying nerve fibres (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). With stimulus and subthreshold
currents applied to different sites on the peroneal nerve, the primary CAP in
the sciatic displayed a temporal shift of -2.5 to -3 us which agreed with
statistically significant changes in the CAP waveform (p&amp;lt;0.02). These findings
contribute to the understanding of mechanisms in myelinated fibres of
subthreshold current neuromodulation therapies.

 &lt;p&gt;For more than a decade now, we can discover and study thousands of cerebral
connections with the application of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)
techniques and the accompanying algorithmic workflow. While numerous
connectomical results were published enlightening the relation between the
braingraph and certain biological, medical, and psychological properties, it is
still a great challenge to identify a small number of brain connections,
closely related to those conditions. In the present contribution, by applying
the 1200 Subjects Release of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we identify
just 102 connections out of the total number of 1950 connections in the
83-vertex graphs of 1065 subjects, which -- by a simple linear test --
precisely, without any error determine the sex of the subject. Very
surprisingly, we were able to identify two graph edges out of these 102, if,
whose weights, measured in fiber numbers, are all high, then the connectome
always belongs to a female subject, independently of the other edges.
Similarly, we have identified 3 edges from these 102, whose weights, if two of
them are high and one is low, imply that the graph belongs to a male subject --
again, independently of the other edges. We call the former 2 edges
superfeminine and the first two of the 3 edges supermasculine edges of the
human connectome. Even more interestingly, one of the edges, connecting the
right Pars Triangularis and the right Superior Parietal areas, is one of the 2
superfeminine edges, and it is also the third edge, accompanying the two
supermasculine connections, if its weight is low; therefore it is also a
&quot;switching&quot; connection.

 &lt;p&gt;To infer information flow in any network of agents, it is important first and
foremost to establish causal temporal relations between the nodes. Practical
and automated methods that can infer causality are difficult to find, and the
subject of ongoing research. While Shannon information only detects
correlation, there are several information-theoretic notions of &quot;directed
information&quot; that have successfully detected causality in some systems, in
particular in the neuroscience community. However, recent work has shown that
some directed information measures can sometimes inadequately estimate the
extent of causal relations, or even fail to identify existing cause-effect
relations between components of systems, especially if neurons contribute in a
cryptographic manner to influence the effector neuron. Here, we test how often
cryptographic logic emerges in an evolutionary process that generates
artificial neural circuits for two fundamental cognitive tasks: motion
detection and sound localization. We also test whether activity time-series
recorded from behaving digital brains can infer information flow using the
transfer entropy concept, when compared to a ground-truth model of causal
influence constructed from connectivity and circuit logic. Our results suggest
that transfer entropy will sometimes fail to infer causality when it exists,
and sometimes suggest a causal connection when there is none. However, the
extent of incorrect inference strongly depends on the cognitive task
considered. These results emphasize the importance of understanding the
fundamental logic processes that contribute to information flow in cognitive
processing, and quantifying their relevance in any given nervous system.

 &lt;p&gt;Biological neural networks produce information backgrounds of multi-scale spontaneous activity that become more complex in brain states displaying higher capacities for cognition, for instance, attentive awake versus asleep or anesthetized states. Here, we review brain state-dependent mechanisms spanning ion channel currents (microscale) to the dynamics of brain-wide, distributed, transient functional assemblies (macroscale). Not unlike how microscopic interactions between molecules underlie structures formed in macroscopic states of matter, using statistical physics, the dynamics of microscopic neural phenomena can be linked to macroscopic brain dynamics through mesoscopic scales. Beyond spontaneous dynamics, it is observed that stimuli evoke collapses of complexity, most remarkable over high dimensional, asynchronous, irregular background dynamics during consciousness. In contrast, complexity may not be further collapsed beyond synchrony and regularity characteristic of unconscious spontaneous activity. We propose that increased dimensionality of spontaneous dynamics during conscious states supports responsiveness, enhancing neural networks' emergent capacity to robustly encode information over multiple scales.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the study of memory engrams, synaptic memory allocation is a newly emerged theme that focuses on how specific synapses are engaged in the storage of a given memory. Cumulating evidence from imaging and molecular experiments indicates that the recruitment of synapses that participate in the encoding and expression of memory is neither random nor uniform. A hallmark observation is the emergence of groups of synapses that share similar response properties and/or similar input properties and are located within a stretch of a dendritic branch. This grouping of synapses has been termed “synapse clustering” and has been shown to emerge in many different memory-related paradigms, as well as in in vitro studies. The clustering of synapses may emerge from synapses receiving similar input, or via many processes which allow for cross-talk between nearby synapses within a dendritic branch, leading to cooperative plasticity. Clustered synapses can act in concert to maximally exploit the nonlinear integration potential of the dendritic branches in which they reside. Their main contribution is to facilitate the induction of dendritic spikes and dendritic plateau potentials, which provide advanced computational and memory-related capabilities to dendrites and single neurons. This review focuses on recent evidence which investigates the role of synapse clustering in dendritic integration, sensory perception, learning, and memory as well as brain dysfunction. We also discuss recent theoretical work which explores the computational advantages provided by synapse clustering, leading to novel and revised theories of memory. As an eminent phenomenon during memory allocation, synapse clustering both shapes memory engrams and is also shaped by the parallel plasticity mechanisms upon which it relies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The scientific landscape surrounding amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continues to shift as the number of genes associated with the disease risk and pathogenesis, and the cellular processes involved, continues to grow. Despite decades of intense research and over 50 potentially causative or disease-modifying genes identified, etiology remains unexplained and treatment options remain limited for the majority of ALS patients. Various factors have contributed to the slow progress in understanding and developing therapeutics for this disease. Here, we review the genetic basis of ALS, highlighting factors that have contributed to the elusiveness of genetic heritability. The most commonly mutated ALS-linked genes are reviewed with an emphasis on disease-causing mechanisms. The cellular processes involved in ALS pathogenesis are discussed, with evidence implicating their involvement in ALS summarized. Past and present therapeutic strategies and the benefits and limitations of the model systems available to ALS researchers are discussed with future directions for research that may lead to effective treatment strategies outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Attention plays a fundamental role in acquiring and understanding information. Therefore, it is useful to evaluate attention objectively in such fields as education and mental health. Aimed at extracting objective indicators of attention from physiological signals, this study examined the characteristics of electroencephalography (EEG), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and pupil diameter signals during a free recall task. The objective was to clarify the temporal characteristics of these signals in relation to attention. We used a free recall task as a cognitive task with an attentional load. The participants attempted to memorize and then recall 13 serially presented words. Our hypothesis was that the significant physiological responses should differ depending on the time scale of the attention evaluation. The physiological responses were compared on the basis of differences between success and failure to recall a word on a short time scale, in terms of the attentional state among five serial position groups on a middle time scale, and on the basis of differences between trials with many and few words recalled on a long time scale. We found that the response of each physiological signal depended on the attention in the different time-scale comparisons. (1) The P300 amplitudes of the EEG signals for the words that were recalled were significantly higher than those for the words that were not recalled. (2) Pupillary dilation differed significantly depending on the serial position group. (3) Functional connectivity in the right hemisphere revealed by NIRS was significantly stronger in trials with many words recalled than in those with few words recalled. Different temporal characteristics of physiological signals with respect to attention were suggested by multimodal measurement and multiple-time-scale analysis. Consideration of these characteristics should help in the development of applications requiring objective attention evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FoG) is a debilitating problem in patients with PD. The multifactorial pathogenesis of FoG remains poorly understood. We aimed to find which factors are most strongly associated with the occurrence of FoG.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Three hundred five PD patients were enrolled and subdivided according to the presence (FoG +, n = 128) or absence (FoG-, n = 177) of FoG. Several clinical, functional, and neuropsychological data were collected and compared between groups. The association between the probability of presence of FoG and possible explanatory variables was assessed by logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;FoG + patients were younger at the diagnosis (p = 0.04), and their mean daily dose of dopaminergic drugs (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) was higher in comparison with FoG- patients. FoG + patients get worse in Frontal Assessment Battery (p = 0.005), had higher scores in Apathy Evaluation Scale (p = 0.03), and were much more impaired on Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) (p = 0.018), Trail Making Test A (p = 0.0013), and Ray Auditory Verbal Learning Test (p = 0.012). Levodopa equivalent dose, age (direct), age at disease onset (inverse), and WCST were significant predictors of FoG (p = 0.01, p = 0.0025, p = 0.0016, and p = 0.029, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;FoG + patients show more deficits in executive functions and in motivation. The main explanatory variables of FoG occurrence are levodopa equivalent dose, age, age at disease onset, and WCST. These data suggest that a specific involvement of frontal cortical circuits in PD is responsible for certain cognitive–behavioral alterations related to the occurrence of FoG.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. More than 25 ALS-related genes have been identified, accounting for approximately 10% of sporadic ALS (SALS) and two-thirds of familial ALS (FALS) cases. Several recent studies showed that genetic factors might have a larger contribution to young-onset ALS than to ALS cases overall. However, the genetic profile of young-onset ALS patients is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated a cohort of 27 young-onset ALS patients (onset age &amp;lt; 45 years) through whole-exome sequencing (WES). Genetic analysis identified pathogenic variants of FUS (25.9%), SOD1 (22.2%), TARDBP (3.7%), and VCP (3.7%) in 27 young-onset ALS patients. Of 12 identified types of mutations, c.1528A &amp;gt; C in FUS and c.266G &amp;gt; A in VCP were novel. All of the cases in this study reflect a monogenic origin with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Notably, a novel de novo missense mutation, c.1528A &amp;gt; C (p.K510Q), in FUS was identified in a 29-year-old ALS patient. Expression of the K510Q mutant FUS resulted in cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS in cultured cells and induced neural toxicity in a fly model. This study provides further evidence of the genetic profile of young-onset ALS patients from China and expands the mutational spectrum of the FUS gene, with one new K510Q mutation identified.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Psychological research has demonstrated that humans can think unconsciously. Unconscious thought (UT) refers to cognitive or affective decision-related processes that occur beyond conscious awareness. UT processes are considered more effective in complex decision-making than conscious thought (CT). In addition, holistic representation plays a key role in UT and consists of a multimodal, value-related cognitive process. While the neural correlates of UT have recently been investigated, the holistic representation hypothesis of UT has not been confirmed. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to further evaluate this hypothesis by utilizing two UT tasks (person and consumer-product evaluations) in conjunction with an improved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experimental protocol. Participants evaluated four alternatives with 12 attributes each. In the UT condition, once the decision information had been presented, the participants completed a 1-back task for 120 s and evaluated each alternative, as well as an independent 1-back task in the absence of any decision information. We then performed regression analysis of the UT performance in both tasks. Our results revealed a positive correlation between performance in the UT task and the use of the anterior part of the precuneus/paracentral lobule in the person evaluation task and between performance and the posterior part of the precuneus, postcentral gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and superior parietal lobule in the consumer-product evaluation task. The involvement of the precuneus area in both tasks was indicative of a multimodal, value-related process and is consistent with the features of holistic representation, supporting a central role for holistic representation in UT. Furthermore, the involvement of different precuneus subregions in the two UT tasks may reflect the task dependency of the key representation critical for advantageous UT.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence showed that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargoes are important information mediators in the nervous system and have been proposed to play an important role in regulating regeneration. Moreover, many studies reported that olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) conditioned medium is capable of promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery. However, the role of EVs derived from OECs in axonal regeneration has not been clear. Thereby, the present study was designed to firstly isolate EVs from OECs culture supernatants, and then investigated their role in enhancing axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve injury. In vitro studies showed that OECs-EVs promoted axonal growth of dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which is dose-dependent and relies on their integrity. In vivo studies further demonstrated that nerve conduit containing OECs-EVs significantly enhanced axonal regeneration, myelination of regenerated axons and neurologically functional recovery in rats with sciatic nerve injury. In conclusion, our results, for the first time, demonstrated that OECs-EVs are capable of promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injuries in rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microvascular complications are often associated with slow and progressive damage of various organs. Pericytes are multi-functional mural cells of the microcirculation that control blood flow, vascular permeability and homeostasis. Whereas accumulating evidence suggests that these cells are also implicated in a variety of diseases, pericytes represent promising targets that can be manipulated for therapeutic gain. Here, we review the role of pericytes in angiogenesis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, neuroinflammation, tissue fibrosis, axon regeneration failure, and neurodegeneration. In addition, we outline strategies altering pericyte behavior to point out problems and promises for axon regeneration and central nervous system (CNS) repair following injury or disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human gastrointestinal (GI)-tract microbiome-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS): (i) has been recently shown to target, accumulate within, and eventually encapsulate neuronal nuclei of the human central nervous system (CNS) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain; and (ii) this action appears to impede and restrict the outward flow of genetic information from neuronal nuclei. It has previously been shown that in LPS-encased neuronal nuclei in AD brain there is a specific disruption in the output and expression of two AD-relevant, neuron-specific markers encoding the cytoskeletal neurofilament light (NF-L) chain protein and the synaptic phosphoprotein synapsin-1 (SYN1) involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. The biophysical mechanisms involved in the facilitation of the targeting of LPS to neuronal cells and nuclei and eventual nuclear envelopment and functional disruption are not entirely clear. In this “Perspectives article” we discuss current advances, and consider future directions in this research area, and provide novel evidence in human neuronal-glial (HNG) cells in primary culture that the co-incubation of LPS with amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) peptide facilitates the association of LPS with neuronal cells. These findings: (i) support a novel pathogenic role for Aβ42 peptides in neurons via the formation of pores across the nuclear membrane and/or a significant biophysical disruption of the neuronal nuclear envelope; and (ii) advance the concept that the Aβ42 peptide-facilitated entry of LPS into brain neurons, accession of neuronal nuclei, and down-regulation of neuron-specific components such as NF-L and SYN1 may contribute significantly to neuropathological deficits as are characteristically observed in AD-affected brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment alleviates cerebral ischemic injury through α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR). We attempted to investigate whether the phenotypic conversion of microglia was involved in the therapeutic effect of EA pretreatment in cerebral ischemia through α7nAChR. Adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) after EA or α7nAChR agonist N-(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl-furo[2,3-c]pyridine-5-carboxamide hydrochloride (PHA-543,613 hydrochloride) and antagonist α-bungarotoxin (α-BGT) pretreatment. Primary microglia were subjected to drug pretreatment and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The expressions of the classical activated phenotype (M1) microglia markers induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86); the alternative activated phenotype (M2) microglia markers arginase-1 (Arg-1), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and cluster of differentiation 206 (CD206); and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the ischemic penumbra or in the supernatant of primary microglia were analyzed. The infarction volume and neurological scores were assessed 72 h after reperfusion. The cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release of neurons co-cultured with microglia were analyzed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and LDH release assays. EA pretreatment decreased the expressions of M1 markers (iNOS, IL-1β, and CD86) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), whereas it increased the expressions of M2 markers (Arg-1, TGF-β1, and CD206) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) by activating α7nAChR. EA pretreatment also significantly reduced the infarction volume and improved the neurological deficit. The activation of α7nAChR in microglia relieved the inflammatory response of primary microglia subjected to OGD and attenuated the injury of neurons co-cultured with microglia. In conclusion, EA pretreatment alleviates cerebral ischemic injury through α7nAChR-mediated phenotypic conversion of microglia, which may be a new mechanism for the EA pretreatment-induced neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Cochlear fibrocytes are a homeostatic supporting cell type embedded in the vascularized extracellular matrix of the spiral ligament, within the lateral wall. Here, they participate in the connective tissue syncytium that enables potassium recirculation into the scala media to take place and ensures development of the endolymphatic potential that helps drive current into hair cells during acoustic stimulation. They have also been implicated in inflammatory responses in the cochlea. Some fibrocytes interact closely with the capillaries of the vasculature in a way which suggests potential involvement, together with the stria vascularis, also in the blood-labyrinth barrier. Several lines of evidence suggests that pathology of the fibrocytes, along with other degenerative changes in this region, contribute to metabolic hearing loss (MHL) during aging that is becoming recognized as distinct from, and potentially a precursor for, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). This pathology may underlie a significant proportion of cases of presbycusis. Some evidence points also to an association between fibrocyte degeneration and Ménière’s disease (MD). Fibrocytes are mesenchymal; this characteristic, and their location, make them amenable to potential cell therapy in the form of cell replacement or genetic modification to arrest the process of degeneration that leads to MHL. This review explores the properties and roles of this neglected cell type and suggests potential therapeutic approaches, such as cell transplantation or genetic engineering of fibrocytes, which could be used to prevent this form of presbycusis or provide a therapeutic avenue for MD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurocognitive disorders, among which Alzheimer’s disease (AD), have become one of the major causes of death in developed countries. No effective disease-modifying therapy is available, possibly because current treatments are administered too late to still be able to intervene in the disease progress. AD is characterized by a gradual onset with subclinical neurobiological and behavioral changes that precede diagnosis with years to even decades. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier potential treatments can be tested and started. Mouse models are valuable to study the possible causes underlying early phases of neuropathology and their reflection in behavior and other biomarkers, to help improve preclinical detection and diagnosis of AD. Here, we assessed cognitive functioning and social behavior in transgenic mice expressing tau pathology only (Tau-P301L) or a combination of amyloid and tau pathology [amyloid precursor protein (APP)-V717I × Tau-P301L]. The mice were subjected to a variety of behavioral tasks at an age of 3–6 months, i.e., at an early phase of their AD-like pathology. We hypothesized that compared to age-matched wild-type controls, transgenic mice would show specific impairments in both cognitive and non-cognitive tasks. In line with our expectations, transgenic mice showed decreased cognitive flexibility in the Morris water maze, decreased exploratory behavior, decreased performance in a nesting task, and increased anxiety-like behavior. In accordance with the amyloid-cascade hypothesis, some of the behavioral measures showed more severe deficits in APP-V717I × Tau-P301L compared to Tau-P301L mice, indicating an exacerbation of disease processes due to the co-occurrence of amyloid and tau pathology. Our study supports the use of behavioral markers as early indicators of ongoing AD pathology during the preclinical phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex etiology. Several factors are known to contribute to the disease onset and its progression. However, the complete underlying mechanisms are still escaping our understanding. To evaluate possible correlations between metabolites and metallomic data, in this research, we combined a control study measured using two different platforms. For the different data sources, we applied a Block Sparse Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (Block-sPLS-DA) model that allows for proving their relation, which in turn uncovers alternative influencing factors that remain hidden otherwise. We found two groups of variables that trace a strong relationship between metallomic and metabolomic parameters for disease development. The results confirmed that the redox active metals iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) together with fatty acids are the major influencing factors for the PD. Additionally, the metabolic waste product p-cresol sulfate and the trace element nickel (Ni) showed up as potentially important factors in PD. In summary, the data integration of different types of measurements emphasized the results of both stand-alone measurements providing a new comprehensive set of information and interactions, on PD disease, between different variables sources.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The number of older people worldwide living with cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases is growing at an unprecedented rate. Despite accumulating evidence that engaging in physical activity is a promising primary behavioral strategy to delay or avert the deleterious effects of aging on brain health, a large degree of variation exists in study findings. Thus, before physical activity and exercise can be prescribed as “medicine” for promoting brain health, it is imperative to understand how different biological factors can attenuate or amplify the effects of physical activity on cognition at the individual level. In this review article, we briefly discuss the current state of the literature, examining the relationship between physical activity and brain health in older adults and we present the argument that biological sex is a potent moderator of this relationship. Additionally, we highlight some of the potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying this sex difference for this relatively new and rapidly expanding line of research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) has multiple roles in the normal nervous system, including the development of synaptic connections and synaptic plasticity. Research over the past several years has indicated a role for the UPP in aging without any overt pathology in the brain. In addition, malfunction of the UPP is implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia associated with it. In this mini review article, we assess the literature on the role of protein degradation by the UPP in aging and in AD with special emphasis on dysregulation of the UPP and its contribution to cognitive decline and impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Preprints in biology are becoming more popular, but only a small fraction of the articles published in peer-reviewed journals have previously been released as preprints. To examine whether releasing a preprint on bioRxiv was associated with the attention and citations received by the corresponding peer-reviewed article, we assembled a dataset of 74,239 articles, 5,405 of which had a preprint, published in 39 journals. Using log-linear regression and random-effects meta-analysis, we found that articles with a preprint had, on average, a 49% higher Altmetric Attention Score and 36% more citations than articles without a preprint. These associations were independent of several other article- and author-level variables (such as scientific subfield and number of authors), and were unrelated to journal-level variables such as access model and Impact Factor. This observational study can help researchers and publishers make informed decisions about how to incorporate preprints into their work.</content>

 Bacterial cells are encased in a peptidoglycan (PG) exoskeleton that protects them from osmotic lysis and specifies their distinct shapes. Cell wall hydrolases are required to enlarge this covalently closed macromolecule during growth, but how these autolytic enzymes are regulated remains poorly understood. &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; encodes two functionally redundant D,L-endopeptidases (CwlO and LytE) that cleave peptide crosslinks to allow expansion of the PG meshwork during growth. Here, we provide evidence that the essential and broadly conserved WalR-WalK two component regulatory system continuously monitors changes in the activity of these hydrolases by sensing the cleavage products generated by these enzymes and modulating their levels and activity in response. The WalR-WalK pathway is conserved among many Gram-positive pathogens where it controls transcription of distinct sets of PG hydrolases. Cell wall remodeling in these bacteria may be subject to homeostatic control mechanisms similar to the one reported here.</content>

 The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is an evolutionarily conserved hub of nutrient sensing and metabolic signaling. In plants, a functional connection of TOR activation with glucose availability was demonstrated, while it is yet unclear whether branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are a primary input of TOR signaling as they are in yeast and mammalian cells. Here, we report on the characterization of an Arabidopsis mutant over-accumulating BCAAs. Through chemical interventions targeting TOR and by examining mutants of BCAA biosynthesis and TOR signaling, we found that BCAA over-accumulation leads to up-regulation of TOR activity, which causes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and actin-associated endomembranes. Finally, we show that activation of TOR is concomitant with alteration of cell expansion, proliferation and specialized metabolism, leading to pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. These results demonstrate that BCAAs contribute to plant TOR activation and reveal previously uncharted downstream subcellular processes of TOR signaling.</content>

 Microtubules segregate chromosomes by attaching to macromolecular kinetochores. Only microtubule-end attached kinetochores can be pulled apart; how these end-on attachments are selectively recognised and stabilised is not known. Using the kinetochore and microtubule-associated protein, Astrin, as a molecular probe, we show that end-on attachments are rapidly stabilised by spatially-restricted delivery of PP1 near the C-terminus of Ndc80, a core kinetochore-microtubule linker. PP1 is delivered by the evolutionarily conserved tail of Astrin and this promotes Astrin's own enrichment creating a highly-responsive positive feedback, independent of biorientation. Abrogating Astrin:PP1-delivery disrupts attachment stability, which is not rescued by inhibiting Aurora-B, an attachment destabiliser, but is reversed by artificially tethering PP1 near the C-terminus of Ndc80. Constitutive Astrin:PP1-delivery disrupts chromosome congression and segregation, revealing a dynamic mechanism for stabilising attachments. Thus, Astrin-PP1 mediates a dynamic 'lock' that selectively and rapidly stabilises end-on attachments, independent of biorientation, and ensures proper chromosome segregation.</content>

 Heterogeneity of lymphatic vessels during embryogenesis is critical for organ-specific lymphatic function. Little is known about lymphatics in the developing kidney, despite their established roles in pathology of the mature organ. We performed three-dimensional imaging to characterize lymphatic vessel formation in the mammalian embryonic kidney at single-cell resolution. In mouse, we visually and quantitatively assessed the development of kidney lymphatic vessels, remodeling from a ring-like anastomosis under the nascent renal pelvis, a site of VEGF-C expression, to form a patent vascular plexus. We identified a heterogenous population of lymphatic endothelial cell clusters in mouse and human embryonic kidneys. Exogenous VEGF-C expanded the lymphatic population in explanted mouse embryonic kidneys. Finally, we characterized complex kidney lymphatic abnormalities in a genetic mouse model of polycystic kidney disease. Our study provides novel insights into the development of kidney lymphatic vasculature; a system which likely has fundamental roles in renal development, physiology and disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 cGAS is an intracellular innate immune sensor that detects double-stranded DNA. The presence of billions of base pairs of genomic DNA in all nucleated cells raises the question of how cGAS is not constitutively activated. A widely accepted explanation for this is the sequestration of cGAS in the cytosol, which is thought to prevent cGAS from accessing nuclear DNA. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous cGAS is predominantly a nuclear protein, regardless of cell cycle phase or cGAS activation status. We show that nuclear cGAS is tethered tightly by a salt-resistant interaction. This tight tethering is independent of the domains required for cGAS activation, and it requires intact nuclear chromatin. We identify the evolutionarily conserved tethering surface on cGAS and we show that mutation of single amino acids within this surface renders cGAS massively and constitutively active against self-DNA. Thus, tight nuclear tethering maintains the resting state of cGAS and prevents autoreactivity.</content>

 Motivated by the wealth of experimental data recently available, we present a cellular-automaton-based modeling framework focussing on high-level cell functions and their concerted effect on cellular migration patterns. Specifically, we formulate a coarse-grained description of cell polarity through self-regulated actin organization and its response to mechanical cues. Furthermore, we address the impact of cell adhesion on collective migration in cell cohorts. The model faithfully reproduces typical cell shapes and movements down to the level of single cells, yet allows for the efficient simulation of confluent tissues. In confined circular geometries, we find that specific properties of individual cells (polarizability; contractility) influence the emerging collective motion of small cell cohorts. Finally, we study the properties of expanding cellular monolayers (front morphology; stress and velocity distributions) at the level of extended tissues.</content>

 Introduction: The thickness of the cerebral cortical sheet and its surface area are highly heritable traits thought to have largely distinct polygenic architectures. Despite large-scale efforts, the majority of their genetic determinants remains unknown. Our ability to identify causal genetic variants can be improved by employing better delineated, less noisy brain measures that better map onto the biology we seek to understand. Such measures may have fewer variants but with larger effects, i.e. lower polygenicity and higher discoverability. Methods: Using Gaussian mixture modeling, we estimated the number of causal variants shared between mean cortical thickness and total surface area. We further determined the polygenicity and discoverability of regional cortical measures from five often-employed parcellation schemes. We made use of UK Biobank data from 31,312 healthy White European individuals (mean age 55.5, standard deviation (SD) 7.4, 52.1% female). Results: Contrary to previous reports, we found large genetic overlap between total surface area and mean thickness, sharing 4427 out of 7150 causal variants. Regional surface area was more discoverable (p=4.1x10-6) and less polygenic (p=.007) than regional thickness measures. We further found that genetically-informed and less granular parcellation schemes had highest discoverability, with no differences in polygenicity. Conclusions: These findings may serve as a roadmap for improved future GWAS studies; Knowledge of which measures or parcellations are most discoverable, as well as the genetic overlap between these measures, may be used to boost identification of genetic predictors and thereby gain a better understanding of brain morphology.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized extracellular matrix structures that ensheathe parvalbumin-containing fast-spiking interneurons (PV FSIs) and play a key role in neuroplasticity. We previously showed that PNNs within the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL PFC) are required for the maintenance of cocaine-associated memories following cocaine memory reactivation. However, how cocaine memory reactivation affects PNNs, PV, and corresponding changes in PV FSI function are unknown. In this study, we characterized the electrophysiological properties of PV FSIs and corresponding changes in PNN and PV intensity within the PL PFC prior to and after cocaine memory reactivation. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to acquire cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP) and, following cocaine-CPP memory reactivation (30 m, 2 h, and 24 h post-reactivation), we measured PNN intensity (determined by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin [WFA] staining) as well as PV intensity using immunohistochemistry. The intensity of PV staining was reduced at all time points following memory reactivation with no changes in WFA intensity. Using whole-cell electrophysiology we found a reduction in the number of action potentials at 30 m and 2 h that returned to control levels by 24 h. The attenuation in firing was accompanied by a presumed compensatory increase in excitatory synaptic transmission, which was corroborated by an increase in VGluT1 puncta apposing PV/PNN neurons. Collectively, our results indicate that cocaine memory reactivation decreases PV intensity, which may play a role in decreasing excitation of PV FSIs. Thus, the inhibitory tone onto pyramidal neurons may be decreased following memory reactivation, resulting in an increase in PFC output to promote cocaine-seeking behaviors.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Deposits of A{beta} peptides (plaques) and tau protein (neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)) are ubiquitous features of brain tissue in Alzheimer's disease. Their contribution to disease etiology remains controversial. The molecular-to-nano-scale organization of fibrillar species in these protein aggregates remains uncertain, but may contain clues as to the contributions of these structures to disease. Whether or not all plaques are the same structure, and all tangles are the same, has implications for current hypotheses about polymorphic templated misfolding of their constituent proteins, A{beta} and tau. Here we use x-ray microdiffraction in the small-angle regime (SAXS) to probe the molecular organization of these deposits. Using unstained histological sections of human brain tissue, we demonstrate that SAXS can characterize A{beta} fibrils and tau filaments in situ. A{beta} fibrils have a cross-sectional radius of gyration (Rxc) of ~45 [A], and larger (Rxc &amp;gt;150 [A]) aggregates appear to represent A{beta} fibrils that have coalesced side-to-side with one another to create fibrillar bundles or macrofibrillar aggregates. Tau fibrils exhibit an Rxc of ~55 [A] with little sign of coalescence into larger structure. The in situ mapping of these structures revealed subtle variation in A{beta} structure across different brain areas and different cases.</content>

		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/868133v1?rss=1"/>

 Objectives: Aberrant cortical development, inferred from cortical folding measures, is linked to the risk of schizophrenia. Cortical folds develop in a time-locked fashion during fetal growth. We leveraged this temporal specificity of sulcation to investigate the approximate timing of the prenatal insult linked to schizophrenia as well as the cognitive impairment seen in this illness. Methods: Anatomical T1 MRI scans from a publicly available dataset of 68 patients with schizophrenia and 72 controls were used to evaluate the sulcal depth. 5 major primary sulci that are invariable, representing lobar development (calcarine sulcus, superior temporal sulcus, superior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus and inferior frontal sulcus) with formation representing distinct developmental periods were chosen. Sulcal depth was measured using BrainVISA software. Results: A repeated measure Analysis of Variance with 5 sulci and 2 hemispheres as within-subject factors and gender, age and intracranial volume as covariates revealed a significant effect of diagnosis (F[1,134]=14.8, p=0.0002). Control subjects had had deeper superior temporal (left t=3.2, p=0.002; right t=2.8, p=0.006), right inferior frontal (t=2.7, p=0.007) and left calcarine (t=2.2, p=0.03) sulci. A deeper superior frontal sulcus predicted better overall cognitive scores (F[1,54]=8.7, p=0.005) among patients. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the gestational cortical disruption underlying schizophrenia is likely to predate, if not, coincide with the appearance of calcarine sulcus (early 2nd trimester) and affects frontal, temporal and occipital lobes. Nevertheless, the burden of cognitive deficits may relate specifically to aberrant superior frontal development occurring in late 2nd trimester.</content>

 Networks in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that are important for executive function are also engaged in adaptive responding to negative events. These networks are particularly vulnerable to age-related structural atrophy and an associated loss of executive function, yet existing evidence suggests preserved emotion processing ability in aging. Using longitudinally acquired data from a battery of cognitive tasks, we defined a metric for the rate of decline of executive function. With this metric, we investigated relationships between changes in executive function and emotion reappraisal ability and brain structure, in older adults using functional and structural MRI. During task-based fMRI, participants were asked to cognitively reappraise negatively valenced images. We hypothesised one of two associations with decreasing executive function over time: 1) a decreased ability to reappraise reflected in decreased PFC and increased amygdala activation, or 2) a neural compensation mechanism characterised by increased PFC activation but no differential amygdala activation. Structurally, for a decreased reappraisal ability, we predicted a decrease in grey matter in PFC and/or a decrease of white matter integrity in amygdala-PFC pathways. Neither of the two hypotheses relating to brain function were completely supported, with the findings indicating a steeper decline in executive function associated with both increased PFC and increased left amygdala activity when reappraising negative stimuli. In addition, white matter integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, a primary white matter tract connecting the amygdala and ventromedial areas of PFC, was lower in those individuals who demonstrated a greater decrease in executive function. These findings highlight that when cognitive ability diminishes, active top-down emotional control is compromised.</content>

 Diffusion MRI is used extensively to investigate changes in white matter microstructure during aging. However, diffusion metrics within white-matter tissue can be affected by partial volume effects due to cerebrospinal fluid, and white matter hyperintensities, especially in aging brain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of free water elimination and WMHs burden on the cingulum diffusion metrics during aging. Using a group of 45 older individuals divided in two groups presenting a high or low WMH burden, we examined the effect of the free water elimination on conventional DTI measures of white matter within the cingulum tract. Moreover, free water elimination effect on the association between cingulum diffusion metrics and cognitive evolution over 12 years is studied. The cingulum bundle was reconstructed with a tractography pipeline that includes a manually curated WMH mask applied in the native space of subjects to limit their negative effect on fiber tracking algorithms. We showed that free water correction not only improved the sensitivity of conventional DTI metrics to age-related tissue changes, but also allow the detection of associations between tissue specific diffusion metrics and changes in verbal fluency in older individuals. Moreover, free water value itself, measured along the cingulum was associated to verbal fluency performance. Therefore, these observations suggest the importance of using the free water compartment to scrutinize aging brain with DTI metrics and that free water itself could be a relevant metric for age-related white matter modifications.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In the context of flexible and adaptive animal behavior, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is found to be one of the crucial regions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) influencing the downstream processes of decision-making and learning in the sub-cortical regions. Although OFC has been implicated to be important in a variety of related behavioral processes, the exact mechanisms are unclear, through which the OFC encodes or processes information related to decision-making and learning. Here, we propose a systems-level view of the OFC, positioning it at the nexus of sub-cortical systems and other prefrontal regions. Particularly we focus on one of the most recent implications of neuroscientific evidences regarding the OFC - possible functional dissociation between two of its sub-regions : lateral and medial. We present a system-level computational model of decision-making and learning involving the two sub-regions taking into account their individual roles as commonly implicated in neuroscientific studies. We emphasize on the role of the interactions between the sub-regions within the OFC as well as the role of other sub-cortical structures which form a network with them. We leverage well-known computational architecture of thalamo-cortical basal ganglia loops, accounting for recent experimental findings on monkeys with lateral and medial OFC lesions, performing a 3-arm bandit task. First we replicate the seemingly dissociate effects of lesions to lateral and medial OFC during decision-making as a function of value-difference of the presented options. Further we demonstrate and argue that such an effect is not necessarily due to the dissociate roles of both the subregions, but rather a result of complex temporal dynamics between the interacting networks in which they are involved.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The neurobiological study of reward was launched by the discovery of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Subsequent investigation of this phenomenon provided the initial link between reward-seeking behavior and dopaminergic neurotransmission. We re-evaluated this relationship by psychophysical, pharmacological, optogenetic, and computational means. In rats working for direct, optical activation of midbrain dopamine neurons, we varied the strength and opportunity cost of the stimulation and measured time allocation, the proportion of trial time devoted to reward pursuit. We found that the dependence of time allocation on the strength and cost of stimulation was similar formally to that observed when electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle served as the reward. When the stimulation is strong and cheap, the rats devote almost all their time to reward pursuit; time allocation falls off as stimulation strength is decreased and/or its opportunity cost is increased. A 3D plot of time allocation versus stimulation strength and cost produces a surface resembling the corner of a plateau (the &quot;reward mountain&quot;). We show that dopamine-transporter blockade shifts the mountain along both the strength and cost axes in rats working for optical activation of midbrain dopamine neurons. In contrast, the same drug shifted the mountain uniquely along the opportunity-cost axis when rats worked for electrical MFB stimulation in a prior study. Dopamine neurons are an obligatory stage in the dominant model of ICSS, which positions them at a key nexus in the final common path for reward seeking. This model fails to provide a cogent account for the differential effect of dopamine transporter blockade on the reward mountain. Instead, we propose that midbrain dopamine neurons and neurons with non-dopaminergic, MFB axons constitute parallel limbs of brain-reward circuitry that ultimately converge on the final-common path for the evaluation and pursuit of rewards.</content>

		<content type="html">
 When the two eyes are presented with incompatible images, the visual system fails to create a single, fused, coherent percept. Instead, it creates an ongoing alternation between each eye's image; a phenomenon dubbed binocular rivalry (BR). Such alternations in awareness are separated by brief, intermediate states during which a spatially mixed (incoherent) pattern of both images is perceived. A recent study proposed that the precedence of mixed percepts positively correlates with the degree of adaptation to conflict between the eyes. However, it neglected the role of visual transients, which covaried with the degree of conflict in the stimulus design. We here study whether the presence of visual transients drive  adaptation to interocular conflict and explain incidence rates of spatially incoherent BR. Across three experiments we created several adaptation conditions in which we systematically varied the frequency of transients and the degree of conflict between the eyes . Transients consisted of grating orientation reversals, blanks, and plaids. The results showed that the pattern of variations in the fractions mixed percepts across conditions was best explained by variations in the frequency of visual transients, rather than the degree of conflict between the eyes. We propose that the prolonged presentation of transients to both eyes evokes a chain of events consisting of (1) the exogenous allocation of attention to both images, (2) the increase in perceptual dominance of both rivalling images, (3) the speed up of adaptation of interocular suppression, and eventually (4) the facilitation of mixed perception during BR after adaptation.</content>

 Numerous studies in the area of BCI are focused on the search for a better experimental paradigm -- a set of mental actions that a user can evoke consistently and a machine can discriminate reliably. Examples of such mental activities are motor imagery, mental computations, etc. We propose a technique that instead allows the user to try different mental actions in the search for the ones that will work best. The system is based on a modification of the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm and enables interactive communication between the user and the learning system through a visualization of user's mental state space. During the interaction with the system the user converges on the paradigm that is most efficient and intuitive for that particular user. Results of the two experiments, one allowing muscular activity, another permitting mental activity only, demonstrate soundness of the proposed method and offer preliminary validation of the performance improvement over the traditional closed-loop feedback approach. The proposed method allows a user to visually explore their mental state space in real time, opening new opportunities for scientific inquiry. The application of this method to the area of brain-computer interfaces enables more efficient search for the mental states that will allow a user to reliably control a BCI system.</content>

 Understanding how genes and experiences work in concert to generate phenotypic variability will provide a better understanding of individuality. Here, we considered this in the context of the main olfactory epithelium, a chemosensory structure with over a thousand distinct cell-types, in mice. We identified a subpopulation of at least three types of olfactory sensory neurons, defined by receptor expression, whose abundances were sexually dimorphic. This subpopulation of olfactory sensory neurons was over-represented in sex-separated female mice and responded robustly to the male-specific semiochemicals 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothaizole and (methylthio)methanethiol. Sex-combined housing led to a robust attenuation of the female over-representation. Testing of Bax null mice revealed a Bax-dependence in generating the sexual dimorphism in sex-separated mice. Altogether, our results suggest a profound role of experience in influencing homeostatic neural lifespan mechanisms to generate a robust sexually dimorphic phenotype in the main olfactory epithelium.</content>

 Delta-frequency network activity is commonly associated with sleep or behavioral disengagement accompanied by a dearth of cortical spiking, but delta in awake behaving animals is not well understood. We show that hippocampal (HC) synchronization in the delta frequency band (1-4 Hz) is related to animals' locomotor behavior using a detailed analysis of simultaneous head- and body-tracking data. In contrast to running-speed modulation of the theta rhythm (6-10 Hz, a critical mechanism in navigation models), we observed that strong delta synchronization occurred when animals were stationary or moving slowly and while theta and fast gamma (55-120 Hz) were weak. We next combined time-frequency decomposition of the local field potential with hierarchical clustering algorithms to categorize momentary estimations of the power spectral density (PSD) into putative modes of HC activity. Delta and theta power measures from these modes were notably orthogonal, and theta and delta coherences between HC recording sites were monotonically related to theta-delta ratios across modes. Next, we focused on bouts of precisely-defined running and stationary behavior. Extraction of delta and theta power density estimates for each instance of these bout types confirmed the orthogonality between frequency bands seen across modes. We found that delta-band and theta-band coherence within HC, and in a small sample, between HC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), mirrored delta and theta components of the PSD. Delta-band synchronization often developed rapidly when animals paused briefly between runs, as well as appearing throughout longer stationary bouts. Taken together, our findings suggest that delta-dominated network modes (and corresponding mPFC-HC couplings) represent functionally-distinct circuit dynamics that are temporally and behaviorally interspersed amongst theta-dominated modes during navigation. As such these modes of mPFC-HC circuit dynamics could play a fundamental role in coordinating encoding and retrieval mechanisms or decision-making processes at a timescale that segments event sequences within behavioral episodes.</content>

 Functional brain connectivity is altered in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Mapping pre-symptomatic functional disruptions in ASD could identify infants based on neural risk, providing a crucial opportunity to mediate outcomes before behavioral symptoms emerge. Here we quantify functional connectivity using scalable EEG measures of oscillatory phase coherence (6-12Hz). Infants at high and low familial risk for ASD (N=65) underwent an EEG recording at 3 months of age and were assessed for ASD symptoms at 18 months using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Toddler Module. Multivariate pattern analysis was used to examine early functional patterns that are associated with later ASD symptoms. Support vector regression (SVR) algorithms accurately predicted observed ASD symptoms at 18 months from EEG data at 3 months (r=0.76, p=0.02). Specifically, lower frontal connectivity and higher right temporo-parietal connectivity predicted higher ASD symptoms. The SVR model did not predict non-verbal cognitive abilities at 18 months (r=0.15, p=0.36), suggesting specificity of these brain alterations to ASD. These data suggest that frontal and temporo-parietal dysconnectivity play important roles in the early pathophysiology of ASD. Early functional differences in ASD can be captured using EEG during infancy and may inform much-needed advancements in the early detection of ASD.</content>

 The brain is an endocrine organ, sensitive to the rhythmic changes in sex hormone production that occurs in most mammalian species. In rodents and nonhuman primates, estrogen and progesterone's impact on the brain is evident across a range of spatiotemporal scales. Yet, the influence of sex hormones on the functional architecture of the human brain is largely unknown. In this dense-sampling, deep phenotyping study, we examine the extent to which endogenous fluctuations in sex hormones alter intrinsic brain networks at rest in a woman who underwent brain imaging and venipuncture for 30 consecutive days. Standardized regression analyses illustrate estrogen and progesterone's widespread influence on cortical dynamics. Time-lagged analyses examined the temporal directionality of these relationships and reveal estrogen's ability to drive connectivity across major functional brain networks, including the Default Mode and Dorsal Attention Networks, whose hubs are densely populated with estrogen receptors. These results reveal the rhythmic nature in which brain networks reorganize across the human menstrual cycle. Neuroimaging studies that densely sample the individual connectome have begun to transform our understanding of the brain's functional organization. As these results indicate, taking endocrine factors into account is critical for fully understanding the intrinsic dynamics of the human brain.</content>

 A central goal in neuroscience is to understand how dynamic networks of neural activity produce effective representations of the world. Advances in the theory of graph measures raise the possibility of elucidating network topologies central to the construction of these representations. We leverage a result from the description of lollipop graphs to identify an iconic network topology in functional magnetic resonance imaging data and characterize changes to those networks during task performance and in populations diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. During task performance, we find that task-relevant subnetworks change topology, becoming more integrated by increasing connectivity throughout cortex. Analysis of resting-state connectivity in clinical populations shows a similar pattern of subnetwork topology changes; resting-scans becoming less default-like with more integrated sensory paths. The study of brain network topologies and their relationship to cognitive models of information processing raises new opportunities for understanding brain function and its disorders.</content>

 Psychedelic agonists of serotonin receptors induce neural plasticity and synaptogenesis, but their potential to enhance learning remains uncharted. Here we show that a single dose of d-LSD, a potent serotonergic agonist, increased novel object preference in young and adult rats several days after treatment. d-LSD alone did not increase preference in old animals, but could rescue it to young levels when followed by a 6-day exposure to enriched environment (EE). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics in human brain organoids treated with d-LSD showed upregulation of proteins from the presynaptic active zone. A computational model of synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex suggests that d-LSD enhances novelty preference by combining local synaptic changes in mnemonic and executive regions, with alterations of long-range synapses. Better pattern separation within EE explained its synergy with d-LSD in rescuing novelty preference in old animals. These results advance the use of d-LSD in cognitive enhancement.</content>

 Humans are remarkably skilled at listening to one speaker out of an acoustic mixture of multiple speech sources, even in the absence of binaural cues. Previous research on the neural representations underlying this ability suggests that the auditory cortex primarily represents only the unsegregated acoustic mixture in its early responses, and then selectively processes features of the attended speech at longer latencies (from ~85 ms). The mechanism by which the attended source signal is segregated from the mixture, however, and to what degree an ignored source may also be segregated and separately processed, is not understood. We show here, in human magnetoencephalographic responses to a two-talker mixture, an early neural representation of acoustic onsets in the ignored speech source, over and above onsets of the mixture and the attended source. This suggests that the auditory cortex initially reconstructs acoustic onsets belonging to any speech source, critically, even when those onsets are acoustically masked by another source. Overt onsets in the unseparated acoustic mixture were processed with a lower latency (~70 ms) than masked onsets in either source (~90 ms), suggesting a neural processing cost to the recovery of the masked onsets. Because acoustic onsets precede sustained source-specific information in the acoustic spectrogram, these representations of onsets are cues available for subsequent processing, including full stream segregation. Furthermore, these findings suggest that even bottom-up saliency of objects in the auditory background may rely on active cortical processing, explaining several behavioral effects of background speech.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Demyelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases. Cycles of demyelination, followed by remyelination, appear in the majority of MS patients, and are associated with the onset and quiescence of diseaserelated symptoms, respectively. Previous studies have shown in human patients and animal models that vast demyelination is accompanied by wide-scale changes to brain activity, but details of this process are poorly understood. We use electrophysiological recordings and nonlinear imaging of fluorescence from genetically-encoded calcium indicators to monitor the activity of hippocampal neurons during demyelination and remyelination processes over a period of 100 days. We find in vitro that synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons is diminished, and in vivo both CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) neuronal firing rates are substantially reduced during demyelination and partially recover after a short remyelination period. This new approach allows monitoring how synaptic transmission changes, induced by cuprizone diet, are affecting neuronal activity, and can potentially be used to study the effects of therapeutic interventions in protecting the functionality of CNS neurons.</content>

 Structural connections between cortical areas form an intricate network with a high degree of specificity. Many aspects of this complex network organization in the adult mammalian cortex are captured by an architectonic type principle, which relates structural connections to the architectonic differentiation of brain regions. In particular, the laminar patterns of projection origins are a prominent feature of structural connections that varies in a graded manner with the relative architectonic differentiation of connected areas in the adult brain. Here we show that the architectonic type principle is already apparent for the laminar origins of cortico-cortical projections in the immature cortex of the macaque monkey. We find that prenatal and neonatal laminar patterns correlate with cortical architectonic differentiation, and that the relation of laminar patterns to architectonic differences between connected areas is not substantially altered by the complete loss of visual input. Moreover, we find that the amount of change in laminar patterns that projections undergo during development varies in proportion to the relative architectonic differentiation of the connected areas. Hence, it appears that initial biases in laminar projection patterns become progressively strengthened by later developmental processes. These findings suggest that early neurogenetic processes during the formation of the brain are sufficient to establish the characteristic laminar projection patterns. This conclusion is in line with previously suggested mechanistic explanations underlying the emergence of the architectonic type principle and provides further constraints for exploring the fundamental factors that shape structural connectivity in the mammalian brain.</content>

 There is an extensive literature debating whether perceived size is used to guide grasping. A possible reason for not using judged size is that using judged positions might lead to more precise movements. As this argument does not hold for small objects, and all studies showing an effect of the Ebbinghaus illusion on grasping used small objects, we hypothesized that size information is used for small objects but not for large ones. Using a modified diagonal illusion, we obtained an effect of about 10% on perceptual judgements, without an effect on grasping, irrespective of object size. We therefore reject our precision hypothesis. We discuss the results in the framework of grasping as moving digits to positions on an object. We conclude that the reported disagreement on the effect of illusions is because the Ebbinghaus illusion not only affects size, but -unlike most size illusions- also affects perceived positions.</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation approach previously shown to enhance memory acquisition, but more studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Here, we examined the effects of anodal tDCS (0.25 mA for 30 min) on the memory performance of male Sprague Dawley rats in the passive avoidance test (PAT) and the associated modifications to the hippocampal proteomes. Results indicate anodal tDCS applied before the acquisition period significantly enhanced memory performance in the PAT. Following PAT, synaptoneurosomes were biochemically purified from the hippocampi of tDCS-treated or sham-treated rats and individual protein abundances were determined by bottom-up liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Proteomic analysis identified 184 differentially expressed hippocampal proteins when comparing the sham to the tDCS before memory acquisition treatment group. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed anodal tDCS before memory acquisition significantly enhanced pathways associated with memory, cognition, learning, transmission, neuritogenesis, and long-term potentiation (LTP). IPA identified significant upstream regulators including &lt;i&gt;bdnf&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;shank3&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;gsk3b&lt;/i&gt;. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and protein sequence similarity (PSS) networks show that glutamate receptor pathways, ion channel activity, memory, learning, cognition, and long-term memory were significantly associated with anodal tDCS. Centrality measures from both networks identified key proteins including &lt;i&gt;dlg&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;shank&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grin&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;gria&lt;/i&gt; that were significantly modified by tDCS applied before the acquisition period. Together, our results provide descriptive molecular evidence that anodal tDCS enhances memory performance in the PAT by modifying hippocampal synaptic plasticity related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unawareness, or &lt;i&gt;anosognosia&lt;/i&gt;, of memory deficits is a challenging manifestation of Alzheimer disease (AD) that adversely affects a patient's safety and decision‐making. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the presence, as well as the evolution, of altered awareness of memory function across the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to characterize change in awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to beta‐amyloid (Aβ) burden in a large cohort (N = 1,070) of individuals across the disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed (average number of visits = 4.3) and operationalized using the discrepancy between mean participant and partner report on the Everyday Cognition scale (memory domain). Aβ deposition was measured at baseline using [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomographic imaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aβ predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such that awareness decreased faster in participants with increased Aβ burden. Aβ and clinical group interacted to predict change in memory awareness, demonstrating the strongest effect in dementia participants, but could also be found in the cognitively normal (CN) participants. In a subset of CN participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), heightened memory awareness was observed up to 1.6 years before MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining until the time of progression to MCI (−0.08 discrepant‐points/yr&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;. In a subset of MCI participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and continued to decline (−0.23 discrepant‐points/yr&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, reaching anosognosia 3.2 years before dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aβ burden is associated with a progressive decrease in self‐awareness of memory deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately 3 years before dementia diagnosis. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;It is largely believed that complex cognitive phenomena require the perfect
orchestrated collaboration of many neurons. However, this is not what
converging experimental evidence suggests. Single neurons, the so-called
concept cells, may be responsible for complex tasks performed by an individual.
Here, starting from a few first principles, we layout physical foundations
showing that concept cells are not only possible but highly likely, given that
neurons work in a high dimensional space.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders with a global burden of approximately 6.1 million patients. Alpha-synuclein has been linked to both the sporadic and familial forms of the disease. Moreover, alpha-synuclein is present in Lewy-bodies, the neuropathological hallmark of PD, and the protein and its aggregation have been widely linked to neurotoxic pathways that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration. Such pathways include autophagy/lysosomal dysregulation, synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial disruption, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress. Alpha-synuclein has not only been shown to alter cellular pathways but also to spread between cells, causing aggregation in host cells. Therapeutic approaches will need to address several, if not all, of these angles of alpha-synuclein toxicity. Here we review the current advances in therapeutic efforts for PD that aim to produce a disease-modifying therapy by targeting the spread, production, aggregation, and degradation of alpha-synuclein. These include: receptor blocking strategies whereby putative alpha-synuclein receptors could be blocked inhibiting alpha-synuclein spread, an alpha-synuclein reduction which will decrease the amount alpha-synuclein available for aggregation and pathway disruption, the use of small molecules in order to target alpha-synuclein aggregation, immunotherapy and the increase of alpha-synuclein degradation by increasing autophagy/lysosomal flux. The research discussed here may lead to a disease-modifying therapy that tackles disease onset and progression in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases are mostly modeled using genetically modified animals such as mice. However, animal models do not recapitulate all the phenotypes that are specific to human disease. This is mainly due to the genetic, anatomical and physiological difference in the neuromuscular systems of animals and humans. The emergence of direct and indirect human somatic cell reprogramming technologies may overcome this limitation because they enable the use of disease and patient-specific cellular models as enhanced platforms for drug discovery and autologous cell-based therapy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and urine-derived stem cells (USCs) are increasingly employed to recapitulate the pathophysiology of various human diseases. Recent cell-based modeling approaches utilize highly complex differentiation systems that faithfully mimic human tissue- and organ-level dysfunctions. In this review, we discuss promising cellular models, such as USC- and iPSC-based approaches, that are currently being used to model human neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alternative splicing is a powerful mechanism for molecular and functional diversification. In neurons, alternative splicing extensively controls various developmental steps as well as the plasticity and remodeling of neuronal activity in the adult brain. The axon initial segment (AIS) is the specialized compartment of proximal axons that initiates action potential (AP). At the AIS, the ion channels and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) required for AP initiation are densely clustered via the scaffolding and cytoskeletal proteins. Notably, recent studies have elucidated that multiple AIS proteins are controlled by extensive alternative splicing in developing and adult brains. Here, we argue the potential role of dynamic regulation of alternative splicing in the development, specification, and functions of the AIS. In particular, we propose the novel concept that alternative splicing potentially modulates the structural and functional plasticity at the AIS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke with highest mortality and morbidity. We have previously demonstrated that dipotassium bisperoxo (picolinato) oxovanadate (V), (bpV[pic]) inhibits phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. In this study, we examined the effect of bpV[pic] in the rat ICH model in vivo and the hemin-induced injury model in rat cortical cultures. The rat model of ICH was created by injecting autologous blood into the striatum, and bpV[pic] was intraperitoneally injected. The effects of bpV[pic] were evaluated by neurological tests, Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining, and Nissl staining. We demonstrate that bpV[pic] attenuates ICH-induced brain injury in vivo and hemin-induced neuron injury in vitro. The expression of E2F1 was increased, but β-catenin expression was decreased after ICH, and the altered expressions of E2F1 and β-catenin after ICH were blocked by bpV[pic] treatment. Our results further show that bpV[pic] increases β-catenin expression through downregulating E2F1 in cortical neurons and prevents hemin-induced neuronal damage through E2F1 downregulation and subsequent upregulation of β-catenin. By testing the effect of PTEN-siRNA, PTEN cDNA, or combined use of ERK1/2 inhibitor and bpV[pic] in cultured cortical neurons after hemin-induced injury, we provide evidence suggesting that PTEN inhibition by bpV[pic] confers neuroprotection through E2F1 and β-catenin pathway, but the neuroprotective role of ERK1/2 activation by bpV[pic] cannot be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Importance&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive techniques for retrieving ocular surface cells from babies infected by zika virus (ZIKV) during the gestational period remain to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to describe an optimized impression cytology method for the isolation of viable cells from Zika infected babies with and without Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) in satisfactory amount and quality to enable easy adoption in the field and application in the context of genomic and molecular approaches.&lt;/p&gt;Design, Settings, and Participants&lt;p&gt;Ocular surface samples were obtained with a hydrophilic nitrocellulose membrane (through optimized impression cytology method) from twelve babies referred to the Pediatric Service of the Antonio Pedro Hospital, Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After an authorized written informed consent from the parents, samples were collected from both eyes of 12 babies (4 babies with maternal ZIKV exposure during gestation and presence of clinical signs which included ocular abnormalities and microcephaly; 4 babies with maternal ZIKV exposure during gestation but no clinical signs; and 4 unaffected control babies with negative PCR for Zika virus and without clinical signs). Cells were used for microscopy analyses and evaluated for their suitability for downstream molecular applications in transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our optimized impression cytology protocol enabled the capture of a considerable number of viable cells. The microscopic features of the conjunctival epithelial cells were described by both direct analysis of the membrane-attached cells and analysis of cytospinned captured cells using several staining procedures. Epithelial basal, polyhedral and goblet cells were clearly identified in all groups. All cases of ZIKV infected babies showed potential morphological alterations (cell keratinization, pyknosis, karyolysis, anucleation, and vacuolization). Molecular approaches were also performed in parallel. Genomic DNA and RNA were successfully isolated from all samples to enable the establishment of transcriptomic and proteomic studies.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;p&gt;Our method proved to be a suitable, fast, and non-invasive tool to obtain ocular cell preparations from babies with and without Zika infection. The method yielded sufficient cells for detailed morphological and molecular analyses of samples. We discuss perspectives for the application of impression cytology in the context of ZIKV studies in basic and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Music training programs have been shown to enhance executive functions in aging adults; however, little is known regarding the extent to which different types of bimanual coordination (i.e., fine and gross motor) in music instruction contribute to these outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of bimanual coordination in music interventions on cognitive performance in healthy older adults (60–80 years). Participants (N = 135) completed motor measures and battery of standardized cognitive measures, before and after a 16-week music training program with a 3 h practice requirement. All participants were matched by age, education, and estimate of intelligence to one of three training programs: piano training (fine motor); percussion instruction (gross motor), and music listening instruction (MLI) (no motor control condition). Results of a Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed significant enhancements in bimanual synchronization and visual scanning/working memory abilities for fine and gross motor training groups as compared to MLI. Pairwise comparisons revealed that piano training significantly improved motor synchronization skills as compared to percussion instruction or music listening. Results suggest that active music performance may benefit working memory, the extent of these benefits may depend upon coordination demands.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Many detailed features of the cochlear anatomy have not been included in existing 3D cochlear models, including the microstructures inside the modiolar bone, which in turn determines the path of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We captured the intricate modiolar microstructures in a 3D human cochlea model reconstructed from μCT scans. A new algorithm was developed to reconstruct ANFs running through the microstructures within the model. Using the finite element method, we calculated the electrical potential as well as its first and second spatial derivatives along each ANF elicited by the cochlear implant electrodes. Simulation results of electrical potential was validated against intracochlear potential measurements. Comparison was then made with a simplified model without the microstructures within the cochlea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: When the stimulus was delivered from an electrode located deeper in the apex, the extent of the auditory nerve influenced by a higher electric potential grew larger; at the same time, the maximal potential value at the auditory nerve also became larger. The electric potential decayed at a faster rate toward the base of the cochlea than toward the apex. Compared to the cochlear model incorporating the modiolar microstructures, the simplified version resulted in relatively small differences in electric potential. However, in terms of the first and second derivatives of electric potential along the fibers, which are relevant for the initiation of action potentials, the two models exhibited large differences: maxima in both derivatives with the detailed model were larger by a factor of 1.5 (first derivative) and 2 (second derivative) in the exemplary fibers. More importantly, these maxima occurred at different locations, and opposite signs were found for the values of second derivatives between the two models at parts along the fibers. Hence, while one model predicts depolarization and spike initiation at a given location, the other may instead predict a hyperpolarization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although a cochlear model with fewer details seems sufficient for analysing the current spread in the cochlear ducts, a detailed-segmented cochlear model is required for the reconstruction of ANF trajectories through the modiolus, as well as the prediction of firing thresholds and spike initiation sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reopening of the cerebral artery after occlusion often results in “no-reflow” that has been attributed to the death and contraction (rigor mortis) of pericytes. Since this hypothesis still needs to be confirmed, we explored the effects of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) on viability and cell death of primary rat pericytes, in the presence or absence of neurovascular unit-derived cytokines. Two morphodynamic parameters, single cell membrane mobility (SCMM) and fractal dimension (D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;), were used to analyze the cell contractions and membrane complexity before and after OGD. We found a marginal reduction in cell viability after 2–6 h OGD; 24 h OGD caused a large reduction in viability and a large increase in the number of apoptotic and dead cells. Application of erythropoietin (EPO), or a combination of EPO and endothelial growth factor (VEGF&lt;sub&gt;A1−165&lt;/sub&gt;) during OGD significantly reduced cell viability; application of Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) during OGD caused a marginal, insignificant increase in cell viability. Simultaneous application of EPO, VEGF&lt;sub&gt;A1−165&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ang1 significantly increased cell viability during 24 h OGD. Twenty minutes and one hour OGD both significantly reduced SCMM compared to pre-OGD values, while no significant difference was seen in SCMM before and after 3 h OGD. There was a significant decrease in membrane complexity (D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) at 20 min during the OGD that disappeared thereafter. In conclusion, OGD transiently affected cell mobility and shape, which was followed by apoptosis in cultured pericytes. Ang1 may have a potentiality for preventing from the OGD-induced apoptosis. Further studies could clarify the relationship between cell contraction and apoptosis during OGD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As we identify the loci involved in late onset neurodegenerative disease, we are finding that the majority of them are involved in damage response processes. In this short review, I propose that it is partly a failure in these damage response processes which underlie late onset disease and that the resultant pathology is a marker of the type of damage response which has failed: microglial clearance of damaged neuronal membranes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), ubiquitin proteasome clearance in the tauopathies, and lysosomal clearance in Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this review, I outline this relationship. This article is not intended as a comprehensive review of the cell biology of any of these disorders but rather a summary of the evidence that the genetics and pathology of these disorders appear to point, in each case, to the removal of misfolded proteins as a critical process in disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: Susceptibility distortions impact diffusion MRI data analysis and is typically corrected during preprocessing. Correction strategies involve three classes of methods: registration to a structural image, the use of a fieldmap, or the use of images acquired with opposing phase encoding directions. It has been demonstrated that phase encoding based methods outperform the other two classes, but unfortunately, the choice of which phase encoding based method to use is still an open question due to the absence of any systematic comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this paper we quantitatively evaluated six popular phase encoding based methods for correcting susceptibility distortions in diffusion MRI data. We employed a framework that allows for the simulation of realistic diffusion MRI data with susceptibility distortions. We evaluated the ability for methods to correct distortions by comparing the corrected data with the ground truth. Four diffusion tensor metrics (FA, MD, eigenvalues and eigenvectors) were calculated from the corrected data and compared with the ground truth. We also validated two popular indirect metrics using both simulated data and real data. The two indirect metrics are the difference between the corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation over the corrected LR, RL, AP, and PA data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that DR-BUDDI and TOPUP offered the most accurate and robust correction compared to the other four methods using both direct and indirect evaluation metrics. EPIC and HySCO performed well in correcting b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; images but produced poor corrections for diffusion weighted volumes, and also they produced large errors for the four diffusion tensor metrics. We also demonstrate that the indirect metric (the difference between corrected LR and AP data) gives a different ordering of correction quality than the direct metric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We suggest researchers to use DR-BUDDI or TOPUP for susceptibility distortion correction. The two indirect metrics (the difference between corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation) should be interpreted together as a measure of distortion correction quality. The performance ranking of the various tools inferred from direct and indirect metrics differs slightly. However, across all tools, the results of direct and indirect metrics are highly correlated indicating that the analysis of indirect metrics may provide a good proxy of the performance of a correction tool if assessment using direct metrics is not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. A lack of curative treatments and a rapidly aging global population have amplified the need for early biomarkers of the disease process. Recent advances suggest that subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may be one of the earliest symptomatic markers of the AD cascade. Previous studies have identified changes in variability in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in patients with AD, with a possible association between BOLD variability and cerebrovascular factors in the aging brain. The objective of the current study was to determine whether changes in BOLD variability can be identified in individuals with SCD, and whether this signal may be associated with markers of cerebrovascular integrity in SCD and older adults without memory complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Data were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database from 19 participants with SCD and 19 similarly-aged controls. For each participant, a map of BOLD signal variability (SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt;) was computed as the standard deviation of the BOLD time-series at each voxel. Group comparisons were performed to examine differences in resting-state SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in SCD vs. healthy controls. Relationships were then examined between participant SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; maps and neuroimaging markers of white matter vascular infarcts in each group separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Between-group comparisons showed no significant differences in whole-brain SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in individuals with SCD and controls. In the healthy aging group, higher white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden was associated with greater SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in right temporal regions (p &amp;lt; 0.05), and lower scores on a measure of global executive functioning. These associations were not identified in individuals with SCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The current study underscores previous evidence for a relationship between SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and white matter vascular infarcts in the healthy aging brain. The findings also provide evidence for a dissociable relationship between healthy aging and SCD, such that in healthy controls, increased WMH is associated with declines in executive function that is not observed in older adults who present with memory complaints. Further multimodal work is needed to better understand the contributions of vascular pathology to the BOLD signal, and its potential relationship with pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising non-invasive method for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs translate brain activity into signals that allow communication with the outside world. Visual and motor imagery are often used as information-encoding strategies, but can be challenging if not grounded in recent experience in these modalities, e.g., in patients with locked-in-syndrome (LIS). In contrast, somatosensory imagery might constitute a more suitable information-encoding strategy as the somatosensory function is often very robust. Somatosensory imagery has been shown to activate the somatotopic cortex, but it has been unclear so far whether it can be reliably detected on a single-trial level and successfully classified according to specific somatosensory imagery content. Using ultra-high field 7-T fMRI, we show reliable and high-accuracy single-trial decoding of left-foot (LF) vs. right-hand (RH) somatosensory imagery. Correspondingly, higher decoding accuracies were associated with greater spatial separation of hand and foot decoding-weight patterns in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Exploiting these novel neuroscientific insights, we developed—and provide a proof of concept for—basic BCI communication by showing that binary (yes/no) answers encoded by somatosensory imagery can be decoded with high accuracy in simulated real-time (in 7 subjects) as well as in real-time (1 subject). This study demonstrates that body part-specific somatosensory imagery differentially activates somatosensory cortex in a topographically specific manner; evidence which was surprisingly still lacking in the literature. It also offers proof of concept for a novel somatosensory imagery-based fMRI-BCI control strategy, with particularly high potential for visually and motor-impaired patients. The strategy could also be transferred to lower MRI field strengths and to mobile functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Finally, given that communication BCIs provide the BCI user with a form of feedback based on their brain signals and can thus be considered as a specific form of neurofeedback, and that repeated use of a BCI has been shown to enhance underlying representations, we expect that the current BCI could also offer an interesting new approach for somatosensory rehabilitation training in the context of stroke and phantom limb pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In order to memorize sentences we use both processes of language comprehension during encoding and processes of language production during maintenance. While the former processes are easily testable via controlled presentation of the input, the latter are more difficult to assess directly as language production is typically initiated and controlled internally. In the present event-related potential (ERP) study we track subvocal rehearsal of sentences, with the goal of studying the concomitant planning processes with the help of a silent cued-production task. Native German participants read different types of sentences word-by-word, then were prompted by a visual cue to silently repeat each individual word, in a rehearsal phase. In order to assess both local and global effects of sentence planning, we presented correct sentences, syntactically or semantically violated sentences, or random word order sequences. Semantic violations during reading elicited an N400 effect at the noun violating the selectional restrictions of the preceding verb. Syntactic violations, induced by a gender incongruency between determiner and noun, led to a P600 effect at the same position. Different ERP patterns occurred during the silent production phase. Here, semantically violated sentences elicited an early fronto-central negativity at the verb, while syntactically violated sentences elicited a late right-frontal positivity at the determiner. Random word order was accompanied by long-lasting slow waves during the production phase. The findings are consistent with models of hierarchical sentence planning and further indicate that the ongoing working memory processes are qualitatively distinct from comprehension mechanisms and neurophysiologically specific for syntactic and lexical-semantic level planning. In conclusion, active working memory maintenance of sentences is likely to comprise specific stages of sentence production that are indicated by ERP correlates of syntactic and semantic planning at the phrasal and clausal level respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurobiological systems rely on hierarchical and modular architectures to carry out intricate computations using minimal resources. A prerequisite for such systems to operate adequately is the capability to reliably and efficiently transfer information across multiple modules. Here, we study the features enabling a robust transfer of stimulus representations in modular networks of spiking neurons, tuned to operate in a balanced regime. To capitalize on the complex, transient dynamics that such networks exhibit during active processing, we apply reservoir computing principles and probe the systems' computational efficacy with specific tasks. Focusing on the comparison of random feed-forward connectivity and biologically inspired topographic maps, we find that, in a sequential set-up, structured projections between the modules are strictly necessary for information to propagate accurately to deeper modules. Such mappings not only improve computational performance and efficiency, they also reduce response variability, increase robustness against interference effects, and boost memory capacity. We further investigate how information from two separate input streams is integrated and demonstrate that it is more advantageous to perform non-linear computations on the input locally, within a given module, and subsequently transfer the result downstream, rather than transferring intermediate information and performing the computation downstream. Depending on how information is integrated early on in the system, the networks achieve similar task-performance using different strategies, indicating that the dimensionality of the neural responses does not necessarily correlate with nonlinear integration, as predicted by previous studies. These findings highlight a key role of topographic maps in supporting fast, robust, and accurate neural communication over longer distances. Given the prevalence of such structural feature, particularly in the sensory systems, elucidating their functional purpose remains an important challenge toward which this work provides relevant, new insights. At the same time, these results shed new light on important requirements for designing functional hierarchical spiking networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is best known for its robust dopaminergic projections to forebrain regions and their critical role in regulating reward, motivation, cognition, and aversion. However, the VTA is not only made of dopamine (DA) cells, as approximately 30% of cells in the VTA are GABA neurons. These neurons play a dual role, as VTA GABA neurons provide both local inhibition of VTA DA neurons and long-range inhibition of several distal brain regions. VTA GABA neurons have increasingly been recognized as potent mediators of reward and aversion in their own right, as well as potential targets for the treatment of addiction, depression, and other stress-linked disorders. In this review article, we dissect the circuit architecture, physiology, and behavioral roles of VTA GABA neurons and suggest critical gaps to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sections from the middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 46) of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and non-demented subjects were examined for the prevalence of hallmark AD pathology, including amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles, neuroinflammation and synaptic loss (n = 7 subjects/group). Dense-core deposits of Aβ were present in all AD patients (7/7) and some non-demented subjects (3/7), as evidenced by 6E10 immunohistochemistry. Levels of Aβ immunoreactivity were higher in AD vs. non-AD cases. For pTau, AT8-positive neurofibrillary tangles and threads were exclusively observed in AD patient tissue. Levels of [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]PK11195 binding to the translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of inflammatory processes, were elevated in the gray matter of AD patients compared to non-demented subjects. Levels of [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]UCB-J binding to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a marker of synaptic density, were not different between groups. In AD patients, pTau immunoreactivity was positively correlated with [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]PK11195, and negatively correlated with [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]UCB-J binding levels. No correlation was observed between Aβ immunoreactivity and markers of neuroinflammation or synaptic density. These data demonstrate a close interplay between tau pathology, inflammation and SV2A density in AD, and provide useful information on the ability of neuroimaging biomarkers to diagnose AD dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Homeostatic plasticity is a form of plasticity in which neurons compensate for changes in neuronal activity through the control of key physiological parameters such as the number and the strength of their synaptic inputs and intrinsic excitability. Recent studies revealed that miRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs repressing mRNA translation, participate in this process by controlling the translation of multiple effectors such as glutamate transporters, receptors, signaling molecules and voltage-gated ion channels. In this review, we present and discuss the role of miRNAs in both cell-wide and compartmentalized forms of homeostatic plasticity as well as their implication in pathological processes associated with homeostatic failure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;An increase in post-synaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance through activation of the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and concomitant structural changes are essential for the initiation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation. Memories can be initiated by coincident events, as occurs in classical conditioning, where the NMDAR can act as a molecular coincidence detector. Binding of glutamate and glycine, together with depolarization of the postsynaptic cell membrane to remove the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel pore block, results in NMDAR opening for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance. Accumulating evidence has implicated both force-from-lipids and protein tethering mechanisms for mechanosensory transduction in NMDAR, which has been demonstrated by both, membrane stretch and application of amphipathic molecules such as arachidonic acid (AA). The contribution of mechanosensitivity to memory formation and consolidation may be to increase activity of the NMDAR leading to facilitated memory formation. In this review we look back at the progress made toward understanding the physiological and pathological role of NMDA receptor channels in mechanobiology of the nervous system and consider these findings in like of their potential functional implications for memory formation. We examine recent studies identifying mechanisms of both NMDAR and other mechanosensitive channels and discuss functional implications including gain control of NMDA opening probability. Mechanobiology is a rapidly growing area of biology with many important implications for understanding form, function and pathology in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Biomarker screening is of major significance for the early diagnosis and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Routine peripheral blood parameters are easy to collect and detect, making them ideal potential biomarkers. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the parameters from routine blood as potential biomarkers for AD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 56 AD patients, 57 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 59 healthy elderly controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic values of routine blood biomarkers in patients with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were significant differences in eight parameters between the groups. Logistic regression revealed that the neutrophil% (odds ratio (OR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.75, p = 0.031) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; OR 6.27, 95% CI 3.98–9.82, p = 0.003) differentiated AD patients and controls (areas under the curve [AUCs], 0.728 and 0.721) and that the NLR (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.07–3.47, p = 0.028) and mean platelet volume (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04–2.70, p = 0.036) differentiated MCI patients and controls (AUCs, 0.60 and 0.638). There were no effective diagnostic biomarkers to distinguish AD from MCI.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Some routine blood biomarkers may correlate with cognitive impairment. Analysis of these biomarkers, such as the NLR, may be useful for the identification of patients with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 CAG/CTG trinuncleotide repeats are fragile sequences that when expanded form DNA secondary structures and cause human disease. We evaluated CAG/CTG repeat stability and repair outcomes in histone H2 mutants in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. Although the two copies of H2A are nearly identical in amino acid sequence, CAG repeat stability depends on H2A copy 1 (H2A.1) but not copy 2 (H2A.2). H2A.1 promotes high-fidelity homologous recombination, sister chromatid recombination (SCR), and break-induced replication whereas H2A.2 does not share these functions. Both decreased SCR and the increase in CAG expansions were due to the unique Thr126 residue in H2A.1 and &lt;i&gt;hta1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Δ&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;hta1-T126A&lt;/i&gt; mutants were epistatic to deletion of the Polδ subunit Pol32, suggesting a role for H2A.1 in D-loop extension. We conclude that H2A.1 plays a greater repair-specific role compared to H2A.2 and may be a first step towards evolution of a repair-specific function for H2AX compared to H2A in mammalian cells.</content>

 In humans, the divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (DMT1) mediates the transport of ferrous iron across the apical membrane of enterocytes. Hence, its inhibition could be beneficial for the treatment of iron overload disorders. Here we characterize the interaction of aromatic bis-isothiourea-substituted compounds with human DMT1 and its prokaryotic homologue EcoDMT. Both transporters are inhibited by a common competitive mechanism with potencies in the low micromolar range. The crystal structure of EcoDMT in complex with a brominated derivative defines the binding of the inhibitor to an extracellular pocket of the transporter in direct contact with residues of the metal ion coordination site, thereby interfering with substrate loading and locking the transporter in its outward-facing state. Mutagenesis and structure-activity relationships further support the observed interaction mode and reveal species-dependent differences between pro- and eukaryotic transporters. Together, our data provide the first detailed mechanistic insight into the pharmacology of SLC11/NRAMP transporters.</content>

 The rhythm generating network for breathing must continuously adjust to changing metabolic and behavioral demands. Here, we examined network-based mechanisms in the mouse preBӧtzinger complex using substance P, a potent excitatory modulator of breathing frequency and stability, as a tool to dissect network properties that underlie dynamic breathing. We find that substance P does not alter the balance of excitation and inhibition during breaths or the duration of the resulting refractory period. Instead, mechanisms of recurrent excitation between breaths are enhanced such that the rate that excitation percolates through the network is increased. We propose a conceptual framework in which three distinct phases of inspiration, the burst phase, refractory phase, and percolation phase, can be differentially modulated to control breathing dynamics and stability. Unraveling mechanisms that support this dynamic control may improve our understanding of nervous system disorders that destabilize breathing, many of which involve changes in brainstem neuromodulatory systems.</content>

 During development, the nervous system undergoes a refinement process by which neurons initially extend an excess number of neurites, the majority of which will be eliminated by the mechanism called neurite pruning. Some neurites undergo stereotyped and developmentally regulated pruning. However, the signaling cues that instruct stereotyped neurite pruning are yet to be fully elucidated. Here we show that Wnt morphogen instructs stereotyped neurite pruning for proper neurite projection patterning of the cholinergic motor neuron called PDB in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;lin-44/wnt&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;lin-17/frizzled&lt;/i&gt; mutant animals, the PDB neurites often failed to prune and grew towards the &lt;i&gt;lin-44-&lt;/i&gt;expressing cells. Surprisingly, membrane-tethered &lt;i&gt;lin-44&lt;/i&gt; is sufficient to induce proper neurite pruning in PDB, suggesting that neurite pruning does not require a Wnt gradient. LIN-17 and DSH-1/Dishevelled proteins were recruited to the pruning neurites in &lt;i&gt;lin-44-&lt;/i&gt;dependent manners. Our results revealed the novel gradient-independent role of Wnt signaling in instructing neurite pruning.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Errorless chromosome segregation requires load-bearing attachments of the plus ends of spindle microtubules to chromosome structures named kinetochores. How these end-on kinetochore attachments are established following initial lateral contacts with the microtubule lattice is poorly understood. Two microtubule-binding complexes, the Ndc80 and Ska complexes, are important for efficient end-on coupling and may function as a unit in this process, but precise conditions for their interaction are unknown. Here, we report that the Ska-Ndc80 interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and does not require microtubules, applied force, or several previously identified functional determinants including the Ndc80-loop and the Ndc80-tail. Both the Ndc80-tail, which we reveal to be essential for microtubule end-tracking, and Ndc80-bound Ska stabilize microtubule ends in a stalled conformation. Modulation of force-coupling efficiency demonstrates that the duration of stalled microtubule disassembly predicts whether a microtubule is stabilized and rescued by the kinetochore, likely reflecting a structural transition of the microtubule end.</content>

 Categorizing and understanding other people’s actions is a key human capability. Whereas there exists a growing literature regarding the organization of objects, the representational space underlying the organization of observed actions remains largely unexplored. Here we examined the organizing principles of a large set of actions and the corresponding neural representations. Using multiple regression representational similarity analysis of fMRI data, in which we accounted for variability due to major action components (body parts, scenes, movements, objects, sociality, transitivity) and three control models (distance between observer and actor, number of people, HMAX-C1), we found that the semantic dissimilarity structure was best captured by patterns of activation in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC). Together, our results demonstrate that the organization of observed actions in the LOTC resembles the organizing principles used by participants to classify actions behaviorally, in line with the view that this region is crucial for accessing the meaning of actions.</content>

However, our unprecedented numerical skills are deeply rooted in our neuronal heritage as primates and vertebrates. In this article, I argue that numerical competence in humans is the result of three neural constraints. First, I propose that the neuronal mechanisms of quantity estimation are part of our evolutionary heritage and can be witnessed across primate and vertebrate phylogeny. Second, I suggest that a basic understanding of number, what numerical quantity means, is innately wired into the brain and gives rise to an intuitive number sense, or number instinct. Third and finally, I argue that symbolic counting and arithmetic in humans is rooted in an evolutionarily and ontogenetically primeval neural system for non-symbolic number representations. These three neural constraints jointly determine the basic processing of number concepts in the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Speech and language are the most widely appreciated behaviors learned in this way. Vocal imitation in songbirds is perhaps the best studied socially transmitted behavior, and research over the past few years has begun to crack the circuit mechanisms for how songbirds learn from vocal models. Studies in zebra finches are revealing an unexpected and essential role for premotor cortical circuits in forming the behavioral-goal memories used to guide song imitation, challenging the view that song memories used for imitation are stored in auditory circuits. Here, we provide a summary of this recent progress focusing on the &lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Where&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;How&lt;/strong&gt; of tutor song memory, and propose a circuit hypothesis for song learning based on these recent findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While brain default mode network (DMN) activation in human subjects has been associated with mind wandering, meditation practice has been found to suppress it and to increase psychological well-being. In addition to DMN activity reduction, experienced meditators (EMs) during meditation practice show an increased connectivity between the DMN and the central executive network (CEN). However, the gradual change between DMN and CEN configuration from pre-meditation, during meditation, and post-meditation is unknown. Here, we investigated the change in DMN and CEN configuration by means of brain activity and functional connectivity (FC) analyses in EMs across three back-to-back functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans: pre-meditation baseline (trait), meditation (state), and post-meditation (state-to-trait). Pre-meditation baseline group comparison was also performed between EMs and healthy controls (HCs). Meditation trait was characterized by a significant reduction in activity and FC within DMN and increased anticorrelations between DMN and CEN. Conversely, meditation state and meditation state-to-trait periods showed increased activity and FC within the DMN and between DMN and CEN. However, the latter anticorrelations were only present in EMs with limited practice. The interactions between networks during these states by means of positive diametric activity (PDA) of the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs) defined as  revealed no trait differences but significant increases during meditation state that persisted in meditation state-to-trait. The gradual reconfiguration in DMN and CEN suggest a neural mechanism by which the CEN negatively regulates the DMN and is probably responsible for the long-term trait changes seen in meditators and reported psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons receive glutamatergic and/or GABAergic input from other local neurons within the VTA. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activity is capable of modulating such intra-VTA transmission, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we isolated monosynaptic glutamate or GABA transmission from mouse medial VTA (mVTA) to lateral VTA (latVTA) using pharmacology and optogenetics, and we studied the ability of nicotine to modulate these modes of transmission. The action of nicotine on mVTA to latVTA glutamate transmission was bidirectional; nicotine enhanced glutamate release in half of the recorded latVTA cells and inhibited release in the other half. Nicotine-mediated reduction in glutamate release was reversed by blockade of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. This, coupled with expression data demonstrating coexpression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) and glutamate decarboxylase 2 (Gad2) in mVTA neurons, suggests that nicotine is able to stimulate GABA corelease from mVTA VGluT2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nicotine had an altogether different effect on mVTA to latVTA GABA release from Gad2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells; nicotine suppressed GABA release from mVTA Gad2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; terminals in nearly all cells tested. Together, these data uncover a complex system of local circuitry in the VTA that is modulated by nAChR activity. These actions of nicotine, which occurred at concentrations of nicotine found in the artificial CSF of cigarette smokers, may play a role in the adaptive response of the reward system to repeated nicotine exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While multiple studies have been conducted of gene expression in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), their findings have not reached a clear consensus and have not accounted for the potentially confounding effects of changes in cellular composition. To help address this gap, we conducted a re-analysis based meta-analysis (mega-analysis) of ten independent studies of hippocampal gene expression in mouse models of AD. We used estimates of cellular composition as covariates in statistical models aimed to identify genes differentially expressed (DE) at either early or late stages of progression. Our analysis revealed changes in gene expression at early phases shared across studies, including dysregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and the complement system. Expression changes at later stages were dominated by cellular compositional effects. Thus, despite the considerable heterogeneity of the mouse models, we identified common patterns that may contribute to our understanding of AD etiology. Our work also highlights the importance of controlling for cellular composition effects in genomics studies of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has promising therapeutic value for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, the maintenance of remission will ultimately require repeated infusions of ketamine, which may lead to abuse potential and may hinder its therapeutic benefits. It is therefore crucial to assess the effects of repeated treatments with ketamine on alcohol intake. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine in both sexes how individual differences in alcohol intake alter ketamine self-administration and how ketamine self-administration will alter subsequent alcohol-drinking behaviors. Male and female rats intermittently drank alcohol or water for 10 weeks and were divided into high- or low-alcohol intake groups prior to ketamine self-administration. Rats self-administered ketamine under fixed and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement from week 4 to 7, and the incubation of ketamine craving was examined from week 8 to 10. To investigate structural plasticity in a brain region involved in reward, nucleus accumbens dendritic spine morphology was examined. Our results show that high alcohol intake in male rats attenuated ketamine self-administration, whereas in female rats high alcohol intake enhanced motivation to self-administer ketamine. Ketamine reduced alcohol intake in high-alcohol male rats but increased it in low-alcohol female rats. Incubation of ketamine craving developed in all groups except low-alcohol females. Three weeks of abstinence from ketamine was associated with increased mushroom spines in all groups except the high-alcohol male group. Overall, these data suggest that ketamine as a treatment for AUD may benefit male subjects, but not female subjects, and warrants further investigation before use as a therapeutic agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people suffer mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) every year, and there is growing evidence that repeated injuries can result in long-term pathology. The acute symptoms of these injuries may or may not include the loss of consciousness but do include disorientation, confusion, and/or the inability to concentrate. Most of these acute symptoms spontaneously resolve within a few hours or days. However, the underlying physiological and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Spreading depolarizations (SDs) are known to occur in rodents and humans following moderate and severe TBIs, and SDs have long been hypothesized to occur in more mild injuries. Using a closed skull impact model, we investigated the presence of SDs immediately following a mTBI. Animals remained motionless for multiple minutes following an impact and once recovered had fewer episodes of movement. We recorded the defining electrophysiological properties of SDs, including the large extracellular field potential shifts and suppression of high-frequency cortical activity. Impact-induced SDs were also associated with a propagating wave of reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF). In the wake of the SD, there was a prolonged period of reduced CBF that recovered in approximately 90 min. Similar to SDs in more severe injuries, the impact-induced SDs could be blocked with ketamine. Interestingly, impacts at a slower velocity did not produce the prolonged immobility and did not initiate SDs. Our data suggest that SDs play a significant role in mTBIs and SDs may contribute to the acute symptoms of mTBIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Christianson syndrome (CS) is an X-linked neurogenetic disorder resulting from loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in &lt;i&gt;SLC9A6&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes the endosomal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger 6 (NHE6). NHE6 regulates proton efflux from endosomes and, thus, participates in regulating cargo processing and trafficking. LoF mutations in NHE6 cause aberrant acidification of endosomes. While CS arises in males generally due to clear LoF mutations, other potentially hypomorphic variants have emerged, yet most of these variants have not been evaluated for functional effects, particularly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we characterize an &lt;i&gt;SLC9A6&lt;/i&gt; variant that has been previously reported in patients, yet now also appears in exome datasets of largely control individuals—c.25G&amp;gt;T, p.A9S. By heterologous expression in cell lines, we show that human NHE6A9S is expressed and localizes in a manner comparable to control NHE6. By genome editing, we generated the equivalent NHE6 mutation in mouse—p.A11S—and determined that male NHE6A11S mice have normal brain size at 6 months of age and do not show cerebellar degeneration or defective neuronal arborization. Neurons from male NHE6A11S mice also did not demonstrate an abnormality in intraendosomal pH compared with controls. These findings are in contrast to findings in NHE6-null mice previously reported and indicate that the NHE6A11S variant functions at a level equivalent to control NHE6 for many of the assays performed. These data stand in support of the population genetic data, which are also evaluated here, indicating that the A9S variant is unlikely to confer disease susceptibility with high penetrance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;An isoform of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), PPAR, is the receptor for the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic medications including pioglitazone. Neuroanatomical data indicate PPAR localization in brain areas involved in drug addiction. Preclinical and clinical data have shown that pioglitazone reduces alcohol and opioid self-administration, relapse to drug seeking, and plays a role in emotional responses. Here, we investigated the behavioral effect of PPAR manipulation on nicotine withdrawal in male Wistar rats and in male mice with neuron-specific PPAR deletion (PPAR&lt;sup&gt;(–/–)&lt;/sup&gt;) and their littermate wild-type (PPAR&lt;sup&gt;(+/+)&lt;/sup&gt;) controls. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and RNAscope &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization assays were used for assessing the levels of expression and cell-type localization of PPAR during nicotine withdrawal. Brain site-specific microinjections of the PPAR agonist pioglitazone were performed to explore the role of this system on nicotine withdrawal at a neurocircuitry level. Results showed that activation of PPAR by pioglitazone abolished the expression of somatic and affective nicotine withdrawal signs in rats and in (PPAR&lt;sup&gt;(+/+)&lt;/sup&gt;) mice. This effect was blocked by the PPAR antagonist GW9662. During early withdrawal and protracted abstinence, the expression of PPAR increased in GABAergic and glutamatergic cells of the amygdala and hippocampus, respectively. Hippocampal microinjections of pioglitazone reduced the expression of the physical signs of withdrawal, whereas excessive anxiety associated with protracted abstinence was prevented by pioglitazone microinjection into the amygdala. Our results demonstrate the implication of the neuronal PPAR in nicotine withdrawal and indicates that activation of PPAR may offer an interesting strategy for smoking cessation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Smoking cessation leads the occurrence of physical and affective withdrawal symptoms representing a major burden to quit tobacco use. Here, we show that activation of PPAR prevents the expression of both somatic and affective signs of nicotine withdrawal. At molecular levels results show that PPAR expression increases in GABAergic cells in the hippocampus and in GABA- and glutamate-positive cells in the basolateral amygdala. Hippocampal microinjections of pioglitazone reduce the insurgence of the physical withdrawal signs, whereas anxiety linked to protracted abstinence is attenuated by pioglitazone injected into the amygdala. Our results demonstrate the implication of neuronal PPAR in nicotine withdrawal and suggest that PPAR agonism may represent a promising treatment to aid smoking cessation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the leading monogenetic cause of autism. One symptom of FXS and autism is sensory hypersensitivity (also called sensory over-responsivity). Perhaps related to this, the audiogenic seizure (AGS) is arguably the most robust behavioral phenotype in the FXS mouse model—the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (KO) mouse. Therefore, the AGS may be considered a mouse model of sensory hypersensitivity. Hyperactive circuits are hypothesized to underlie dysfunction in a number of brain regions in patients with FXS and &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice, and the AGS may be a result of this. But the specific cell types and brain regions underlying AGSs in the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO are unknown. We used conditional deletion or expression of &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; in different cell populations to determine whether &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; deletion in those cells was sufficient or necessary, respectively, for the AGS phenotype in males. Our data indicate that &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; deletion in glutamatergic neurons that express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2) and are located in subcortical brain regions is sufficient and necessary to cause AGSs. Furthermore, the deletion of &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; in glutamatergic neurons of the inferior colliculus is necessary for AGSs. When we demonstrate necessity, we show that &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; expression in either the larger population of VGlut2-expressing glutamatergic neurons or the smaller population of inferior collicular glutamatergic neurons—in an otherwise &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mouse—eliminates AGSs. Therefore, targeting these neuronal populations in FXS and autism may be part of a therapeutic strategy to alleviate sensory hypersensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sensory hypersensitivity in fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism patients significantly interferes with quality of life. Audiogenic seizures (AGSs) are arguably the most robust behavioral phenotype in the FXS mouse model—the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout—and may be considered a model of sensory hypersensitivity in FXS. We provide the clearest and most precise genetic evidence to date for the cell types and brain regions involved in causing AGSs in the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout and, more broadly, for any mouse mutant. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; in these same cell types in an otherwise &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout eliminates AGSs indicating possible cellular targets for alleviating sensory hypersensitivity in FXS and other forms of autism.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Migraine is a complex brain disorder, characterized by attacks of unilateral headache and global dysfunction in multisensory information processing, whose underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms remain unknown. The finding of enhanced excitatory, but unaltered inhibitory, neurotransmission at intracortical synapses in mouse models of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) suggested the hypothesis that dysregulation of the excitatory–inhibitory balance in specific circuits is a key pathogenic mechanism. Here, we investigated the thalamocortical (TC) feedforward inhibitory microcircuit in FHM1 mice of both sexes carrying a gain-of-function mutation in Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1. We show that TC synaptic transmission in somatosensory cortex is enhanced in FHM1 mice. Due to similar gain of function of TC excitation of layer 4 excitatory and fast-spiking inhibitory neurons elicited by single thalamic stimulations, neither the excitatory–inhibitory balance nor the integration time window set by the TC feedforward inhibitory microcircuit was altered in FHM1 mice. However, during repetitive thalamic stimulation, the typical shift of the excitatory–inhibitory balance toward excitation and the widening of the integration time window were both smaller in FHM1 compared with WT mice, revealing a dysregulation of the excitatory–inhibitory balance, whereby the balance is relatively skewed toward inhibition. This is due to an unexpected differential effect of the FHM1 mutation on short-term synaptic plasticity at TC synapses on cortical excitatory and fast-spiking inhibitory neurons. Our findings point to enhanced transmission of sensory, including trigeminovascular nociceptive, signals from thalamic nuclei to cortex and TC excitatory–inhibitory imbalance as mechanisms that may contribute to headache, increased sensory gain, and sensory processing dysfunctions in migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Migraine is a complex brain disorder, characterized by attacks of unilateral headache and by global dysfunction in multisensory information processing, whose underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms remain unknown. Here we provide insights into these mechanisms by investigating thalamocortical (TC) synaptic transmission and the function of the TC feedforward inhibitory microcircuit in a mouse model of a rare monogenic migraine. This microcircuit is critical for gating information flow to cortex and for sensory processing. We reveal increased TC transmission and dysregulation of the cortical excitatory–inhibitory balance set by the TC feedforward inhibitory microcircuit, whereby the balance is relatively skewed toward inhibition during repetitive thalamic activity. These alterations may contribute to headache, increased sensory gain, and sensory processing dysfunctions in migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Signaling at the orexin-1 receptor (OxR1) is important for motivated drug taking. Using a within-session behavioral economics (BE) procedure, we previously found that pharmacologic blockade of the OxR1 decreased motivation (increased demand elasticity) for the potent and short-acting opioid remifentanil and reduced low-effort remifentanil consumption. However, the mechanism through which orexin regulates remifentanil demand is currently unknown. Previous work implicated OxR1 signaling within ventral pallidum (VP) as a potential target. VP is densely innervated by orexin fibers and is known to regulate opioid reward. Accordingly, this study sought to determine the role of VP OxR1 signaling in remifentanil demand and cue-induced reinstatement of remifentanil seeking in male rats. Intra-VP microinjections of the OxR1 antagonist SB-334867 (SB) decreased motivation (increased demand elasticity; α) for remifentanil without affecting remifentanil consumption at low effort. Baseline α values predicted the degree of cue-induced remifentanil seeking, and microinjection of SB into VP attenuated this behavior without affecting extinction responding. Baseline α values also predicted SB efficacy, such that SB was most effective in attenuating reinstatement behavior in highly motivated rats. Together, these findings support a selective role for VP OxR1 signaling in motivation for the opioid remifentanil. Our findings also highlight the utility of BE in predicting relapse propensity and efficacy of treatment with OxR1 antagonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Abuse of opioids has risen rapidly and continues to be a major health crisis. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms underlying opioid addiction. Here, we investigate the role of orexin-1 receptor signaling (OxR1) within ventral pallidum (VP) in remifentanil demand and cue-induced reinstatement of remifentanil seeking. Using a within-session behavioral economics procedure, we show that intra-VP microinjections of the OxR1 antagonist SB-334867 decreased motivation (increased demand elasticity) without affecting remifentanil consumption at low effort. We also found that SB microinjected intra-VP attenuated cue-induced reinstatement of remifentanil seeking. Together, our results support a role for VP OxR1 signaling in opioid reward.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A central function of the brain is to plan, predict, and imagine the effect of movement in a dynamically changing environment. Here we show that in mice head-fixed in a plus-maze, floating on air, and trained to pick lanes based on visual stimuli, the asymmetric movement, and position of whiskers on the two sides of the face signals whether the animal is moving, turning, expecting reward, or licking. We show that (1) whisking asymmetry is coordinated with behavioral state, and that behavioral state can be decoded and predicted based on asymmetry, (2) even in the absence of tactile input, whisker positioning and asymmetry nevertheless relate to behavioral state, and (3) movement of the nose correlates with asymmetry, indicating that facial expression of the mouse is itself correlated with behavioral state. These results indicate that the movement of whiskers, a behavior that is not instructed or necessary in the task, can inform an observer about what a mouse is doing in the maze. Thus, the position of these mobile tactile sensors reflects a behavioral and movement-preparation state of the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Behavior is a sequence of movements, where each movement can be related to or can trigger a set of other actions. Here we show that, in mice, the movement of whiskers (tactile sensors used to extract information about texture and location of objects) is coordinated with and predicts the behavioral state of mice: that is, what mice are doing, where they are in space, and where they are in the sequence of behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Temporal orienting improves sensory processing, akin to other top–down biases. However, it is unknown whether these improvements reflect increased neural gain to any stimuli presented at expected time points, or specific tuning to task-relevant stimulus aspects. Furthermore, while other top–down biases are selective, the extent of trade-offs across time is less well characterized. Here, we tested whether gain and/or tuning of auditory frequency processing in humans is modulated by rhythmic temporal expectations, and whether these modulations are specific to time points relevant for task performance. Healthy participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 23) of either sex performed an auditory discrimination task while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Acoustic stimulation consisted of sequences of brief distractors interspersed with targets, presented in a rhythmic or jittered way. Target rhythmicity not only improved behavioral discrimination accuracy and M/EEG-based decoding of targets, but also of irrelevant distractors preceding these targets. To explain this finding in terms of increased sensitivity and/or sharpened tuning to auditory frequency, we estimated tuning curves based on M/EEG decoding results, with separate parameters describing gain and sharpness. The effect of rhythmic expectation on distractor decoding was linked to gain increase only, suggesting increased neural sensitivity to any stimuli presented at relevant time points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Being able to predict when an event may happen can improve perception and action related to this event, likely due to the alignment of neural activity to the temporal structure of stimulus streams. However, it is unclear whether rhythmic increases in neural sensitivity are specific to task-relevant targets, and whether they competitively impair stimulus processing at unexpected time points. By combining magnetoencephalography and encephalographic recordings, neural decoding of auditory stimulus features, and modeling, we found that rhythmic expectation improved neural decoding of both relevant targets and irrelevant distractors presented and expected time points, but did not competitively impair stimulus processing at unexpected time points. Using a quantitative model, these results were linked to nonspecific neural gain increases due to rhythmic expectation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Alpha Oscillations in the Human Brain Implement Distractor Suppression Independent of Target Selection</title>

 &lt;p&gt;In principle, selective attention is the net result of target selection and distractor suppression. The way in which both mechanisms are implemented neurally has remained contested. Neural oscillatory power in the alpha frequency band (~10 Hz) has been implicated in the selection of to-be-attended targets, but there is lack of empirical evidence for its involvement in the suppression of to-be-ignored distractors. Here, we use electroencephalography recordings of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 33 human participants (males and females) to test the preregistered hypothesis that alpha power directly relates to distractor suppression and thus operates independently from target selection. In an auditory spatial pitch discrimination task, we modulated the location (left vs right) of either a target or a distractor tone sequence, while fixing the other in the front. When the distractor was fixed in the front, alpha power relatively decreased contralaterally to the target and increased ipsilaterally. Most importantly, when the target was fixed in the front, alpha lateralization reversed in direction for the suppression of distractors on the left versus right. These data show that target-selection-independent alpha power modulation is involved in distractor suppression. Although both lateralized alpha responses for selection and for suppression proved reliable, they were uncorrelated and distractor-related alpha power emerged from more anterior, frontal cortical regions. Lending functional significance to suppression-related alpha oscillations, alpha lateralization at the individual, single-trial level was predictive of behavioral accuracy. These results fuel a renewed look at neurobiological accounts of selection-independent suppressive filtering in attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although well established models of attention rest on the assumption that irrelevant sensory information is filtered out, the neural implementation of such a filter mechanism is unclear. Using an auditory attention task that decouples target selection from distractor suppression, we demonstrate that two sign-reversed lateralized alpha responses reflect target selection versus distractor suppression. Critically, these alpha responses are reliable, independent of each other, and generated in more anterior, frontal regions for suppression versus selection. Prediction of single-trial task performance from alpha modulation after stimulus onset agrees with the view that alpha modulation bears direct functional relevance as a neural implementation of attention. Results demonstrate that the neurobiological foundation of attention implies a selection-independent alpha oscillatory mechanism to suppress distraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the transcription factors FOXP1 and FOXP2 are associated with speech impairments. FOXP1 is additionally linked to cognitive deficits, as is FOXP4. These FoxP proteins are highly conserved in vertebrates and expressed in comparable brain regions, including the striatum. In male zebra finches, experimental manipulation of FoxP2 in Area X, a striatal song nucleus essential for vocal production learning, affects song development, adult song production, dendritic spine density, and dopamine-regulated synaptic transmission of striatal neurons. We previously showed that, in the majority of Area X neurons FoxP1, FoxP2, and FoxP4 are coexpressed, can dimerize and multimerize with each other and differentially regulate the expression of target genes. These findings raise the possibility that FoxP1, FoxP2, and FoxP4 (FoxP1/2/4) affect neural function differently and in turn vocal learning. To address this directly, we downregulated FoxP1 or FoxP4 in Area X of juvenile zebra finches and compared the resulting song phenotypes with the previously described inaccurate and incomplete song learning after &lt;i&gt;FoxP2&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. We found that experimental downregulation of &lt;i&gt;FoxP1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FoxP4&lt;/i&gt; led to impaired song learning with partly similar features as those reported for &lt;i&gt;FoxP2&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns. However, there were also specific differences between the groups, leading us to suggest that specific features of the song are differentially impacted by developmental manipulations of &lt;i&gt;FoxP1/2/4&lt;/i&gt; expression in Area X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We compared the effects of experimentally reduced expression of the transcription factors FoxP1, FoxP2, and FoxP4 in a striatal song nucleus, Area X, on vocal production learning in juvenile male zebra finches. We show, for the first time, that these temporally and spatially precise manipulations of the three FoxPs affect spectral and temporal song features differentially. This is important because it raises the possibility that the different FoxPs control different aspects of vocal learning through combinatorial gene expression or by acting in different microcircuits within Area X. These results are consistent with the deleterious effects of human &lt;i&gt;FOXP1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXP2&lt;/i&gt; mutations on speech and language and add &lt;i&gt;FOXP4&lt;/i&gt; as a possible candidate gene for vocal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Stress responses are coordinated by widespread neural circuits. Homeostatic and psychogenic stressors activate preproglucagon (PPG) neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) that produce glucagon-like peptide-1; published work in rodents indicates that these neurons play a crucial role in stress responses. While the axonal targets of PPG neurons are well established, their afferent inputs are unknown. Here we use retrograde tracing with cholera toxin subunit b to show that the cNTS in male and female mice receives axonal inputs similar to those reported in rats. Monosynaptic and polysynaptic inputs specific to cNTS PPG neurons were revealed using Cre-conditional pseudorabies and rabies viruses. The most prominent sources of PPG monosynaptic input include the lateral (LH) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus, parasubthalamic nucleus, lateral division of the central amygdala, and Barrington's nucleus (Bar). Additionally, PPG neurons receive monosynaptic vagal sensory input from the nodose ganglia and spinal sensory input from the dorsal horn. Sources of polysynaptic input to cNTS PPG neurons include the hippocampal formation, paraventricular thalamus, and prefrontal cortex. Finally, cNTS-projecting neurons within PVN, LH, and Bar express the activation marker cFOS in mice after restraint stress, identifying them as potential sources of neurogenic stress-induced recruitment of PPG neurons. In summary, cNTS PPG neurons in mice receive widespread monosynaptic and polysynaptic input from brain regions implicated in coordinating behavioral and physiological stress responses, as well as from vagal and spinal sensory neurons. Thus, PPG neurons are optimally positioned to integrate signals of homeostatic and psychogenic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent research has indicated a crucial role for glucagon-like peptide-1-producing preproglucagon (PPG) neurons in regulating both appetite and behavioral and autonomic responses to acute stress. Intriguingly, the central glucagon-like peptide-1 system defined in rodents is conserved in humans, highlighting the translational importance of understanding its anatomical organization. Findings reported here indicate that PPG neurons receive significant monosynaptic and polysynaptic input from brain regions implicated in autonomic and behavioral responses to stress, as well as direct input from vagal and spinal sensory neurons. Improved understanding of the neural pathways underlying the recruitment of PPG neurons may facilitate the development of novel therapies for the treatment of stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/49/9757?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Breathing results from sequential recruitment of muscles in the expiratory, inspiratory, and postinspiratory (post-I) phases of the respiratory cycle. Here we investigate whether neurons in the medullary intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt) are components of a central pattern generator (CPG) that generates post-I activity in laryngeal adductors and vasomotor sympathetic nerves and interacts with other members of the central respiratory network to terminate inspiration. We first identified the region of the (male) rat IRt that contains the highest density of lightly cholinergic neurons, many of which are glutamatergic, which aligns well with the putative postinspiratory complex in the mouse (Anderson et al., 2016). Acute bilateral inhibition of this region reduced the amplitudes of post-I vagal and sympathetic nerve activities. However, although associated with reduced expiratory duration and increased respiratory frequency, IRt inhibition did not affect inspiratory duration or abolish the recruitment of post-I activity during acute hypoxemia as predicted. Rather than representing an independent CPG for post-I activity, we hypothesized that IRt neurons may instead function as a relay that distributes post-I activity generated elsewhere, and wondered whether they could be a site of integration for para-respiratory CPGs that drive the same outputs. Consistent with this idea, IRt inhibition blocked rhythmic motor and autonomic components of fictive swallow but not swallow-related apnea. Our data support a role for IRt neurons in the transmission of post-I and swallowing activity to motor and sympathetic outputs, but suggest that other mechanisms also contribute to the generation of post-I activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Interactions between multiple coupled oscillators underlie a three-part respiratory cycle composed from inspiratory, postinspiratory (post-I), and late-expiratory phases. Central post-I activity terminates inspiration and activates laryngeal motoneurons. We investigate whether neurons in the intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt) form the central pattern generator (CPG) responsible for post-I activity. We confirm that IRt activity contributes to post-I motor and autonomic outputs, and find that IRt neurons are necessary for activation of the same outputs during swallow, but that they are not required for termination of inspiration or recruitment of post-I activity during hypoxemia. We conclude that this population may not represent a distinct CPG, but instead may function as a premotor relay that integrates activity generated by diverse respiratory and nonrespiratory CPGs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Most single units recorded from macaque secondary visual cortex (V2) respond with higher firing rates to synthetic texture images containing &quot;naturalistic&quot; higher-order statistics than to spectrally matched &quot;noise&quot; images lacking these statistics. In contrast, few single units in V1 show this property. We explored how the strength and dynamics of response vary across the different layers of visual cortex by recording multiunit (defined as high-frequency power in the local field potential) and gamma-band activity evoked by brief presentations of naturalistic and noise images in V1 and V2 of anesthetized macaque monkeys of both sexes. As previously reported, recordings in V2 showed consistently stronger responses to naturalistic texture than to spectrally matched noise. In contrast to single-unit recordings, V1 multiunit activity showed a preference for images with naturalistic statistics, and in gamma-band activity this preference was comparable across V1 and V2. Sensitivity to naturalistic image structure was strongest in the supragranular and infragranular layers of V1, but weak in granular layers, suggesting that it might reflect feedback from V2. Response timing was consistent with this idea. Visual responses appeared first in V1, followed by V2. Sensitivity to naturalistic texture emerged first in V2, followed by the supragranular and infragranular layers of V1, and finally in the granular layers of V1. Our results demonstrate laminar differences in the encoding of higher-order statistics of natural texture, and suggest that this sensitivity first arises in V2 and is fed back to modulate activity in V1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The circuit mechanisms responsible for visual representations of intermediate complexity are largely unknown. We used a well validated set of synthetic texture stimuli to probe the temporal and laminar profile of sensitivity to the higher-order statistical structure of natural images. We found that this sensitivity emerges first and most strongly in V2 but soon after in V1. However, sensitivity in V1 is higher in the laminae (extragranular) and recording modalities (local field potential) most likely affected by V2 connections, suggesting a feedback origin. Our results show how sensitivity to naturalistic image structure emerges across time and circuitry in the early visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Fertility critically depends on the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator, a neural construct comprised of hypothalamic neurons coexpressing kisspeptin, neurokoinin-B and dynorphin. Here, using mathematical modeling and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; optogenetics we reveal for the first time how this neural construct initiates and sustains the appropriate ultradian frequency essential for reproduction. Prompted by mathematical modeling, we show experimentally using female estrous mice that robust pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone, a proxy for GnRH, emerges abruptly as we increase the basal activity of the neuronal network using continuous low-frequency optogenetic stimulation. Further increase in basal activity markedly increases pulse frequency and eventually leads to pulse termination. Additional model predictions that pulsatile dynamics emerge from nonlinear positive and negative feedback interactions mediated through neurokinin-B and dynorphin signaling respectively are confirmed neuropharmacologically. Our results shed light on the long-elusive GnRH pulse generator offering new horizons for reproductive health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator controls the pulsatile secretion of the gonadotropic hormones LH and FSH and is critical for fertility. The hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin neurons are thought to represent the GnRH pulse generator, since their oscillatory activity is coincident with LH pulses in the blood; a proxy for GnRH pulses. However, the mechanisms underlying GnRH pulse generation remain elusive. We developed a mathematical model of the kisspeptin neuronal network and confirmed its predictions experimentally, showing how LH secretion is frequency-modulated as we increase the basal activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using continuous optogenetic stimulation. Our model provides a quantitative framework for understanding the reproductive neuroendocrine system and opens new horizons for fertility regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Contribution of the Retrotrapezoid Nucleus and Carotid Bodies to Hypercapnia- and Hypoxia-induced Arousal from Sleep</title>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The combination of hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep produces arousal, which helps restore breathing and normalizes blood gases. Hypercapnia and hypoxia produce arousal in mammals by activating central (pH-sensitive) and peripheral (primarily O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sensitive) chemoreceptors. The relevant chemoreceptors and the neuronal circuits responsible for arousal are largely unknown. Here we examined the contribution of two lower brainstem nuclei that could be implicated in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hypoxia-induced arousal: the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-responsive nucleus, which mediates the central respiratory chemoreflex; and the C1 neurons, which are hypoxia activated and produce arousal and blood pressure increases when directly stimulated. Additionally, we assessed the contribution of the carotid bodies (CBs), the main peripheral chemoreceptors in mammals, to hypoxia and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced arousal. In unanesthetized male rats, we tested whether ablation of the RTN, CBs, or C1 neurons affects arousal from sleep and respiratory responses to hypercapnia or hypoxia. The sleep–wake pattern was monitored by EEG and neck EMG recordings and breathing by whole-body plethysmography. The latency to arousal in response to hypoxia or hypercapnia was determined along with changes in ventilation coincident with the arousal. RTN lesions impaired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced arousal but had no effect on hypoxia-induced arousal. CB ablation impaired arousal to hypoxia and, to a lesser extent, hypercapnia. C1 neuron ablation had no effect on arousal. Thus, the RTN contributes to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced arousal, whereas the CBs contribute to both hypoxia and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced arousal. Asphyxia-induced arousal likely requires the combined activation of RTN, CBs and other central chemoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hypercapnia and hypoxia during sleep elicit arousal, which facilitates airway clearing in the case of obstruction and reinstates normal breathing in the case of hypoventilation or apnea. Arousal can also be detrimental to health by interrupting sleep. We sought to clarify how CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hypoxia cause arousal. We show that the retrotrapezoid nucleus, a brainstem nucleus that mediates the effect of brain acidification on breathing, also contributes to arousal elicited by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but not hypoxia. We also show that the carotid bodies contribute predominantly to hypoxia-induced arousal. Lesions of the retrotrapezoid nucleus or carotid bodies attenuate, but do not eliminate, arousal to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or hypoxia; therefore, we conclude that these structures are not the sole trigger of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or hypoxia-induced arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Large-scale functional connectome formation and reorganization is apparent in the second trimester of pregnancy, making it a crucial and vulnerable time window in connectome development. Here we identified which architectural principles of functional connectome organization are initiated before birth, and contrast those with topological characteristics observed in the mature adult brain. A sample of 105 pregnant women participated in human fetal resting-state fMRI studies (fetal gestational age between 20 and 40 weeks). Connectome analysis was used to analyze weighted network characteristics of fetal macroscale brain wiring. We identified efficient network attributes, common functional modules, and high overlap between the fetal and adult brain network. Our results indicate that key features of the functional connectome are present in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Understanding the organizational principles of fetal connectome organization may bring opportunities to develop markers for early detection of alterations of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The fetal to neonatal period is well known as a critical stage in brain development. Rapid neurodevelopmental processes establish key functional neural circuits of the human brain. Prenatal risk factors may interfere with early trajectories of connectome formation and thereby shape future health outcomes. Recent advances in MRI have made it possible to examine fetal brain functional connectivity. In this study, we evaluate the network topography of normative functional network development during connectome genesis &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt;. Understanding the developmental trajectory of brain connectivity provides a basis for understanding how the prenatal period shapes future brain function and disease dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a key mediator of nociception, acting during the development and differentiation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and on adult DRG neuron sensitization to painful stimuli. NGF also has central actions in the brain, where it regulates the phenotypic maintenance of cholinergic neurons. The physiological function of NGF as a pain mediator is altered in patients with Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type V (HSAN V), caused by the 661C&amp;gt;T transition in the &lt;i&gt;Ngf&lt;/i&gt; gene, resulting in the R100W missense mutation in mature NGF. Homozygous HSAN V patients present with congenital pain insensitivity, but are cognitively normal. This led us to hypothesize that the R100W mutation may differentially affect the central and peripheral actions of NGF. To test this hypothesis and provide a mechanistic basis to the HSAN V phenotype, we generated transgenic mice harboring the human 661C&amp;gt;T mutation in the &lt;i&gt;Ngf&lt;/i&gt; gene and studied both males and females. We demonstrate that heterozygous NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W/wt&lt;/sup&gt; mice display impaired nociception. DRG neurons of NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W/wt&lt;/sup&gt; mice are morphologically normal, with no alteration in the different DRG subpopulations, whereas skin innervation is reduced. The NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; protein has reduced capability to activate pain-specific signaling, paralleling its reduced ability to induce mechanical allodynia. Surprisingly, however, NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W/wt&lt;/sup&gt; mice, unlike heterozygous mNGF&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, show no learning or memory deficits, despite a reduction in secretion and brain levels of NGF. The results exclude haploinsufficiency of NGF as a mechanistic cause for heterozygous HSAN V mice and demonstrate a specific effect of the R100W mutation on nociception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The R100W mutation in nerve growth factor (NGF) causes Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type V, a rare disease characterized by impaired nociception, even in apparently clinically silent heterozygotes. For the first time, we generated and characterized heterozygous knock-in mice carrying the human R100W-mutated allele (NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W/wt&lt;/sup&gt;). Mutant mice have normal nociceptor populations, which, however, display decreased activation of pain transduction pathways. NGF&lt;sup&gt;R100W&lt;/sup&gt; interferes with peripheral and central NGF bioavailability, but this does not impact on CNS function, as demonstrated by normal learning and memory, in contrast with heterozygous NGF knock-out mice. Thus, a point mutation allows neurotrophic and pronociceptive functions of NGF to be split, with interesting implications for the treatment of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Retinal photoreceptor cells contain the highest concentration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in our bodies, and it has been long assumed that this is critical for supporting normal vision. Indeed, early studies using DHA dietary restriction documented reduced light sensitivity by DHA-deprived retinas. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a major route of DHA entry in the retina is the delivery across the blood–retina barrier by the sodium-dependent lipid transporter, Mfsd2a. This discovery opened a unique opportunity to analyze photoreceptor health and function in DHA-deprived retinas using the &lt;i&gt;Mfsd2a&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mouse as animal model. Our lipidome analyses of &lt;i&gt;Mfsd2a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; retinas and outer segment membranes corroborated the previously reported decrease in the fraction of DHA-containing phospholipids and a compensatory increase in phospholipids containing arachidonic acid. We also revealed an increase in the retinal content of monounsaturated fatty acids and a reduction in very long chain fatty acids. These changes could be explained by a combination of reduced DHA supply to the retina and a concomitant upregulation of several fatty acid desaturases controlled by sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factors, which are upregulated in &lt;i&gt;Mfsd2a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; retinas. &lt;i&gt;Mfsd2a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; retinas undergo slow progressive degeneration, with ~30% of photoreceptor cells lost by the age of 6 months. Despite this pathology, the ultrastructure &lt;i&gt;Mfsd2a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; photoreceptors and their ability to produce light responses were essentially normal. These data demonstrate that, whereas maintaining the lysophosphatidylcholine route of DHA supply to the retina is essential for long-term photoreceptor survival, it is not important for supporting normal phototransduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are greatly enriched in the nervous system, with the highest concentration found in the light-sensitive membranes of photoreceptor cells. In this study, we analyzed the consequences of impaired DHA transport across the blood–retina barrier. We have found that, in addition to a predictable reduction in the DHA level, the affected retinas undergo a complex, transcriptionally-driven rebuilding of their membrane lipidome in a pattern preserving the overall saturation/desaturation balance of retinal phospholipids. Remarkably, these changes do not affect the ability of photoreceptors to produce responses to light but are detrimental for the long-term survival of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Principal cells in the olfactory bulb (OB), mitral and tufted cells, play key roles in processing and then relaying sensory information to downstream cortical regions. How OB local circuits facilitate odor-specific responses during odor discrimination is not known but involves GABAergic inhibition mediated by axonless granule cells (GCs), the most abundant interneuron in the OB. Most previous work on GCs has focused on defining properties of distal apical dendrites where these interneurons form reciprocal dendrodendritic connections with principal cells. Less is known about the function of the proximal dendritic compartments. In the present study, we identified the likely action potentials (AP) initiation zone by comparing electrophysiological properties of rat (either sex) GCs with apical dendrites severed at different locations. We find that truncated GCs with long apical dendrites had active properties that were indistinguishable from intact GCs, generating full-height APs and short-latency low-threshold Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes. We then confirmed the presumed site of AP and low-threshold Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spike initiation in the proximal apical dendrite using two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; photometry and focal TTX application. These results suggest that GCs incorporate two separate pathways for processing synaptic inputs: an already established dendrodendritic input to the distal apical dendrite and a novel pathway in which the cell body integrates proximal synaptic inputs, leading to spike generation in the proximal apical dendrite. Spikes generated by the proximal pathway likely enables GCs to regulate lateral inhibition by defining time windows when lateral inhibition is functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The olfactory bulb plays a central role in processing sensory input transduced by receptor neurons. How local circuits in the bulb function to facilitate sensory processing during odor discrimination is not known but appears to involve inhibition mediated by granule cells, axonless GABAergic interneurons. Little is known about the active conductances in granule cells including where action potentials originate. Using a variety of experimental approaches, we find the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based action potentials originate in the proximal apical dendrite, a region targeted by cortical feedback afferents. We also find evidence for high expression of low-voltage activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in the same region, intrinsic currents that enable GCs to spike rapidly in response to sensory input during each sniff cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) is a brain region involved in regulating arousal, goal-oriented behaviors, and drug seeking, all key factors playing a role in substance use disorder. Given this, we investigated the temporal effects of administering morphine, an opioid with strongly addictive properties, on PVT neuronal function in mice using acute brain slices. Here we show that morphine administration and electrophysiological recordings that occur during periods of animal inactivity (light cycle) elicit increases in PVT neuronal function during a 24 h abstinence time point. Furthermore, we show that morphine-induced increases in PVT neuronal activity at 24 h abstinence are occluded when morphine administration and recordings are performed during an animals’ active state (dark cycle). Based on our electrophysiological results combined with previous findings demonstrating that PVT neuronal activity regulates drug-seeking behaviors, we investigated whether timing morphine administration with periods of vigilance (dark cycle) would decrease drug-seeking behaviors in an animal model of substance use disorder. We found that context-induced morphine-seeking behaviors were intact regardless of the time morphine was administered (e.g., light cycle or dark cycle). Our electrophysiological results suggest that timing morphine with various states of arousal may impact the firing of PVT neurons during abstinence. Although, this may not impact context-induced drug-seeking behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Here we show that the timing of morphine administration differentially alters paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neuronal function. Timing morphine administration during an animals’ inactive state increases PVT neuronal activity, while this morphine-induced effect is occluded when morphine administration occurs during an animals’ active state. Given evidence that PVT neuronal activity regulates drug-seeking behaviors, we investigated whether timing morphine administration with periods of vigilance would decrease drug-seeking behaviors in an animal model of substance use disorder. We found that morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was intact regardless of the time morphine was administered. Our results suggest that timing morphine with various states of arousal impacts the firing of PVT neurons during abstinence, but not morphine-induced CPP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The aim of this paper is to investigate various information-theoretic
measures, including entropy, mutual information, and some systematic measures
that based on mutual information, for a class of structured spiking neuronal
network. In order to analyze and compute these information-theoretic measures
for large networks, we coarse-grained the data by ignoring the order of spikes
that fall into the same small time bin. The resultant coarse-grained entropy
mainly capture the information contained in the rhythm produced by a local
population of the network. We first proved that these information theoretical
measures are well-defined and computable by proving the stochastic stability
and the law of large numbers. Then we use three neuronal network examples, from
simple to complex, to investigate these information-theoretic measures. Several
analytical and computational results about properties of these
information-theoretic measures are given.

 &lt;p&gt;To understand potential encoding mechanism of motor cortical neurons for
control commands during reach-to-grasp movements, experiments to record
neuronal activities from primary motor cortical regions have been conducted in
many research laboratories (for example, (7), (17)). The most popular approach
in neuroscience community is to fit the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model
using the firing rates of individual neurons. In addition to consider neural
firing counts but also temporal intervals, (5) proposed to apply Analysis of
Covariance (ANCOVA) model. Due to the nature of the data, in this paper we
propose to apply an integrated method, called heterogeneous Poisson regression
model, to categorize different neural activities. Three scenarios are discussed
to show that the proposed heterogeneous Poisson regression model can overcome
some disadvantages of the traditional Poisson regression model.

 &lt;p&gt;Removing skull artifacts from functional magnetic images (fMRI) is a well
understood and frequently encountered problem. Because the fMRI field has grown
mostly due to human studies, many new tools were developed to handle human
data. Nonetheless, these tools are not equally useful to handle the data
derived from animal studies, especially from rodents. This represents a major
problem to the field because rodent studies generate larger datasets from
larger populations, which implies that preprocessing these images manually to
remove the skull becomes a bottleneck in the data analysis pipeline. In this
study, we address this problem by implementing a neural network based method
that uses a U-Net architecture to segment the brain area into a mask and
removing the skull and other tissues from the image. We demonstrate several
strategies to speed up the process of generating the training dataset using
watershedding and several strategies for data augmentation that allowed to
train faster the U-Net to perform the segmentation. Finally, we deployed the
trained network freely available.

 &lt;p&gt;In the last few years, spiking neural networks have been demonstrated to
perform on par with regular convolutional neural networks. Several works have
proposed methods to convert a pre-trained CNN to a Spiking CNN without a
significant sacrifice of performance. We demonstrate first that
quantization-aware training of CNNs leads to better accuracy in SNNs. One of
the benefits of converting CNNs to spiking CNNs is to leverage the sparse
computation of SNNs and consequently perform equivalent computation at a lower
energy consumption. Here we propose an efficient optimization strategy to train
spiking networks at lower energy consumption, while maintaining similar
accuracy levels. We demonstrate results on the MNIST-DVS and CIFAR-10 datasets.

 &lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks have diverged far from their early inspiration in
neurology. In spite of their technological and commercial success, they have
several shortcomings, most notably the need for a large number of training

learning. Here we describe an approach to neurological network simulation, both
architectural and algorithmic, that adheres more closely to established

 &lt;p&gt;The shared response model provides a simple but effective framework to
analyse fMRI data of subjects exposed to naturalistic stimuli. However when the
number of subjects or runs is large, fitting the model requires a large amount
of memory and computational power, which limits its use in practice. In this
work, we introduce the FastSRM algorithm that relies on an intermediate
atlas-based representation. It provides considerable speed-up in time and
memory usage, hence it allows easy and fast large-scale analysis of
naturalistic-stimulus fMRI data. Using four different datasets, we show that
our method matches the performance of the original SRM algorithm while being
about 5x faster and 20x to 40x more memory efficient. Based on this
contribution, we use FastSRM to predict age from movie watching data on the
CamCAN sample. Besides delivering accurate predictions (mean absolute error of
7.5 years), FastSRM extracts topographic patterns that are predictive of age,
demonstrating that brain activity during free perception reflects age.

 &lt;p&gt;We develop a method to investigate the effect of noise timescales on the
first-passage time of nonlinear oscillators. Using Fredholm theory, we derive
an exact integral equation for the mean event rate of a
leaky-integrate-and-fire oscillator that receives constant input and temporally
correlated noise. Furthermore, we show that Fredholm theory provides a unified
framework to determine system scaling behavior for small and large noise
timescales. In this framework, the leading order and higher-order asymptotic
corrections for slow and fast noise are naturally emerging. We show the scaling
behavior in the both limits are not reciprocal. We discuss further how this
approach can be extended to study the first-passage time in a general class of
nonlinear oscillators driven by colored noise at arbitrary timescales.

 &lt;p&gt;Humans have the ability to report the contents of their subjective experience
- we can say to each other, &quot;I am aware of X&quot;. The decision processes that
support these reports about mental contents remain poorly understood. In this
article I propose a computational framework that characterises awareness
reports as metacognitive decisions (inference) about a generative model of
perceptual content. This account is motivated from the perspective of how
flexible hierarchical state spaces are built during learning and
decision-making. Internal states supporting awareness reports, unlike those
covarying with perceptual contents, are simple and abstract, varying along a
one-dimensional continuum from absent to present. A critical feature of this
architecture is that it is both higher-order and asymmetric: a vast number of
perceptual states is nested under &quot;present&quot;, but a much smaller number of
possible states nested under &quot;absent&quot;. Via simulations I show that this
asymmetry provides a natural account of observations of &quot;global ignition&quot; in
brain imaging studies of awareness reports.

 &lt;p&gt;Critical brain hypothesis has been intensively studied both in experimental and theoretical neuroscience over the past two decades. However, some important questions still remain: (i) What is the critical point the brain operates at? (ii) What is the regulatory mechanism that brings about and maintains such a critical state? (iii) The critical state is characterized by scale-invariant behavior which is seemingly at odds with definitive brain oscillations? In this work we consider a biologically motivated model of Izhikevich neuronal network with chemical synapses interacting via spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as well as axonal time delay. Under generic and physiologically relevant conditions we show that the system is organized and maintained around a synchronization transition point as opposed to an activity transition point associated with an absorbing state phase transition. However, such a state exhibits experimentally relevant signs of critical dynamics including scale-free avalanches with finite-size scaling as well as critical branching ratios. While the system displays stochastic oscillations with highly correlated fluctuations, it also displays dominant frequency modes seen as sharp peaks in the power spectrum. The role of STDP as well as time delay is crucial in achieving and maintaining such critical dynamics, while the role of inhibition is not as crucial. In this way we provide possible answers to all three questions posed above. We also show that one can achieve supercritical or subcritical dynamics if one changes the average time delay associated with axonal conduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The transient receptor potential cation channel, vanilloid type (TRPV) 3, is a member of the TRPV subfamily that is expressed predominantly in the skin, hair follicles, and gastrointestinal tract. It is also distributed in the organ of Corti of the inner ear and colocalizes with TRPV1 or TRPV4, but its role in auditory function is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that TRPV3 is expressed in inner hair cells (HCs) but mainly in cochlear outer HCs in mice, with expression limited to the cytoplasm and not detected in stereocilia. We compared the number of HCs as well as distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds between TRPV3 knockout (V3KO) and wild-type (V3WT) mice and found that although most mutants (72.3%) had normal hearing, a significant proportion (27.7%) showed impaired hearing associated with loss of cochlear HCs. Compensatory upregulation of TRPV4 in HCs prevented HC damage and kanamycin-induced hearing loss and preserved normal auditory function in most of these mice. Thus, TRPV4 and TRPV3 in cochlear HCs protect hearing in mice; moreover, the results suggest some functional redundancy in the functions of TRPV family members. Our findings provide novel insight into the molecular basis of auditory function in mammals that can be applied to the development of strategies to mitigate hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are subterranean rodents that utilize their incisors for feeding, chisel-tooth digging of complex tunnel systems, social interactions, and defense in their eusocial colony structure. Previous studies have shown that naked mole-rats have morphological and anatomical adaptations that predict strong bite forces, namely, skulls that are relatively tall and wide, in addition to impressive masticatory musculature. However, no studies to date have directly measured bite force in this species or analyzed the relationship between bite force and social caste. In the current study, we assessed adult naked mole-rat maximum bite force in relation to body mass, in addition to considering each animal’s position within the eusocial hierarchy (i.e., dominant versus subordinate). Each animal was permitted to freely interact with a piezo-resistive bite force sensor. Our results showed that bite force was correlated with body mass in subordinate but not in dominant naked mole-rats, and that subordinate animals exhibited a shorter latency in producing their first bite. Maximum bite force was significantly influenced by caste. In comparing bite force with available data from previous studies across 82 additional mammalian species, subordinate naked mole-rats exhibited a bite force that was 65% higher than predicted for their body size, comparable to Tasmanian devils and exceeding bite force values for all of the carnivorans included for comparison. These results supported the hypothesis that the naked mole-rat’s bite force would exceed predictions based on body size due to the behavioral importance and specialization of the naked mole-rat incisors. This study provides insight into the differences in bite force across species, and the significant role that social and ecological factors might play in the evolutionary relationship between bite force performance and underlying anatomical structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Several electrophysiological parameters, including the auditory evoked response component M50/M100 latencies and the phase synchrony of transient and steady-state gamma-band oscillations have been implicated as atypical (to various extents) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Furthermore, some hypotheses suggest that an underlying neurobiological mechanism for these observations might be atypical local circuit function indexed by atypical levels of inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, escalating-dose, acute investigation conducted in 25 14–18 year-old adolescents with ASD. The study assessed the sensitivity of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and MEGAPRESS “GABA” magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor dose-dependent acute effects, as well as seeking to define properties of the pre-drug “baseline” electrophysiological and GABA signatures that might predict responsiveness to the GABA-B agonist, arbaclofen (STX-209). Overall, GABA levels and gamma-band oscillatory activity showed no acute changes at either low (15 mg) or high (30 mg) dose. Evoked M50 response latency measures tended to shorten (normalize), but there was heterogeneity across the group in M50 latency response, with only a subset of participants (n = 6) showing significant M50 latency shortening, and only at the 15 mg dose. Findings thus suggest that MEG M50 latency measures show acute effects of arbaclofen administration in select individuals, perhaps reflecting effective target engagement. Whether these subjects have a greater trend towards clinical benefit remains to be established. Finally, findings also provide preliminary support for the use of objective electrophysiological measures upon which to base inclusion for optimal enrichment of populations to be included in full-scale clinical trials of arbaclofen.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessels feed and protect the brain parenchyma thanks to the unique features of the blood–brain barrier. Cerebrovascular dysfunction is therefore seen as a detrimental factor for the initiation of several central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as stroke, cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), and Alzheimer’s disease. The main working hypothesis linking cerebrovascular dysfunction to brain disorders includes the contribution of neuroinflammation. While our knowledge on microglia cells – the brain-resident immune cells – has been increasing in the last decades, the specific populations of microglia and macrophages surrounding brain vessels, vessel-associated microglia (VAM), and perivascular macrophages (PVMs), respectively, have been overlooked. This review aims to summarize the knowledge gathered on VAM and PVMs, to discuss existing knowledge gaps of importance for later studies and to summarize evidences for their contribution to cerebrovascular dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dysfunction in neurovascular coupling that results in a mismatch between cerebral blood flow and neuronal activity has been suggested to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Meanwhile, physical exercise is a powerful approach for maintaining cognitive health and could play a preventive role against the progression of AD. Given the fundamental role of capillaries in oxygen transport to tissue, our pilot study aimed to characterize changes in capillary hemodynamics with AD and AD supplemented by exercise. Exploiting two-photon microscopy, intrinsic signal optical imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging, we found hemodynamic alterations and lower vascular density with AD that were reversed by exercise. We further observed that capillary properties were branch order-dependent and that stimulation-evoked changes were attenuated with AD but increased by exercise. Our study provides novel indications into cerebral microcirculatory disturbances with AD and the modulating role of voluntary exercise on these alterations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by increased impulsivity, which is multifactorial and can be assessed by tests like the delay discounting, Go-Nogo, and stop signal task (SST). Impulsivity has been related to poor treatment outcomes in substance use disorders, including AUD. In order to decrease impulsivity or improve inhibitory control, high frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has gained interest. Studies applying HF-rTMS over the DLPFC of individuals suffering from AUD assessing its effects on impulsivity measures are scarce, and results are inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The current study (registered in Netherlands Trial Register with trial number 5291: https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/5151) applied 10 sessions of HF-rTMS [sixty 10 Hz trains of 5 s at 110% motor threshold (MT)] over the right DLPFC of 80 alcohol dependent patients in clinical treatment on 10 consecutive workdays. At baseline, halfway and after the HF-rTMS treatment, the delay discounting, Go-NoGo, and SST were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Ten sessions of HF-rTMS over the right DLPFC versus sham HF-rTMS did not affect performance on the delay discounting, Go-NoGo, and SSTs. A significant effect of age was found for the Go-NoGo task, with higher age associated with better performance. Furthermore, no significant correlations were found between difference scores of task performance and baseline impulsivity or severity of AUD.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Results of this study, in combination with other studies using HF-rTMS studies in alcohol and substance use disorder, indicate mixed and inconclusive findings of HF-rTMS on impulsivity. Future studies within patient groups hospitalized at the same department are recommended to consider using a sham coil that mimics the sensations on the scalp of active HF-rTMS and to measure motivation across test sessions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Vicarious reward is a phenomenon in which an individual feels as if he/she has received a reward as the result of watching someone else receive a reward. In this study, we used electroencephalography to investigate brain activity while participants watched a preferred player win a competitive game (Rock-Paper-Scissors game). In the experimental task, movie clips showed right hand of the two players and played Rock-Paper-Scissors game. We asked participants to explicitly support or “cheer” for a specific player, and then examined brain activity associated with vicarious reward. For the observed hand movement, previous findings showed that the event-related desynchronization of mu band (8–14 Hz) appeared at the contra-lateral central electrode to the observed hand (If someone sees the right-hand movement, the left central electrode shows the event-related desynchronization of mu-band). During observation of the player, we detected event-related desynchronization of mu band activity in the contra-lateral central electrode as well as mid-frontal beta band (15–22 Hz) activation when the preferred player won. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed a strong phase synchronization between the contra-lateral central electrode and mid-frontal electrode in the mu band when participants received the vicarious reward. Cross-frequency coupling analysis revealed functional integration between the mu and beta bands at mid-frontal electrode. These results indicate the interaction of mu band observed at contra-lateral electrode and beta band observed at mid-frontal electrode coupling, suggesting a link between the mirror neuron system and the reward system during vicarious reward.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Bioelectric oscillations occur throughout the nervous system of nearly all animals, revealed to play an important role in various aspects of cognitive activity such as information processing and feature binding. Modern research into this dynamic and intrinsic bioelectric activity of neural cells continues to raise questions regarding their role in consciousness and cognition. In this theoretical article, we assert a novel interpretation of the hierarchical nature of “brain waves” by identifying that the superposition of multiple oscillations varying in frequency corresponds to the superimposing of the contents of consciousness and cognition. In order to describe this isomorphism, we present a layered model of the global functional oscillations of various frequencies which act as a part of a unified metastable continuum described by the Operational Architectonics theory and suggested to be responsible for the emergence of the phenomenal mind. We detail the purposes, functions, and origins of each layer while proposing our main theory that the superimposition of these oscillatory layers mirrors the superimposition of the components of the integrated phenomenal experience as well as of cognition. In contrast to the traditional view that localizations of high and low-frequency activity are spatially distinct, many authors have suggested a hierarchical nature to oscillations. Our theoretical interpretation is founded in four layers which correlate not only in frequency but in evolutionary development. As other authors have done, we explore how these layers correlate to the phenomenology of human experience. Special importance is placed on the most basal layer of slow oscillations in coordinating and grouping all of the other layers. By detailing the isomorphism between the phenomenal and physiologic aspects of how lower frequency layers provide a foundation for higher frequency layers to be organized upon, we provide a further means to elucidate physiological and cognitive mechanisms of mind and for the well-researched outcomes of certain voluntary breathing patterns and meditative practices which modulate the mind and have therapeutic effects for psychiatric and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Collision sports, such as Rugby Union (“Rugby”) have a particularly high risk of injury. Of all injuries common to collision sports, concussions have received the most attention due to the potentially negative cognitive effects in the short- and long-term. Despite non-professional Rugby players comprising the majority of the world’s playing population, there is relatively little research in this population. Stellenbosch Rugby Football Club (“Maties”), the official rugby club of Stellenbosch University, represents one of the world’s largest non-professional Rugby clubs, making this an ideal cohort for community-level injury surveillance. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and events associated with concussion in this cohort. Baseline demographics were obtained on the 807 male student Rugby non-professional players who registered for the 10-week long 2018 season, which comprised 101 matches and 2,915 of exposure hours. All match-related injuries were captured by the medical staff of Stellenbosch Campus Health Service on an electronic form developed from the consensus statement for injury recording in Rugby. The mean age, height and weight of this cohort were 20 ± 2 years, 182 ± 7 cm and 88 ± 14 kg, respectively. Overall, there were 89 time-loss injuries, which equated to an injury rate of 30.6 per 1,000 match hours [95% confidence intervals (CIs): 24.2–36.9], or about one injury per match. The most common injury diagnosis was “concussion” (n = 27 out of 90 injuries, 30%), at a rate of 9.3 per 1,000 match hours (95% CIs: 5.8–12.8). The three most common mechanisms of concussion in the present study were performing a tackle (33%), accidental collision (30%) and being tackled (11%). Concussion was the most common injury in this population, at a rate that was six times higher than the most comparable study from the UK, which had far more exposure time over six seasons and wider range of player ability, from recreational to semi-professional. This might be explained by the training and vigilance of the club’s first aiders observing all matches for concussion. Future studies should try to explain this high rate and subsequently reduce these concussions. The addition of video surveillance data would assist in identifying the etiology of these concussions injuries in order to develop specific targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuroactive estrogenic and androgenic steroids influence synaptic transmission, finely modulating synaptic plasticity in several brain regions including the hippocampus. While estrogens facilitate long-term potentiation (LTP), androgens are involved in the induction of long-term depression (LTD) and depotentiation (DP) of synaptic transmission. To examine sex neurosteroid-dependent LTP and LTD in single cells, patch-clamp recordings from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of male rats and selective antagonists for estrogen receptors (ERs) and androgen (AR) receptors were used. LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) depended on activation of ERs since it was prevented by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 in most of the neurons. Application of the selective antagonists for ERα (MPP) or ERβ (PHTPP) caused a reduction of the LTP amplitude, while these antagonists in combination, prevented LTP completely. LTP was never affected by blocking AR with the specific antagonist flutamide. Conversely, LTD and DP, elicited by low-frequency stimulation (LFS), were impeded by flutamide, but not by ICI 182,780, in most neurons. In few cells, LTD was even reverted to LTP by flutamide. Moreover, the combined application of both ER and AR antagonists completely prevented both LTP and LTD/DP in the same neuron. The current study demonstrates that the activation of ERs is necessary for inducing LTP in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, whereas the activation of ARs is required for LTD and DP. Moreover, both estrogen- and androgen-dependent LTP and LTD can be expressed in the same pyramidal neurons, suggesting that the activation of sex neurosteroids signaling pathways is responsible for bidirectional synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Physical activity may attenuate age-related cognitive decline by improving cerebrovascular function. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate effects of aerobic exercise training on cerebral blood flow (CBF), which is a sensitive physiological marker of cerebrovascular function, in sedentary older men.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seventeen apparently healthy men, aged 60–70 years and with a BMI between 25 and 35 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, were included in a randomized, controlled cross-over trial. Study participants were randomly allocated to a fully-supervised, progressive, aerobic exercise training or no-exercise control period for 8 weeks, separated by a 12-week wash-out period. Measurements at the end of each period included aerobic fitness evaluated using peak oxygen consumption during incremental exercise (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;), CBF measured with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging, and post-load glucose responses determined using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Furthermore, cognitive performance was assessed in the domains of executive function, memory, and psychomotor speed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt; significantly increased following aerobic exercise training compared to no-exercise control by 262 ± 236 mL (P &amp;lt; 0.001). CBF was increased by 27% bilaterally in the frontal lobe, particularly the subcallosal and anterior cingulate gyrus (cluster volume: 1008 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; P &amp;lt; 0.05), while CBF was reduced by 19% in the right medial temporal lobe, mainly temporal fusiform gyrus (cluster volume: 408 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; P &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean post-load glucose concentrations determined using an OGTT decreased by 0.33 ± 0.63 mmol/L (P = 0.049). Furthermore, executive function improved as the latency of response was reduced by 5% (P = 0.034), but no changes were observed in memory or psychomotor speed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Aerobic exercise training improves regional CBF in sedentary older men. These changes in CBF may underlie exercise-induced beneficial effects on executive function, which could be partly mediated by improvements in glucose metabolism. This clinical trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03272061.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;An ancestral inversion of 900 kb on chromosome 17q21, which includes the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene, defines two haplotype clades in Caucasians (H1 and H2). The H1 haplotype has been linked inconsistently with AD. In a previous study, we showed that an SNP tagging this haplotype (rs1800547) was associated with AD risk in a large population from the Dementia Genetics Spanish Consortium (DEGESCO) including 4435 cases and 6147 controls. The association was mainly driven by individuals that were non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele. Our aim was to replicate our previous findings in an independent sample of 4124 AD cases and 3290 controls from Spain (GR@ACE project) and to analyze the effect of the H1 sub-haplotype structure on the risk of AD. The H1 haplotype was associated with AD risk (OR = 1.12; p = 0.0025). Stratification analysis showed that this association was mainly driven by the APOE ε4 non-carriers (OR = 1.15; p = 0.0022). Pooled analysis of both Spanish datasets (n = 17,996) showed that the highest AD risk related to the MAPT H1/H2 haplotype was in those individuals that were the oldest [third tertile (&amp;gt;77 years)] and did not carry APOE ε4 allele (p = 0.001). We did not find a significant association between H1 sub-haplotypes and AD. H1c was nominally associated but lost statistical significance after adjusting by population sub-structure. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic variants linked to the MAPT H1/H2 are tracking a genuine risk allele for AD. The fact that this association is stronger in APOE ε4 non-carriers partially explains previous controversial results and might be related to a slower alternative causal pathway less dependent on brain amyloid load.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Previously we identified Lam/GramD1 proteins, a family of endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins with sterol-binding StARkin domains (Gatta et al. eLife 2015), which are implicated in intracellular sterol homeostasis. Here we show how these proteins exchange sterol molecules with membranes. An aperture at one end of the StARkin domain enables sterol to enter/exit the binding pocket. Strikingly, the wall of the pocket is longitudinally fractured, exposing bound sterol to solvent. Large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that sterol egress involves widening of the fracture, penetration of water into the cavity and consequent destabilization of the bound sterol. The simulations identify polar residues along the fracture that are important for sterol release. Their replacement with alanine affects the ability of the StARkin domain to bind sterol, catalyze inter-vesicular sterol exchange and alleviate the nystatin-sensitivity of &lt;i&gt;lam2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; yeast cells. These data suggest an unprecedented, water-controlled mechanism of sterol discharge from a StARkin domain.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Appropriate regulation of autophagy is crucial for clearing toxic proteins from cells. Defective autophagy results in accumulation of toxic protein aggregates that detrimentally affect cellular function and organismal survival. Here, we report that the microRNA miR-1 regulates the autophagy pathway through conserved targeting of the orthologous &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;re-2/&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;ub2/&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;DC16 (TBC) Rab GTPase-activating proteins TBC-7 and TBC1D15 in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans &lt;/i&gt;and mammalian cells, respectively. Loss of miR-1 causes TBC-7/TBC1D15 overexpression, leading to a block on autophagy. Further, we found that the cytokine interferon-b (IFN-b) can induce miR-1 expression in mammalian cells, reducing TBC1D15 levels, and safeguarding against proteotoxic challenges. Therefore, this work provides a potential therapeutic strategy for protein aggregation disorders.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Constraint-based modelling (CBM) is a powerful tool for the analysis of evolutionary trajectories. Evolution, especially evolution in the distant past, is not easily accessible to laboratory experimentation. Modelling can provide a window into evolutionary processes by allowing the examination of selective pressures which lead to particular optimal solutions in the model. To study the evolution of C4 photosynthesis from a ground state of C3 photosynthesis, we initially construct a C3 model. After duplication into two cells to reflect typical C4 leaf architecture, we allow the model to predict the optimal metabolic solution under various conditions. The model thus identifies resource limitation in conjunction with high photorespiratory flux as a selective pressure relevant to the evolution of C4. It also predicts that light availability and distribution play a role in guiding the evolutionary choice of possible decarboxylation enzymes. The data shows evolutionary CBM in eukaryotes predicts molecular evolution with precision.</content>

Pain is a hallmark of inflammation and can be either protective or detrimental during acute or chronic phase. Macrophages play a chief role in the pathogenesis of pain and have bilateral communications with nociceptors, the specialized primary sensory neurons that sense pain. Macrophages ‘talk to’ nociceptors by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines) that induce pain via direct activation of nociceptors. Macrophages also ‘listen to’ nociceptors, by which nociceptors secrete neuropeptides and chemokines which act on macrophages. Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in nociceptors releases CCL2, activating macrophages and potentiating pathological pain. Emerging evidence also points to a pro-resolution role of macrophages in inflammation and pain. Macrophage GPR37 is activated by neuroprotectin D1, a specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) and resolves inflammatory pain via phagocytosis and production of IL-10 that inhibits nociceptors. Macrophage-nociceptor interactions are also mediated by microRNAs and microRNA-containing exosomes in chronic pain. Notably, extracellular microRNAs (e.g. let-7b and miR-711) can directly bind and activate nociceptors. Targeting macrophage-nociceptor interactions will help to control inflammation and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

The contribution of these factors in shaping the gut microbiota and the subsequent effects on the prevention and development of stroke has been under intense investigation. Furthermore, several reports have uncovered the impact of stroke on intestinal dysfunction and gut dysbiosis, highlighting the delicate interplay between the brain, gut and microbiome following this acute brain injury. Despite our growing appreciation of the gut microbiota in shaping brain health, the immune system, host metabolism and disease progression, its therapeutic capability in stroke is yet to be fully exploited. This review will explore the microbiota-gut-brain axis in stroke, and examine the potential role of the gut microbiota in the onset, progression and recovery phase of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

In contrast to most vertebrates, insects usually must cope with low resolution retinal images and the inability to infer spatial features using accommodation or stereovision. However, during locomotion, the retinal input is dominated by characteristic panoramic image shifts, termed optic flow, that depend on self-motion parameters and environmental features. Therefore, optic flow provides a rich source of information guiding locomotion speed as well as the position and orientation of animals over time relative to their surroundings. Here, focusing on flight behavior, we describe the strategies and putative underlying neuronal mechanisms by which insects control their course through processing of visual motion cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Adolescent binge drinking is a serious public health concern and a risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and comorbid anxiety in adulthood. Chromatin remodeling mediated by epigenetic enzymes including lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) due to adolescent alcohol exposure may play a role in adult psychopathology. The mechanism by which adolescent alcohol exposure mechanistically regulates epigenetic reprogramming and behavioral changes in adulthood is unknown. We investigated the role of microRNA-137 (miR-137), which is crucial for normal neurodevelopment and targets LSD1, in adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure-induced anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors and related epigenetic reprogramming in the amygdala in adulthood. Adolescent rats were exposed to 2 g/kg ethanol (2 d on/off; AIE) or adolescent intermittent saline (AIS) during postnatal days (PND)28–PND41 and allowed to grow to adulthood for analysis of behavior, miRNA expression, and epigenetic measures in the amygdala. Interestingly, miR-137 was increased and its target genes &lt;i&gt;Lsd1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lsd1 + 8a&lt;/i&gt; were decreased in the AIE adult amygdala. Infusion of miR-137 antagomir directly into the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) rescues AIE-induced alcohol-drinking and anxiety-like behaviors via normalization of decreased &lt;i&gt;Lsd1&lt;/i&gt; expression, decreased LSD1 occupancy, and decreased &lt;i&gt;Bdnf IV&lt;/i&gt; expression due to increased H3K9 dimethylation in AIE adult rats. Further, concomitant &lt;i&gt;Lsd1&lt;/i&gt; small interfering RNA (siRNA) infusion into the CeA prevents the miR-137-mediated reversal of AIE-induced adult anxiety and chromatin remodeling at the &lt;i&gt;Bdnf IV&lt;/i&gt; promoter. These novel results highlight miR-137 as a potential therapeutic target for anxiety and AUD susceptibility after adolescent alcohol exposure in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common source of intellectual disability and autism. Extensive studies have been performed on the network and behavioral correlates of the syndrome, but our knowledge about intrinsic conductance changes is still limited. In this study, we show a differential effect of FMRP knockout in different subsections of hippocampus using whole-cell patch clamp in mouse hippocampal slices. We observed no significant change in spike numbers in the CA1 region of hippocampus, but a significant increase in CA3, in juvenile mice. However, in adult mice we see a reduction in spike number in the CA1 with no significant difference in CA3. In addition, we see increased variability in spike numbers in CA1 cells following a variety of steady and modulated current step protocols. This effect emerges in adult mice (8 weeks) but not juvenile mice (4 weeks). This increased spiking variability was correlated with reduced spike number and with elevated AHP. The increased AHP arose from elevated SK currents (small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels), but other currents involved in medium AHP, such as &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and M, were not significantly different. We obtained a partial rescue of the cellular variability phenotype when we blocked SK current using the specific blocker apamin. Our observations provide a single-cell correlate of the network observations of response variability and loss of synchronization, and suggest that the elevation of SK currents in FXS may provide a partial mechanistic explanation for this difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the ASC‐1 complex has been identified as a mechanistic link between ALS and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and three mutations of the ASC‐1 gene &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt; have been associated with SMA or congenital myopathy. Our goal was to define ASC‐1 neuromuscular function and the phenotypical spectrum associated with &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt; mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical, molecular, histological and MRI studies in 5 families with 7 novel &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt; mutations. FACS and Western blot in patient‐derived fibroblasts and muscles and in &lt;i&gt;Trip4&lt;/i&gt; knocked‐down C2C12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All mutations caused ASC‐1 protein depletion. The clinical phenotype was purely myopathic, ranging from lethal neonatal to mild ambulatory adult patients. It included early‐onset axial and proximal weakness, scoliosis, rigid spine, dysmorphic facies, cutaneous involvement, respiratory failure and, in the older cases, dilated cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies showed multiminicores, nemaline rods, cytoplasmic bodies, caps, central nuclei, rimmed fibers and/or mild endomysial fibrosis. ASC‐1 depletion in C2C12 and in patient‐derived fibroblasts and muscles caused accelerated proliferation, altered expression of cell cycle proteins and/or shortening of the G0/G1 cell cycle phase leading to cell size reduction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results expand the phenotypical and molecular spectrum of &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt;‐associated disease to include mild adult forms with or without cardiomyopathy, associate ASC‐1 depletion with primary pure muscle involvement and establish &lt;i&gt;TRIP4&lt;/i&gt; as a causative gene for several congenital muscle diseases including nemaline, core, centronuclear or cytoplasmic‐body myopathies. They also identify ASC‐1 as a novel cell cycle regulator with a key role in cell proliferation, and underline transcriptional co‐regulation defects as a novel pathophysiological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Neural codes are lists of subsets of neurons that fire together. Of
particular interest are neurons called place cells, which fire when an animal
is in specific, usually convex regions in space. A fundamental question,
therefore, is to determine which neural codes arise from the regions of some
collection of open convex sets or closed convex sets in Euclidean space. This
work focuses on how these two classes of codes -- open convex and closed convex
codes -- are related. As a starting point, open convex codes have a desirable
monotonicity property, but here we show that closed convex codes do not possess
the same property. We additionally show that, even for 3-sparse codes, closed
convexity is not equivalent to avoiding local obstructions to convexity.
Finally, we disprove a conjecture of Goldrup and Phillipson, and then present
an example of a code that is neither open convex nor closed convex.

 &lt;p&gt;A procedure is developed and tested to enforce synchronicity in a family of
Stuart-Landau oscillators, coupled through a symmetric network. The proposed
method exploits network plasticity, as an inherent non autonomous drive. More
specifically, we assume that the system is initially confined on a network
which turns the underlying homogeneous synchronous state unstable. A properly
engineered network can be always generated, which links the same set of nodes,
and allows for synchronicity to be eventually restored, upon performing
continuously swappings, at a sufficient rate, between the two aforementioned
networks. The result is cast in rigorous terms, as follows an application of
the average theorem and the critical swapping rate determined analytically.

 &lt;p&gt;Deep-Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a therapy used in conjunction with medication
to help alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, the
monitoring and adjustment of DBS settings is tedious and expensive, requiring
long programming appointments every few months. We investigated the possible
correlation between PD motor score severity and digitally extracted patient
voice features to potentially aid clinicians in their monitoring and treatment
of PD with DBS, and eventually enable a closed-loop DBS system. 5 DBS PD
patients were enrolled. Voice samples were collected for various voice tasks
(single phoneme vocalization, free speech task, sentence reading task, counting
backward task, categorical fluency task) for DBS ON and OFF states. Motor
scores per the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were also
collected for DBS ON and OFF states. Voice samples were then analyzed to
extract voice features using publicly available voice feature library sets, and
statistically compared for DBS ON and OFF. Of the feature categories explored
(Acoustic, Prosodic, Linguistic) 6 features from the GeMAPS feature set for
acoustic features demonstrated significant differences with DBS ON and OFF
(p&amp;lt;0.05). Prosodic features such as pause length/percentage were found to be
negatively correlated with increased motor symptom severity. Non-significant
differences were found for linguistic features. These findings provide
preliminary evidence for acoustic and prosodic speech features to act as
potential biomarkers for PD disease severity in DBS patients. We hope to
explore further by expanding our data set, identifying other features, applying
machine learning models, and working towards a closed-loop DBS system that can
auto-tune itself based on changes in a patient's voice.

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Three perceptually orthogonal auditory dimensions for
multidimensional and multivariate data sonification are identified and
experimentally validated. Background: Psychoacoustic investigations have shown
that orthogonal acoustical parameters may interfere perceptually. The
literature hardly offers any solutions to this problem, and previous auditory
display approaches have failed to implement auditory dimensions that are
perceived orthogonally by a user. In this study we demonstrate how a location
in three-dimensional space can be sonified unambiguously by the implementation
of perceptually orthogonal psychoacoustic attributes in monophonic playback.
Method: Perceptually orthogonal auditory attributes are identified from
literature research and experience in music and psychoacoustic research. We
carried out an experiment with 21 participants who identified sonified
locations in two-dimensional space. Results: With just 5 minutes of explanation
and exploration, naive users can interpret our multidimensional sonification
with high accuracy. Conclusion: We identified a set of perceptually orthogonal
auditory dimensions suitable for three-dimensional data sonification.
Application: Three-dimensional data sonification promises blind navigation,
e.g. for unmanned vehicles, and reliable real-time monitoring of multivariate
data, e.g., in the patient care sector.

 &lt;p&gt;Multimodal integration is an important process in perceptual decision-making.
In humans, this process has often been shown to be statistically optimal, or
near optimal: sensory information is combined in a fashion that minimises the
average error in perceptual representation of stimuli. However, sometimes there
are costs that come with the optimization, manifesting as illusory percepts. We
review audio-visual facilitations and illusions that are products of
multisensory integration, and the computational models that account for these
phenomena. In particular, the same optimal computational model can lead to
illusory percepts, and we suggest that more studies should be needed to detect
and mitigate these illusions, as artefacts in artificial cognitive systems. We
provide cautionary considerations when designing artificial cognitive systems
with the view of avoiding such artefacts. Finally, we suggest avenues of
research towards solutions to potential pitfalls in system design. We conclude
that detailed understanding of multisensory integration and the mechanisms
behind audio-visual illusions can benefit the design of artificial cognitive
systems.

 &lt;p&gt;Diverse subfields of neuroscience have enriched artificial intelligence for
many decades. With recent advances in machine learning and artificial neural
networks, many neuroscientists are partnering with AI researchers and machine
learning experts to analyze data and construct models. This paper attempts to
demonstrate the value of such collaborations by providing examples of how
insights derived from neuroscience research are helping to develop new machine
learning algorithms and artificial neural network architectures. We survey the
relevant neuroscience necessary to appreciate these insights and then describe
how we can translate our current understanding of the relevant neurobiology
into algorithmic techniques and architectural designs. Finally, we characterize
some of the major challenges facing current AI technology and suggest avenues
for overcoming these challenges that draw upon research in developmental and
comparative cognitive neuroscience.

 &lt;p&gt;The advent of large-scale and high-density extracellular recording devices
allows simultaneous recording from thousands of neurons. However, the
complexity and size of the data makes it mandatory to develop robust algorithms

 &lt;p&gt;Clusters of neurons can communicate with others through the cross-frequency coupling mechanism of oscillatory synchrony. We addressed the hypothesis that neuronal networks at various levels from micro- to macrocircuits implement this communication strategy. An abundance of local recurrent axons of vagal complex (VC) cells establish dense local microcircuits and seem to generate high-frequency noise-causing stochastic resonance (reverberation) and coherence resonance, even in in vitro slice preparations. These phenomena were observed in vitro as the generation of episodes of higher-frequency noise after an external stimulation and as stimulus-induced or spontaneous high-amplitude signals (postsynaptic activities). The in vitro microcircuit networks rarely sustained the stochastic resonance and coherence resonance cooperatively; however, in vivo networks involving additional intrabulbar mesocircuits and large-scale macrocircuits were able to sustain them cooperatively. This gave rise to large-scale oscillatory synchrony leading to robust power and coherence of signals with high amplitudes, reaching several millivolts in amplitude from a noise level of ~100 microV through cardiorespiratory frequency coupling. A regenerative mechanism of neuronal circuits might work for the generation of large-scale oscillatory synchrony. The amplitude and phase of neuronal activity in vivo may interact cooperatively to give rise to varying degrees of power and coherence of robust rhythmic activity for distinct physiological roles. The cooperative interaction between phase adaptation and amplitude amplification of neuronal activity may provide diverse nervous systems with both robustness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;BK Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are important regulators of membrane excitability. Multiple regulatory mechanisms tailor BK current properties across tissues, such as alternative splicing, posttranslational modifications, and auxiliary subunits. Another potential mechanism for modulating BK channel activity is genetic variation due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The gene encoding the human BK α subunit, KCNMA1, contains hundreds of SNPs. However, the variation in BK channel activity due to SNPs is not well studied. Here, we screened the effects of four SNPs (A138V, C495G, N599D, and R800W) on BK currents in HEK293T cells, selected based on predicted protein pathogenicity or disease linkage. We found that the SNPs C495G and R800W had the largest effects on BK currents, affecting the conductance–voltage relationship across multiple Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conditions in the context of two BK channel splice variants. In symmetrical K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, C495G shifted the V&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; to more hyperpolarized potentials (by −15 to −20 mV) and accelerated activation, indicating C495G confers some gain-of-function properties. R800W shifted the V&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; to more depolarized potentials (+15 to +35 mV) and slowed activation, conferring loss-of-function properties. Moreover, the C495G and R800W effects on current properties were found to persist with posttranslational modifications. In contrast, A138V and N599D had smaller and more variable effects on current properties. Neither application of alkaline phosphatase to patches, which results in increased BK channel activity attributed to channel dephosphorylation, nor bidirectional redox modulations completely abrogated SNP effects on BK currents. Lastly, in physiological K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, C495G increased the amplitude of action potential (AP)-evoked BK currents, while R800W had a more limited effect. However, the introduction of R800W in parallel with the epilepsy-linked mutation D434G (D434G/R800W) decreased the amplitude of AP-evoked BK currents compared with D434G alone. These results suggest that in a physiological context, C495G could increase BK activation, while the effects of the loss-of-function SNP R800W could oppose the gain-of-function effects of an epilepsy-linked mutation. Together, these results implicate naturally occurring human genetic variation as a potential modifier of BK channel activity across a variety of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transgenic animal models are invaluable research tools for elucidating the pathways and mechanisms involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Mechanistic clues can be revealed by applying labelling techniques such as immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridisation to brain tissue sections. Precision in both assigning anatomical location to the sections and quantifying labelled features is crucial for output validity, with a stereological approach or image-based feature extraction typically used. However, both approaches are restricted by the need to manually delineate anatomical regions. To circumvent this limitation, we present the QUINT workflow for quantification and spatial analysis of labelling in series of rodent brain section images based on available 3D reference atlases. The workflow is semi-automated, combining three open source software that can be operated without scripting knowledge, making it accessible to most researchers. As an example, a brain region-specific quantification of amyloid plaques across whole transgenic Tg2576 mouse brain series, immunohistochemically labelled for three amyloid-related antigens is demonstrated. First, the whole brain image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to produce customised atlas maps adapted to match the cutting plan and proportions of the sections (QuickNII software). Second, the labelling was segmented from the original images by the Random Forest Algorithm for supervised classification (ilastik software). Finally, the segmented images and atlas maps were used to generate plaque quantifications for each region in the reference atlas (Nutil software). The method yielded comparable results to manual delineations and to the output of a stereological method. While the use case demonstrates the QUINT workflow for quantification of amyloid plaques only, the workflow is suited to all mouse or rat brain series with labelling that is visually distinct from the background, for example for the quantification of cells or labelled proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electrocorticography (ECoG) holds promise to provide efficient neuroprosthetic solutions for people suffering from neurological disabilities. This recording technique combines adequate temporal and spatial resolution with the lower risks of medical complications compared to the other invasive methods. ECoG is routinely used in clinical practice for preoperative cortical mapping in epileptic patients. During the last two decades, research utilizing ECoG has considerably grown, including the paradigms where behaviorally relevant information is extracted from ECoG activity with decoding algorithms of different complexity. Several research groups have advanced toward the development of assistive devices driven by brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode motor commands from multichannel ECoG recordings. Here we review the evolution of this field and its recent tendencies, and discuss the potential areas for future development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dysfunction of retinal glial cells, particularly Müller cells, has been implicated in several retinal diseases. Despite their important contribution to retinal homeostasis, a specific way to differentiate retinal glial cells from human pluripotent stem cells has not yet been described. Here, we report a method to differentiate retinal glial cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) through promoting the Notch signaling pathway. We first generated retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) from hESCs then promoted the Notch signaling pathway using Notch ligands, including Delta-like ligand 4 and Jagged-1. We validated glial cell differentiation with qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, western blots and fluorescence-activated cell sorting as we promoted Notch signaling in RPCs. We found that promoting Notch signaling in RPCs for 2 weeks led to upregulation of glial cell markers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamine synthetase, vimentin and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP). Of these markers, we found the greatest increase in expression of the pan glial cell marker, GFAP. Conversely, we also found that inhibition of Notch signaling in RPCs led to upregulation of retinal neuronal markers including cone-rod homeobox (CRX) and orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) but with little expression of GFAP. This retinal glial differentiation method will help advance the generation of stem cell disease models to study the pathogenesis of retinal diseases associated with glial dysfunction such as macular telangiectasia type 2. This method may also be useful for the development of future therapeutics such as drug screening and gene editing using patient-derived retinal glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The enteric nervous system (ENS) is derived from neural crest cells (NCCs). Defects in ENS NCCs colonizing in the intestines lead to an absence of enteric ganglia in the colon and results in Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR). Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play diverse roles in the proliferation, migration and survival of ENS NCCs; however, whether BMPs are involved in HSCR and the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that BMP2 expression is significantly decreased in HSCR patients. Further experiments demonstrated that BMP2 is involved in the regulation of NCC proliferation, migration and differentiation. In a detailed analysis of the role of BMP2 in HSCR development in vivo, we demonstrated that BMP2b regulates the proliferation, migration and differentiation of vagal NCCs in zebrafish and that BMP2b is required for intestinal smooth muscle development. In addition, we showed that BMP2b is involved in regulating the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the intestine, which mediates the regulation of ENS development by BMP2b in zebrafish. These results highlight a central role of the BMP-GDNF cascade in intestinal patterning and ENS development. Our results further demonstrate the key role of BMP2 in the etiology of HSCR in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synapses undergo rapid activity-dependent plasticity to store information, which when left uncompensated can lead to destabilization of neural function. It has been well documented that homeostatic changes, which operate at a slower time scale, are required to maintain stability of neural networks. While there are many mechanisms that can endow homeostatic control, sliding threshold and synaptic scaling are unique in that they operate by providing homeostatic control of synaptic strength. The former mechanism operates by adjusting the threshold for synaptic plasticity, while the latter mechanism directly alters the gain of synapses. Both modes of homeostatic synaptic plasticity have been studied across various preparations from reduced in vitro systems, such as neuronal cultures, to in vivo intact circuitry. While most of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity have been worked out using reduced preparations, there are unique challenges present in intact circuitry in vivo, which deserve further consideration. For example, in an intact circuit, neurons receive distinct set of inputs across their dendritic tree which carry unique information. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity in vivo needs to operate without compromising processing of these distinct set of inputs to preserve information processing while maintaining network stability. In this mini review, we will summarize unique features of in vivo homeostatic synaptic plasticity, and discuss how sliding threshold and synaptic scaling may act across different activity regimes to provide homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the precursor to Aβ plaques. The cytoplasmic domain of APP mediates attachment of vesicles to molecular motors for axonal transport. In APP-KO mice, transport of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is decreased. In old transgenic mice expressing mutated human (APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt;) linked to Familial Alzheimer’s Disease, with both expression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; and plaques, the rate and destination of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; axonal transport is altered, as detected by time-lapse manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) of the brain in living mice. To determine the relative contribution of expression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; versus plaque on transport dynamics, we developed a Tet-off system to decouple expression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; from plaque, and then studied hippocampal to forebrain transport by MEMRI. Three groups of mice were compared to wild-type (WT): Mice with plaque and APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression; mice with plaque but suppression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression; and mice with APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; suppressed from mating until 2 weeks before imaging with no plaque. MR images were captured before at successive time points after stereotactic injection of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (3–5 nL) into CA3 of the hippocampus. Mice were returned to their home cage between imaging sessions so that transport would occur in the awake freely moving animal. Images of multiple mice from the three groups (suppressed or expressed) together with C57/B6J WT were aligned and processed with our automated computational pipeline, and voxel-wise statistical parametric mapping (SPM) performed. At the conclusion of MR imaging, brains were harvested for biochemistry or histopathology. Paired T-tests within-group between time points (p = 0.01 FDR corrected) support the impression that both plaque alone and APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression alone alter transport rates and destination of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation. Expression of APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; in the absence of plaque or detectable Aβ also resulted in transport defects as well as pathology of hippocampus and medial septum, suggesting two sources of pathology occur in familial Alzheimer’s disease, from toxic mutant protein as well as plaque. Alternatively mice with plaque without APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression resemble the human condition of sporadic Alzheimer’s, and had better transport. Thus, these mice with APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt; expression suppressed after plaque formation will be most useful in preclinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;After cerebral ischemia, the ratio between astroglial cells and neurons in the neurovascular unit is disrupted in the perilesional area. We hypothesized that restoring the balance within the neurovascular unit may lead to an improved neurorestoration after focal ischemia. Recently, an innovative technology has been invented to efficiently convert proliferating astroglial cells into neurons in the injured young brain. However, the conversion efficacy of this technology has not been explored in the post-stroke brains of the aged rodents. To this end, we used a retroviral delivery system encoding the transcription factor Ngn2 alone or in combination with the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 to target proliferating astrocytes in the neocortex of young and aged mice after cerebral ischemia. Successful direct in vivo reprogramming of reactive glia into neuroblasts and mature neurons was assessed by cellular phenotyping. We found that the conversion efficacy of proliferating astrocytes into neurons after cerebral ischemia in young and aged mice is disappointingly low, most likely because the therapeutic vectors carrying the conversion gene are engulfed by phagocytes shortly after intracortical administration. We conclude that other viral vectors and combinations of transcription factors should be employed to improve the efficacy of glia-to-neuron conversion after stroke in young and aged rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is generally reported as one of the regions most impacted by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is closely associated with memory function and orientation. Undirected functional connectivity (FC) alterations occur in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and these alterations have been the subject of many studies. However, abnormal patterns of directed FC remain poorly understood. In this study, to identify changes in directed FC between the hippocampus and other brain regions, Granger causality analysis (GCA) based on voxels was applied to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from 29 AD, 65 MCI, and 30 normal control (NC) subjects. The results showed significant differences in the patterns of directed FC among the three groups. There were fewer brain regions showing changes in directed FC with the hippocampus in the MCI group than the NC group, and these regions were mainly located in the temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and cingulate cortex. However, regarding the abnormalities in directed FC in the AD group, the number of affected voxels was greater, the size of the clusters was larger, and the distribution was wider. Most of the abnormal connections were unidirectional and showed hemispheric asymmetry. In addition, we also investigated the correlations between the abnormal directional FCs and cognitive and clinical measurement scores in the three groups and found that some of them were significantly correlated. This study revealed abnormalities in the transmission and reception of information in the hippocampus of MCI and AD patients and offer insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Plants coordinate the polarity of hundreds of cells during vein formation, but how they do so is unclear. The prevailing hypothesis proposes that GNOM, a regulator of membrane trafficking, positions PIN-FORMED auxin transporters to the correct side of the plasma membrane; the resulting cell-to-cell, polar transport of auxin would coordinate tissue cell polarity and induce vein formation. Contrary to predictions of the hypothesis, we find that vein formation occurs in the absence of PIN-FORMED or any other intercellular auxin-transporter; that the residual auxin-transport-independent vein-patterning activity relies on auxin signaling; and that a &lt;i&gt;GNOM&lt;/i&gt;-dependent signal acts upstream of both auxin transport and signaling to coordinate tissue cell polarity and induce vein formation. Our results reveal synergism between auxin transport and signaling, and their unsuspected control by &lt;i&gt;GNOM&lt;/i&gt; in the coordination of tissue cell polarity during vein patterning, one of the most informative expressions of tissue cell polarization in plants.</content>

 Lysosomal acidification is a key feature of healthy cells. Inability to maintain lysosomal acidic pH is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms elicited by impaired lysosomal acidification remain poorly understood. We show here that inhibition of lysosomal acidification triggers cellular iron deficiency, which results in impaired mitochondrial function and non-apoptotic cell death. These effects are recovered by supplying iron via a lysosome-independent pathway. Notably, iron deficiency is sufficient to trigger inflammatory signaling in cultured primary neurons. Using a mouse model of impaired lysosomal acidification, we observed a robust iron deficiency response in the brain, verified by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, the brains of these mice present a pervasive inflammatory signature associated with instability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), both corrected by supplementation of the mice diet with iron. Our results highlight a novel mechanism linking impaired lysosomal acidification, mitochondrial malfunction and inflammation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</content>

In this paper we investigate the rate coding capabilities of neurons whose input signal are alterations of the base state of balanced inhibitory and excitatory synaptic currents. We consider different regimes of excitation-inhibition relationship and an established conductance-based leaky integrator model with adaptive threshold and parameter sets recreating biologically relevant spiking regimes. We find that given mean post-synaptic firing rate, counter-intuitively, increased ratio of inhibition to excitation generally leads to higher signal to noise ratio (SNR). On the other hand, the inhibitory input significantly reduces the dynamic coding range of the neuron. We quantify the joint effect of SNR and dynamic coding range by computing the metabolic efficiency—the maximal amount of information per one ATP molecule expended (in bits/ATP). Moreover, by calculating the metabolic efficiency we are able to predict the shapes of the post-synaptic firing rate histograms that may be tested on experimental data. Likewise, optimal stimulus input distributions are predicted, however, we show that the optimum can essentially be reached with a broad range of input distributions. Finally, we examine which parameters of the used neuronal model are the most important for the metabolically efficient information transfer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3ruuWS6-k7A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A key task in cancer genomics research is to identify cancer driver genes. As these genes initialise and progress cancer, understanding them is critical in designing effective cancer interventions. Although there are several methods developed to discover cancer drivers, most of them only identify coding drivers. However, non-coding RNAs can regulate driver mutations to develop cancer. Hence, novel methods are required to reveal both coding and non-coding cancer drivers. In this paper, we develop a novel framework named Controllability based Biological Network Analysis (CBNA) to uncover coding and non-coding cancer drivers (i.e. miRNA cancer drivers). CBNA integrates different genomic data types, including gene expression, gene network, mutation data, and contains a two-stage process: (1) Building a network for a condition (e.g. cancer condition) and (2) Identifying drivers. The application of CBNA to the BRCA dataset demonstrates that it is more effective than the existing methods in detecting coding cancer drivers. In addition, CBNA also predicts 17 miRNA drivers for breast cancer. Some of these predicted miRNA drivers have been validated by literature and the rest can be good candidates for wet-lab validation. We further use CBNA to detect subtype-specific cancer drivers and several predicted drivers have been confirmed to be related to breast cancer subtypes. Another application of CBNA is to discover epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) drivers. Of the predicted EMT drivers, 7 coding and 6 miRNA drivers are in the known EMT gene lists.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u8H3dSyh0rM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Quantifying cell-type proportions and their corresponding gene expression profiles in tissue samples would enhance understanding of the contributions of individual cell types to the physiological states of the tissue. Current approaches that address tissue heterogeneity have drawbacks. Experimental techniques, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and single cell RNA sequencing are expensive. Computational approaches that use expression data from heterogeneous samples are promising, but most of the current methods estimate either cell-type proportions or cell-type-specific expression profiles by requiring the other as input. Although such partial deconvolution methods have been successfully applied to tumor samples, the additional input required may be unavailable. We introduce a novel complete deconvolution method, CDSeq, that uses only RNA-Seq data from bulk tissue samples to simultaneously estimate both cell-type proportions and cell-type-specific expression profiles. Using several synthetic and real experimental datasets with known cell-type composition and cell-type-specific expression profiles, we compared CDSeq’s complete deconvolution performance with seven other established deconvolution methods. Complete deconvolution using CDSeq represents a substantial technical advance over partial deconvolution approaches and will be useful for studying cell mixtures in tissue samples. CDSeq is available at GitHub repository (MATLAB and Octave code): https://github.com/kkang7/CDSeq.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtLPvdJwv7Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Signal propagation over long distances is a ubiquitous feature of multicellular communities, but cell-to-cell variability can cause propagation to be highly heterogeneous. Simple models of signal propagation in heterogenous media, such as percolation theory, can potentially provide a quantitative understanding of these processes, but it is unclear whether these simple models properly capture the complexities of multicellular systems. We recently discovered that in biofilms of the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, the propagation of an electrical signal is statistically consistent with percolation theory, and yet it is reasonable to suspect that key features of this system go beyond the simple assumptions of basic percolation theory. Indeed, we find here that the probability for a cell to signal is not independent from other cells as assumed in percolation theory, but instead is correlated with its nearby neighbors. We develop a mechanistic model, in which correlated signaling emerges from cell division, phenotypic inheritance, and cell displacement, that reproduces the experimentally observed correlations. We find that the correlations do not significantly affect the spatial statistics, which we rationalize using a renormalization argument. Moreover, the fraction of signaling cells is not constant in space, as assumed in percolation theory, but instead varies within and across biofilms. We find that this feature lowers the fraction of signaling cells at which one observes the characteristic power-law statistics of cluster sizes, consistent with our experimental results. We validate the model using a mutant biofilm whose signaling probability decays along the propagation direction. Our results reveal key statistical features of a correlated signaling process in a multicellular community. More broadly, our results identify extensions to percolation theory that do or do not alter its predictions and may be more appropriate for biological systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uZzyDeJ1X2E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Cortical spreading depression (SD) is a spreading disruption of ionic homeostasis in the brain during which neurons experience complete and prolonged depolarizations. SD is the basis of migraine aura and is increasingly associated with many other brain pathologies. Here, we study the role of glutamate and NMDA receptor dynamics in the context of an ionic electrodiffusion model. We perform simulations in one (1D) and two (2D) spatial dimension. Our 1D simulations reproduce the “inverted saddle” shape of the extracellular voltage signal for the first time. Our simulations suggest that SD propagation depends on two overlapping mechanisms; one dependent on extracellular glutamate diffusion and NMDA receptors and the other dependent on extracellular potassium diffusion and persistent sodium channel conductance. In 2D simulations, we study the dynamics of spiral waves. We study the properties of the spiral waves in relation to the planar 1D wave, and also compute the energy expenditure associated with the recurrent SD spirals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6B7JcLlTVrw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate most human genes through direct base-pairing with mRNAs. We investigate the underlying principles of miRNA regulation in living cells. To this end, we overexpressed miRNAs in different cell types and measured the mRNA decay rate under a paradigm of a transcriptional arrest. Based on an exhaustive matrix of mRNA-miRNA binding probabilities, and parameters extracted from our experiments, we developed a computational framework that captures the cooperative action of miRNAs in living cells. The framework, called COMICS, simulates the stochastic binding events between miRNAs and mRNAs in cells. The input of COMICS is cell-specific profiles of mRNAs and miRNAs, and the outcome is the retention level of each mRNA at the end of 100,000 iterations. The results of COMICS from thousands of miRNA manipulations reveal gene sets that exhibit coordinated behavior with respect to all miRNAs (total of 248 families). We identified a small set of genes that are highly responsive to changes in the expression of almost any of the miRNAs. In contrast, about 20% of the tested genes remain insensitive to a broad range of miRNA manipulations. The set of insensitive genes is strongly enriched with genes that belong to the translation machinery. These trends are shared by different cell types. We conclude that the stochastic nature of miRNAs reveals unexpected robustness of gene expression in living cells. By applying a systematic probabilistic approach some key design principles of cell states are revealed, emphasizing in particular, the immunity of the translational machinery vis-a-vis miRNA manipulations across cell types. We propose COMICS as a valuable platform for assessing the outcome of miRNA regulation of cells in health and disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J1VJIPK0p1o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Information sampling can reduce uncertainty in future decisions but is often costly. To maximize reward, people need to balance sampling cost and information gain. Here we aimed to understand how autistic traits influence the optimality of information sampling and to identify the particularly affected cognitive processes. Healthy human adults with different levels of autistic traits performed a probabilistic inference task, where they could sequentially sample information to increase their likelihood of correct inference and may choose to stop at any moment. We manipulated the cost and evidence associated with each sample and compared participants’ performance to strategies that maximize expected gain. We found that participants were overall close to optimal but also showed autistic-trait-related differences. Participants with higher autistic traits had a higher efficiency of winning rewards when the sampling cost was zero but a lower efficiency when the cost was high and the evidence was more ambiguous. Computational modeling of participants’ sampling choices and decision times revealed a two-stage decision process, with the second stage being an optional second thought. Participants may consider cost in the first stage and evidence in the second stage, or in the reverse order. The probability of choosing to stop sampling at a specific stage increases with increasing cost or increasing evidence. Surprisingly, autistic traits did not influence the decision in either stage. However, participants with higher autistic traits inclined to consider cost first, while those with lower autistic traits considered cost or evidence first in a more balanced way. This would lead to the observed autistic-trait-related advantages or disadvantages in sampling optimality, depending on whether the optimal sampling strategy is determined only by cost or jointly by cost and evidence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dVMOYje6s7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Gaze saccades –rapid shifts of the eyes and head toward a goal— have provided fundamental insights into the neural control of movement. For example, it has been shown that the superior colliculus (SC) transforms a visual target (T) code to future gaze (G) location commands after a memory-delay. However, this transformation has not been observed in ‘reactive’ saccades made directly to a stimulus, so its contribution to normal gaze behavior is unclear. Here, we tested this using a quantitative measure of the intermediate codes between T and G, based on variable errors in gaze endpoints. We demonstrate that a rapid spatial transformation occurs within the primate’s SC (&lt;i&gt;Maccaca Mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) during reactive saccades, involving a shift in coding from T, through intermediate codes, to G. This spatial shift progressed continuously both across and within cell populations (visual, visuomotor, motor), rather than relaying discretely between populations with fixed spatial codes. These results suggest that the SC produces a rapid, noisy, and distributed transformation that contributes to variable errors in reactive gaze shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Oculomotor studies have demonstrated visuomotor transformations in structures like the superior colliculus with the use of trained behavioral manipulations, like the memory-delay and antisaccades tasks, but it is not known how this happens during normal saccades. Here, using a spatial model fitting method based on endogenous gaze errors in ‘reactive’ gaze saccades, we show that the superior colliculus provides a rapid spatial transformation from target to gaze coding that involves visual, visuomotor, and motor neurons. This technique demonstrates that SC spatial codes are not stable, and may provide a quantitative diagnostic marker for assessing the health of sensorimotor transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;When postmortem studies related to transgender individuals were first published, little was known about the function of the various identified nuclei. Now, over two decades later, significant progress has been made associating function with specific brain regions, as well as in identifying networks associated with groups of behaviors. However, much of this progress has not been integrated into the general conceptualization of gender dysphoria in humans. We hypothesize that in individuals with gender dysphoria, the aspects of chronic distress, gender atypical behavior, and incongruence between perception of gender identity and external primary sex characteristics are all directly related to functional differences in associated brain networks. We evaluated previously published neuroscience data related to these aspects and the associated functional networks, along with other relevant information. We find that the brain networks that give individuals their ownership of body parts, that influence gender typical behavior, and that are involved in chronic distress are different in individuals with and without gender dysphoria, leading to a new theory—that gender dysphoria is a sensory perception condition, an alteration in sense of gender influenced by the reflexive behavioral responses associated with each of these networks. This theory builds upon previous work that supports the relevance of the body ownership network and that questions the relevance of cerebral sexual dimorphism in regards to gender dysphoria. However, our theory uses a hierarchical executive function model to incorporate multiple reflexive factors (body ownership, gender (a)typical behavior, and chronic distress) with the cognitive, reflective process of gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Our new model highlights connections between multiple dimensions of gender dysphoria and behavioral neuroscience data, explaining the experience of gender dysphoria using relevant neural substrates and networks. This biology/symptom-based approach provides an updated theory of gender dysphoria, fostering new hypotheses to advance basic understanding of the condition. This theory may lead to therapies which directly address the underlying biology rather than just the subjective symptoms. Such therapies may also be more effective at reducing comorbid conditions (e.g., depression or suicide), given the possibility of a common, underlying biological cause.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Sleep is important to maintain physical and cognitive functions in everyday life. However, the prevalence of sleep disorders is on the rise. One existing solution to this problem is to induce sleep using an auditory stimulus. When we listen to acoustic beats of two tones in each ear simultaneously, a binaural beat is generated which induces brain signals at a specific desired frequency. However, this auditory stimulus is uncomfortable for users to listen to induce sleep. To overcome this difficulty, we can exploit the feelings of calmness and relaxation that are induced by the perceptual phenomenon of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). In this study, we proposed a novel auditory stimulus for inducing sleep. Specifically, we used a 6 Hz binaural beat corresponding to the center of the theta band (4–8 Hz), which is the frequency at which brain activity is entrained during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) in sleep stage 1. In addition, the “ASMR triggers” that cause ASMR were presented from natural sound as the sensory stimuli. In session 1, we combined two auditory stimuli (the 6 Hz binaural beat and ASMR triggers) at three-decibel ratios to find the optimal combination ratio. As a result, we determined that the combination of a 30:60 dB ratio of binaural beat to ASMR trigger is most effective for inducing theta power and psychological stability. In session 2, the effects of these combined stimuli (CS) were compared with an only binaural beat, only the ASMR trigger, or a sham condition. The combination stimulus retained the advantages of the binaural beat and resolved its shortcomings with the ASMR triggers, including psychological self-reports. Our findings indicate that the proposed auditory stimulus could induce the brain signals required for sleep, while simultaneously keeping the user in a psychologically comfortable state. This technology provides an important opportunity to develop a novel method for increasing the quality of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

It is generally accepted that these signals are defined with respect to the external world (i.e., a world-centered, or allocentric, frame of reference). Recently, evidence of egocentric processing (i.e., self-centered, defined relative to the subject) in the extended hippocampal system has accumulated. These results support the idea that egocentric sensory information, derived from primary sensory cortical areas, may be transformed to allocentric representations that interact with the allocentric hippocampal system. We propose a framework to explain the implications of the egocentric-allocentric transformations to the functions of the medial temporal lobe memory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restless legs syndrome is a frequent neurological disorder with substantial burden on individual wellbeing and public health. Genetic risk loci have been identified but the causatives genes at these loci are largely unknown, so that functional investigation and clinical translation of molecular research data are still inhibited. To identify putatively causative genes we searched for highly significant mutational burden in candidate genes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed 84 candidate genes in 4,649 patients and 4,982 controls by next generation sequencing using molecular inversion probes that targeted mainly coding regions. The burden of low‐frequency and rare variants was assessed, and in addition, an algorithm (binomial performance deviation analysis) was established to estimate independently the sequence variation in the probe binding regions from the variation in sequencing depth.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly significant results (considering the number of genes in the genome) of the conventional burden test and the binomial performance deviation analysis overlapped significantly. Fourteen genes were highly significant by one method and confirmed with nominal significance by the other to show a differential burden of low‐frequency and rare variants in restless legs syndrome. Nine of them (&lt;i&gt;AAGAB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATP2C1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CNTN4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;COL6A6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GLO1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NTNG1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;STEAP4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;VAV3&lt;/i&gt;) resided in the vicinity of known restless legs syndrome loci while five (&lt;i&gt;BBS7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CADM1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CREB5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NRG3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SUN1&lt;/i&gt;) have not previously been associated with restless legs syndrome. Burden test and binomial performance deviation analysis also converged significantly in fine‐mapping potentially causative domains within these genes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differential burden with intragenic low‐frequency variants reveals putatively causative genes in restless legs syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptomatic head trauma associated with American‐style football (ASF) has been linked to brain pathology, along with physical and mental distress in later life. However, the longer‐term effects of such trauma on objective metrics of cognitive–motor function remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that ASF‐related symptomatic head trauma would predict worse gait performance, particularly during dual task conditions (ie, walking while performing an additional cognitive task), in later life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty‐six retired professional ASF players aged 29 to 75 years completed a health and wellness questionnaire. They also completed a validated smartphone‐based assessment in their own homes, during which gait was monitored while they walked normally and while they performed a verbalized serial‐subtraction cognitive task.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who reported more symptomatic head trauma, defined as the total number of impacts to the head or neck followed by concussion‐related symptoms, exhibited greater dual task cost (ie, percentage increase) to stride time variability (ie, the coefficient of variation of mean stride time). Those who reported ≥1 hit followed by loss of consciousness, compared to those who did not, also exhibited greater dual task costs to this metric. Relationships between reported trauma and dual task costs were independent of age, body mass index, National Football League career duration, and history of musculoskeletal surgery. Symptomatic head trauma was not correlated with average stride times in either walking condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote, smartphone‐based assessments of dual task walking may be utilized to capture meaningful data sensitive to the long‐term impact of symptomatic head trauma in former professional ASF players and other contact sport athletes. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The nematode &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; provides an opportunity to define evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of regulation of host innate immunity and inflammation in a genetically tractable whole-animal system. In the past few years, the &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; nervous system has emerged as an integral part of host defense against pathogens, acting through diverse mechanisms to repress or induce protective transcriptional responses to infection in distal tissues. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the mechanisms through which the &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; nervous system controls the expression of host defense genes in the intestinal epithelium. Although still incomplete, the insights derived from such work have broad implications for neural regulation of epithelial function at mucosal barriers in higher organisms in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438819301059-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25644?af=R"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otaplimastat is a neuroprotectant that inhibits matrix metalloprotease pathway, and reduces edema and intracerebral hemorrhage induced by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in animal stroke models. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of otaplimastat in patients receiving rtPA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phase 2, 2‐part, multicenter trial in stroke patients (19–80 years old) receiving rtPA. Intravenous otaplimastat was administered &amp;lt;30 minutes after rtPA. Stage 1 was a single‐arm, open‐label safety study in 11 patients. Otaplimastat 80 mg was administered twice daily for 3 days. Stage 2 was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study involving 69 patients, assigned (1:1:1) to otaplimastat 40 mg, otaplimastat 80 mg, or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of parenchymal hematoma (PH) on day 1. Secondary endpoints included serious adverse events (SAEs), mortality, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) distribution at 90 days (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; identifier: NCT02787278).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No safety issues were encountered in stage 1. The incidence of PH during stage 2 was comparable: 0 of 22 with the placebo, 0 of 22 with otaplimastat 40 mg, and 1 of 21 with the 80 mg dose. No differences in SAEs (13%, 17%, 14%) or death (8.3%, 4.2%, 4.8%) were observed among the 3 groups. Three adverse events (chills, muscle rigidity, hepatotoxicity) were judged to be related to otaplimastat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intravenous otaplimastat adjunctive therapy in patients receiving rtPA is feasible and generally safe. The functional efficacy of otaplimastat needs to be investigated with further large trials. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00531"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00531</id>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) species in the extracellular environment induce downstream signaling via six different G protein-coupled receptors (LPAR1–6). These signaling cascades are essential for normal brain development and function of the nervous system. However, in response to acute or chronic central nervous system (CNS) damage, LPA levels increase and aberrant signaling events can counteract brain function. Under neuro-inflammatory conditions signaling along the LPA/LPAR5 axis induces a potentially neurotoxic microglia phenotype indicating the need for new pharmacological intervention strategies. Therefore, we compared the effects of two novel small-molecule LPAR5 antagonists on LPA-induced polarization parameters of the BV-2 microglia cell line. AS2717638 is a selective piperidine-based LPAR5 antagonist (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 0.038 μM) while compound 3 is a diphenylpyrazole derivative with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of 0.7 μM in BV-2 cells. Both antagonists compromised cell viability, however, at concentrations above their IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. Both inhibitors blunted LPA-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, p65, and c-Jun and consequently reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cyto-/chemokines (IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β, CXCL10, CXCL2, and CCL5) at non-toxic concentrations. Both compounds modulated the expression of intracellular (COX-2 and Arg1) and plasma membrane-located (CD40, CD86, and CD206) polarization markers yet only AS2717638 attenuated the neurotoxic potential of LPA-activated BV-2 cell-conditioned medium towards CATH.a neurons. Our findings from the present in vitro study suggest that the two LPAR5 antagonists represent valuable pharmacological tools to interfere with LPA-induced pro-inflammatory signaling cascades in microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Opioid activation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) promotes signaling cascades that evoke both analgesic responses to pain and side effects like addiction and dependence. Manipulation of these cascades, such as by biased agonism, has great promise to improve opioid therapy. However, the signaling cascades of the MOR are in general poorly understood, providing few targets for drug development. In our earlier work, we identified Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as a novel and crucial regulator of opioid anti-nociception in the brain by promoting ERK MAPK activation. In this study, we sought to identify the molecular isoforms and co-chaperones by which Hsp90 carried out this role, which could provide specific targets for future clinical intervention. We used novel selective small molecule inhibitors as well as CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing constructs delivered by the intracerebroventricular (icv) route to the brains of adult CD-1 mice to target Hsp90 isoforms (Hsp90α/β, Grp94) and co-chaperones (p23, Cdc37, Aha1). We found that inhibition of the isoform Hsp90α fully blocked morphine anti-nociception in a model of post-surgical paw incision pain, while blocking ERK and JNK MAPK activation, suggesting Hsp90α as the main regulator of opioid response in the brain. We further found that inhibition of the co-chaperones p23 and Cdc37 blocked morphine anti-nociception, suggesting that these co-chaperones assist Hsp90α in promoting opioid anti-nociception. Lastly, we used cycloheximide treatment in the brain to demonstrate that rapid protein translation within 30 min of opioid treatment is required for Hsp90 regulation of opioid response. Together these studies provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Hsp90 promotes opioid anti-nociception. These findings thus both improve our basic science knowledge of MOR signal transduction and could provide future targets for clinical intervention to improve opioid therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human studies have consistently shown that drugs of abuse affect memory function. The psychostimulants amphetamine and the “bath salt” 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) increase brain monoamine levels through a similar, yet not identical, mechanism of action. Findings indicate that amphetamine enhances the consolidation of memory for emotional experiences, but still MDPV effects on memory function are underinvestigated. Here, we tested the effects induced by these two drugs on generalization of fear memory and their relative neurobiological underpinnings. To this aim, we used a modified version of the classical inhibitory avoidance task, termed inhibitory avoidance discrimination task. According to such procedure, adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were first exposed to one inhibitory avoidance apparatus and, with a 1-min delay, to a second apparatus where they received an inescapable footshock. Forty-eight hours later, retention latencies were tested, in a randomized order, in the two training apparatuses as well as in a novel contextually modified apparatus to assess both strength and generalization of memory. Our results indicated that both amphetamine and MDPV induced generalization of fear memory, whereas only amphetamine enhanced memory strength. Co-administration of the β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol prevented the effects of both amphetamine and MDPV on the strength and generalization of memory. The dopaminergic receptor blocker cis-flupenthixol selectively reversed the amphetamine effect on memory generalization. These findings indicate that amphetamine and MDPV induce generalization of fear memory through different modulations of noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed to be associated with ischemic stroke (IS); however, their involvement still needs to be extensively explored. Therefore, we aimed to study the expression profile of lncRNAs and the potential roles and mechanisms of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the Southern Chinese Han population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this study, lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in AIS were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and network analyses were performed to predict the functions and interactions of the aberrantly expressed genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of lncRNAs in AIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: RNA-Seq analysis showed that 428 lncRNAs and 957 mRNAs were significantly upregulated, while 791 lncRNAs and 4,263 mRNAs were downregulated in patients with AIS when compared with healthy controls. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes showed that the apoptosis, inflammatory, oxidative and calcium signaling pathways were potentially implicated in AIS pathology. The PCR results showed that the selected lncRNA-C14orf64 and lncRNA-AC136007.2 were significantly downregulated in AIS. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of lncRNA-C14orf64 and lncRNA-AC136007.2 between AIS and healthy controls were 0.74 and 0.94, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study provides evidence of altered expression of lncRNAs and their potential functions in AIS. Our findings may facilitate pathological mechanistic studies of lncRNAs in AIS and provide potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AIS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are among the most prevalent chronic diseases affecting the aging population. Extensive research evidence indicates that T2D is a well-established risk factor for AD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, how T2D may contribute to the progression of AD is a subject of extensive investigation. In this study, we compared the blood transcriptome of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and advanced AD to those afflicted with T2D to unveil shared and unique pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Blood transcriptomic analyses revealed a positive correlation between gene expression profiles of MCI, AD, and T2D in seven independent microarrays. Interestingly, gene expression profiles from women with advanced AD correlated negatively with T2D, suggesting sex-specific differences in T2D as a risk factor for AD. Network and pathway analysis revealed that shared molecular networks between MCI and T2D were predominantly enriched in inflammation and infectious diseases whereas those networks shared between overt AD and T2D were involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B/Akt (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway, a major mediator of insulin signaling in the body. The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway became more significantly dysregulated in the advanced AD and T2D shared network. Furthermore, endocrine resistance and atherosclerosis pathways emerged as dysregulated pathways in the advanced AD and T2D shared network. Interestingly, network analysis of shared differentially expressed genes between children with T2D and MCI subjects identified forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) as a central transcriptional regulator, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in AD. Collectively, these results suggest that T2D may be implicated at different stages of AD through different molecular pathways disrupted during the preclinical phase of AD and more advanced stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One of the grand challenges for computational neuroscience and high-performance computing is computer simulation of a human-scale whole brain model with spiking neurons and synaptic plasticity using supercomputers. To achieve such a simulation, the target network model must be partitioned onto a number of computational nodes, and the sub-network models are executed in parallel while communicating spike information across different nodes. However, it remains unclear how the target network model should be partitioned for efficient computing on next generation of supercomputers. Specifically, reducing the communication of spike information across compute nodes is essential, because of the relatively slower network performance than processor and memory. From the viewpoint of biological features, the cerebral cortex and cerebellum contain 99% of neurons and synapses and form layered sheet structures. Therefore, an efficient method to split the network should exploit the layered sheet structures. In this study, we indicate that a tile partitioning method leads to efficient communication. To demonstrate it, a simulation software called MONET (Millefeuille-like Organization NEural neTwork simulator) that partitions a network model as described above was developed. The MONET simulator was implemented on the Japanese flagship supercomputer K, which is composed of 82,944 computational nodes. We examined a performance of calculation, communication and memory consumption in the tile partitioning method for a cortical model with realistic anatomical and physiological parameters. The result showed that the tile partitioning method drastically reduced communication data amount by replacing network communication with DRAM access and sharing the communication data with neighboring neurons. We confirmed the scalability and efficiency of the tile partitioning method on up to 63,504 compute nodes of the K computer for the cortical model. In the companion paper by Yamaura et al., the performance for a cerebellar model was examined. These results suggest that the tile partitioning method will have advantage for a human-scale whole-brain simulation on exascale computers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Drug- and noise-related hearing loss are both associated with inflammatory responses in the inner ear. We propose that intracochlear delivery of a combination of pro-resolving mediators, specialized proteins and lipids that accelerate the return to homeostasis by modifying the immune response rather than by inhibiting inflammation, might have a profound effect on the prevention of sensorineural hearing loss. However, intracochlear delivery of such agents requires a reliable and effective method to convey them, fully active, directly to the target cells. The present study provides evidence that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from auditory HEI-OC1 cells may incorporate significant quantities of anti-inflammatory drugs, pro-resolving mediators and their polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors as cargo, and potentially could work as carriers for their intracochlear delivery. EVs generated by HEI-OC1 cells were divided by size into two fractions, small (≤150 nm diameter) and large (&amp;gt;150 nm diameter), and loaded with aspirin, lipoxin A4, resolvin D1, and the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexanoic, and linoleic. Bottom-up proteomics revealed a differential distribution of selected proteins between small and large vesicles. Only 17.4% of these proteins were present in both fractions, whereas 61.5% were unique to smaller vesicles and only 3.7% were exclusively found in the larger ones. Importantly, the pro-resolving protein mediators Annexin A1 and Galectins 1 and 3 were only detected in small vesicles. Lipidomic studies, on the other hand, showed that small vesicles contained higher levels of eicosanoids than large ones and, although all of them incorporated the drugs and molecules investigated, small vesicles were more efficiently loaded with PUFA and the large ones with aspirin, LXA4 and resolvin D1. Importantly, our data indicate that the vesicles contain all necessary enzymatic components for the de novo generation of eicosanoids from fatty acid precursors, including pro-inflammatory agents, suggesting that their cargo should be carefully tailored to avoid interference with their therapeutic purpose. Altogether, these results support the idea that both small and large EVs from auditory HEI-OC1 cells could be used as nanocarriers for anti-inflammatory drugs and pro-resolving mediators.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuroligins (NLs) are a group of postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules that function in synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission. Genetic defects in neuroligin 3 (NL3), a member of the NL protein family, are associated with autism. Studies in rodents have revealed that mutations of NL3 gene lead to increased growth and complexity in dendrites in the central nervous system. However, the detailed mechanism is still unclear. In our study, we found that deficiency of NL3 led to morphological changes of the pyramidal neurons in layer II/III somatosensory cortex in mice, including enlarged somata, elongated dendritic length, and increased dendritic complexity. Knockdown of NL3 in cultured rat neurons upregulated Akt/mTOR signaling, resulting in both increased protein synthesis and dendritic growth. Treating neurons with either rapamycin to inhibit the mTOR or LY294002 to inhibit the PI3K/Akt activity rescued the morphological abnormalities resulting from either NL3 knockdown or knockout (KO). In addition, we found that the hyperactivated Akt/mTOR signaling associated with NL3 defects was mediated by a reduction in phosphatase and tensin (PTEN) expression, and that MAGI-2, a scaffold protein, interacted with both NL3 and PTEN and could be a linker between NL3 and Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that NL3 regulates neuronal morphology, especially dendritic outgrowth, by modulating the PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, probably via MAGI-2. Thereby, this study provides a new link between NL3 and neuronal morphology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;The incidence of symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is increasing in Chinese aging population, but its clinical and demographic knowledge is still lacking. This study sought to outline the clinical and demographic data of CSDH patients from two medical centers in Tianjin and Chongqing to provide a better understanding for CSDH treatment in China.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Age, sex, etiologies, conscious level on admission, treatment strategies, outcome at discharge, recurrence, and concomitant disease of enrolled patients were recorded. The data were further analyzed after the patients were sub-grouped into young/middle (less than 60 years old) and old (over than 60 years old) age groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 1281 CSDH patients were enrolled. Of these, 85.01% were male and 51.91% were aged between 60 and 80 years. 57.61% patients encountered head trauma before diagnosing CSDH. The top three clinical symptoms at admission were headache (58.55%), dyskinesia (36.92%), and dizziness (33.96%). Headache as well as dizziness often happened in young/middle age group, while dyskinesia often occurred in the old age group. The most common concomitant diseases were cardio-cerebrovascular system diseases (41.14%). The concomitant respiratory diseases in aged patients led to unfavorable outcomes (p = 0.049, OR:0.357). The prognosis of old age subgroup receiving conservative treatment was better than those who received burr-hole drainage treatment (p &amp;lt; 0.015, OR:4.091).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;CSDH mostly occurs in aged and male population with a history a head trauma. The respiratory disease often results in unfavorable outcomes in aged patients. Conservative treatment might benefit some patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug‐resistant seizures are common in patients with Leucine‐rich, glioma‐inactivated‐1 (LGI1) and contactin‐associated‐protein‐like‐2 (CASPR2)‐IgG associated encephalitis. We performed the first randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in reducing seizure frequency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our enrollment goal was 30 LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG‐seropositive adult patients with ≥2 seizures per‐week. Patients were randomized to receive IVIG (0.5g/kg day‐1, 1g/kg day‐2, 0.6g/kg week 3 and 5) or volume‐matched intravenous normal saline. Following the blinded‐phase, the non‐responders in the placebo group received IVIG. The primary clinical outcome was 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to 5 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After enrollment of 17 patients (LGI1‐IgG, 14; CASPR2‐IgG, 3) over 34 months the study was terminated due to slow enrollment. Six of eight patients in the IVIG group were responders compared to two of nine in the placebo group (p=0.044, OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 98.9). For the LGI1‐IgG seropositive subgroup: 6 of 8 patients in the IVIG group were responders, compared to zero of 6 in the placebo group. Two LGI1‐IgG seropositive patients receiving IVIG, but none receiving placebo, were seizure free at the end of the blinded‐phase. Four of the six patients entering the open‐label IVIG arm reported ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency. There were no correlations with LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG1‐4 subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpreation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superiority of IVIG to placebo reached statistical significance for the primary end‐point for all patients and the subset with LGI1‐IgG. These results have to be interpreted with the caveat that the study did not reach its originally selected sample size.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Anxiety affects the life quality of a significant percentage of autism patients. To understand the possible biological basis of this high anxiety level, we used a valproic acid (VPA) model of autism. Anxiety level is significantly higher in VPA-injected mice, at both P35 and P70. In addition, protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) level in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is significantly higher in VPA mice at both ages. Consistent with this finding, infusion of a PKMζ-blocking peptide z-pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide (ZIP) into BLA significantly reduced anxiety levels in VPA mice. Furthermore, viral overexpression of PKMζ in the BLA led to elevated anxiety level in Wild Type (WT) mice, with concomitant higher intrinsic excitability of BLA excitatory neurons. Altogether, our results indicate a key contribution of BLA PKMζ level to anxiety, especially in autism; and this finding may provide a further understanding of the pathogenesis as well as treatment of anxiety symptoms in autism patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The results from epidemiologic studies linking blood folate concentrations, folic acid supplementation, or dietary folate to the risk of preterm birth are inconsistent. In this study, we aimed to summarize the available evidence on these associations. A systematic search of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up to October 20, 2018 was performed and reference lists of retrieved articles were screened. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the highest vs. the lowest levels of folate concentrations, folic acid supplementation, and dietary folate were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and univariate meta-regression were performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Ten studies (six prospective cohort studies and four case-control studies) were included on folate concentrations, 13 cohort studies were included about folic acid supplementation, and 4 cohort studies were included regarding dietary folate intake. Higher maternal folate levels were associated with a 28% reduction in the risk of preterm birth (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.93). Higher folic acid supplementation was associated with 10% lower risk of preterm birth (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85–0.95). In addition, a significant negative association was observed between dietary folate intake and the risk of preterm birth (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55–0.84), but no significant relation was seen between dietary folate and the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57–1.41). In the subgroup analysis, higher maternal folate levels in the third trimester were associated with a lower risk of preterm birth (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.94). To initiate taking folic acid supplementation early before conception was adversely associated with preterm birth risk (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83–0.95). In conclusion, higher maternal folate levels and folic acid supplementation were significantly associated with a lower risk of preterm birth. The limited data currently available suggest that dietary folate is associated with a significantly decreased risk of preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that miRNA expression changes are associated with the development of AD. Our previous study showed that the expression level of miR-409-5p was stably downregulated in the early stage of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice model of AD. We now report that miR-409-5p impairs neurite outgrowth, decreases neuronal viability, and accelerates the progression of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced pathologies. In this study, we found that Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; peptide significantly decreased the expression of miR-409-5p, which was consistent with the expression profile of miR-409-5p in the APP/PS1 mice cortexes. Plek was confirmed to be a potential regulatory target of miR-409-5p by luciferase assay and Western blotting. Overexpression of miR-409-5p has an obvious neurotoxicity in neuronal cell viability and differentiation, whereas Plek overexpression could partially rescue neurite outgrowth from this toxicity. Some cytoskeleton regulatory proteins have been found to be related to AD pathogenesis. Our data show some clues that cytoskeletal reorganization may play roles in AD pathology. The early downregulation of miR-409-5p in AD progression might be a self-protective reaction to alleviate the synaptic damage induced by Aβ, which may be used as a potential early biomarker of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Endovascular treatment of large or giant non-saccular vertebrobasilar aneurysms (VBAs) by conventional stents is difficult and has unsatisfactory outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;Object&lt;p&gt;This study was performed to retrospectively analyze the safety and efficacy of a flow diverter in treating large and giant non-saccular VBAs.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We identified 78 patients with 83 large or giant non-saccular VBAs who accepted endovascular treatment with a pipeline embolization device (PED) or conventional stent from January 2014 to June 2018. The technical details of the procedure, procedure-associated complications, angiographic outcomes, and clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Forty-two patients (53.8%, 42/78) with 44 aneurysms (53.0%, 44/83) underwent endovascular treatment with PEDs. Thirty-six patients (46.2%, 36/78) with 39 aneurysms (47.0%, 39/83) underwent endovascular treatment with conventional stents. The complication rate of PED group and conventional stent group was 7.1% (3/42) and 5.6% (2/36), respectively (odds ratio, 0.765; 95% confidence interval, 0.121–4.851; P = 0.776). During a median follow-up time of 28.8 months, the complete occlusion rate in the PED group and conventional stent group was 90.2% (37/41) and 70.3% (26/37), respectively (odds ratio, 3.913; 95% confidence interval, 1.122–13.652; P = 0.032).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Endovascular treatment with a PED is a promising and safe modality for large and giant non-saccular VBAs, and the complication rate is acceptable, compared with conventional endovascular treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is associated with development of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, due to considerable heterogeneity in intellectual function among persons with DS, it is difficult to assess whether a person with DS has developed dementia due to AD (DS-AD). EEG spectral power has previously shown very promising results with increased slowing in DS-AD compared to DS. However, another technique called microstates may be used to assess whole-brain dynamics and has to our knowledge not previously been investigated in either DS or DS-AD. The aim of the current study was to assess whether microstates could be used to differentiate between adults with DS, and DS-AD. We included EEGs from 10 persons with DS and 15 persons with DS-AD in the analysis. For the microstate analyses, we calculated four global maps, which were then back-fitted to all the EEGs. Lastly, we extracted the duration, occurrence, and coverage for each of the microstates. Here, we found the four archetypical maps as has previously been reported in the literature. We did not find any significant difference between DS and DS-AD but the largest difference in microstate duration between DS and DS-AD was found in microstate A and D. These findings are in line with structural MR studies showing that both the frontal and temporal lobes are affected in persons with DS-AD. Microstates may potentially serve as a diagnostic marker, but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Unilateral weakness of the lower limb is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) and a significant contributor to the progressive worsening of walking ability. There are currently no effective rehabilitation strategies targeting strength asymmetries and/or gait impairments in people with MS (PwMS). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has improved motor outcomes in various populations, but the effect of tDCS on gait in PwMS and the ideal timing window of tDCS application are still unknown. This study investigated the effects of tDCS, either before or during a 6 min walk test (6MWT), on the distance walked and gait characteristics in PwMS. Twelve participants were recruited and randomly assigned into BEFORE or DURING groups (both n = 6). The BEFORE group received stimulation before performing a 6MWT (sham/2 mA, 13 min). The DURING group received stimulation only during a 6MWT (sham/2 mA, 6 min). Stimulation was over the more MS-affected primary motor cortex (M1). Distance walked and gait characteristics of the walk were the primary and secondary outcomes. The results indicated a significant decrease in distance walked in the DURING group (p = 0.026) and a significant increase in gait velocity in the BEFORE group (p = 0.04). These changes were accompanied by trends (p &amp;lt; 0.1) in distance walked, gait velocity, and stride length. Overall, the results of this study suggest that tDCS performed before a 6MWT might be more effective than tDCS during a 6MWT and that a single session of tDCS may not be sufficient to influence gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier #NCT03757819.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Oncolytic virotherapies, including the modified herpes simplex virus talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), have shown great promise as potent instigators of anti-tumour immune effects. The OPTiM trial, in particular, demonstrated the superior anti-cancer effects of T-VEC as compared to systemic immunotherapy treatment using exogenous administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Theoretically, a combined approach leveraging exogenous cytokine immunotherapy and oncolytic virotherapy would elicit an even greater immune response and improve patient outcomes. However, regimen scheduling of combination immunostimulation and T-VEC therapy has yet to be established. Here, we calibrate a computational biology model of sensitive and resistant tumour cells and immune interactions for implementation into an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; clinical trial to test and individualize combination immuno- and virotherapy. By personalizing and optimizing combination oncolytic virotherapy and immunostimulatory therapy, we show improved simulated patient outcomes for individuals with late-stage melanoma. More crucially, through evaluation of individualized regimens, we identified determinants of combination GM-CSF and T-VEC therapy that can be translated into clinically-actionable dosing strategies without further personalization. Our results serve as a proof-of-concept for interdisciplinary approaches to determining combination therapy, and suggest promising avenues of investigation towards tailored combination immunotherapy/oncolytic virotherapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z-PEZKQFdTc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease causes prominent difficulties in the generation and execution of voluntary limb movements, including regulation of distal muscles and coordination of proximal and distal movement components to achieve accurate grasping. Difficulties with manual dexterity have a major impact on activities of daily living. We used extracellular single neuron recordings to investigate the neural underpinnings of parkinsonian movement deficits in the motor cortex of chronic unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion male rats performing a skilled reach-to-grasp task the. Both normal movements and parkinsonian deficits in this task have striking homology to human performance. In lesioned animals there were several differences in the activity of cortical neurons during reaches by the affected limb compared with control rats. These included an increase in proportions of neurons showing rate decreases, along with increased amplitude of their average rate-decrease response at specific times during the reach, suggesting a shift in the balance of net excitation and inhibition of cortical neurons; a significant increase in the duration of rate-increase responses, which could result from reduced coupling of cortical activity to specific movement components; and changes in the timing and incidence of neurons with pure rate-increase or biphasic responses, particularly at the end of reach when grasping would normally be occurring. The changes in cortical activity may account for the deficits that occur in skilled distal motor control following dopamine depletion, and highlight the need for treatment strategies targeted toward modulating cortical mechanisms for fine distal motor control in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show for the first time in a chronic lesion rat model of Parkinson's disease movement deficits that there are specific changes in motor cortex neuron activity associated with the grasping phase of a skilled motor task. Such changes provide a possible mechanism underpinning the problems with manual dexterity seen in Parkinson's patients and highlight the need for treatment strategies targeted toward distal motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent vasculoprotective and neuroprotective signaling lipid, synthesized primarily by sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) in the brain. We have reported pronounced loss of S1P and SK2 activity early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and an inverse correlation between hippocampal S1P levels and age in females, leading us to speculate that loss of S1P is a sensitizing influence for AD. Paradoxically, SK2 was reported to mediate amyloid β (Aβ) formation from amyloid precursor protein (APP) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. To determine whether loss of S1P sensitizes to Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration, we investigated whether SK2 deficiency worsens pathology and memory in male J20 (PDGFB-APP&lt;sub&gt;SwInd&lt;/sub&gt;) mice. SK2 deficiency greatly reduced Aβ content in J20 mice, associated with significant improvements in epileptiform activity and cross-frequency coupling measured by hippocampal electroencephalography. However, several key measures of APP&lt;sub&gt;SwInd&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent neurodegeneration were enhanced on the SK2-null background, despite reduced Aβ burden. These included hippocampal volume loss, oligodendrocyte attrition and myelin loss, and impaired performance in Y-maze and social novelty memory tests. Inhibition of the endosomal cholesterol exporter NPC1 greatly reduced sphingosine phosphorylation in glial cells, linking loss of SK2 activity and S1P in AD to perturbed endosomal lipid metabolism. Our findings establish SK2 as an important endogenous regulator of both APP processing to Aβ, and oligodendrocyte survival, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These results urge greater consideration of the roles played by oligodendrocyte dysfunction and altered membrane lipid metabolic flux as drivers of neurodegeneration in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Genetic, neuropathological, and functional studies implicate both Aβ and altered lipid metabolism and/or signaling as key pathogenic drivers of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we first demonstrate that the enzyme SK2, which generates the signaling lipid S1P, is required for Aβ formation from APP &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Second, we establish a new role for SK2 in the protection of oligodendrocytes and myelin. Loss of SK2 sensitizes to Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration by attenuating oligodendrocyte survival and promoting hippocampal atrophy, despite reduced Aβ burden. Our findings support a model in which Aβ-independent sensitizing influences such as loss of neuroprotective S1P are more important drivers of neurodegeneration than gross Aβ concentration or plaque density.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (TIPARP) is an enzyme that adds a single ADP-ribose moiety to itself or other proteins. Tiparp is highly expressed in the brain; however, its function in this organ is unknown. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice to determine Tiparp’s role in the development of the prefrontal cortex. Loss of Tiparp resulted in an aberrant organization of the mouse cortex, where the upper layers presented increased cell density in the knock-out mice compared with wild type. Tiparp loss predominantly affected the correct distribution and number of GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, neural progenitor cell proliferation was significantly reduced. Neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice showed a slower rate of migration. Cytoskeletal components, such as α-tubulin are key regulators of neuronal differentiation and cortical development. α-tubulin mono-ADP ribosylation (MAR) levels were reduced in &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; cells, suggesting that Tiparp plays a role in the MAR of α-tubulin. Despite the mild phenotype presented by &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, our findings reveal an important function for Tiparp and MAR in the correct development of the cortex. Unravelling Tiparp’s role in the cortex, could pave the way to a better understanding of a wide spectrum of neurological diseases which are known to have increased expression of &lt;i&gt;TIPARP&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Excitatory neurons in the primary motor cortex project bilaterally to the striatum. However, whether synaptic structure and function in ipsilateral and contralateral cortico-striatal pathways is identical or different remains largely unknown. Here, we describe that excitatory synapses in the mouse contralateral pathway have higher levels of NMDA-type of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) than those in the ipsilateral pathway, although both synapses utilize the same presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). We also show that NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit, but not GluN2A, contribute to this difference. The altered NMDAR subunit composition in these two pathways results in opposite synaptic plasticity induced by -burst stimulus: long-term depression in the ipsilateral pathway and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the contralateral pathway. The standard long-term depression (LTD)-inducing protocol using paired postsynaptic and presynaptic activity triggers synaptic depression at ipsilateral pathway synapses, but not at those of the contralateral pathway. Altogether, our results provide novel and unexpected evidence for the lack of bilaterality of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission at cortico-striatal pathways due to differences in the expression of GluN2B subunits, which results in differences in bidirectional synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Literally hundreds of statisticians have rightly called for an end to statistical significance testing (Amrhein et al. 2019; Wasserstein et al. 2019). But the practice of arbitrarily thresholding p-values is not only deeply embedded in statistical practice, it is also congenial to the human mind. It is thus not sufficient to tell our students, &quot;Don’t do this.&quot; We must vividly show them why the practice is wrong and its effects detrimental to scientific progress. I offer three teaching examples I have found to be useful in prompting students to think more deeply about the problem and to begin to interpret the results of statistical procedures as measures of how evidence should change our beliefs, and not as bright lines separating truth from falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Visuomotor rotations are learned through a combination of explicit strategy and implicit recalibration. However, measuring the relative contribution of each remains a challenge and the possibility of multiple explicit and implicit components complicates the issue. Recent interest has focused on the possibility that eye movements reflect explicit strategy. Here we compared eye movements during adaptation to two accepted measures of explicit learning - verbal report and the exclusion test. We found that while reporting, all subjects showed a match between all three measures. However, when subjects did not report their intention, the eye movements of some subjects suggested less explicit adaptation than what was measured in an exclusion test. Interestingly, subjects whose eye movements did match their exclusion could be clustered into two subgroups: fully implicit learners showing no evidence of explicit adaptation and explicit learners with little implicit adaptation. Subjects showing a mix of both explicit and implicit adaptation were also those where eye movements showed less explicit adaptation than did exclusion. Thus, our results support the idea of multiple components of explicit learning as only part of the explicit learning is reflected in the eye movements. Individual subjects may use explicit components that are reflected in the eyes or those that are not or some mixture of the two. Analysis of reaction times suggests that the explicit components reflected in the eye-movements involve longer reaction times. This component, according to recent literature, may be related to mental rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Visuomotor adaptation involves both explicit and implicit components: aware re-aiming and unaware error correction. Recent studies suggest that eye movements could be used to capture the explicit component, a method that would have significant advantages over other approaches. We show that eye movements capture only one component of explicit adaptation. This component scales with reaction time while the component unrelated to eye movements does not. Our finding has obvious practical implications for the use of eye movements as a proxy for explicit learning. However, our results also corroborate recent findings suggesting the existence of multiple explicit components, and, specifically, their decomposition into components correlated with reaction time and components that are not.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional variations in oscillatory activity during human sleep remain unknown. Using the unique ability of intracranial electroencephalography to study in‐situ brain physiology, this study assesses regional variations of electroencephalographic sleep activity and creates the first atlas of human sleep using recordings from the first sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings with channels displaying physiological activity from non‐lesional tissue were selected from 91 patients of three tertiary epilepsy centers. Sections during non‐rapid eye movement sleep (N2, N3) and rapid eye movement sleep (R) were selected from the first sleep cycle for oscillatory and non‐oscillatory signal analysis. Results of 1468 channels were grouped into 38 regions covering all cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found regional differences in the distribution of sleep transients and spectral content, during all sleep stages. There was a caudo‐rostral gradient with more slow frequencies and fewer spindles in temporo‐parieto‐occipital than in frontal cortex. Moreover, deep‐seated structures showed spectral peaks differing from the baseline electroencephalogram. The regions with &amp;gt;60% of channels presenting significant rhythmic activity were either mesial or temporal basal structures that contribute minimally to the scalp EEG. Finally, during deeper sleep stages, electroencephalographic analysis revealed a more homogeneous spatial distribution, with increased coupling between high and low frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides a better understanding of the regional variability of sleep, and establishes a baseline for human sleep in all cortical regions during the first sleep cycle. Furthermore, the open‐access atlas will be a unique resource for research (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;https://mni‐open‐ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether midlife atherosclerosis is associated with different dementia subtypes and related underlying pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants comprised the cardiovascular cohort of the Swedish prospective population‐based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (N = 6,103). Carotid plaques and intima media thickness (IMT) were measured at baseline (1991–1994). Dementia incidence until 2014 was obtained from national registers. Diagnoses were reviewed and validated in medical records. In a cognitively unimpaired subcohort (n = 330), β‐amyloid&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and tau were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds were estimated on magnetic resonance imaging (2009–2015).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 20 years of follow‐up, 462 individuals developed dementia (mean age at baseline = 57.5 ± 5.9 years, 58% women). Higher IMT in midlife was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all‐cause dementia (adjusted HR = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03–1.26]) and vascular dementia (adjusted HR = 1.32 [95% CI = 1.10–1.57]) but not Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (adjusted HR = 0.95 [95% CI = 0.77–1.17]). Carotid plaques were associated with vascular dementia when assessed as a 3‐graded score (adjusted HR = 1.90 [95% CI = 1.07–3.38]). In the cognitively unimpaired subcohort (53.8 ± 4.6 years at baseline, 60% women), higher IMT in midlife was associated with development of small vessel disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.47 [95% CI = 1.05–2.06]) but not significantly with abnormal CSF AD biomarkers (adjusted OR = 1.28 [95% CI = 0.87–1.90] for Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and 1.35 [95% CI = 0.86–2.13] for Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/p‐tau). Carotid plaques revealed no significant association with any of the underlying brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings support an association between midlife atherosclerosis and development of vascular dementia and cerebral small vessel disease but not between atherosclerosis and subsequent AD dementia or AD pathology. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare response to rituximab (RTX) between adult patients positive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and aquaporin‐4 (AQP4) antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively studied adult patients with MOG or AQP4 antibodies who received RTX under an individualized dosing schedule adapted to the biological effect of RTX monitored by memory B‐cell measurement. Memory B cells were counted monthly and when relapse occurred. The biological effect of RTX was considered significant with &amp;lt;0.05% memory B cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 16 patients with MOG antibodies and 29 with AQP4 antibodies, mean follow‐up was 19 (range = 9–38) and 38 (13–79) months. Under RTX, 10 relapses occurred in 6 of 16 (37.5%) patients with MOG antibodies, and 13 occurred in 7 of 29 (24%) with AQP4 antibodies. The median time of relapse after the most recent infusion was 2.6 (0.6–5.8) and 7 (0.8–13) months, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Memory B cells had reemerged in 2 of 10 (20%) relapses in patients with MOG antibodies and 12 of 13 (92.5%) with AQP4 antibodies (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In AQP4 antibody–associated disorder, relapse mostly occurs when the biological effect of RTX decreases, which argues for treatment efficacy. In MOG antibody–associated disorder, the efficacy of RTX is not constant, because one‐third of patients showed relapse despite an effective biological effect of RTX. In this subpopulation, memory B‐cell depletion was unable to prevent relapse, which was probably caused by different immunological mechanisms. These findings should be used to improve treatment strategies for MOG antibody–associated disorder. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin &lt;i&gt;(HTT)&lt;/i&gt; gene. No disease‐modifying therapy exists for the treatment of patients with HD. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate early disease mechanisms that potentially could be used as a target therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymphocyte activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 4 cohorts of &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers (n = 121 in total) and controls was analyzed by techniques based on flow cytometry and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data of this study provide evidence of immune abnormalities before motor onset of disease. In CSF of &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers, we found increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL‐17, and increased consumption of the lymphocyte growth factor IL‐7 before motor onset of HD. In concordance, we observed an increased prevalence of IL‐17–producing Th17.1 cells in the CSF of &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers, predominantly in pre–motor manifest individuals. The frequency of intrathecal Th17.1 cells correlated negatively with progression of HD and the level of neurodegeneration, suggesting a role of Th17.1 cells in the early disease stage. We also observed a skewing in the balance between proinflammatory and regulatory T cells potentially favoring a proinflammatory intrathecal environment in &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that Th17.1 cells are implicated in the earliest pathogenic phases of HD and suggest that treatment to dampen T ‐cell–driven inflammation before motor onset might be of benefit in &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt; gene expansion carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;It is generally thought that muscle excitability is almost exclusively controlled by currents responsible for generation of action potentials. We propose that smaller ion channel currents that contribute to setting the resting potential and to subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential can also modulate excitability in important ways. These channels open at voltages more negative than the action potential threshold and are thus termed subthreshold currents. As subthreshold currents are orders of magnitude smaller than the currents responsible for the action potential, they are hard to identify and easily overlooked. Discovery of their importance in regulation of excitability opens new avenues for improved therapy for muscle channelopathies and diseases of the neuromuscular junction.

 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor proteins (NCS) transduce changes in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis into altered signaling and neuronal function. NCS-1 activity has emerged as important for neuronal viability and pathophysiology. The progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, particularly within the Substantia nigra (SN), is the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD), causing its motor symptoms. The activity-related Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis of SN DA neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic stress promote neurodegeneration and PD. In contrast, NCS-1 in general has neuroprotective effects. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed transcriptional changes in SN DA neurons upon NCS-1 loss by combining UV-laser microdissection and RT-qPCR-approaches to compare expression levels of a panel of PD and/or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-stress related genes from wildtype and NCS-1 KO mice. In NCS-1 KO, we detected significantly lower mRNA levels of mitochondrially coded ND1, a subunit of the respiratory chain, and of the neuron-specific enolase ENO2, a glycolytic enzyme. We also detected lower levels of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins UCP4 and UCP5, the PARK7 gene product DJ-1, and the voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Cav2.3 in SN DA neurons from NCS-1 KO. Transcripts of other analyzed uncoupling proteins (UCPs), mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters, PARK genes, and ion channels were not altered. As Cav channels are linked to regulation of gene expression, metabolic stress and degeneration of SN DA neurons in PD, we analyzed Cav2.3 KO mice, to address if the transcriptional changes in NCS-1 KO were also present in Cav.2.3 KO, and thus probably correlated with lower Cav2.3 transcripts. However, in SN DA neurons from Cav2.3 KO mice, ND1 mRNA as well as genomic DNA levels were elevated, while ENO2, UCP4, UCP5, and DJ-1 transcript levels were not altered. In conclusion, our data indicate a possible novel function of NCS-1 in regulating gene transcription or stabilization of mRNAs in SN DA neurons. Although we do not provide functional data, our findings at the transcript level could point to impaired ATP production (lower ND1 and ENO2) and elevated metabolic stress (lower UCP4, UCP5, and DJ-1 levels) in SN DA neurons from NCS-1 KO mice. We speculate that NCS-1 is involved in stimulating ATP synthesis, while at the same time controlling mitochondrial metabolic stress, and in this way could protect SN DA neurons from degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Estimation of individuals’ cognitive, behavioral and demographic (CBD) variables based on MRI has attracted much research interest in the past decade, and effective machine learning techniques are of great importance for these estimations. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is an attractive machine learning technique that can accommodate both single- and multi-label learning in a simple framework, while its potential for MRI-based estimations of CBD variables remains to be explored. In this study, we systemically investigated the performance of PLSR in MRI-based estimations of individuals’ CBD variables, especially its performance in simultaneous estimation of multiple CBD variables (multi-label learning). We performed the study on the dataset included in the HCP S1200 release. Resting state functional connections (RSFCs) were used as features, and a total of 10 CBD variables (e.g., age, gender, grip strength, and picture vocabulary) were estimated. The results showed that PLSR performed well in both single- and multi-label learning. In fact, the present estimations were better than those reported in literatures, as indicated by stronger correlations between the estimated and actual CBD variables, as well as high gender classification accuracy (97.8% in this study). Moreover, the RSFCs that contributed to the estimations exhibited strong correlations with the CBD variable estimated, that is, PLSR algorithm automatically selected the RSFCs closely related to one CBD variable to establish predictive models for the variable. Besides, the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs among 100, 200, and 300 regions of interest (ROIs) were higher than those based on RSFCs among 15, 25, and 50 ROIs; the estimation accuracies based on RSFCs evaluated using partial correlation were higher than those based on RSFCs evaluated using full correlation. In addition to the aforementioned virtues, PLSR is efficient in model training and testing, and it is simple and easy to use. Therefore, PLSR can be a favorable choice for future MRI-based estimations of CBD variables.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method commonly used in the disciplines of neuroscience, neurology, and neuropsychiatry to examine or modulate brain function. Low frequency rTMS (e.g., 1 Hz) is associated with a net suppression of cortical excitability, whereas higher frequencies (e.g., 5 Hz) purportedly increase excitability. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) allow investigation of neurochemistry and functional connectivity, respectively, and can assess the influence of rTMS in these domains. This pilot study investigated the effects of rTMS on the primary motor cortex using pre and post MRS and rsfMRI assessments at 7 T. Seven right-handed males (age 27 ± 7 y.o.) underwent single-voxel MRS and rsfMRI before and about 30-min after rTMS was administered outside the scanner for 20-min over the primary motor cortex of the left (dominant) hemisphere. All participants received 1-Hz rTMS; one participant additionally received 5-Hz rTMS in a separate session. Concentrations of 17 neurochemicals were quantified in left and right motor cortices. Connectivity metrics included fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) of both motor cortices, strength of related brain networks, and inter-hemispheric connectivity. The group-analysis revealed few trends (i.e., uncorrected for multiple comparisons), including a mean increase in the concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) after the inhibitory rTMS protocol as compared to baseline in the stimulated (left) motor cortex (+8%, p = 0.043), along with a slight increase of total creatine (+2%, p = 0.018), and decrease of aspartate (−18%, p = 0.016). Additionally, GABA tended to decrease in the contralateral hemisphere (−6%, p = 0.033). No other changes of metabolite concentrations were found. Whereas functional connectivity outcomes did not exhibit trends of significant changes induced by rTMS, the percent changes of few connectivity metrics in both hemispheres were negatively correlated with GABA changes in the contralateral hemisphere. While studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, our results indicate the safety and feasibility of detecting changes in key metabolites associated with neurotransmission after a single 1-Hz rTMS session, establishing the construct for future exploration of the neurochemical, and connectivity mechanisms of cortical responses to neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The electroencephalographic activity of particular brain areas during the decision making process is still little known. This paper presents results of experiments on the group of 30 patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders and 41 members of the control group. All subjects were performing the Iowa Gambling Task that is often used for decision process investigations. The electroencephalographical activity of participants was recorded using the dense array amplifier. The most frequently active Brodmann Areas were estimated by means of the photogrammetry techniques and source localization algorithms. The analysis was conducted in the full frequency as well as in alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and theta bands. Next the mean electric charge flowing through each of the most frequently active areas and for each frequency band was calculated. The comparison of the results obtained for the subjects and the control groups is presented. The difference in activity of the selected Brodmann Areas can be observed in all variants of the task. The hyperactivity of amygdala is found in both the patients and the control group. It is noted that the somatosensory association cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and primary visual cortex play an important role in the decision-making process as well. Some of our results confirm the previous findings in the fMRI experiments. In addition, the results of the electroencephalographic analysis in the broadband as well as in specific frequency bands were used as inputs to several machine learning classifiers built in Azure Machine Learning environment. Comparison of classifiers' efficiency is presented to some extent and finding the most effective classifier may be important for planning research strategy toward finding decision-making biomarkers in cortical activity for both healthy people and those suffering from psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous mental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are notoriously difficult to diagnose, especially in children. The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field toward more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a single layer perceptron (SLP) which results in improved quality of extracted features and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1, 035 subjects coming from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms other state of the art methods from 10 imaging centers with increase in classification accuracy up to 28% with maximum accuracy of 82%. The machine learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 min vs. 7 h on other methods). The implemented code is available as GPL license on GitHub portal of our lab (https://github.com/pcdslab/ASD-DiagNet).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We propose that deficits in lexical retrieval can involve difficulty in transmission of activation between processing levels, or difficulty in maintaining activation. In support, we present an investigation of picture naming by persons with aphasia in which the naming response is generated after a 1 s (sec) cue to respond in one condition or a 5 s cue to respond in another. Some individuals did better after 5 s, some did worse after 5 s, and some were not impacted by the delay. It is suggested that better performance after 5 s indicates a transmission deficit and that worse performance after 5 s indicates a maintenance deficit. To support this hypothesis, we adapted the two-step semantic-phonological model of lexical retrieval (Schwartz et al., 2006) so that it can simulate the passage of time and can simulate lesions in transmission (its semantic and phonological connection strength parameters) and/or maintenance (its decay parameter). The naming error patterns after 1 and 5 s for each participant were successfully fit to the model. Persons who did better after 5 s were found to have low connection strength parameters, persons who did worse after 5 s were simulated with an increased decay rate, and persons whose performance did not differ with delay were found to have lesions of both types. Some potential theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Haptic communication between humans plays an important role in society. Although this form of communication is ubiquitous at all levels of society and of human development, little is known about how synchronized coordination of motion between two persons leads to higher-order cognitive functions used in communication. In this study, we developed a novel experimental paradigm of a coin-collecting task in which participants used their hands to control a rod to jointly collect the coins on the screen. We characterized the haptic interactions between paired participants while they were taking part in a cooperative task. The individual participants first completed this task on their own and then with a randomly assigned partner for the cooperative task. Single participant experiments were used as a baseline to compare results of the paired participants. Forces applied to the rod were translated to four possible haptic states which encode the combination of the haptic interactions. As a next step, pairs of consecutive haptic states were then combined into 16 possible haptic signals which were classified in terms of their temporal patterns using a Tsallis q-exponential function. For paired participants, 80% of the haptic signals could be fit by the Tsallis q-exponential. On the other hand, only 30% of the signals found in the single-participant trials could be fit by the Tsallis q-exponential. This shows a clear difference in the temporal structures of haptic signals when participants are interacting with each other and when they are not. We also found a large difference in the number of haptic signals used by paired participants and singles. Single participants only used 1/4 of the possible haptic signals. Paired participants, on the other hand, used more than half of the possible signals. These results suggest that temporal structures present in haptic communication could be linked to the emergence of language at an evolutionary level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We studied the columnar and layer-specific response properties of neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of six (four females, two males) anesthetized free-tailed bats, Tadaridabrasiliensis, in response to pure tones and down and upward frequency modulated (FM; 50 kHz bandwidth) sweeps. In addition, we calculated current source density (CSD) to test whether lateral intracortical projections facilitate neuronal activation in response to FM echoes containing spectrally distant frequencies from the excitatory frequency response area (FRA). Auditory responses to a set of stimuli changing in frequency and level were recorded along 64 penetrations in the left A1 of six free-tailed bats. FRA shapes were consistent across the cortical depth within a column and there were no obvious differences in tuning properties. Generally, response latencies were shorter (&amp;lt;10 ms) for cortical depths between 500 and 600 μm, which might correspond to thalamocortical input layers IIIb–IV. Most units showed a stronger response to downward FM sweeps, and direction selectivity did not vary across cortical depth. CSD profiles calculated in response to the CF showed a current sink located at depths between 500 and 600 μm. Frequencies lower than the frequency range eliciting a spike response failed to evoke any visible current sink. Frequencies higher than the frequency range producing a spike response evoked layer IV sinks at longer latencies that increased with spectral distance. These data support the hypothesis that a progressive downward relay of spectral information spreads along the tonotopic axis of A1 via lateral connections, contributing to the neural processing of FM down sweeps used in biosonar.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Connexins (Cxs) are ubiquitous membrane proteins that are found throughout vertebrate organs, acting as building blocks of the gap junctions (GJs) known to play vital roles in the normal function of many organs. Mutations in Cx genes (particularly GJB2, which encodes Cx26) cause approximately half of all cases of congenital hearing loss in newborns. Great progress has been made in understanding GJ function and the molecular mechanisms for the role of Cxs in the cochlea. Data reveal that multiple types of Cxs work together to ensure normal development and function of the cochlea. These findings include many aspects not proposed in the classic K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; recycling theory, such as the formation of normal cochlear morphology (e.g., the opening of the tunnel of Corti), the fine-tuning of the innervation of nerve fibers to the hair cells (HCs), the maturation of the ribbon synapses, and the initiation of the endocochlear potential (EP). New data, especially those collected from targeted modification of major Cx genes in the mouse cochlea, have demonstrated that Cx26 plays an essential role in the postnatal maturation of the cochlea. Studies also show that Cx26 and Cx30 assume very different roles in the EP generation, given that only Cx26 is required for normal hearing. This article will review our current understanding of the molecular structure, cellular distribution, and major functions of cochlear GJs. Potential implications of the knowledge of cochlear GJs on the design and implementation of translational studies of cochlear gene therapies for Cx mutations are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There has been a surge of interest in the structure and function of the mammalian claustrum in recent years. However, most anatomical and physiological studies treat the claustrum as a relatively homogenous structure. Relatively little attention has been directed toward possible compartmentalization of the claustrum complex into anatomical subdivisions, and how this compartmentalization is reflected in claustrum connections with other brain structures. In this study, we examined the cyto- and myelo-architecture of the claustrum of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), to determine whether the claustrum contains internal anatomical structures or compartments, which could facilitate studies focused on understanding its role in brain function. NeuN, Nissl, calbindin, parvalbumin, and myelin-stained sections from eight adult marmosets were studied using light microscopy and serial reconstruction to identify potential internal compartments. Ultra high resolution (9.4T) post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging was employed to identify tractographic differences between identified claustrum subcompartments by diffusion-weighted tractography. Our results indicate that the classically defined marmoset claustrum includes at least two major subdivisions, which correspond to the dorsal endopiriform and insular claustrum nuclei, as described in other species, and that the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (DEnD) contains architecturally distinct compartments. Furthermore, the dorsal subdivision of the DEnD is tractographically distinguishable from the insular claustrum with respect to cortical connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The insular cortex has been linked to a multitude of functions. In contrast, the nearby claustrum is a densely connected subcortical region with unclear function. To view the insula-claustrum region from the molecular perspective we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of these areas in six adult and four fetal human brains. We identified marker genes with specific expression and performed transcriptome-wide tests for enrichment of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. In addition, specific insular and claustral expression of genes pertaining to diseases, addiction, and depression was tested. At the anatomical level, we used brain-wide analyses to determine the specificity of our results and to determine the transcriptomic similarity of the insula-claustrum region. We found UCMA to be the most significantly enriched gene in the insular cortex and confirmed specific expression of NR4A2, NTNG2, and LXN in the claustrum. Furthermore, the insula was found to have enriched expression of genes associated with mood disorders, learning, cardiac muscle contraction, oxygen transport, glutamate and dopamine signaling. Specific expression in the claustrum was enriched for genes pertaining to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe intellectual disability, epileptic encephalopathy, intracellular transport, spine development, and macroautophagy. We tested for enrichment of genes related to addiction and depression, but they were generally not highly specific to the insula-claustrum region. Exceptions include high insular expression of genes linked to cocaine abuse and genes associated with ever smoking in the claustrum. Brain-wide, we find that markers of the adult claustrum are most specifically expressed in the fetal and adult insula. Altogether, our results provide a novel molecular perspective on the unique properties of the insula and claustrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Declining serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D, a biomarker of vitamin D status] with aging is a well-recognized phenomenon. However, scarce information is available on the relation between 25(OH)D levels and cognitive performance over time in older individuals. Our purpose was to evaluate, longitudinally, the association of 25(OH)D with cognitive function in a healthy older adults’ cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Sixty-four individuals over 55 years-old with no cognitive impairment, clustered as healthy “Poor” and “Good” cognitive performers, were followed for an average of 18 months. Seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D serum levels (measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) were related, longitudinally, with cognitive (memory and general/executive) composite scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Overall seasonal-adjusted median serum 25(OH)D level was of 47 nmol/l [interquartile range (IQR), 38–60 nmol/l]. A negative correlation between baseline 25(OH)D and the general/executive composite score was found in the “Poor” cognitive performers (r&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; = −0.52, p = 0.006), an association lost after adjusting 25(OH)D levels for the season. No effect was found in both groups between seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D levels and the variation of both memory and general/executive composites during follow-up when adjusted for age, gender and education level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In this healthy older population with no cognitive impairment, lower serum levels of 25(OH)D were not longitudinally associated with poorer cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Planar cell polarity (PCP), the long-range in-plane polarization of epithelial tissues, provides directional information that guides a multitude of developmental processes at cellular and tissue levels. While it is manifest that cells utilize both intracellular and intercellular interactions, the coupling between the two modules, essential to the coordination of collective polarization, remains an active area of investigation. We propose a generalized reaction-diffusion model to study the role of intracellular interactions in the emergence of long-range polarization, and show that the nonlocality of cytoplasmic interactions, i.e. coupling of membrane proteins localized on different cell-cell junctions, is of vital importance to the faithful detection of weak directional signals, and becomes increasingly more crucial to the stability of polarization against the deleterious effects of large geometric irregularities. We demonstrate that nonlocal interactions are necessary for geometric information to become accessible to the PCP components. The prediction of the model regarding polarization in elongated tissues, is shown to be in agreement with experimental observations, where the polarity emerges perpendicular to the axis of elongation. Core PCP is adopted as a model pathway, in term of which we interpret the model parameters. To this end, we introduce three distinct classes of mutations, (I) in membrane proteins, (II) in cytoplasmic proteins, and (III) local enhancement of geometric disorder. Comparing the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; phenotypes, we show that our model successfully recapitulates the salient phenotypic features of these mutations. Exploring the parameter space helps us shed light on the role of cytoplasmic proteins in cell-cell communications, and make falsifiable predictions regarding the cooperation of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in the establishment of long-range polarization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Dn6nYNWsqt8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pallido‐nigro‐luysian (PNL) system, the primary component of cortico‐subcortical circuits, is generally spared in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We evaluated the clinicopathological features of an unusual form of ALS with PNL degeneration (PNLD) and assessed whether ALS with PNLD represents a distinct ALS subtype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a cohort of 97 autopsied cases of sporadic ALS with phosphorylated 43‐kDa TAR DNA‐binding protein (pTDP‐43) inclusions, we selected those with PNLD and analyzed their clinicopathological features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven cases (11%) that showed PNLD were divided into two subtypes depending on the lesion distribution: i) &lt;i&gt;extensive type&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) showing widespread TDP‐43 pathology and multisystem degeneration, both involving the PNL system, and ii) &lt;i&gt;limited type&lt;/i&gt; (n = 5) showing selective PNL and motor system involvement, thus being unclassifiable in terms of Brettschneiderʼs staging or Nishihiraʼs typing of ALS. The &lt;i&gt;limited type&lt;/i&gt; showed a younger age at onset and predominant PNLD that accounted for the early development of extrapyramidal signs. The &lt;i&gt;limited type&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the heaviest pathology in the subthalamus and external globus pallidus, suggesting that TDP‐43 inclusions propagated via indirect or hyperdirect pathways, unlike ALS without PNLD where the direct pathway is considered to convey TDP‐43 aggregates from the cerebral cortex to the substantia nigra.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PNL system can be involved in the disease process of ALS, either non‐selectively as part of multisystem degeneration, or selectively. ALS with selective involvement of the PNL and motor systems exhibits unique clinicopathological features and TDP‐43 propagation routes, thus representing a distinct subtype of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Electric fields can direct cell migration and are crucial during development and tissue repair. We previously reported neural precursor cells are electrosensitive cells that can undergo rapid and directed migration towards the cathode using charge-balanced electrical stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we investigate the ability of electrical stimulation to direct neural precursor migration in mouse brains &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To visualize migration, fluorescent adult murine neural precursors were transplanted onto the corpus callosum of adult male mice and intracortical platinum wire electrodes were implanted medial (cathode) and lateral (anode) to the injection site. We applied a charge-balanced biphasic monopolar stimulation waveform for 3 sessions per day, for 3 or 6 days. Irrespective of stimulation, the transplanted neural precursors had a propensity to migrate laterally along the corpus callosum, and applied stimulation affected that migration. Further investigation revealed an endogenous electric field along the corpus callosum that correlated with the lateral migration, suggesting that the applied electric field would need to overcome endogenous cues. There was no difference in transplanted cell differentiation and proliferation, or inflammatory cell numbers near the electrode leads and injection site comparing stimulated and implanted non-stimulated brains. Our results support that endogenous and applied electric fields are important considerations for designing cell therapies for tissue repair &lt;i&gt;in vivo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The study of electricity in biological environments outside of the well-known action potential is becoming more prominent. Applied electrical stimulation is used clinically and can modulate cell behaviour. Endogenous electric fields exist in the adult brain along the rostral migratory stream and disrupting them can reverse the migration direction of neural precursor cells. We demonstrate that an endogenous electric field exists on the corpus callosum which correlates with the preferred lateral migration of transplanted neural precursor cells. Endogenous electric fields in the brain provide migratory cues that can impact neural repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Model-based analyses open exciting opportunities for understanding neural information processing. In a commentary published in &lt;i&gt;eNeuro&lt;/i&gt;, Gardner &amp;amp; Liu (2019) discuss the role of model specification in interpreting results derived from complex models of neural data. As a case study, they suggest that one such analysis, the inverted encoding model (IEM), should not be used to assay properties of &quot;stimulus representations&quot; because the ability to apply linear transformations at various stages of the analysis procedure renders results &quot;arbitrary&quot;. Here, we argue that the &lt;i&gt;specification&lt;/i&gt; of all models is arbitrary to the extent that an experimenter makes choices based on current knowledge of the model system. However, the &lt;i&gt;results&lt;/i&gt; derived from any given model, such as the reconstructed channel response profiles obtained from an IEM analysis, are uniquely defined and are arbitrary only in the sense that changes in the model can predictably change results. IEM-based channel response profiles should therefore not be considered arbitrary when the model is clearly specified and guided by our best understanding of neural population representations in the brain regions being analyzed. Intuitions derived from this case study are important to consider when interpreting results from all model-based analyses, which are similarly contingent upon the specification of the models used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Gardner &amp;amp; Liu (2019) point out that linear models can provide equally good fits to data across a class of linear transforms applied during analysis. They suggest this is particularly problematic for one analysis method – the inverted encoding model – that uses activation patterns to estimate responses in modeled information channels, as this renders results arbitrary. Instead, we argue results are not arbitrary when considered in the context of a well-motivated model. Of course, changing model properties can change results, but this applies to all model-based analyses, regardless of inversion. Changing properties of models to recover desired results without disclosure is always ill-advised. When used properly, especially to compare population-level response profiles across conditions, these approaches remain useful tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze why numerous acute stroke treatments were successful in the laboratory but failed in large clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We searched all phase 3 trials of medical treatments for acute ischemic stroke and corresponding early clinical and experimental studies. We compared the overall efficacy and assessed the impact of publication bias and study design on the efficacy. Furthermore, we estimated power and true report probability of experimental studies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 50 phase 3 trials with 46,008 subjects, 75 early clinical trials with 12,391 subjects, and 209 experimental studies with &amp;gt;7,141 subjects. Three (6%) phase 3, 24 (32%) early clinical, and 143 (69.08%) experimental studies were positive. The mean treatment effect was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70–0.83) in experimental studies, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.71–1.06) in early clinical trials, and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.95–1.06) in phase 3 trials. Funnel plot asymmetry and trim‐and‐fill revealed a clear publication bias in experimental studies and early clinical trials. Study design and adherence to quality criteria had a considerable impact on estimated effect sizes. The mean power of experimental studies was 17%. Assuming a bias of 30% and pre‐study odds of 0.5 to 0.7, this leads to a true report probability of &amp;lt;50%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pivotal study design differences between experimental studies and clinical trials, including different primary end points and time to treatment, publication bias, neglected quality criteria and low power, contribute to the stepwise efficacy decline of stroke treatments from experimental studies to phase 3 clinical trials. Even under conservative estimates, less than half of published positive experimental stroke studies are truly positive. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is widely established for older generation AEDs, whereas there is limited evidence about newer AEDs. Our aim is to assess the benefit of TDM of newer generation AEDs in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing systematic with rescue TDM of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, brivaracetam, zonisamide, or pregabalin. Participants were adults with epilepsy, in whom treatment with newer generation AEDs was initiated or needed adjustment. In the systematic TDM arm, AED plasma levels were available at each appointment, whereas in the rescue TDM arm, levels were known only if a study endpoint was reached (inefficacy or adverse events). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants followed 1 year without reaching one of the predefined endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 151 participants were enrolled; global retention in the study was similar in both arms (56% overall, 58% in the systematic, and 53% in the rescue TDM arm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.6, Cox regression). There was no difference in terms of outcome regarding treatment efficacy or tolerability. Partial adherence of clinicians to TDM (adjusting or not AED dosage based on blood levels) did not explain this lack of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides class A evidence that systematic drug level monitoring of newer generation AEDs does not bring tangible benefits in the management of patients with epilepsy. Poor correlation between clinical effects and drug levels likely accounts for this finding. However, TDM is useful in several situations, such as pregnancy, as well as when there are compliance issues. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The integration of sensory with top–down cognitive signals for generating appropriate sensory–motor behaviors is an important issue in understanding the brain’s information processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that the interplay between sensory and high-level signals in oculomotor behavior could be explained by Bayesian inference. Specifically, prior knowledge for motion speed introduces a bias in the speed of smooth pursuit eye movements. The other important prediction of Bayesian inference is variability reduction by prior expectation; however, there is insufficient evidence in oculomotor behaviors to support this prediction. In the present study, we trained monkeys to switch the prior expectation about motion direction and independently controlled the strength of the motion stimulus. Under identical sensory stimulus conditions, we tested if prior knowledge about the motion direction reduced the variability of open-loop smooth pursuit eye movements. We observed a significant reduction when the prior expectation was strong; this was consistent with the prediction of Bayesian inference. Taking advantage of the open-loop smooth pursuit, we investigated the temporal dynamics of the effect of the prior to the pursuit direction bias and variability. This analysis demonstrated that the strength of the sensory evidence depended not only on the strength of the sensory stimulus but also on the time required for the pursuit system to form a neural sensory representation. Finally, we demonstrated that the variability and directional bias change by prior knowledge were quantitatively explained by the Bayesian observer model.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder categorized by severe disability in intellectual functions and affected by the loss of function of maternally inherited UBE3A gene. Mice deficient for the maternal Ube3a recapitulates many distinguishing behavioral features of the AS and is used as a typical model system to understand the disease pathogenic mechanism. Here, we first show a significant increase in HDAC1 and HDAC2 activities in AS mice brain from as early as embryonic day 16(E16). In depth study further reveals that the deficiency of Ube3a leads to transcriptional up-regulation of both HDAC1 and HDAC2. Restoration of HDAC1 and HDAC2 activities (as evident from the increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4) using simvastatin significantly improves the cognitive deficit and social interaction behavior in AS mice. Simvastatin treatment also restores the reduced level of BDNF in AS mice brain. Finally, we demonstrate that the treatment of simvastatin to primary cortical neuronal culture prepared from AS mice embryo also rescues altered acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and the level of BDNF. These results suggest that simvastatin could be a promising drug for the treatment of AS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is involved in neuronal differentiation. This study aimed to identify the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for 2-AG production during retinoic acid (RA)-induced neurite outgrowth of Neuro-2a cells. First, we confirmed that RA stimulation of Neuro-2a cells increases 2-AG production and neurite outgrowth. The diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) inhibitor DH376 blocked 2-AG production and reduced neuronal differentiation. Surprisingly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of DAGLα and DAGLβ in Neuro-2a cells did not reduce 2-AG levels, suggesting another enzyme capable of producing 2-AG in this cell line. Chemical proteomics revealed DAGLβ and α,β-hydrolase domain containing protein (ABHD6) as the only targets of DH376 in Neuro-2a cells. Biochemical, genetic and lipidomic studies demonstrated that ABHD6 possesses DAGL activity in conjunction with its previously reported monoacylglycerol lipase activity. RA treatment of Neuro-2a cells increased by three-fold the amount of active ABHD6. Our study shows that ABHD6 exhibits significant DAG lipase activity in Neuro-2a cells in addition to its known MAG lipase activity and suggest it is involved in neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has devastating implications for patients, including a high predisposition for developing chronic pain distal to the site of injury. Chronic pain develops weeks to months after injury, consequently, patients are treated after irreparable changes have occurred. Nociceptors are central to chronic pain; however, the diversity of this cellular population presents challenges to understanding mechanisms and attributing pain modalities to specific cell types. To begin to address how peripheral sensory neurons below the injury level may contribute to the below-level pain reported by SCI patients, we examined SCI-induced changes in gene expression in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) below the site of injury. SCI was performed at the T10 vertebral level, with injury produced by a vessel clip with a closing pressure of 15 g for 1 min. Alterations in gene expression produce long-term sensory changes, therefore, we were interested in studying SCI-induced transcripts before the onset of chronic pain, which may trigger changes in downstream signaling pathways and ultimately facilitate the transmission of pain. To examine changes in the nociceptor subpopulation in DRG distal to the site of injury, we retrograde labeled sensory neurons projecting to the hairy hindpaw skin with fluorescent dye and collected the corresponding lumbar (L2–L6) DRG 4 days post-injury. Following dissociation, labeled neurons were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA was extracted from sorted sensory neurons of naïve, sham, or SCI mice and sequenced. Transcript abundances validated that the desired population of nociceptors were isolated. Cross-comparisons to data sets from similar studies confirmed, we were able to isolate our cells of interest and identify a unique pattern of gene expression within a subpopulation of neurons projecting to the hairy hindpaw skin. Differential gene expression analysis showed high expression levels and significant transcript changes 4 days post-injury in SCI cell populations relevant to the onset of chronic pain. Regulatory interrelationships predicted by pathway analysis implicated changes within the synaptogenesis signaling pathway as well as networks related to inflammatory signaling mechanisms, suggesting a role for synaptic plasticity and a correlation with pro-inflammatory signaling in the transition from acute to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human psychological (cognitive and affective) dimensions can be assessed using several methods, such as physiological or performance measurements. To date, however, few studies have compared different data modalities with regard to their ability to enable accurate classification of different psychological dimensions. This study thus compares classification accuracies for four psychological dimensions and two subjective preferences about computer game difficulty using three data modalities: physiology, performance, and personality characteristics. Thirty participants played a computer game at nine difficulty configurations that were implemented via two difficulty parameters. In each configuration, seven physiological measurements and two performance variables were recorded. A short questionnaire was filled out to assess the perceived difficulty, enjoyment, valence, arousal, and the way the participant would like to modify the two difficulty parameters. Furthermore, participants’ personality characteristics were assessed using four questionnaires. All combinations of the three data modalities (physiology, performance, and personality) were used to classify six dimensions of the short questionnaire into either two, three or many classes using four classifier types: linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine (SVM), ensemble decision tree, and multiple linear regression. The classification accuracy varied widely between the different psychological dimensions; the highest accuracies for two-class and three-class classification were 97.6 and 84.1%, respectively. Normalized physiological measurements were the most informative data modality, though current game difficulty, personality and performance also contributed to classification accuracy; the best selected features are presented and discussed in the text. The SVM and multiple linear regression were the most accurate classifiers, with regression being more effective for normalized physiological data. In the future, we will further examine the effect of different classification approaches on user experience by detecting the user’s psychological state and adapting game difficulty in real-time. This will allow us to obtain a complete picture of the performance of affect-aware systems in both an offline (classification accuracy) and real-time (effect on user experience) fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transfer entropy (TE) is a model-free effective connectivity measure based on information theory. It has been increasingly used in neuroscience because of its ability to detect unknown non-linear interactions, which makes it well suited for exploratory brain effective connectivity analyses. Like all information theoretic quantities, TE is defined regarding the probability distributions of the system under study, which in practice are unknown and must be estimated from data. Commonly used methods for TE estimation rely on a local approximation of the probability distributions from nearest neighbor distances, or on symbolization schemes that then allow the probabilities to be estimated from the symbols' relative frequencies. However, probability estimation is a challenging problem, and avoiding this intermediate step in TE computation is desirable. In this work, we propose a novel TE estimator using functionals defined on positive definite and infinitely divisible kernels matrices that approximate Renyi's entropy measures of order α. Our data-driven approach estimates TE directly from data, sidestepping the need for probability distribution estimation. Also, the proposed estimator encompasses the well-known definition of TE as a sum of Shannon entropies in the limiting case when α → 1. We tested our proposal on a simulation framework consisting of two linear models, based on autoregressive approaches and a linear coupling function, respectively, and on the public electroencephalogram (EEG) database BCI Competition IV, obtained under a motor imagery paradigm. For the synthetic data, the proposed kernel-based TE estimation method satisfactorily identifies the causal interactions present in the data. Also, it displays robustness to varying noise levels and data sizes, and to the presence of multiple interaction delays in the same connected network. Obtained results for the motor imagery task show that our approach codes discriminant spatiotemporal patterns for the left and right-hand motor imagination tasks, with classification performances that compare favorably to the state-of-the-art.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain–computer interfaces (BCI) in motor imagery (MI) have developed rapidly in recent years. A reliable feature extraction method is essential because of a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and time-dependent covariates of EEG signals. Because of efficient application in various fields, deep learning has been adopted in EEG signal processing and has obtained competitive results compared with the traditional methods. However, designing and training an end-to-end network to fully extract potential features from EEG signals remains a challenge in MI.&lt;/p&gt;Approach&lt;p&gt;In this study, we propose a parallel multiscale filter bank convolutional neural network (MSFBCNN) for MI classification. We introduce a layered end-to-end network structure, in which a feature-extraction network is used to extract temporal and spatial features. To enhance the transfer learning ability, we propose a network initialization and fine-tuning strategy to train an individual model for inter-subject classification on small datasets. We compare our MSFBCNN with the state-of-the-art approaches on open datasets.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The proposed method has a higher accuracy than the baselines in intra-subject classification. In addition, the transfer learning experiments indicate that our network can build an individual model and obtain acceptable results in inter-subject classification. The results suggest that the proposed network has superior performance, robustness, and transfer learning ability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established technique for the treatment of movement and psychiatric disorders through the modulation of neural oscillatory activity and synaptic plasticity. The central thalamus (CT) has been indicated as a potential target for stimulation to enhance memory. However, the mechanisms underlying local field potential (LFP) oscillations and memory enhancement by CT-DBS remain unknown. In this study, we used CT-DBS to investigate the mechanisms underlying the changes in oscillatory communication between the CT and hippocampus, both of which are involved in spatial working memory. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from microelectrode array implanted in the CT, dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis (CA) region 1, and CA region 3. Functional connectivity (FC) strength was assessed by LFP–LFP coherence calculations for these brain regions. In addition, a T-maze behavioral task using a rat model was performed to assess the performance of spatial working memory. In DBS group, our results revealed that theta oscillations significantly increased in the CT and hippocampus compared with that in sham controls. As indicated by coherence, the FC between the CT and hippocampus significantly increased in the theta band after CT-DBS. Moreover, Western blotting showed that the protein expressions of the dopamine D1 and α4-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were enhanced, whereas that of the dopamine D2 receptor decreased in the DBS group. In conclusion, the use of CT-DBS resulted in elevated theta oscillations, increased FC between the CT and hippocampus, and altered synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, suggesting that CT-DBS is an effective approach for improving spatial working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Repurposing existing drugs represents a promising approach for successful development of acute stroke therapies. In this context, the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin has been shown to exert neuroprotection in mice due to its immunomodulatory properties. Here, we have demonstrated that acute administration of a single dose of azithromycin upon reperfusion produces a dose-dependent (ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.40 mg/kg; 95% CI = 0.48–4.03) reduction of ischemic brain damage measured 22 h after transient (2 h) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in adult male rats. Neuroprotection by azithromycin (150 mg/kg, i.p., upon reperfusion) was associated with a significant elevation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in astrocytes and neurons of the peri-ischemic motor cortex as detected after 2 and 22 h of reperfusion. By contrast, in the core region of the striatum, drug administration resulted in a dramatic elevation of STAT3 phosphorylation only after 22 h of reperfusion, being the signal mainly ascribed to infiltrating leukocytes displaying an M2 phenotype. These early molecular events were associated with a long-lasting neuroprotection, since a single dose of azithromycin reduced brain infarct damage and neurological deficit measured up to 7 days of reperfusion. These data, together with the evidence that azithromycin was effective in a clinically relevant time-window (i.e., when administered after 4.5 h of MCAo), provide robust preclinical evidence to support the importance of developing azithromycin as an effective acute therapy for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies frequently applied the spatial normalization on fMRI time series before the calculation of temporal features (here referred to as “Prenorm”). We hypothesized that calculating the rs-fMRI features, for example, functional connectivity (FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in individual space, before the spatial normalization (referred to as “Postnorm”) can be an improvement to avoid artifacts and increase the results’ reliability. We utilized two datasets: (1) simulated images where temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) is kept a constant and (2) an empirical fMRI dataset with 50 healthy young subjects. For simulated images, the tSNR is constant as generated in individual space but increased after Prenorm and intersubject variability of tSNR was induced. In contrast, tSNR was kept constant after Postnorm. Consistently, for empirical images, higher tSNR, ReHo, and FC (default mode network, seed in precuneus) and lower ALFF were found after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Coefficient of variability of tSNR and ALFF was higher after Prenorm compared to those of Postnorm. Moreover, the significant correlation was found between simulated tSNR after Prenorm and empirical tSNR, ALFF, and ReHo after Prenorm, indicating algorithmic variation in empirical rs-fMRI features. Furthermore, comparing to Prenorm, ALFF and ReHo showed higher intraclass correlation coefficients between two serial scans after Postnorm. Our results indicated that Prenorm may induce algorithmic intersubject variability on tSNR and reduce its reliability, which also significantly affected ALFF and ReHo. We suggest using Postnorm instead of Prenorm for future rs-fMRI studies using ALFF/ReHo.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Several clinical trials address demyelinating diseases via transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Published reports detail that administration of MSCs in patients may provide a beneficial immunomodulation, and that factors secreted by MSCs are potent inducers of oligodendrogenesis. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used in life science and medicine as solvent, vehicle or cryoprotectant for cells used in transplantation. Importantly, most transplantation protocols do not include the removal of DMSO before injecting the cell suspension into patients. This indifferent application of DMSO is coming under increasing scrutiny following reports investigating its potential toxic side-effects. While the impact of DMSO on the central nervous system (CNS) has been partially studied, its effect on oligodendrocytes and oligodendrogenesis has not been addressed yet. Consequently, we evaluated the influence of DMSO on oligodendrogenesis, and on the pro-oligodendrogenic effect of MSCs’ secreted factors, using adult rat neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Here, we demonstrate that a concentration of 1% DMSO robustly suppressed oligodendrogenesis and drove the fate of differentiating NSPCs toward astrogenesis. Furthermore, the pro-oligodendrogenic effect of MSC-conditioned medium (MSCCM) was also nearly completely abolished by the presence of 1% DMSO. In this condition, inhibition of the Erk1/2 signal transduction pathway and high levels of Id2 expression, a specific inhibitor of oligodendrogenic differentiation, were detected. Furthermore, inflammatory demyelinating diseases may even potentiate the impact of DMSO on oligodendrogenesis. Our results demonstrate the imperative of considering the strong anti-oligodendrogenic activity of DMSO when designing future clinical trial protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from intracranial aneurysms (IAs) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Although trigger mechanisms in the pathogenesis of IAs have not been fully elucidated, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that inflammation acts as a critical contributor to aneurysm pathogenesis. IAs is initiated by disruption and dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs) caused by abnormal wall shear stress (WSS). Subsequently, vascular inflammation can trigger a series of biochemical reactions resulting in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis and migration, accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, secretion of various cytokines, and inflammatory factors. These changes result in degradation of vascular wall, leading to the progression and eventual rupture of IAs. Increasing our knowledge of the pathogenesis of these lesions will offer physicians new options for prevention and treatment. In this study, we review aneurysmal pathogenesis to seek for safe, effective, and non-invasive therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;It was recently discovered that brain cells release extracellular vesicles (EV) which can pass from brain into blood. These findings raise the possibility that brain-derived EV’s present in blood can be used to monitor disease processes occurring in the cerebrum. Since the levels of certain micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be altered in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain, we sought to assess miRNA dysregulation in AD brain tissue and to determine if these changes were reflected in neural EVs isolated from blood of subjects with AD. To this end, we employed high-content miRNA arrays to search for differences in miRNAs in RNA pools from brain tissue of AD (n = 5), high pathological control (HPC) (n = 5), or cognitively intact pathology-free controls (n = 5). Twelve miRNAs were altered by &amp;gt;1.5-fold in AD compared to controls, and six of these were also changed compared to HPCs. Analysis of hits in brain extracts from 11 AD, 7 HPCs and 9 controls revealed a similar fold difference in these six miRNAs, with three showing statistically significant group differences and one with a strong trend toward group differences. Thereafter, we focused on the four miRNAs that showed group differences and measured their content in neurally derived blood EVs isolated from 63 subjects: 16 patients with early stage dementia and a CSF Aβ42+ tau profile consistent with AD, 16 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and an AD CSF profile, and 31 cognitively intact controls with normal CSF Aβ42+ tau levels. ROC analysis indicated that measurement of miR-132-3p in neurally-derived plasma EVs showed good sensitivity and specificity to diagnose AD, but did not effectively separate individuals with AD-MCI from controls. Moreover, when we measured the levels of a related miRNA, miR-212, we found that this miRNA was also decreased in neural EVs from AD patients compared to controls. Our results suggest that measurement of miR-132 and miR-212 in neural EVs should be further investigated as a diagnostic aid for AD and as a potential theragnostic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There are major concerns about the suitability of immersive virtual reality (VR) systems (i.e., head-mounted display; HMD) to be implemented in research and clinical settings, because of the presence of nausea, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue, and instability (i.e., VR induced symptoms and effects; VRISE). Research suggests that the duration of a VR session modulates the presence and intensity of VRISE, but there are no suggestions regarding the appropriate maximum duration of VR sessions. The implementation of high-end VR HMDs in conjunction with ergonomic VR software seems to mitigate the presence of VRISE substantially. However, a brief tool does not currently exist to appraise and report both the quality of software features and VRISE intensity quantitatively. The Virtual Reality Neuroscience Questionnaire (VRNQ) was developed to assess the quality of VR software in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Forty participants aged between 28 and 43 years were recruited (18 gamers and 22 non-gamers) for the study. They participated in 3 different VR sessions until they felt weary or discomfort and subsequently filled in the VRNQ. Our results demonstrated that VRNQ is a valid tool for assessing VR software as it has good convergent, discriminant, and construct validity. The maximum duration of VR sessions should be between 55 and 70 min when the VR software meets or exceeds the parsimonious cut-offs of the VRNQ and the users are familiarized with the VR system. Also, the gaming experience does not seem to affect how long VR sessions should last. Also, while the quality of VR software substantially modulates the maximum duration of VR sessions, age and education do not. Finally, deeper immersion, better quality of graphics and sound, and more helpful in-game instructions and prompts were found to reduce VRISE intensity. The VRNQ facilitates the brief assessment and reporting of the quality of VR software features and/or the intensity of VRISE, while its minimum and parsimonious cut-offs may appraise the suitability of VR software for implementation in research and clinical settings. The findings of this study contribute to the establishment of rigorous VR methods that are crucial for the viability of immersive VR as a research and clinical tool in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The finding of reasonably consistent spatial and temporal productions of actions across different body parts has been used to argue in favor of the existence of a high-order representation of motor programs. In these terms, a generalized motor program consists of an abstract memory structure apt to specify a class of non-specific instructions used to guide a broad range of movements (e.g., “grasp,” “bite”). Although a number of studies, using a variety of tasks, have assessed the issue of effector independence in terms of action execution, little is known regarding the issue of effector independence within an action observation context. Here corticospinal excitability (CSE) of the right hand’s first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles was assessed by means of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) during observation of a grasping action performed by the hand, the foot, the mouth, the elbow, or the knee. The results indicate that observing a grasping action performed with different body parts activates the effector typically adopted to execute that action, i.e., the hand. We contend that, as far as grasping is concerned, motor activations by action observation are evident in the muscles typically used to perform the observed action, even when the action is executed with another effector. Nevertheless, some exceptions call for a deeper analysis of motor coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The fight and flight theory and the tend-and-befriend theory suggest two opposite behavioral stress responses, and heterogeneous research results revealed the importance of taking sex into account. The experiment was designed to investigate the effect of stress-related cortisol reactivity on subsequent prosocial decision-making behaviors, and the moderating role of sex and empathic concern (EC) in the process. Sixty-one healthy students (34 women, 27 men) underwent the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G) or the control condition. Subsequently, participants completed three economic tasks—the dictator game, the ultimatum game, and the third-party compensation game. Statistical analyses revealed a significant main effect of cortisol reactivity on individuals’ third-party compensation behaviorssex. A sex-specific effect of stress-related cortisol change on prosocial behaviors was found, with men behaving more generously in the dictator game as stress-related cortisol reactivity increased. Furthermore, the level of EC was found to moderate the association between stress-related cortisol change and prosocial behaviors, that individuals with a low level of EC reported more generosity and third-party compensation behaviors. Overall, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the behavioral stress responses, that individuals whose hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are highly activated in response to stress would exhibit tend-and-befriend responses, but only among men and those with a low level of EC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;By convention, it is believed that the ipsilateral side of the body is controlled by the contralateral side of the brain. Past studies measuring brain activity primarily recorded changes before and after an intervention is performed on one side of the body within one hemisphere (usually the contralateral) of the brain. The purpose of this investigation was to observe the brain activity within the left and right hemispheres of the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices during physical and imagined, dominant and non-dominant unilateral isometric elbow flexion. Fifteen right hand dominant individuals (six males and nine females) between the ages of 18 and 21 performed four different isometric contractions of their biceps brachii at a preacher curl bench: dominant physical contraction (DomCon), non-dominant physical contraction (NonCon), dominant imagined contraction (DomImagine), and non-dominant imagined contraction (NonImagine). Each contraction was sustained for 5 s followed by 30 s of rest. Motor activity-related cortical potential (MRCP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) within the right and left hemispheres of the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortices were determined for each condition at 500–1,000 ms and 2,000–2,500 ms after initiation of contraction. MRCP and ERSP were both changed at the 500–1,000 ms time window for all conditions. Changes in the 2,000–2,500 ms window were most consistently observed during physical contractions. While the changes during DomCon occurred in the left (contralateral) side of the brain, the greatest changes observed in MRCP and ERSP occurred in both sides of the brain during the NonCon condition. Further understanding of bilateral changes in brain activity during unilateral tasks is valuable for improving rehabilitation practices through mental and physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Affective human-robot interaction requires lightweight software and cheap wearable devices that could further this field. However, the estimation of emotions in real-time poses a problem that has not yet been optimized. An optimization is proposed for the emotion estimation methodology including artifact removal, feature extraction, feature smoothing, and brain pattern classification. The challenge of filtering artifacts and extracting features, while reducing processing time and maintaining high accuracy results, is attempted in this work. First, two different approaches for real-time electro-oculographic artifact removal techniques are tested and compared in terms of loss of information and processing time. Second, an emotion estimation methodology is proposed based on a set of stable and meaningful features, a carefully chosen set of electrodes, and the smoothing of the feature space. The methodology has proved to perform on real-time constraints while maintaining high accuracy on emotion estimation on the SEED database, both under subject dependent and subject independent paradigms, to test the methodology on a discrete emotional model with three affective states.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human brain imaging studies have revealed several regions that are activated in patients with chronic pain. In rodent brains, functional changes due to chronic pain have not been fully elucidated, as brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) require the use of anesthesia to suppress movement. Consequently, conclusions derived from existing imaging studies in rodents may not accurately reflect brain activity under awake conditions. In this study, we used quantitative activation-induced manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to directly capture the previous brain activity of awake mice. We also observed and quantified the brain activity of the spared nerve injury (SNI) neuropathic pain model during awake conditions. SNI-operated mice exhibited a robust decrease of mechanical nociceptive threshold 14 days after nerve injury. Imaging on SNI-operated mice revealed increased neural activity in the limbic system and secondary somatosensory, sensory-motor, piriform, and insular cortex. We present the first study demonstrating a direct measurement of awake neural activity in a neuropathic pain mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cell-type-specific expression of molecular tools and sensors is critical to construct circuit diagrams and to investigate the activity and function of neurons within the nervous system. Strategies for targeted manipulation include combinations of classical genetic tools such as Cre/loxP and Flp/FRT, use of cis-regulatory elements, targeted knock-in transgenic mice, and gene delivery by AAV and other viral vectors. The combination of these complex technologies with the goal of precise neuronal targeting is a challenge in the lab. This report will discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of combining current technologies and establish best practices for achieving targeted manipulation of specific cell types. Novel applications and tools, as well as areas for development, will be envisioned and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Although existing computational models have identified many common driver genes, it remains challenging to identify the personalized driver genes by using samples of an individual patient. Recently, the methods of exploiting the structure-based control principles of complex networks provide new clues for identifying minimum number of driver nodes to drive the state transition of large-scale complex networks from an initial state to the desired state. However, the structure-based network control methods cannot be directly applied to identify the personalized driver genes due to the unknown network dynamics of the personalized system. Here we proposed the personalized network control model (PNC) to identify the personalized driver genes by employing the structure-based network control principle on genetic data of individual patients. In PNC model, we firstly presented a paired single sample network construction method to construct the personalized state transition network for capturing the phenotype transitions between healthy and disease states. Then, we designed a novel structure-based network control method from the Feedback Vertex Sets-based control perspective to identify the personalized driver genes. The wide experimental results on 13 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas firstly showed that PNC model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, in terms of F-measures for identifying cancer driver genes enriched in the gold-standard cancer driver gene lists. Furthermore, these results showed that personalized driver genes can be explored by their network characteristics even when they are hidden factors in transcription and mutation profiles. Our PNC gives novel insights and useful tools into understanding the tumor heterogeneity in cancer.

Surveillance plays a crucial role in preventing emerging infectious diseases from becoming epidemic. In circumstances where it is possible to monitor the infection status of certain people, transport hubs, or hospitals, early detection of the disease allows interventions to be implemented before most of the damage can occur, or at least its impact can be mitigated. This paper addresses the question of which nodes we should select in a network of individuals susceptible to some infectious disease in order to minimize the number of casualties. By simulating disease outbreaks on a collection of empirical and synthetic networks we show that the best strategy depends on topological characteristics of the network. For highly modular or spatially embedded networks it is better to place the sentinels on nodes distributed across different regions. However, if the degree heterogeneity is high, then a strategy that targets network hubs is preferred. We further consider the consequences of having an incomplete sample of the network and demonstrate that the value of new information diminishes as more data is collected. Finally we find further marginal improvements using two heuristics informed by known results in graph theory that exploit the fragmented structure of sparse network data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1b5wzGpj8o4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The sheer size of the human genome makes it improbable that identical somatic mutations at the exact same position are observed in multiple tumours solely by chance. The scarcity of cancer driver mutations also precludes positive selection as the sole explanation. Therefore, recurrent mutations may be highly informative of characteristics of mutational processes. To explore the potential, we use recurrence as a starting point to cluster &amp;gt;2,500 whole genomes of a pan-cancer cohort. We describe each genome with 13 recurrence-based and 29 general mutational features. Using principal component analysis we reduce the dimensionality and create independent features. We apply hierarchical clustering to the first 18 principal components followed by k-means clustering. We show that the resulting 16 clusters capture clinically relevant cancer phenotypes. High levels of recurrent substitutions separate the clusters that we link to UV-light exposure and deregulated activity of POLE from the one representing defective mismatch repair, which shows high levels of recurrent insertions/deletions. Recurrence of both mutation types characterizes cancer genomes with somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes and the cluster of genomes exposed to gastric acid. Low levels of recurrence are observed for the cluster where tobacco-smoke exposure induces mutagenesis and the one linked to increased activity of cytidine deaminases. Notably, the majority of substitutions are recurrent in a single tumour type, while recurrent insertions/deletions point to shared processes between tumour types. Recurrence also reveals susceptible sequence motifs, including TT[C&amp;gt;A]TTT and AAC[T&amp;gt;G]T for the POLE and ‘gastric-acid exposure’ clusters, respectively. Moreover, we refine knowledge of mutagenesis, including increased C/G deletion levels in general for lung tumours and specifically in midsize homopolymer sequence contexts for microsatellite instable tumours. Our findings are an important step towards the development of a generic cancer diagnostic test for clinical practice based on whole-genome sequencing that could replace multiple diagnostics currently in use.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sHFUUNRTSPo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Plant-derived nature products, known as herb formulas, have been commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for disease prevention and treatment. The herbs have been traditionally classified into different categories according to the TCM Organ systems known as Meridians. Despite the increasing knowledge on the active components of the herbs, the rationale of Meridian classification remains poorly understood. In this study, we took a machine learning approach to explore the classification of Meridian. We determined the molecule features for 646 herbs and their active components including structure-based fingerprints and ADME properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion), and found that the Meridian can be predicted by machine learning approaches with a top accuracy of 0.83. We also identified the top compound features that were important for the Meridian prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that molecular properties of the herb compounds are associated with the TCM Meridians. Taken together, the machine learning approach may provide novel insights for the understanding of molecular evidence of Meridians in TCM.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S4kzsCbX3qo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to improve neural function via the regulation of cortical plasticity. Its capacity to induce functional and/or anatomical repair of miswired circuits is unknown. Ten-m3 knockout (KO) mice exhibit a highly-stereotyped and profound miswiring of ipsilateral retinogeniculate axons and associated deficits in binocularly-mediated visual behaviour. We determined whether, and when, EE can drive the repair of subcortical wiring deficits by analysing Ten-m3 KO and wildtype mice that were enriched for 6 weeks from adulthood, weaning or birth in comparison to standard-housed controls. Six weeks of EE initiated from birth, but not later, induced a significant reduction in the area occupied by ipsilateral retinogeniculate terminals in KOs enriched from birth. No EE-induced correction of mistargeted axons was observed at postnatal day 7, indicating that this intervention impacts pruning rather than initial targeting of axons. This reduction was most prominent in the ventrolateral region of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, suggesting a preferential pruning of the most profoundly mistargeted axons. EE can thus partially repair a specific, subcortical axonal wiring deficit, but only during an early, developmentally-restricted time-window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The incorrect wiring of neural circuits can lead to profound disability. Using a mouse model which exhibits a marked miswiring of neural projections to subcortical relay centres of the brain, we show that positive modulation (enrichment) of the environment during the first few postnatal weeks can induce the pruning of aberrant neural projections. The capacity for environmental enrichment to correct miswired projections diminished prior to adolescence, suggesting that the enrichment can only drive these changes during an early critical period. This expands our knowledge of the capacity for enrichment to induce repair of neural circuits. The demonstration of dramatic effects on targeting of neural projections over a restricted period may have implications for the development of therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to contact and collision sports, including American football. We hypothesized a dose–response relationship between duration of football played and CTE risk and severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a convenience sample of 266 deceased American football players from the Veterans Affairs–Boston University–Concussion Legacy Foundation and Framingham Heart Study Brain Banks, we estimated the association of years of football played with CTE pathological status and severity. We evaluated the ability of years played to classify CTE status using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Simulation analyses quantified conditions that might lead to selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, 223 of 266 participants met neuropathological diagnostic criteria for CTE. More years of football played were associated with having CTE (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30 per year played, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19–1.41; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;) and with CTE severity (severe vs mild; OR = 1.14 per year played, 95% CI = 1.07–1.22; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;). Participants with CTE were 1/10th as likely to have played &amp;lt;4.5 years (negative likelihood ratio [LR] = 0.102, 95% CI = 0.100–0.105) and were 10 times as likely to have played &amp;gt;14.5 years (positive LR = 10.2, 95% CI = 9.8–10.7) compared with participants without CTE. Sensitivity and specificity were maximized at 11 years played. Simulation demonstrated that years played remained adversely associated with CTE status when years played and CTE status were both related to brain bank selection across widely ranging scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odds of CTE double every 2.6 years of football played. After accounting for brain bank selection, the magnitude of the relationship between years played and CTE status remained consistent. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The prevailing paradigm for the analysis of biological data involves comparing groups of replicates from different conditions (e.g. control and treatment) to statistically infer features that discriminate them (e.g. differentially expressed genes). However, many situations in modern genomics such as single-cell omics experiments do not fit well into this paradigm because they lack true replicates. In such instances, spectral techniques could be used to rank features according to their degree of consistency with an underlying metric structure without the need to cluster samples. Here, we extend spectral methods for feature selection to abstract simplicial complexes and present a general framework for clustering-independent analysis. Combinatorial Laplacian scores take into account the topology spanned by the data and reduce to the ordinary Laplacian score when restricted to graphs. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with several applications to the analysis of gene expression and multi-modal genomic data. Specifically, we perform differential expression analysis in situations where samples cannot be grouped into distinct classes, and we disaggregate differentially expressed genes according to the topology of the expression space (e.g. alternative paths of differentiation). We also apply this formalism to identify genes with spatial patterns of expression using fluorescence in-situ hybridization data and to establish associations between genetic alterations and global expression patterns in large cross-sectional studies. Our results provide a unifying perspective on topological data analysis and manifold learning approaches to the analysis of large-scale biological datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2bPoyHJP3uw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Seasonal influenza results in substantial annual morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013/2014 season. In the 2017/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is determined by maximizing overall ensemble accuracy over past seasons. In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eMce6xkJIF4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

External perturbation forces may compromise standing balance. The nervous system can intervene only after a delay greater than 100 ms, during which the body falls freely. With ageing, sensorimotor delays are prolonged, posing a critical threat to balance. We study a generic model of stabilisation with neural delays to understand how the organism should adapt to challenging balance conditions. The model suggests that ankle stiffness should be increased in anticipation of perturbations, for example by muscle co-contraction, so as to slow down body fall during the neural response delay. Increased ankle muscle co-contraction is indeed observed in young adults when standing in challenging balance conditions, and in older relative to young adults during normal stance. In parallel, the analysis of the model shows that increases in either stiffness or neural delay must be coordinated with decreases in spinal sensorimotor gains, otherwise the feedback itself becomes destabilizing. Accordingly, a decrease in spinal feedback is observed in challenging conditions, and with age-related increases in neural delay. These observations have been previously interpreted as indicating an increased reliance on cortical rather than spinal control of balance, despite the fact that cortical responses have a longer latency. Our analysis challenges this interpretation by showing that these observations are consistent with a functional coadaptation of spinal feedback gains to functional changes in stiffness and neural delay.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ons7ZPkKFWY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Infections are a serious health concern worldwide, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the immunocompromised, elderly, and young. Advances in metagenomic sequencing availability, speed, and decreased cost offer the opportunity to supplement or even replace culture-based identification of pathogens with DNA sequence-based diagnostics. Adopting metagenomic analysis for clinical use requires that all aspects of the workflow are optimized and tested, including data analysis and computational time and resources. We tested the accuracy, sensitivity, and resource requirements of three top metagenomic taxonomic classifiers that use fast k-mer based algorithms: Centrifuge, CLARK, and KrakenUniq. Binary mixtures of bacteria showed all three reliably identified organisms down to 1% relative abundance, while only the relative abundance estimates of Centrifuge and CLARK were accurate. All three classifiers identified the organisms present in their default databases from a mock bacterial community of 20 organisms, but only Centrifuge had no false positives. In addition, Centrifuge required far less computational resources and time for analysis. Centrifuge analysis of metagenomes obtained from samples of VAP, infected DFUs, and FN showed Centrifuge identified pathogenic bacteria and one virus that were corroborated by culture or a clinical PCR assay. Importantly, in both diabetic foot ulcer patients, metagenomic sequencing identified pathogens 4–6 weeks before culture. Finally, we show that Centrifuge results were minimally affected by elimination of time-consuming read quality control and host screening steps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9p_4mLbCm9o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Febrile seizures may follow vaccination. Common variants in the sodium channel gene, &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt;, are associated with febrile seizures and rare pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; cause the severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy Dravet Syndrome. Following vaccination, febrile seizures may raise the spectre of poor outcome and inappropriately implicate vaccination as the cause. We aimed to determine the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; variants in children having their first febrile seizure either proximal to vaccination, or unrelated to vaccination compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; sequencing, blind to clinical category, in a prospective cohort of children presenting with their first febrile seizure as vaccine proximate (n=69), or as non‐vaccine proximate (n=75), and children with no history of seizures (n=90) recruited in Australian paediatric hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We detected two pathogenic variants in vaccine proximate cases (p.R568X and p.W932R), both of whom developed Dravet syndrome, and one in a non‐vaccine proximate case (p.V947L) who had Febrile seizures plus from 9 months. All had generalised tonic‐clonic seizures lasting longer than 15 minutes. We also found enrichment of a reported risk allele, rs6432860‐T, in children with febrile seizures compared to controls (Odds Ratio 1.91 [95% CI 1.31‐ 2.81]).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; variants may be identified in infants with vaccine proximate febrile seizures. As early diagnosis of Dravet syndrome is essential for optimal management and outcome. &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; sequencing in infants with prolonged febrile seizures, proximate to vaccination, should become routine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) are highly variable. We aim to determine the long‐term clinical outcomes in MS, and to identify early prognostic features of these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred thirty‐two people presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome were prospectively recruited between 1984 and 1987, and followed up clinically and radiologically 1, 5, 10, 14, 20, and now 30 years later. All available notes and magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed, and MS was defined according to the 2010 McDonald criteria.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical outcome data were obtained in 120 participants at 30 years. Eighty were known to have developed MS by 30 years. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were available in 107 participants, of whom 77 had MS; 32 (42%) remained fully ambulatory (EDSS scores ≤3.5), all of whom had relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 3 (4%) had RRMS and EDSS scores &amp;gt;3.5, 26 (34%) had secondary progressive MS (all had EDSS scores &amp;gt;3.5), and MS contributed to death in 16 (20%). Of those with MS, 11 received disease‐modifying therapy. The strongest early predictors (within 5 years of presentation) of secondary progressive MS at 30 years were presence of baseline infratentorial lesions and deep white matter lesions at 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after onset, in a largely untreated cohort, there was a divergence of MS outcomes; some people accrued substantial disability early on, whereas others ran a more favorable long‐term course. These outcomes could, in part, be predicted by radiological findings from within 1 year of first presentation. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the network dynamics mechanisms underlying differential initiation of epileptic interictal spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed combined in vivo 2‐photon calcium imaging from different targeted neuronal subpopulations and extracellular electrophysiological recordings during 4‐aminopyridine–induced neocortical spikes and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both spikes and seizures were associated with intense synchronized activation of excitatory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) and to a lesser degree layer 4 neurons, as well as inhibitory parvalbumin‐expressing interneurons (INs). In sharp contrast, layer 5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs were gradually and asynchronously recruited into the ictal activity during the course of seizures. Within layer 2/3, the main difference between onset of spikes and seizures lay in the relative recruitment dynamics of excitatory PNs compared to parvalbumin‐ and somatostatin‐expressing inhibitory INs. Whereas spikes exhibited balanced recruitment of PNs and parvalbumin‐expressing INs, during seizures IN responses were reduced and less synchronized than in layer 2/3 PNs. Similar imbalance was not observed in layers 4 or 5 of the neocortex. Machine learning–based algorithms we developed were able to distinguish spikes from seizures based solely on activation dynamics of layer 2/3 PNs at discharge onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During onset of seizures, the recruitment dynamics markedly differed between neuronal subpopulations, with rapid synchronous recruitment of layer 2/3 PNs, layer 4 neurons, and parvalbumin‐expressing INs and gradual asynchronous recruitment of layer 5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs. Seizures initiated in layer 2/3 due to a dynamic mismatch between local PNs and inhibitory INs, and only later spread to layer 5 by gradually and asynchronously recruiting PNs in this layer.

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical slow oscillations (≲1 Hz) are an emergent property of the cortical network that integrate connectivity and physiological features. This rhythm, highly revealing of the characteristics of the underlying dynamics, is a hallmark of low complexity brain states like sleep, and represents a default activity pattern. Here, we present a methodological approach for quantifying the spatial and temporal properties of this emergent activity. We improved and enriched a robust analysis procedure that has already been successfully applied to both in vitro and in vivo data acquisitions. We tested the new tools of the methodology by analyzing the electrocorticography (ECoG) traces recorded from a custom 32-channel multi-electrode array in wild-type isoflurane-anesthetized mice. The enhanced analysis pipeline, named SWAP (Slow Wave Analysis Pipeline), detects Up and Down states, enables the characterization of the spatial dependency of their statistical properties, and supports the comparison of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way, allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects, or with different recording tools), as well as to the outcome of numerical simulations. By using the SWAP, we report statistically significant differences in the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites. Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an oblique axis directed from fronto-lateral toward occipito-medial regions, further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results obtained using the SWAP will be essential for producing data-driven brain simulations. A spatial characterization of slow oscillations will also trigger a discussion on the role of, and the interplay between, the different regions in the cortex, improving our understanding of the mechanisms of generation and propagation of delta rhythms and, more generally, of cortical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is a state-of-the-art tool for interrogating neural circuits. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells serve as the sole output of the cerebellar cortex where they synapse on neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). To investigate the properties of this synaptic connection, we sought to elicit time-locked single action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. Using optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing Purkinje cells combined with patch-clamp recordings of Purkinje cells and DCN neurons in acute cerebellar slices, we determine the photostimulation parameters required to elicit single time-locked action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. We show that axons require longer light pulses than somata do to elicit single action potentials and that Purkinje cell axons are also more susceptible to light perturbations. We then demonstrate that these empirically determined photostimulation parameters elicit time-locked synaptic currents from postsynaptic cells in the DCN. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing optogenetic stimulation conditions to interrogate synaptic connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a challenging clinical problem worldwide. The cellular state and molecular expression in spinal cord tissue after injury are extremely complex and closely related to functional recovery. However, the spatial and temporal changes of gene expression and regulation in various cell types after SCI are still unclear. Here, we collected the rostral and caudal regions to the lesion at 11 time points over a period of 28 days after rat hemisection SCI. Combining whole-transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spinal cord tissue from injured and sham-operated animals. Significantly altered biological processes were enriched from DEGs in astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, immune cells, and vascular systems after SCI. We then identified dynamic trends in these processes using the average expression profiles of DEGs. Gene expression and regulatory networks for selected biological processes were also constructed to illustrate the complicate difference between rostral and caudal tissues. Finally, we validated the expressions of some key genes from these networks, including α-synuclein, heme oxygenase 1, bone morphogenetic protein 2, activating transcription factor 3, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Collectively, we provided a comprehensive network of gene expression and regulation to shed light on the molecular characteristics of critical biological processes that occur after SCI, which will broaden the understanding of SCI and facilitate clinical therapeutics for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as master switch regulators in many biological processes in health and disease, including neuropathy. miRNAs are commonly quantified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), usually estimated as relative expression through reference genes normalization. Different non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are used for miRNA normalization; however, there is no study identifying the optimal reference genes in animal models for peripheral nerve injury. We evaluated the stability of eleven ncRNAs, commonly used for miRNA normalization, in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), dorsal horn of the spinal cord (dhSC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the mouse spared nerve injury (SNI) model. After RT-qPCR, the stability of each ncRNA was determined by using four different methods: BestKeeper, the comparative delta-Cq method, geNorm, and NormFinder. The candidates were rated according to their performance in each method and an overall ranking list was compiled. The most stable ncRNAs were: sno420, sno429, and sno202 in DRG; sno429, sno202, and U6 in dhSC; sno202, sno420, and sno142 in mPFC. We provide the first reference genes’ evaluation for miRNA normalization in different neuronal tissues in an animal model of peripheral nerve injury. Our results underline the need for careful selection of reference genes for miRNA normalization in different tissues and experimental conditions. We further anticipate that our findings can be used in a broad range of nerve injury related studies, to ensure validity and promote reproducibility in miRNA quantification.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) plays an important role in rapid synaptic inhibition in mammalian spinal cord, brainstem, higher brain centers, and is involved in transmission of nociceptive signals. Glucose and related mono- and disaccharides potentiate currents mediated by recombinant α1, α1-β, and α3 GlyRs. Here, we confirmed the specific potentiation of α3 GlyR signaling by glucose through: (i) patch-clamp electrophysiology on recombinant receptors; and (ii) by verifying in vitro data in a mouse model in vivo. Mice were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with glucose (2 g/kg) or vehicle, and then challenged with sublethal doses of strychnine (0.2 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg). Pain-related behavior was assessed using two established models: (i) touch sensitivity tests using von Frey filaments; and (ii) hotplate assay. We observed a reduction of pain sensitivity in glucose-treated mice relative to vehicle-treated control mice. Injection of strychnine resulted in an increased sensitivity to tactile and heat stimuli, which was reversed in the presence of glucose. Analgesic effects of glucose were more pronounced in von Frey experiments, consistent with the established use of this model for neuropathic pain. Overall, glucose showed mild analgesic effects and was able to compensate for strychnine-induced allodynia in mice. Since the action of strychnine is specific for GlyR, these experiments show for the first time an in vivo potentiation of GlyR activity by glucose and suggest a molecular mechanism for glucose-mediated analgesia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;To determine the relationship between alterations in resting state functional connectivity and social cognition dysfunction among patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven participants (FTD = 10, AD = 18, PD = 19, and HC = 10) underwent structural and functional imaging and completed the Awareness of Social Inference Test-Emotion Evaluation Test (TASIT-EET), Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scale, Revised Self-Monitoring Scale (RSMS), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ). A multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA) was carried out to determine activation differences between the groups. The clusters from the MVPA were used as seeds for the ROI-to-voxel analysis. Relationship between social cognition deficits and uncinate integrity was also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;BOLD signal activation differed among the four groups of AD, PD, FTD, and HC in the left inferior temporal gyrus-anterior division [L-ITG (ant)], right central opercular cortex (R-COp), right supramarginal gyrus, posterior division (R-SMG, post), right angular gyrus (R-AG), and R-ITG. The BOLD co-activation of the L-ITG (ant) with bilateral frontal pole (FP) and paracingulate gyrus was positively associated with IRI-perspective taking (PT) (r = 0.38, p = 0.007), SNQ total (r = 0.37, p = 0.009), and TASIT-EET (r = 0.47, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with neurodegenerative diseases showed alterations in connectivity in brain regions important for social cognition compared with HCs. Functional connectivity correlated with performance on social cognition tasks and alterations could be responsible for some of the social cognition deficits observed in all neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Usher’s syndrome is the most common combined blindness–deafness disorder with USH1B, caused by mutations in MYO7A, resulting in the most severe phenotype. The existence of numerous, naturally occurring shaker1 mice harboring variable MYO7A mutations on different genetic backgrounds has complicated the characterization of MYO7A knockout (KO) and heterozygote mice. We generated a novel MYO7A KO mouse (Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) that is easily genotyped, maintained, and confirmed to be null for MYO7A in both the eye and inner ear. Like USH1B patients, Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice are profoundly deaf, and display near complete loss of inner and outer cochlear hair cells (HCs). No gross structural changes were observed in vestibular HCs. Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited modest declines in retinal function but, unlike patients, no loss of retinal structure. We attribute the latter to differential expression of MYO7A in mouse vs. primate retina. Interestingly, heterozygous Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice had reduced numbers of cochlear HCs and concomitant reductions in auditory function relative to Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; controls. Notably, this is the first report that loss of a single Myo7a allele significantly alters auditory structure and function and suggests that audiological characterization of USH1B carriers is warranted. Maintenance of vestibular HCs in Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice suggests that gene replacement could be used to correct the vestibular dysfunction in USH1B patients. While Myo7a&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mice do not exhibit sufficiently robust retinal phenotypes to be used as a therapeutic outcome measure, they can be used to assess expression of vectored MYO7A on a null background and generate valuable pre-clinical data toward the treatment of USH1B.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cognitive dysfunction is a very severe consequence of diabetes, but the underlying causes are still unclear. Recently, the cerebellum was reported to play an important role in learning and memory. Since long-term depression (LTD) is a primary cellular mechanism for cerebellar motor learning, we aimed to explore the role of cerebellar LTD pathways in diabetic rats and the therapeutic effect of gastrodin. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin into adult Sprague–Dawley rats. Motor learning ability was assessed by a beam walk test. Pathological changes of the cerebellum were assessed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Nissl staining. Cellular apoptosis was assessed by anti-caspase-3 immunostaining. Protein expression levels of LTD pathway-related factors, including GluR2, protein kinase C (PKC), NR2A, and nNOS, in the cerebellar cortex were evaluated by western blotting and double immunofluorescence. The NO concentration was measured. The cellular degeneration and the apoptosis of Purkinje cells were evident in the cerebellum of diabetic rats. Protein expression levels of GluR2 (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.81 ± 0.07), PKC (NC9W: 1.66 ± 0.10; DM9W + S: 0.58 ± 0.19), NR2A (NC9W: 1.40 ± 0.05; DM9W + S: 0.63 ± 0.06), nNOS (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.68 ± 0.04), and NO (NC9W: 135.61 ± 31.91; DM9W + S: 64.06 ± 24.01) in the cerebellum were significantly decreased in diabetic rats. Following gastrodin intervention, the outcome of motor learning ability was significantly improved (NC9W: 6.70 ± 3.31; DM9W + S: 20.47 ± 9.43; DM9W + G: 16.04 ± 7.10). In addition, degeneration and apoptosis were ameliorated, and this was coupled with the elevation of the protein expression of the abovementioned biomarkers. Arising from the above, we concluded that gastrodin may contribute to the improvement of motor learning by protecting the LTD pathways in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We evaluated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in two different montages could improve picture naming abilities in participants with anomic Alzheimer Disease or Frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Utilizing a double-blind cross-over design, twelve participants were trained on picture naming over a series of 10 sessions with 30 min of anodal (2 mA) tDCS stimulation to either the left inferior parietotemporal region (P3), the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3), or sham stimulation. We evaluated performance on a trained picture naming list, an equivalent novel untrained list, and additional neuropsychological tasks.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For trained item picture naming, significantly larger improvement was seen for real stimulation vs. sham stimulation for both the DLPFC and left inferior parieto-temporal stimulation montages at the end of the stimulation sessions. The parieto-temporal montage remained superior to sham 2 weeks poststimulation. Significant improvement vs. sham was also seen for novel “untrained” item picture naming 2 weeks post-stimulation when the parieto-temporal montage was given, whereas no change was observed when the DLPFC montage was given. Finally, comparing groups when they received the parieto-temporal montage, participants with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) showed the least improvement for untrained items after their sessions. Scores on the additional neuropsychological tasks were unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;tDCS stimulation has promise as a treatment for individuals with anomia arising from neurodegenerative disease, but its effectiveness can vary depending on the training given, the montage location used, as well as a participants’ diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to explore the composition of the fecal microflora of Chinese Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, as well as to explore links between PD clinical features and antiparkinsonian medications on the gut microflora. Seventy-two PD cases [59 patients suffering from PD for &amp;gt;1 year (OPD) and 13 new PD (NPD) patients] were studied. Microflora communities in the feces of the patients and corresponding healthy controls (HCs) were examined using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The gut microflora of OPD patients contained high levels of Rikenellaceae compared to corresponding HCs. In addition, significantly higher levels of Turicibacteraceae were found in the NPD group compared to the corresponding HCs. The genera Turicibacter and Prevotella were significantly correlated with the PD severity scores. Our findings that some fecal microflora were closely related to PD clinical characteristics may enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stereotypes exist in the interactions between different social groups, and gender stereotypes are particularly prevalent. Previous studies have suggested that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in the social cognition that plays an important role in gender stereotypes, but the specific causal effect of the mPFC remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to identify a direct link between the mPFC and gender bias. Implicit stereotypes were measured by the gender implicit association test (IAT), and explicit prejudice was measured by the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI). We found that male and female participants had different behavioral and neural correlates of gender stereotypes. Anodal tDCS significantly reduced male participants’ gender D-IAT scores compared with cathodal and sham stimulation, while the stimulation had an insignificant effect in female participants. The reduction in male participants’ gender bias mainly resulted from a decrease in the difference in reaction time (RT) between congruent and incongruent blocks. Regarding the explicit bias measurement, male and female participants had distinct attitudes, but tDCS had no effect on ASI. Our results revealed that the mPFC played a causal role in controlling implicit gender stereotypes, which is consistent with previous observations and complements past lesion, neuroimaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies and suggests that males and females have different neural bases for gender stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The acquisition and retention of motor skills is necessary for everyday functioning in the elderly and may be critical in the context of motor rehabilitation. Recent studies indicate that motor training closely followed by sleep may result in better engagement of procedural (“how to”) memory consolidation processes in the elderly. Nevertheless, elderly individuals are mostly morning oriented and a common practice is to time rehabilitation programs to morning hours. Here, we tested whether the time-of-day wherein training is afforded (morning, 8–10:30 a.m., or evening, 6–9 p.m.) affects the long-term outcome of a multi-session motor practice program (10 sessions across 3–4 weeks) in healthy elderly participants. Twenty-nine (15 women) older adults (60–75 years) practiced an explicitly instructed five-element key-press sequence by repeatedly generating the sequence “as fast and accurately as possible.” The groups did not differ in terms of sleep habits and quality (1-week long actigraphy); all were morning-oriented individuals. All participants gained robustly from the intervention, shortening sequence tapping duration and retaining the gains (&amp;gt; 90%) at 1-month post-intervention, irrespective of the time-of-day of training. However, retesting at 7-months post-intervention showed that the attrition of the training induced gains was more pronounced in the morning trained group compared to the evening group (76 and 56.5% loss in sequence tapping time; 7/14 and 3/14 participants showed a &amp;gt; 5% decline in accuracy relative to end of training, respectively). Altogether, the results show that morning-oriented older adults effectively acquired skill in the performance of a sequence of finger movements, in both morning and evening practice sessions. However, evening training leads to a significant advantage, over morning training, in the long-term retention of the skill. Evening training should be considered an appropriate time window for motor skill learning in older adults, even in individuals with morning chronotype. The results are in line with the notion that motor training preceding a sleep interval may be better consolidated into long-term memory in the elderly, and thus result in lower forgetting rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with sensory, motor and cognitive impairments that may lead to reduced daily life functioning including gait disturbances, falls, injuries and mobility restrictions. A strong need exists for implementing effective evidence-based interventions for healthy aging. Therefore, the aim of this study was to (i) evaluate the feasibility and usability of an in-home multicomponent exergame training and (ii) explore its effects on physical functions, cognition and cortical activity. Twenty-one healthy and independently living older adults were included (11 female, 74.4 ± 7.0 years, range: 65–92 years) and performed 24 trainings sessions (each 40 min) over eight weeks. The first part was conducted in a living lab (home-like laboratory environment), the second part at participants’ home. The multicomponent exergame included Tai Chi-inspired exercises, dance movements and step-based cognitive games to train strength, balance and cognition. Attendance and attrition rates were calculated and safety during training was evaluated to determine feasibility. Participants rated the usability of the exergame (System Usability Scale) and reported on their game experience (Game Experience Questionnaire). Physical and cognitive functions and cortical activity (resting state electroencephalopathy) were assessed pre and post intervention. Results showed a high training attendance rate for the living lab and the home-based setting (91.7 and 91.0%, respectively) with a rather high attrition rate (28.6%, six drop-outs). Half of the drop-out reasons were related to personal or health issues. System usability was rated acceptable with a mean score of 70.6/100. Affective game experience was rated favorable. Significant improvements were found for minimal toe clearance, short-term attentional span, and information processing speed (p &amp;lt; 0.05). No significant pre-post differences were found for cortical activity. To summarize, the exergame is generally feasible and usable for healthy older adults applied in an in-home setting and provides an overall positive emotional game experience. Nevertheless, flawless technical functionality should be a mandatory consideration. Additionally, the training might have potential positive influence on specific functions in older adults. However, the efficacy has to be evaluated in a future randomized controlled trial assessing the behavioral and neuroplastic changes in a larger population after a longer training period.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Dengue and influenza-like illness (ILI) are two of the leading causes of viral infection in the world and it is estimated that more than half the world’s population is at risk for developing these infections. It is therefore important to develop accurate methods for forecasting dengue and ILI incidences. Since data from multiple sources (such as dengue and ILI case counts, electronic health records and frequency of multiple internet search terms from Google Trends) can improve forecasts, standard time series analysis methods are inadequate to estimate all the parameter values from the limited amount of data available if we use multiple sources. In this paper, we use a computationally efficient implementation of the known variable selection method that we call the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio (ARLR) method. This method combines sparse representation of time series data, electronic health records data (for ILI) and Google Trends data to forecast dengue and ILI incidences. This sparse representation method uses an algorithm that maximizes an appropriate likelihood ratio at every step. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method recovers the underlying sparse model much more accurately than the lasso method. We apply our method to dengue case count data from five countries/states: Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand and to ILI case count data from the United States. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing time series forecasting methods in forecasting the dengue and ILI case counts. In particular, our method gives a 18 percent forecast error reduction over a leading method that also uses data from multiple sources. It also performs better than other methods in predicting the peak value of the case count and the peak time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RY7VezuN2ss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The development of the brain is shaped by a myriad of factors among which neurotransmitters play remarkable roles before and during the formation and maturation of synaptic circuits. Cellular processes such as neurogenesis, morphological development, synaptogenesis and maturation of synapses are temporary and spatially regulated by the local or distal influence of neurotransmitters in the developing cortex. Thus, research on this area has contributed to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of brain development and to shed light on the etiology of various human neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome (RTT), among others. Recently, the field of neuroscience has been shaken by an explosive advance of experimental approaches linked to the use of induced pluripotent stem cells and reprogrammed neurons. This new technology has allowed researchers for the first time to model in the lab the unique events that take place during early human brain development and to explore the mechanisms that cause synaptopathies. In this context, the role of neurotransmitters during early stages of cortex development is beginning to be re-evaluated and a revision of the state of the art has become necessary in a time when new protocols are being worked out to differentiate stem cells into functional neurons. New perspectives on reconsidering the function of neurotransmitters include opportunities for methodological advances, a better understanding of the origin of mental disorders and the potential for development of new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Serotonylation, the covalent linkage of serotonin to proteins has been discovered more than 60 years ago but only recently the mechanisms and first functions have been elucidated. It has been found that transglutaminases (TG) such as TG2 and the blood coagulation factor XIIIa are the enzymes which catalyze the linkage of serotonin and other monoamines to distinct glutamine (Gln) residues of target proteins. The first target proteins, small G-proteins and extracellular matrix constituents, were found in platelets and are pivotally involved in platelet aggregation and the formation of thrombi. The serotonylation of the same proteins is also involved in insulin secretion and in the proliferation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and thereby in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Recently histones have been described as targets of serotonylation opening the area of transcriptional control to this posttranslational protein modification. Future studies will certainly reveal further target proteins, signaling pathways, cellular processes, and diseases, in which serotonylation or, more general, monoaminylation is important.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The pathological aggregation of tau characterizes a set of neurodegenerative diseases collectively referred to as tauopathies. Recent studies using cellular and animal models have suggested that tau pathology progresses by trans-cellular propagation. The process of propagation is mediated by certain species of extracellular tau, which are taken up by recipient cells and serve as a seed for tau aggregation. Tau propagation is currently one of the most active areas of research in dementia. Previous efforts to identify the specific tau molecules involved in propagation have suggested that multiple forms of tau with different molecular weights derived from recombinant tau or brain lysates exert seeding activity. Nonetheless, the molecular characteristics of the “extracellular” seed-competent tau as well as its release mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Given that tau is physiologically released into the extracellular space, it is critical to distinguish seed-competent tau from normal monomeric tau. Utilizing biosensor cells expressing P301S mutant tau fused to CFP/YFP, here we discriminated between seed-competent tau and inert monomer tau released from HEK293 cells. By analyzing the size-exclusion fractions of the media, we found that seed-competent tau was enriched in high molecular weight fractions of &amp;gt;2,000 kDa, while the majority of soluble tau in the media positively detected by ELISA was in low molecular weight fractions. We also found that lysosomal stress not only increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent release of seed-competent tau but also altered its molecular size. Inhibiting lysosomal exocytosis specifically decreased release of seed-competent tau without influencing total tau. These data underscore the differential response of seed-competent tau and inert tau to lysosomal stress and indicates the presence of distinct release mechanisms via lysosomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stroke patients often use trunk to compensate for impaired upper limb motor function during upper limb rehabilitation training, which results in a reduced rehabilitation training effect. Detecting trunk compensations can improve the effect of rehabilitation training. This study investigates the feasibility of a surface electromyography-based trunk compensation detection (sEMG-bTCD) method. Five healthy subjects and nine stroke subjects with cognitive and comprehension skills were recruited to participate in the experiments. The sEMG signals from nine superficial trunk muscles were collected during three rehabilitation training tasks (reach-forward-back, reach-side-to-side, and reach-up-to-down motions) without compensation and with three common trunk compensations [lean-forward (LF), trunk rotation (TR), and shoulder elevation (SE)]. Preprocessing like filtering, active segment detection was performed and five time domain features (root mean square, variance, mean absolute value (MAV), waveform length, and the fourth order autoregressive model coefficient) were extracted from the collected sEMG signals. Excellent TCD performance was achieved in healthy participants by using support vector machine (SVM) classifier (LF: accuracy = 94.0%, AUC = 0.97, F1 = 0.94; TR: accuracy = 95.8%, AUC = 0.99, F1 = 0.96; SE: accuracy = 100.0%, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 1.00). By using SVM classifier, TCD performance in stroke participants was also obtained (LF: accuracy = 74.8%, AUC = 0.90, F1 = 0.73; TR: accuracy = 67.1%, AUC = 0.85, F1 = 0.71; SE: accuracy = 91.3%, AUC = 0.98, F1 = 0.90). Compared with the methods based on cameras or inertial sensors, better detection performance was obtained in both healthy and stroke participants. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the sEMG-bTCD method, and it helps to prompt the stroke patients to correct their incorrect posture, thereby improving the effectiveness of rehabilitation training.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests as frequent disruptions in the flow of speech, affecting 1% of adults. Treatments are limited to behavioral interventions with variable success and high relapse rates, particularly in adults. However, even in severe cases, fluency can be temporarily induced during conditions in which the speaker synchronizes his speech with external rhythmic cues, such as when reading in unison (choral speech) or with a metronome. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promise in augmenting the effects of behavioral treatment during motor and speech/language rehabilitation, but only one study to date has examined behavioral modulatory effects of tDCS in the context of stuttering. Using high-definition (HD)-tDCS electrodes, which improves focality of stimulation relative to conventional tDCS, we investigated the effects of tDCS on speech fluency and brain activation in 14 adults who stutter (AWS). Either anodal or sham stimulation was delivered on separate days over left supplementary motor area (SMA). During stimulation, participants read aloud in sync with a metronome. Measures of speech fluency and brain activity functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were collected before and after stimulation. No significant differences in brain activity or speech fluency were found when comparing active and sham stimulation. However, stuttering severity significantly modulated the effect of stimulation: active stimulation attenuated the atypically strong association between stuttering severity and right thalamocortical network activity, especially in more severe speakers. These preliminary results warrant additional research into potential application of HD-tDCS to modulate speech motor networks to enhance fluency in stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Recent evidence suggests the presence of hippocampal neuroanatomical abnormalities in subjects of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Our study aimed to identify the radiomic biomarkers of the hippocampus for building the classification models in aMCI diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: For this target, we recruited 42 subjects with aMCI and 44 normal controls (NC). The right and left hippocampi were segmented for each subject using an efficient learning-based method. Then, the radiomic analysis was applied to calculate and select the radiomic features. Finally, two logistic regression models were built based on the selected features obtained from the right and left hippocampi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There were 385 features derived after calculation, and four features remained after feature selection from each group of data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, precision, recall, and F-score of the classification evaluation index of the right hippocampus logistic regression model were 0.76, 0.71, 0.69, 0.69, 0.71, 0.69, 0.69, and 0.69, and those of the left hippocampus model were 0.79, 0.71, 0.54, 0.64, 0.63, 0.64, 0.54, and 0.58, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Results demonstrate the potential hippocampal radiomic biomarkers are valid for the aMCI diagnosis. The MRI-based radiomic analysis, with further improvement and validation, can be used to identify patients with aMCI and guide the individual treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Multiple neurological, physiological, and behavioral functions are synchronized by circadian clocks into daily rhythms. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies are associated with a decay of circadian rhythms, disruption of sleep patterns, and impaired cognitive function but the mechanisms underlying these alterations are still unclear. Traditional approaches in neurodegeneration research have focused on understanding how pathology impinges on circadian function. Since in Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies tau proteostasis is compromised, here we sought to understand the role of tau protein in neuronal circadian biology and related behavior. Considering molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms are conserved from Drosophila to humans, here we took advantage of a recently developed tau-deficient Drosophila line to show that loss of tau promotes dysregulation of daily circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Strikingly, tau deficiency dysregulates the structural plasticity of the small ventral lateral circadian pacemaker neurons by disrupting the temporal cytoskeletal remodeling of its dorsal axonal projections and by inducing a slight increase in the cytoplasmic accumulation of core clock proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of tau function participates in the regulation of circadian rhythms by modulating the correct operation and connectivity of core circadian networks and related behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate changes in brain function at the regional and whole-brain levels in patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson’s disease (TDPD) complicated by sleep disorder (SD) by regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analysis of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: ReHo and seed-based FC analyses were conducted among 32 patients with TDPD and SD (TDPD-SD), 24 with TDPD and no SD (TDPD-NSD), and 23 healthy controls (HCs) to assess spontaneous brain activity and network-level brain function. Correlation analyses were used to examine the associations between brain activity and the clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) ReHo values differed significantly among the groups. ACC ReHo values were increased in TDPD-SD vs. HC and TDPD-SD vs. TDPD-NSD. ACC ReHo values were reduced in TDPD-NSD vs. HC. TDPD-SD ReHo values were positively correlated with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores (r = 0.41, p = 0.020) but negatively correlated with Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) scores (r = −0.38, p = 0.030). FC analysis using ACC as a mask showed that FC of the left olfactory cortex (L-OC), right straight gyrus (R-SG), right superior parietal gyrus (R-SPG), and right precuneus differed significantly among the groups. FC values between R-SG and ACC were significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in TDPD-NSD, while the FC of L-OC and R-OC with ACC was significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in HC. FC between ACC and L-OC, R-SPG, and the right precuneus was lower in TDPD-NSD than in HC. There was no correlation between the FC values and other clinical data in any of the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Localized abnormal activity in TDPD-SD was chiefly triggered by ACC. The change in the ReHo of ACC is closely related to the severity of TDPD-associated SD, revealing the role of this region as a regulator of the sleep mechanism in TDPD. Significant abnormal FC was found between R-SG and ACC in TDPD-SD but was not shown to correlate with clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-related neurodegenerative and neurochemical changes are considered to be the basis for the decline of motor function; however, the change of effective connections in cortical motor networks that come with aging remains unclear. Here, we investigated the age-related changes of the dynamic interaction between cortical motor regions. Twenty young subjects and 20 older subjects underwent both right hand motor execution (ME) and right hand motor imagery (MI) tasks by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) was used to compare young and older adults’ effective connectivity among regions of the motor network during the tasks. The more effective connections among motor regions in older adults were found during ME; however, effective within-domain hemisphere connections were reduced, and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal was significantly delayed in older adults during MI. Supplementary motor area (SMA) had a significantly higher In+Out degree within the network during ME and MI in older adults. Our results revealed a dynamic interaction within the motor network altered with aging during ME and MI, which suggested that the interaction with cortical motor neurons caused by the mental task was more difficult with aging. The age-related effects on the motor cortical network provide a new insight into our understanding of neurodegeneration in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-related differences in white matter (WM) microstructure have been linked to lower performance in tasks of processing speed in healthy older individuals. However, only few studies have examined this link in a longitudinal setting. These investigations have been limited to the correlation of simultaneous changes in WM microstructure and processing speed. Still little is known about the nature of age-related changes in WM microstructure, i.e., regionally distinct vs. global changes. In the present study, we addressed these open questions by exploring whether previous changes in WM microstructure were related to subsequent changes in processing speed: (a) 1 year later; or (b) 2 years later. Furthermore, we investigated whether age-related changes in WM microstructure were regionally specific or global. We used data from four occasions (covering 4 years) of the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project (N = 232; age range at baseline = 64–86). As a measure of WM microstructure, we used mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in 10 major WM tracts averaged across hemispheres. Processing speed was measured with four cognitive tasks. Statistical analyses were conducted with bivariate latent change score (LCS) models. We found, for the first time, evidence for lagged couplings between preceding changes in FA and subsequent changes in processing speed 2 years, but not 1 year later in some of the WM tracts (anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus). Our results supported the notion that FA changes were different between regional WM tracts rather than globally shared, with some tracts showing mean declines in FA, and others remaining relatively stable across 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Human cortical neurons integrate as single cells in the mouse cortex and display human-like prolonged development, indicating cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Following maturation in the visual cortex, xenotransplanted human neurons display decorrelated activity and tuned responses to visual stimuli that are similar to host neurons.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The connection strength of most chemical synapses changes dynamically during normal use as a function of the recent history of activity. The phenomenon is known as short-term synaptic plasticity or synaptic dynamics, and is thought to be involved in processing and filtering information as it is transmitted across the synaptic cleft. Multiple presynaptic mechanisms have been implicated, but large gaps remain in our understanding of how the mechanisms are modulated and how they interact. One important factor is the timing of recruitment of synaptic vesicles to a readily-releasable pool. A number of studies have concluded that activity and/or residual Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can accelerate the mechanism, but alternative explanations for some of the evidence have emerged. Here I review the methodology that we have developed for isolating the recruitment and the dependence on activity from other kinds of mechanisms that are activated concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Optic radiation (OR) tractography may help predict and reduce post-neurosurgical visual field deficits. OR tractography methods currently lack pediatric and surgical focus.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;We propose a clinically feasible OR tractography strategy in a pediatric neurosurgery setting and examine its intra-rater and inter-rater reliability/agreements.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Preoperative and intraoperative MRI data were obtained from six epilepsy and two brain tumor patients on 3 Tesla MRI scanners. Four raters with different clinical experience followed the proposed strategy to perform probabilistic OR tractography with manually drawing anatomical landmarks to reconstruct the OR pathway, based on fiber orientation distributions estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging data. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities/agreements of tractography results were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across various tractography and OR morphological metrics, including the lateral geniculate body positions, tract volumes, and Meyer’s loop position from temporal anatomical landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Good to excellent intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was demonstrated for the majority of OR reconstructions (ICC = 0.70–0.99; DSC = 0.84–0.89). ICC was higher for non-lesional (0.82–0.99) than lesional OR (0.70–0.99). The non-lesional OR’s mean volume was 22.66 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; the mean Meyer’s loop position was 29.4 mm from the temporal pole, 5.89 mm behind of and 10.26 mm in front of the temporal ventricular horn. The greatest variations (± 1.00–3.00 mm) were observed near pathology, at the tract edges or at cortical endpoints. The OR tractography were used to assist surgical planning and guide lesion resection in all cases, no patient had new visual field deficits postoperatively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The proposed tractography strategy generates reliable and reproducible OR tractography images that can be reliably implemented in the routine, non-emergency pediatric neurosurgical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Semantic audiovisual stimuli have a facilitatory effect on behavioral performance and influence the integration of multisensory inputs across sensory modalities. Many neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies investigated the neural mechanisms of multisensory semantic processing and reported that attention modulates the response to multisensory semantic inputs. In the present study, we designed an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment of semantic discrimination using the unimodal auditory, unimodal visual and bimodal audiovisual stimuli with semantic information. By manipulating the stimuli present on attended and unattended position, we recorded the task-related fMRI data corresponding to the unimodal auditory, unimodal visual and bimodal audiovisual stimuli in attended and unattended conditions. We also recorded the fMRI data in resting state. Then the fMRI method was used together with a graph theoretical analysis to construct the functional brain networks in task-related and resting states and quantitatively characterize the topological network properties. The aim of our present study is to explore the characteristics of functional brain networks that process semantic audiovisual stimuli in attended and unattended conditions, revealing the neural mechanism of multisensory processing and the modulation of attention. The behavioral results showed that the audiovisual stimulus presented simultaneously promoted the performance of semantic discrimination task. And the analyses of network properties showed that compared with the resting-state condition, the functional networks of processing semantic audiovisual stimuli (both in attended and unattended conditions) had greater small-worldness, global efficiency, and lower clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency and hierarchy. In addition, the hubs were concentrated in the bilateral temporal lobes, especially in the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs), which were positively correlated to reaction time (RT). Moreover, attention significantly altered the degree of small-worldness and the distribution of hubs in the functional network for processing semantic audiovisual stimuli. Our findings suggest that the topological structure of the functional brain network for processing semantic audiovisual stimulus is modulated by attention, and has the characteristics of high efficiency and low wiring cost, which maintains an optimized balance between functional segregation and integration for multisensory processing efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are an emergent public health problem, placing significant burden upon the individual, family and health system. ASD are polygenetic spectrum disorders of neural connectome development, in which one or more feedback loops amplify small genetic, structural, or functional variations in the very early development of motor and sensory-motor pathways. These perturbations trigger a ‘butterfly effect’ of unpredictable cascades of structural and functional imbalances in the global neuronal workspace, resulting in atypical behaviors, social communication, and cognition long-term. The first 100 days post-term are critically neuroplastic and comprise an injury-sensitive developmental window, characterized by a neural biomarker, the persistence of the cortical subplate, and a behavioral biomarker, the crying diathesis. By the time potential diagnostic signs are identified, from 6 months of age, ASD neuropathy is already entrenched. The International Society for Autism Research Special Interest Group has called for pre-emptive intervention, based upon rigorous theoretical frames, and real world translation and evaluation. This paper responds to that call. It synthesizes heterogenous evidence concerning ASD etiologies from both psychosocial and biological research literatures with complexity science and evolutionary biology, to propose a theoretical framework for pre-emptive intervention. This paper hypothesizes that environmental factors resulting from a mismatch between environment of evolutionary adaptedness and culture initiate or perpetuate early motor and sensory-motor lesions, triggering a butterfly effect of multi-directional cascades of atypical developmental in the complex adaptive system of the parent and ASD-susceptible infant. Chronic sympathetic nervous system/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperarousal and disrupted parent-infant biobehavioral synchrony are the key biologic and behavioral mechanisms perpetuating these atypical developmental cascades. A clinical translation of this evidence is proposed, for application antenatally and in the first 6 months of life, as pre-emptive intervention for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Aim&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive and safe technique for treatment of central and peripheral nerve injury. In recent years, this technique has been widely used in clinic, and an increasing number of studies have reported its mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of rTMS-mediated autophagy flux in human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A frequency of 50 Hz was employed. Cells were divided into five groups: (1) normal, (2) sham, (3) 0.5 T, (4) 1.0 T, and (5) 1.5 T. Cells were stimulated for 20 min/day. The levels of p62, LC3-II/I, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), ERK, phosphorylated-AKT (p-AKT), AKT, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), mTOR, phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA), PKA, phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), EGFR, Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and NMDA receptor (NMDAR1) were investigated by western blotting. Intracellular calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) levels were quantified by flow cytometry. p62 and LC3 expression was also assessed by immunofluorescence analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the 0.5 T group, rTMS increased the expression of LC3-II/I, p-ERK/ERK, and NMDAR1 and decreased the levels of p62 and p-mTOR/mTOR than in the normal group. The ratio of p-AKT/AKT, p-PKA/PKA, and p-EGFR/EGFR and the expression of Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 remained unchanged. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization of p62 with LC3 puncta, and flow cytometry analysis displayed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels were elevated. However, in the 1.0 and 1.5 T groups, no changes in the expression of these autophagy markers were observed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In the 0.5 T group, high-frequency rTMS can induce autophagy through NMDAR–Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;–ERK–mTOR signaling in BMSCs. In the 1.0 and 1.5 T groups, autophagy is not activated.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A number of experiments support the hypothetical utility of statistical information for language learning and processing among both children and adults. However, tasks in these studies are often very general, and only a few include populations with developmental language disorder (DLD). We wanted to determine whether a stronger relationship might be shown when the measure of statistical learning is chosen for its relevance to the language task when including a substantial number of participants with DLD. The language ability we measured was sensitivity to verb bias – the likelihood of a verb to appear with a certain argument or interpretation. A previous study showed adults with DLD were less sensitive to verb bias than their typical peers. Verb bias sensitivity had not yet been tested in children with DLD. In Study 1, 49 children, ages 7–9 years, 17 of whom were classified as having DLD, completed a task designed to measure sensitivity to verb bias through implicit and explicit measures. We found children with and without DLD showed sensitivity to verb bias in implicit but not explicit measures, with no differences between groups. In Study 2, we used a multiverse approach to investigate whether individual differences in statistical learning predicted verb bias sensitivity in these participants as well as in a dataset of adult participants. Our analysis revealed no evidence of a relationship between statistical learning and verb bias sensitivity in children, which was not unexpected given we found no group differences in Study 1. Statistical learning predicted sensitivity to verb bias as measured through explicit measures in adults, though results were not robust. These findings suggest that verb bias may still be relatively unstable in school age children, and thus may not play the same role in sentence processing in children as in adults. It would also seem that individuals with DLD may not be using the same mechanisms during processing as their typically developing (TD) peers in adulthood. Thus, statistical information may differ in relevance for language processing in individuals with and without DLD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00073"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The ventral tegmental area (VTA) reportedly regulates sleep and wakefulness through communication with the lateral hypothalamus (LH). It has also been suggested that adequate anesthesia produced by administration of chloral hydrate, ketamine, or halothane significantly reduces the GABAergic neuronal firing rate within the VTA. However, the exact effects on GABAergic neurons in the VTA and the mechanisms through which these neurons modulate anesthesia through associated neural circuits is still unclear. Here, we used optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to specifically activate or inhibit GABAergic neuronal perikarya in the VTA or their projections to the LH in Vgat-Cre mice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analyses and burst suppression ratio (BSR) calculations were conducted following administration of 0.8 or 1.0% isoflurane, respectively; and loss of righting reflex (LORR), recovery of righting reflex (RORR), and anesthesia sensitivity were assessed under 1.4% isoflurane anesthesia. The results showed that activation of GABAergic neurons in the VTA increased delta wave power from 40.0 to 46.4% (P = 0.006) and decreased gamma wave power from 15.2 to 11.5% (P = 0.017) during anesthesia maintenance. BSR was increased from 51.8 to 68.3% (P = 0.017). Induction time (LORR) was reduced from 333 to 290 s (P = 0.019), whereas arousal time (RORR) was prolonged from 498 to 661 s (P = 0.007). Conversely, inhibition of VTA GABAergic neurons led to opposite effects. In contrast, optical activation of VTA–LH GABAergic projection neurons increased power of slow delta waves from 44.2 to 48.8% (P = 0.014) and decreased that of gamma oscillations from 10.2 to 8.0%. BSR was increased from 39.9 to 60.2% (P = 0.0002). LORR was reduced from 330 to 232 s (P = 0.002), and RORR increased from 396 to 565 s (P = 0.007). Optical inhibition of the projection neurons caused opposite effects in terms of both the EEG spectrum and the BSR, except that inhibition of this projection did not accelerate arousal time. These results indicate that VTA GABAergic neurons could facilitate the anesthetic effects of isoflurane during induction and maintenance while postponing anesthetic recovery, at least partially, through modulation of their projections to the LH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;T helper 17 (Th17) cells represent a distinct population of immune cells, important in the defense of the organism against extracellular infectious agents. Because of their cytokine profile and ability to recruit other immune cell types, they are highly pro-inflammatory and are involved in the induction of several autoimmune disorders. Recent studies show that Th17 cells and their signature cytokine IL-17 have also a role in a wide variety of neurological diseases. This review article will briefly summarize the evidence linking Th17 cells to brain diseases associated with cognitive impairment, including multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will also investigate the mechanisms by which these cells enter the brain and induce brain damage, including direct effects of IL-17 on brain cells and indirect effects mediated through disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), neurovascular dysfunction and gut-brain axis. Finally, therapeutic prospects targeting Th17 cells and IL-17 will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hibernating mammals undergo torpor periods characterized by a general decrease in body temperature, metabolic rate, and brain activity accompanied by complex adaptive brain changes that appear to protect the brain from extreme conditions of hypoxia and low temperatures. These processes are accompanied by morphological and neurochemical changes in the brain including those in cortical neurons such as the fragmentation and reduction of the Golgi apparatus (GA), which both reverse a few hours after arousal from the torpor state. In the present study, we characterized – by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy – the GA of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells in the Syrian hamster, which is a facultative hibernator. We also show that after artificial induction of hibernation, in addition to neurons, the GA of glia in the Syrian hamster undergoes important structural changes, as well as modifications in the intensity of immunostaining and distribution patterns of Golgi structural proteins at different stages of the hibernation cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter release relies on an evolutionarily conserved presynaptic machinery. Nonetheless, some proteins occur in certain species and synapses, and are absent in others, indicating that they may have modulatory roles. How such proteins expand the power or versatility of the core release machinery is unclear. The presynaptic protein Mover/TPRGL/SVAP30 is heterogeneously expressed among synapses of the rodent brain, suggesting that it may add special functions to subtypes of presynaptic terminals. Mover is a synaptic vesicle-attached phosphoprotein that binds to Calmodulin and the active zone scaffolding protein Bassoon. Here we use a Mover knockout mouse line to investigate the role of Mover in the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse and Schaffer collateral to CA1. While Schaffer collateral synapses were unchanged by the knockout, the MFs showed strongly increased facilitation. The effect of Mover knockout in facilitation was both calcium- and age-dependent, having a stronger effect at higher calcium concentrations and in younger animals. Increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by forskolin equally potentiated both wildtype and knockout MF synapses, but occluded the increased facilitation observed in the knockout. These discoveries suggest that Mover has distinct roles at different synapses. At MF terminals, it acts to constrain the extent of presynaptic facilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has previously been reported to improve facets of upper limb motor performance such as accuracy and strength. However, the magnitude of motor performance improvement has not been reviewed by contemporaneous systematic review or meta-analysis of sham vs. active tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyse the existing evidence regarding the benefits of tDCS on upper limb motor performance in healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was conducted to obtain relevant articles from three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) yielding 3,200 abstracts. Following independent assessment by two reviewers, a total of 86 articles were included for review, of which 37 were deemed suitable for meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Meta-analyses were performed for four outcome measures, namely: reaction time (RT), execution time (ET), time to task failure (TTF), and force. Further qualitative review was performed for accuracy and error. Statistically significant improvements in RT (effect size −0.01; 95% CI −0.02 to 0.001, p = 0.03) and ET (effect size −0.03; 95% CI −0.05 to −0.01, p = 0.017) were demonstrated compared to sham. In exercise tasks, increased force (effect size 0.10; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.13, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and a trend towards improved TTF was also observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence attesting to the impact of tDCS on upper limb motor performance in healthy adults. Improved performance is demonstrable in reaction time, task completion time, elbow flexion tasks and accuracy. Considerable heterogeneity exists amongst the literature, further confirming the need for a standardised approach to reporting tDCS studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved great success for image classification in medical research. Deep learning with brain imaging is the imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, it is also well known that DCNNs are “black boxes” owing to their low interpretability to humans. The lack of transparency of deep learning compromises its application to the prediction and mechanism investigation in AD. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel general framework that integrates deep leaning, feature selection, causal inference, and genetic-imaging data analysis for predicting and understanding AD. The proposed algorithm not only improves the prediction accuracy but also identifies the brain regions underlying the development of AD and causal paths from genetic variants to AD via image mediation. The proposed algorithm is applied to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 151 subjects (51 AD and 100 non-AD) who were measured at four time points of baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The algorithm identified brain regions underlying AD consisting of the temporal lobes (including the hippocampus) and the ventricular system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In this paper, we evaluate the computational performance of the GEneral NEural SImulation System (GENESIS) for large scale simulations of neural networks. While many benchmark studies have been performed for large scale simulations with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons or neuronal models with only a few compartments, this work focuses on higher fidelity neuronal models represented by 50–74 compartments per neuron. After making some modifications to the source code for GENESIS and its parallel implementation, PGENESIS, particularly to improve memory usage, we find that PGENESIS is able to efficiently scale on supercomputing resources to network sizes as large as 9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons with 18 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; synapses and 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons with 45 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; synapses. The modifications to GENESIS that enabled these large scale simulations have been incorporated into the May 2019 Official Release of PGENESIS 2.4 available for download from the GENESIS web site (genesis-sim.org).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;There exist two major types of striatum-targeting neocortical neurons, specifically, intratelencephalic (IT) neurons and pyramidal-tract (PT) neurons. Regarding their striatal projections, it was once suggested that IT axons are extended whereas PT axons are primarily focal. However, subsequent study with an increased number of well-stained extended axons concluded that such an apparent distinction was spurious due to limited sample size. Recent work using genetically labeled neurons reintroduced the differential spatial extent of the striatal projections of IT and PT neurons through population-level analyses, complemented by observations of single axons. However, quantitative IT vs. PT comparison of a large number of axons remained to be conducted. We analyzed the data of axonal end-points of 161 IT neurons and 33 PT neurons in the MouseLight database (http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/). The number of axonal end-points in the ipsilateral striatum exhibits roughly monotonically decreasing distributions in both neuron types. Excluding neurons with no ipsilateral end-point, the distributions of the logarithm of the number of ipsilateral end-points are considerably overlapped between IT and PT neurons, although the proportion of neurons having more than 50 ipsilateral end-points is somewhat larger in IT neurons than in PT neurons. Looking at more details, among IT subpopulations in the secondary motor area (MOs), layer 5 neurons and bilateral striatum-targeting layer 2/3 neurons, but not contralateral striatum-non-targeting layer 2/3 neurons, have a larger number of ipsilateral end-points than MOs PT neurons. We also found that IT ipsilateral striatal axonal end-points are on average more widely distributed than PT end-points, especially in the medial-lateral direction. These results indicate that IT and PT striatal axons differ in the frequencies and spatial extent of end-points while there are wide varieties within each neuron type.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The distribution of locomotor-activated neurons in the brainstem of the cat was studied by c-Fos immunohistochemistry in combination with antibody-based cellular phenotyping following electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) – the anatomical constituents of which remain debated today, primarily between the cuneiform (CnF) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (PPT). Effective MLR sites were co-extensive with the CnF nucleus. Animals subject to the locomotor task showed abundant Fos labeling in the CnF, parabrachial nuclei of the subcuneiform region, periaqueductal gray, locus ceruleus (LC)/subceruleus (SubC), Kölliker–Fuse, magnocellular and lateral tegmental fields, raphe, and the parapyramidal region. Labeled neurons were more abundant on the side of stimulation. In some animals, Fos-labeled cells were also observed in the ventral tegmental area, medial and intermediate vestibular nuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, n. tractus solitarii, and retrofacial nucleus in the ventrolateral medulla. Many neurons in the reticular formation were innervated by serotonergic fibers. Numerous locomotor-activated neurons in the parabrachial nuclei and LC/SubC/Kölliker–Fuse were noradrenergic. Few cholinergic neurons within the PPT stained for Fos. In the medulla, serotonergic neurons within the parapyramidal region and the nucleus raphe magnus were positive for Fos. Control animals, not subject to locomotion, showed few Fos-labeled neurons in these areas. The current study provides positive evidence for a role for the CnF in the initiation of locomotion while providing little evidence for the participation of the PPT. The results also show that MLR-evoked locomotion involves the parallel activation of reticular and monoaminergic neurons in the pons/medulla, and provides the anatomical and functional basis for spinal monoamine release during evoked locomotion. Lastly, the results indicate that vestibular, cardiovascular, and respiratory centers are centrally activated during MLR-evoked locomotion. Altogether, the results show a complex pattern of neuromodulatory influences of brainstem neurons by electrical activation of the MLR.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to observe the effects of mild mechanical stimulation on acupuncture points of spinal motor neurons and active substances of sciatic nerve injury in rats, and to explore the morphological basis for the recovery of motor function in rats with sciatic nerve injury, using mild acupuncture. Acupuncture in the local area of injury may cause further damage to the peripheral nerve injury. We believe that mild mechanical stimulation on the surface, using some specific acupuncture points can also have a positive effect on nerve repair. This method, called Chinese tuina, has existed for more than 2,000 years in China.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study establishes a rat model using sciatic nerve crush injury. Rats received Chinese tuina in accordance with the principle of the three methods and three points, once a day, for 20 days. The rats’ status of hindlimb recovery was detected by a sciatic functional index. The labeled neuronal cell body was used to evaluate the fiber recovery after the rats’ sciatic nerve injury, using a neural tracing technique. Our team studied motor neuronal cell bodies, CGRP-positive cells, and the microglia of damaged sciatic nerves which were stained with fluorescent triple staining, adopting a confocal multi-layer scanning technique, and then the changes in neuronal activity distribution and expression, and changes of time and treatment were described, using the method of morphological description.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Sciatic nerve injury decreased the survival rate of motor neurons, affected CGRP-positive cells, and activated microglia in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Compared with the model group, the survival of spinal ventral horn motor neurons was increased through tuina intervention. The swelling of CGRP-positive cells was alleviated, and the degree of microglia activation was less than that of the model group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study used visual morphological findings to assess changes in neurons and active substances with time after injury of the peripheral nerve, and demonstrated that peripheral mild acupuncture intervention improved the capacity of neurofibrillary axoplasmic transport, regulated microglia activation, and significantly promoted the recovery of sciatic nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular exercise is known to promote the consolidation of newly acquired motor skills. Previous studies seeking to understand the neural correlates underlying motor memory consolidation that is modulated by exercise, have relied so far on using traditional statistical approaches for a priori selected features from neuroimaging data, including EEG. With recent advances in machine learning, data-driven techniques such as deep learning have shown great potential for EEG data decoding for brain-computer interfaces, but have not been explored in the context of exercise. Here, we present a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based pipeline for analysis of EEG data to study the brain areas and spectral EEG measures modulated by exercise. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to demonstrate the ability of CNNs to be trained in a limited sample size setting. Our approach revealed discriminative spectral features within a refined frequency band (27–29 Hz) as compared to the wider beta bandwidth (15–30 Hz), which is commonly used in data analyses, as well as corresponding brain regions that were modulated by exercise. These results indicate the presence of finer EEG spectral features that could have been overlooked using conventional hypothesis-driven statistical approaches. Our study thus demonstrates the feasibility of using deep network architectures for neuroimaging analysis, even in small-scale studies, to identify robust brain biomarkers and investigate neuroscience-based questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is emerging as a robust treatment alternative for major depressive disorder, with a potential for achieving higher remission rates by providing targeted stimulation to underlying brain networks, such as the salience network (SN). Growing evidence suggests that these therapeutic effects are dependent on the frequency and phase synchrony between SN oscillations and stimulation as well as the task-specific state of the SN during stimulation. However, the development of phase-synchronized non-invasive stimulation has proved challenging until recently. Here, we use a phase-locked pulsed brain stimulation approach to study the effects of two NIBS methods: transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) versus phase-locked transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), on the SN during an SN activating task. 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Each volunteer partook in four sessions, receiving one stimulation type at random (theta-tACS, peak tPCS, trough tPCS or sham) while undergoing a learning game, followed by an unstimulated test based on learned material. Each session lasted approximately 1.5 h, with an interval of at least 2 days to allow for washout and to avoid cross-over effects. Our results showed no statistically significant effect of stimulation on the event related potential (ERP) recordings, resting electroencephalogram (EEG), and the performance of the volunteers. While stimulation effects were not apparent in this study, the nominal performance of the phase-locking algorithm offers a technical foundation for further research in determining effective stimulation paradigms and conditions. Specifically, future work should investigate stronger stimulation and true task-specific stimulation of SN nodes responsible for the task as well as their recording. If refined, NIBS could offer an effective, homebased treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Compression of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in muscles is reported to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in development of chronic pain, the mechanisms of how MTrP compression at low back regions affects PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigated effects of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subjects with chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial and an observer and subject-blinded clinical trial. Thirty-two subjects with chronic low back pain were divided into two groups: subjects with compression at MTrPs (n = 16) or those with non-MTrPs (n = 16). Compression at MTrP or non-MTrP for 30 s was applied five times, and hemodynamic activity (near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS) and EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that compression at MTrPs significantly (1) reduced subjective pain (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and increased the pressure pain threshold (P &amp;lt; 0.05), (2) decreased the NIRS hemodynamic activity in the frontal polar area (pPFC) (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and (3) increased the current source density (CSD) of EEG theta oscillation in the anterior part of the PFC (P &amp;lt; 0.05). CSD of EEG theta oscillation was negatively correlated with NIRS hemodynamic activity in the pPFC (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, functional connectivity in theta bands between the medial pPFC and insula cortex was significantly decreased in the MTrP group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The functional connectivity between those regions was positively correlated with subjective low back pain (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that MTrP compression at the lumbar muscle modulates pPFC activity and functional connectivity between the pPFC and insula, which may relieve chronic musculoskeletal pain.&lt;/p&gt;Trial registration&lt;p&gt;This trial was registered at University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000033913) on 27 August 2018, at https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000038660.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Understanding the origin of the main physiological processes involved in consciousness is a major challenge of contemporary neuroscience, with crucial implications for the study of Disorders of Consciousness (DOC). The difficulties in achieving this task include the considerable quantity of experimental data in this field, along with the non-intuitive, nonlinear nature of neuronal dynamics. One possibility of integrating the main results from the experimental literature into a cohesive framework, while accounting for nonlinear brain dynamics, is the use of physiologically-inspired computational models. In this study, we present a physiologically-grounded computational model, attempting to account for the main micro-circuits identified in the human cortex, while including the specificities of each neuronal type. More specifically, the model accounts for thalamo-cortical (vertical) regulation of cortico-cortical (horizontal) connectivity, which is a central mechanism for brain information integration and processing. The distinct neuronal assemblies communicate through feedforward and feedback excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections implemented in a template brain accounting for long-range connectome. The EEG generated by this physiologically-based simulated brain is validated through comparison with brain rhythms recorded in humans in two states of consciousness (wakefulness, sleep). Using the model, it is possible to reproduce the local disynaptic disinhibition of basket cells (fast GABAergic inhibition) and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons through long-range activation of vasoactive intestinal-peptide (VIP) interneurons that induced inhibition of somatostatin positive (SST) interneurons. The model (COALIA) predicts that the strength and dynamics of the thalamic output on the cortex control the local and long-range cortical processing of information. Furthermore, the model reproduces and explains clinical results regarding the complexity of transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS-evoked EEG responses in DOC patients and healthy volunteers, through a modulation of thalamo-cortical connectivity that governs the level of cortico-cortical communication. This new model provides a quantitative framework to accelerate the study of the physiological mechanisms involved in the emergence, maintenance and disruption (sleep, anesthesia, DOC) of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accurate and practical assessment of the brain circulation is needed to adequately estimate the viability of cerebral blood flow regulatory mechanisms in various physiological conditions. The objective of our study was to examine feasibility of the contactless green-light imaging photoplethysmography (PPG) for assessing cerebral autoregulation by revealing the dynamic relationships between cortical microcirculation assessed by PPG and changes in systemic blood pressure caused by visceral and somatic peripheral stimuli. In anesthetized male Wistar rats, the PPG video images of the open parietal cortex (either with unimpaired or dissected dura mater), electrocardiogram, and systemic arterial blood pressure (ABP) in the femoral artery were continuously recorded before, during and after visceral (colorectal distension) or somatic (tail squeezing) stimulation. In the vast majority of experiments with intact and removed dura mater, both spontaneous and peripheral stimulation-evoked changes in ABP negatively correlated with the accompanying alterations in the amplitude of pulsatile PPG component (APC), i.e., an increase of ABP resulted in a decrease of APC and vice versa. The most pronounced ABP and APC alterations were induced by noxious stimuli. Visceral painful stimulation in all cases caused short-term hypotension with simultaneous increase in cortical APC, whereas somatic noxious stimuli in 8 of 21 trials produced hypertensive effect with decreased APC. Animals with pressure 50-70 mmHg possessed higher negative cerebrovascular response rate of ABP-APC gradients than rats with either lower or higher pressure. Severe hypotension reversed the negative ratio to positive one, which was especially evident under visceral pain stimulation. Amplitude of the pulsatile PPG component probably reflects the regulation of vascular tone of cerebral cortex in response to systemic blood pressure fluctuations. When combined with different kinds of peripheral stimuli, the technique is capable for evaluation of normal and elucidation of impaired cerebrovascular system reactivity to particular physiological events, for example pain. The reported contactless PPG monitoring of cortical circulatory dynamics during neurosurgical interventions in combination with recordings of changes in other physiological parameters, such as systemic blood pressure and ECG, has the appealing potential to monitor viability of the cortex vessels and determine the state of patient’s cerebrovascular autoregulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synaptic changes induced by neural activity need to be consolidated to maintain memory over a timescale of hours. In experiments, synaptic consolidation can be induced by repeating a stimulation protocol several times and the effectiveness of consolidation depends crucially on the repetition frequency of the stimulations. We address the question: is there an understandable reason why induction protocols with repetitions at some frequency work better than sustained protocols—even though the accumulated stimulation strength might be exactly the same in both cases? In real synapses, plasticity occurs on multiple time scales from seconds (induction), to several minutes (early phase of long-term potentiation) to hours and days (late phase of synaptic consolidation). We use a simplified mathematical model of just two times scales to elucidate the above question in a purified setting. Our mathematical results show that, even in such a simple model, the repetition frequency of stimulation plays an important role for the successful induction, and stabilization, of potentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Rate coding and phase coding are the two major coding modes seen in the brain. For these two modes, network dynamics must either have a wide distribution of frequencies for rate coding, or a narrow one to achieve stability in phase dynamics for phase coding. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a potent regulator of neural excitability. Acting through the muscarinic receptor, ACh reduces the magnitude of the potassium M-current, a hyperpolarizing current that builds up as neurons fire. The M-current contributes to several excitability features of neurons, becoming a major player in facilitating the transition between Type 1 (integrator) and Type 2 (resonator) excitability. In this paper we argue that this transition enables a dynamic switch between rate coding and phase coding as levels of ACh release change. When a network is in a high ACh state variations in synaptic inputs will lead to a wider distribution of firing rates across the network and this distribution will reflect the network structure or pattern of external input to the network. When ACh is low, network frequencies become narrowly distributed and the structure of a network or pattern of external inputs will be represented through phase relationships between firing neurons. This work provides insights into how modulation of neuronal features influences network dynamics and information processing across brain states.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proof of concept of an intervention to decrease sympathetic activation as measured by skin conductivity (electrodermal activity, EDA) in children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and auditory hypersensitivity (hyperacusis). In addition, researchers examined if the intervention provided protection against the negative effects of decibel level of environmental noises on electrodermal measures between interventions. The feasibility of implementation and outcome measures within natural environments were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A single-subject multi-treatment design was used with six children, aged 8–16 years, with a form of Autism (i.e., Autism, PDD-NOS). Participants used in-ear (IE) and over-ear (OE) headphones for two randomly sequenced treatment phases. Each child completed four phases: (1) a week of baseline data collection; (2) a week of an intervention; (3) a week of no intervention; and (4) a week of the other intervention. Empatica E4 wristbands collected EDA data. Data was collected on 16–20 occasions per participant, with five measurements per phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Separated tests for paired study phases suggested that regardless of intervention type, noise attenuating headphones led to a significance difference in both skin conductance levels (SCL) and frequency of non-specific conductance responses (NS-SCRs) between the baseline measurement and subsequent phases. Overall, SCL and NS-SCR frequency significantly decreased between baseline and the first intervention phase. A protective effect of the intervention was tested by collapsing intervention results into three phases. Slope correlation suggested constant SCL and NS-SCR frequency after initial use of the headphones regardless of the increase in environmental noises. A subsequent analysis of the quality of EDA data identified that later phases of data collection were associated with better data quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Many children with ASD have hypersensitivities to sound resulting in high levels of sympathetic nervous system reactivity, which is associated with problematic behaviors and distress. The findings of this study suggest that the use of noise attenuating headphones for individuals with ASD and hyperacusis may reduce sympathetic activation. Additionally, results suggest that the use of wearable sensors to collect physiological data in natural environments is feasible with established protocols and training procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In many mammalian species including opossums, adult neurogenesis, the function of which is not completely understood, declines with aging. Aging also causes impairment of cognition. To understand whether new neurons contribute to learning and memory, we performed experiments on young and aged laboratory opossums, Monodelphis domestica, and examined the association between spatial memory using the Morris water maze test and the rate of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). Modification of this test allowed us to assess how both young and aged opossums learn and remember the location of the platform in the water maze. We found that both young and aged opossums were motivated to perform this task. However, aged opossums needed more time to achieve the test than young opossums. Classical parameters measuring spatial learning in a water maze during a probe test showed that young opossums spent more time in the platform zone crossing it more often than aged opossums. Additionally, hippocampal neurogenesis was lower in the aged opossums than in the young animals but new neurons were still generated in the DG of aged opossums. Our data revealed individual differences in the levels of doublecortin in relation to memory performance across aged opossums. These differences were correlated with distinct behaviors, particularly, aged opossums with high levels of DCX achieved high performance levels in the water maze task. We, therefore suggest that new neurons in the DG of Monodelphis opossums contribute to learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sustained attention is a fundamental ability ensuring effective cognitive processing and can be enhanced by meditation practice. However, keeping a focused meditative state is challenging for novices because involuntary mind-wandering frequently occurs during their practice. Inspired by the potential of force-control tasks in invoking internal somatic attention, we proposed a haptics-assisted meditation (HAM) to help reduce mind-wandering and enhance attention. During HAM, participants were instructed to maintain awareness on the respiration and meanwhile adjust bimanual fingertip pressures to keep synchronized with the respiration. This paradigm required somatosensory attention as a physiological foundation, aiming to help novices meditate starting with the body and gradually gain essential meditation skills. A cross-sectional study on 12 novices indicated that the participants reported less mind-wandering during HAM compared with the classic breath-counting meditation (BCM). In a further longitudinal study, the experimental group with 10 novices showed significantly improved performance in several attentional tests after 5 days’ practice of HAM. They tended to show more significant improvements in a few tests than did the control group performing the 5-day BCM practice. To investigate the brain activities related to HAM, we applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record cerebral hemodynamic responses from the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices when performing HAM, and we assessed the changes in cerebral activation and functional connectivity (FC) after the 5-day HAM practice. The prefrontal and sensorimotor regions demonstrated a uniform activation when performing HAM, and there was a significant increase in the right prefrontal activation after the practice. We also observed significant changes in the FC between the brain regions related to the attention networks. These behavioral and neural findings together provided preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of HAM on attention enhancement in the early stage of meditation learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
