 &lt;p&gt;The practical success of widely used machine learning (ML) and deep learning
(DL) algorithms in Artificial Intelligence (AI) community owes to availability
of large datasets for training and huge computational resources. Despite the
enormous practical success of AI, these algorithms are only loosely inspired
from the biological brain and do not mimic any of the fundamental properties of
neurons in the brain, one such property being the chaotic firing of biological
neurons. This motivates us to develop a novel neuronal architecture where the
individual neurons are intrinsically chaotic in nature. By making use of the
topological transitivity property of chaos, our neuronal network is able to
perform classification tasks with very less number of training samples. For the
MNIST dataset, with as low as $0.1 \%$ of the total training data, our method
outperforms ML and matches DL in classification accuracy for up to $7$ training
samples/class. For the Iris dataset, our accuracy is comparable with ML
algorithms, and even with just two training samples/class, we report an
accuracy as high as $95.8 \%$. This work highlights the effectiveness of chaos
and its properties for learning and paves the way for chaos-inspired neuronal
architectures by closely mimicking the chaotic nature of neurons in the brain.

 &lt;p&gt;There are inherent limits in classical computation for it to serve as an
adequate model of human cognition. In particular, non-commutativity, while
ubiquitous in physics and psychology, cannot be sufficiently handled. We
propose that we need a new mathematics that is capable of expressing more
complex mathematical structures to tackle those hard X-problems in cognitive

 &lt;p&gt;In a recent paper Basieva, Cervantes, Dzhafarov, and Khrennikov (2019)
presented a series of experiments which they claimed show evidence for
contextuality in human judgments. This was based on a set of modified Bell-like
inequalities designed to rule out effects caused by signalling. In this comment
we show that it is, however, possible to construct a non-contextual model which
explains the experimental data via direct influences. We trace the apparent
inconsistency to a definition of signalling which does not account for all
possible forms of direct influence. Further, we cast doubt on the idea that any
experimental data in psychology could provide conclusive evidence for
contextuality.

 &lt;p&gt;We extend the scope of the dynamical theory of extreme values to cover
phenomena that do not happen instantaneously, but evolve over a finite, albeit
unknown at the onset, time interval. We consider complex dynamical systems,
composed of many individual subsystems linked by a network of interactions. As
a specific example of the general theory, a model of neural network, introduced
to describe the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex, is analyzed in
detail: on the basis of this analysis we propose a novel definition of neuronal
cascade, a physiological phenomenon of primary importance. We derive extreme
value laws for the statistics of these cascades, both from the point of view of
exceedances (that satisfy critical scaling theory) and of block maxima.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Seizures occur in the neonatal period more frequently than other periods of
life and usually denote the presence of serious brain dysfunction. The gold
standard for detecting seizures is based on visual inspection of continuous
electroencephalogram (cEEG) complemented by video analysis, performed by an
expert clinical neurophysiologist. Previous studies have reported varying
degree of agreement between expert EEG readers, with kappa coefficients ranging
from 0.4 to 0.85, calling into question the validity of visual scoring. This
variability in visual scoring of neonatal seizures may be due to factors such
as reader expertise and the nature of expressed patterns. One of the possible
reasons for low inter-rater agreement is the absence of any benchmark for the
EEG readers to be able to compare their opinions. One way to develop this is to
use a shared multi-center neonatal seizure database and use the inputs from
multiple experts. This will also improve the teaching of trainees, and help to
avoid potential bias from a single expert's opinion. In this paper, we
introduce and explain the NeoGuard public learning platform that can be used by
trainees, tutors, and expert EEG readers who are interested to test their
knowledge and learn from neonatal EEG-polygraphic segments scored by several
expert EEG readers. For this platform, 1919 clinically relevant segments,
totaling 280h, recorded from 71 term neonates in two centers, including a wide
variety of seizures and artifacts were used. These segments were scored by 4
EEG readers from three different centers. Users of this platform can score an
arbitrary number of segments and then test their scoring with the experts'
opinions. The kappa and joint probability of agreement, is then shown as
inter-rater agreement metrics between the user and each of the experts. The
platform is publicly available at the NeoGuard website (www.neoguard.net).

 &lt;p&gt;Extracellular recordings using modern, dense probes provide detailed
footprints of action potentials (spikes) from thousands of neurons
simultaneously. Inferring the activity of single neurons from these recordings,
however, is a complex blind source separation problem, complicated both by the
high intrinsic data dimensionality and large data volume. Despite these
complications, dense probes can allow for the estimation of a spike's source
location, a powerful feature for determining the firing neuron's position and
identity in the recording. Here we present a novel, generative model for
inferring the source of individual spikes given observed electrical traces. To
allow for scalable, efficient inference, we implement our model as a
variational autoencoder and perform amortized variational inference. We
evaluate our method on biophysically realistic simulated datasets, showing that
our method outperforms heuristic localization methods such as center of mass
and can improve spike sorting performance significantly. We further apply our
model to real data to show that it is an effective, interpretable tool for
analyzing large-scale extracellular recordings.

 &lt;p&gt;Evoked EMG M-responses obtained from the thenar muscle in the palm by
electrical stimulation of the median nerve demonstrate a well-established
smooth bipolar shape for normal healthy subjects while kinks are observed in
certain neurological disorders, particularly in cervical spondylotic
neuropathy. A first differentiation failed to identify these kinks because of
comparable values obtained for normally rising and falling segments of the
smooth regions, and due to noise. In this study, the usefulness of the wavelet
transform (WT), that provides localized measures of non-stationary signals is
investigated. The Haar WT was used to analyze a total of 36 M-responses
recorded from the median nerves of 6 normal subjects (having smooth shape) and
12 subjects with assumed neurological disorders (having kinks), for two points
of stimulation on the same nerve. Features in the time-scale representation of
the M-responses were studied using WT to distinguish smooth M-responses from
ones with kinks. Variations in the coefficient line of the WT were also studied
to allow visualization of WT at different scales (inverse of frequency). The
high and low frequency regions in the WT came out distinctively which helped
identifications of kinks even of very subtle ones in the M-responses which were
difficult to obtain using the differentiated signal. In conclusion, the wavelet
analysis may be a technique of choice in identifying kinks in M-responses in
relation to time, thus enhancing the accuracy of neurological diagnosis.

 &lt;p&gt;Encoder-decoder recurrent neural network models (Seq2Seq) have achieved great
success in ubiquitous areas of computation and applications. It was shown to be
successful in modeling data with both temporal and spatial dependencies for
translation or prediction tasks. In this study, we propose a dimension
reduction approach to visualize and interpret the representation of the data by
these models. We propose to view the hidden states of the encoder and the
decoder as spatio-temporal snapshots of network dynamics and to apply proper
orthogonal decomposition to their concatenation to compute a low-dimensional
embedding for hidden state dynamics. Projection of the decoder states onto such
interpretable embedding space shows that Seq2Seq training to predict sequences
using gradient-descent back propagation effectively performs dimension
reduction consisting of only a small percentage of dimensions of the network's
hidden units. Furthermore, sequences are being clustered into well separable
clusters in the low dimensional space each of which corresponds to a different
type of dynamics. The projection methodology also clarifies the roles of the
encoder and the decoder components of the network. We show that the projection
of encoder hidden states onto the low dimensional space provides an
initializing trajectory directing the sequence to the cluster which corresponds
to that particular type of distinct dynamics and the projection of the decoder
hidden states constitutes the embedded cluster attractor. Inspection of the low
dimensional space and the projections onto it during training shows that the
estimation of clusters separability in the embedding can be utilized to
estimate the optimality of model training. We test and demonstrate our proposed
interpretability methodology on synthetic examples (dynamics on a circle and an
ellipse) and on 3D human body movement data.

 &lt;p&gt;To learn useful dynamics on long time scales, neurons must use plasticity
rules that account for long-term, circuit-wide effects of synaptic changes. In
other words, neural circuits must solve a credit assignment problem to
appropriately assign responsibility for global network behavior to individual
circuit components. Furthermore, biological constraints demand that plasticity
rules are spatially and temporally local; that is, synaptic changes can depend
only on variables accessible to the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While
artificial intelligence offers a computational solution for credit assignment,
namely backpropagation through time (BPTT), this solution is wildly
biologically implausible. It requires both nonlocal computations and unlimited
memory capacity, as any synaptic change is a complicated function of the entire
history of network activity. Similar nonlocality issues plague other approaches
such as FORCE (Sussillo et al. 2009). Overall, we are still missing a model for
learning in recurrent circuits that both works computationally and uses only
local updates. Leveraging recent advances in machine learning on approximating
gradients for BPTT, we derive biologically plausible plasticity rules that
enable recurrent networks to accurately learn long-term dependencies in
sequential data. The solution takes the form of neurons with segregated voltage
compartments, with several synaptic sub-populations that have different
functional properties. The network operates in distinct phases during which
each synaptic sub-population is updated by its own local plasticity rule. Our
results provide new insights into the potential roles of segregated dendritic
compartments, branch-specific inhibition, and global circuit phases in
learning.

The most mineralized tissue of the mammalian body is tooth enamel. Especially in species with thick enamel, three-dimensional (3D) tomography data has shown that the distribution of enamel varies across the occlusal surface of the tooth crown. Differences in enamel thickness among species and within the tooth crown have been used to examine taxonomic affiliations, life history, and functional properties of teeth. Before becoming fully mineralized, enamel matrix is secreted on the top of a dentine template, and it remains to be explored how matrix thickness is spatially regulated. To provide a predictive framework to examine enamel distribution, we introduce a computational model of enamel matrix secretion that maps the dentine topography to the enamel surface topography. Starting from empirical enamel-dentine junctions, enamel matrix deposition is modeled as a diffusion-limited free boundary problem. Using laboratory microCT and synchrotron tomographic data of pig molars that have markedly different dentine and enamel surface topographies, we show how diffusion-limited matrix deposition accounts for both the process of matrix secretion and the final enamel distribution. Simulations reveal how concave and convex dentine features have distinct effects on enamel surface, thereby explaining why the enamel surface is not a straightforward extrapolation of the dentine template. Human and orangutan molar simulations show that even subtle variation in dentine topography can be mapped to the enamel surface features. Mechanistic models of extracellular matrix deposition can be used to predict occlusal morphologies of teeth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FychEWYHcAc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GB) is one of the deadliest brain cancers to afflict humans, and it has a very poor survival rate even with treatment. The extracellular adenosine-generating enzyme CD73 is involved in many cellular functions that can be usurped by tumors, including cell adhesion, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. We set out to determine the role of CD73 in GB pathogenesis. To do this, we established a unique GB mouse model (CD73-FLK) in which we spatially expressed CD73 on endothelial cells in CD73&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. This allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of host CD73 versus GB-expressed CD73 by comparing GB pathogenesis in WT, CD73&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;, and CD73-FLK mice. GB in CD73&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice had decreased tumor size, decreased tumor vessel density, and reduced tumor invasiveness compared with GB in WT mice. Interestingly, GBs in CD73-FLK mice were much more invasive and caused complete distortion of the brain morphology. We showed a 20-fold upregulation of A&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; AR on GB compared with sham, and its activation induced matrix metalloproteinase-2, which enhanced GB pathogenesis. Inhibition of A&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; AR signaling decreased multidrug resistance transporter protein expression, including permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). Further, we showed that blockade of A&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; AR signaling potently increased GB cell death induced by the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide. Together, these findings suggest that CD73 and A&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; AR play a multifaceted role in GB pathogenesis and progression and that targeting the CD73–A&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; AR axis can benefit GB patients and inform new approaches for therapy to treat GB patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glioblastoma (GB) is the most devastating primary brain tumor. GB patients' median survival is 16 months even with treatment. It is critical that we develop prophylaxes to advance GB treatment and improve patient survival. CD73-generated adenosine has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis, but its role in GB was not ascertained. Here, we demonstrated that host CD73 plays a prominent role in multiple areas of glioblastoma pathogenesis, including promoting GB growth, its angiogenesis, and its invasiveness. We found a 20-fold increase in A&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; adenosine receptor (AR) expression on GB compared with sham, and its inhibition increased GB chemosensitivity to temozolomide. These findings strongly indicate that blockade or inhibition of CD73 and the A&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; AR are prime targets for future GB therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Retrieval of long-term episodic memories is characterized by synchronized neural activity between hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), with additional evidence that vmPFC activity leads that of the hippocampus. It has been proposed that the mental generation of scene imagery is a crucial component of episodic memory processing. If this is the case, then a comparable interaction between the two brain regions should exist during the construction of novel scene imagery. To address this question, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of MEG to investigate the construction of novel mental imagery. We tasked male and female humans with imagining scenes and single isolated objects in response to one-word cues. We performed source-level power, coherence, and causality analyses to characterize the underlying interregional interactions. Both scene and object imagination resulted in theta power changes in the anterior hippocampus. However, higher theta coherence was observed between the hippocampus and vmPFC in the scene compared with the object condition. This interregional theta coherence also predicted whether imagined scenes were subsequently remembered. Dynamic causal modeling of this interaction revealed that vmPFC drove activity in hippocampus during novel scene construction. Additionally, theta power changes in the vmPFC preceded those observed in the hippocampus. These results constitute the first evidence in humans that episodic memory retrieval and scene imagination rely on similar vmPFC–hippocampus neural dynamics. Furthermore, they provide support for theories emphasizing similarities between both cognitive processes and perspectives that propose the vmPFC guides the construction of context-relevant representations in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Episodic memory retrieval is characterized by a dialog between hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). It has been proposed that the mental generation of scene imagery is a crucial component of episodic memory processing. An ensuing prediction would be of a comparable interaction between the two brain regions during the construction of novel scene imagery. Here, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of MEG and combined it with a scene imagination task. We found that a hippocampal–vmPFC dialog existed and that it took the form of vmPFC driving the hippocampus. We conclude that episodic memory and scene imagination share fundamental neural dynamics and the process of constructing vivid, spatially coherent, contextually appropriate scene imagery is strongly modulated by vmPFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Multimodal Integration and Vividness in the Angular Gyrus During Episodic Encoding and Retrieval</title>
		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/22/4365?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Much evidence suggests that the angular gyrus (AnG) is involved in episodic memory, but its precise role has yet to be determined. We examined two possible accounts within the same experimental paradigm: the &quot;cortical binding of relational activity&quot; (CoBRA) account (Shimamura, 2011), which suggests that the AnG acts as a convergence zone that binds multimodal episodic features, and the subjectivity account (Yazar et al., 2012), which implicates AnG involvement in subjective mnemonic experience (such as vividness or confidence). fMRI was used during both encoding and retrieval of paired associates. During study, female and male human participants memorized picture-pairs of common objects (in the unimodal task) or of an object-picture and an environmental sound (in the crossmodal task). At test, they performed a cued-recall task and further indicated the vividness of their memory. During retrieval, BOLD activation in the AnG was greatest for vividly remembered associates, consistent with the subjectivity account. During encoding, the same effect of vividness was found, but this was further modulated by task: greater activations were associated with subsequent recall in the crossmodal than the unimodal task. Therefore, encoding data suggest an additional role to the AnG in crossmodal integration, consistent with its role at retrieval proposed by CoBRA. These results resolve some of the puzzles in the literature and indicate that the AnG can play different roles during encoding and retrieval as determined by the cognitive demands posed by different mnemonic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We offer new insights into the multiplicity of processes that are associated with angular gyrus (AnG) activation during encoding and retrieval of newly formed memories. We used fMRI while human participants learned and subsequently recalled pairs of objects presented to the same sensory modality or to different modalities. We were able to show that the AnG is involved when vivid memories are created and retrieved, as well as when encoded information is integrated across different sensory modalities. These findings provide novel evidence for the contribution of the AnG to our subjective experience of remembering alongside its role in integrative processes that promote subsequent memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Being able to limit the pursuit of reward to prevent negative consequences is an important expression of behavioral inhibition. Everyday examples of an inability to exert such control over behavior are the overconsumption of food and drugs of abuse, which are important factors in the development of obesity and addiction, respectively. Here, we use a behavioral task that assesses the ability of male rats to exert behavioral restraint at the mere sight of palatable food during the presentation of an audiovisual threat cue to investigate the corticolimbic underpinnings of behavioral inhibition. We demonstrate a prominent role for the medial prefrontal cortex in the exertion of control over behavior under threat of punishment. Moreover, task engagement relies on function of the ventral striatum, whereas the basolateral amygdala mediates processing of the threat cue. Together, these data show that inhibition of reward pursuit requires the coordinated action of a network of corticolimbic structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; There is a need for translational models that allow to dissect mechanisms underlying the processes involved in controlling behavior. In this study, we present a novel behavioral task that assesses the ability of rats to exert behavioral restraint over the consumption of a visually present sucrose pellet during the presentation of an audiovisual threat cue. This task requires relatively little behavioral training and it discerns distinct behavioral impairments, including a failure to retrieve stimulus value, a reduced task engagement, and compromised inhibition of behavior. Using pharmacological inactivations of different regions of the corticolimbic system of the rat, we demonstrate dissociable roles for the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and striatum in inhibition of reward pursuit under threat of punishment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Age-Related Decreases in the Retrieval Practice Effect Directly Relate to Changes in Alpha-Beta Oscillations</title>
		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/22/4344?rss=1"/>

 &lt;p&gt;The retrieval (or testing) of information leads to better memory performance compared with reencoding. This phenomenon is known as &quot;testing effect&quot; or &quot;retrieval practice effect&quot; and has been primarily described in behavioral studies with healthy young subjects. However, possible age-related changes and their associated underlying neural processes, in particular neural oscillations, remain unclear. To address this issue, we used a previously established paradigm in healthy young (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 27) and elderly (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 28) male and female human adults while their brain activity was being recorded using EEG. Subjects viewed prefamiliarized scene images intermixed with new scenes and classified them as indoor versus outdoor (encoding task) or old versus new (retrieval task). Subsequently, subjects performed a recognition memory task 10 min and 24 h after encoding. Behaviorally, both age groups showed the testing effect at both time points but, importantly, it was less pronounced in the elderly. At the neural level, the retrieval compared with the encoding task was accompanied by power decreases in the alpha (9–12 Hz) and beta bands (13–30 Hz), possibly reflecting task demands, and this difference was more pronounced in the elderly. Finally, a correlation analysis revealed that those elderly who displayed a more pronounced testing effect exhibited a neural pattern that was more similar to the younger subjects. These findings provide evidence that the testing effect decreases across the life span, and they suggest that changes in alpha-beta oscillations play a direct role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Learning new and retrieving old information is part of everyday human life. Understanding how learning processes can be optimized therefore has direct applications in the realm of educational and rehabilitative contexts. Here, we show that retrieval practice is a strategy to optimize encoding into long-term memory in both young and elderly humans. Importantly, retrieval practice was significantly reduced in the elderly and closely related to changes in alpha (9–13 Hz) and beta band (13–30 Hz) oscillations. Our findings suggest that decreased retrieval practice effects across the life span contribute to, and may reflect, age-related declines in memory performance. They further provide new insights into the underlying neural mechanisms and point toward future avenues for neuro-modulatory interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;EEG studies in healthy humans have highlighted that alpha-band activity is relatively reduced over the occipital–parietal areas of the hemisphere contralateral to the direction of spatial attention. Here, we investigated the hemispheric distribution of alpha during orienting of attention in male and female right brain-damaged patients with left spatial neglect. Temporal spectral evolution showed that in patients with neglect alpha oscillations over the damaged hemisphere were pathologically enhanced both during the baseline-fixation period that preceded cued orienting (capturing tonic alpha changes) and during orienting with leftward, rightward, or neutral-bilateral spatial cues (reflecting phasic alpha changes). Patients without neglect showed a similar though significantly less enhanced hemispheric asymmetry. Healthy control subjects displayed a conventional decrease of alpha activity over the hemisphere contralateral to the direction of orienting. In right-brain-damaged patients, neglect severity in the line bisection task was significantly correlated both with tonic alpha asymmetry during the baseline period and with phasic asymmetries during orienting of attention with neutral-bilateral and leftward cues. Asymmetries with neutral-bilateral and leftward cues were correlated with lesion of white matter tracts linking frontal with parietal–occipital areas. These findings show that disruption of rostrocaudal white matter connectivity in the right hemisphere interferes with the maintenance of optimal baseline tonic levels of alpha and the phasic modulation of alpha activity during shifts of attention. The hemispheric distribution of alpha activity can be used as a diagnostic tool for acquired pathological biases of spatial attention due to unilateral brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Alpha desynchronization over the hemisphere contralateral to the attended side of space is a reliable marker of attentional orienting in the healthy human brain: can the same marker be used to spot and quantify acquired disturbances of spatial attention after unilateral brain injuries? Are pathological modifications in the hemispheric distribution of alpha specifically linked to attentional neglect for one side of space? We show that in patients with right brain damage the pathological enhancement of alpha oscillations over the parietal and occipital areas of the injured hemisphere is correlated with reduced awareness for the left side of space and with the lesion of white matter pathways that subserve frontal modulation of alpha activity in posterior brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Migraine is the second leading cause for disability worldwide and the most common neurological disorder. It is also three times more common in women; reasons for this sex difference are not known. Using preclinical behavioral models of migraine, we show that application of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to the rat dura mater produces cutaneous periorbital hypersensitivity. Surprisingly, this response was observed only in females; dural CGRP at doses from 1 pg to 3.8 μg produce no responses in males. In females, dural CGRP causes priming to a pH 7.0 solution after animals recover from the initial CGRP-induced allodynia. Dural application of interleukin-6 causes acute responses in males and females but only causes priming to subthreshold dural CGRP (0.1 pg) in females. Intracisternal application of BDNF also causes similar acute hypersensitivity responses in males and females but only priming to subthreshold dural CGRP (0.1 pg) in females. Females were additionally primed to a subthreshold dose of the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (0.1 mg/kg) following dural CGRP. Finally, the sexually dimorphic responses to dural CGRP were not specific to rats as similar female-specific hypersensitivity responses were seen in mice, where increased grimace responses were also observed. These data are the first to demonstrate that CGRP-induced headache-like behavioral responses at doses up to 3.8 μg are female-specific both acutely and following central and peripheral priming. These data further implicate dural CGRP signaling in the pathophysiology of migraine and propose a model where dural CGRP-based mechanisms contribute to the sexual disparity of this female-biased disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine, and CGRP-based therapeutics are efficacious for the treatment of migraine in humans. However, the location of action for CGRP in migraine remains unclear. We show here that application of CGRP to the cranial meninges causes behavioral responses consistent with headache in preclinical rodent models. Surprisingly, however, these responses are only observed in females. Acute responses to meningeal CGRP are female-specific and sensitization to CGRP after two distinct stimuli are also female-specific. These data implicate the dura mater as a primary location of action for CGRP in migraine and suggest that female-specific mechanisms downstream of CGRP receptor activation contribute to the higher prevalence of migraine in women.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/22/4312?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Two types of mammalian direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), ON and ONOFF, operate over different speed ranges. The directional axes of the ON-DSGCs are thought to align with the axes of the vestibular system and provide sensitivity at rotational velocities that are too slow to activate the semicircular canals. ONOFF-DSGCs respond to faster image velocities. Using natural images that simulate the natural visual inputs to freely moving animals, we show that simulated visual saccades suppress responses in ON-DSGCs but not ONOFF-DSGCs recorded in retinas of domestic rabbits of either gender. Analysis of the synaptic inputs shows that this saccadic suppression results from glycinergic inputs that are specific to ON-DSGCs and are absent in ONOFF-DSGCs. When this glycinergic input is blocked, both cell types respond similarly to visual saccades and display essentially identical speed tuning. The results demonstrate that glycinergic circuits within the retina can produce saccadic suppression of retinal ganglion cell activity. The cell-type-specific targeting of the glycinergic circuits further supports the proposed physiological roles of ON-DSGCs in retinal-image stabilization and of ONOFF-DSGCs in detecting local object motion and signaling optical flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the mammalian retina, ON direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) respond preferentially to slow image motion, whereas ONOFF-DSGCs respond better to rapid motion. The mechanisms producing this different speed tuning remain unclear. Here we show that simulated visual saccades suppress ON-DSGCs, but not ONOFF-DSGCs. This selective saccadic suppression is because of the selective targeting of glycinergic inhibitory synaptic inputs to ON-DSGCs. The different saccadic suppression in the two cell types points to different physiological roles, consistent with their projections to distinct areas within the brain. ON-DSGCs may be critical for providing the visual feedback signals that contribute to stabilizing the image on the retina, whereas ONOFF-DSGCs may be important for detecting the onset of saccades or for signaling optical flow.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Electrocorticogram (ECoG), obtained by low-pass filtering the brain signal recorded from a macroelectrode placed on the cortex, is extensively used to find the seizure focus in drug-resistant epilepsy and is of growing importance in cognitive and brain–machine-interfacing studies. To accurately estimate the epileptogenic cortex or to make inferences about cognitive processes, it is important to determine the &quot;spatial spread&quot; of ECoG (i.e., the extent of cortical tissue that contributes to its activity). However, the ECoG spread is currently unknown; even the spread of local field potential (LFP) obtained from microelectrodes is debated, with estimates ranging from a few hundred micrometers to several millimeters. Spatial spread can be estimated by measuring the receptive field (RF) and multiplying by the cortical magnification factor, but this method overestimates the spread because RF size gets inflated due to several factors. This issue can be partially addressed using a model that compares the RFs of two measures, such as LFP and multi-unit activity (MUA). To use this approach for ECoG, we designed a customized array containing both microelectrodes and ECoG electrodes to simultaneously map MUA, LFP, and ECoG RFs from the primary visual cortex of awake monkeys (three female &lt;i&gt;Macaca radiata&lt;/i&gt;). The spatial spread of ECoG was surprisingly local (diameter ~3 mm), only 3 times that of the LFP. Similar results were obtained using a model to simulate ECoG as a sum of LFPs of varying electrode sizes. Our results further validate the use of ECoG in clinical and basic cognitive research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Brains signals capture different attributes of the neural network depending on the size and location of the recording electrode. Electrocorticogram (ECoG), obtained by placing macroelectrodes (typically 2–3 mm diameter) on the exposed surface of the cortex, is widely used by neurosurgeons to identify the source of seizures in drug-resistant epileptic patients. The brain area responsible for seizures is subsequently surgically removed. Accurate estimation of the epileptogenic cortex and its removal requires the estimation of spatial spread of ECoG. Here, we estimated the spatial spread of ECoG in five behaving monkeys using two different approaches. Our results suggest that ECoG is a local signal (diameter of ~3 mm), which can provide a useful tool for clinical, cognitive neuroscience, and brain–machine-interfacing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;How does the brain link visual stimuli across space and time? Visual illusions provide an experimental paradigm to study these processes. When two stationary dots are flashed in close spatial and temporal succession, human observers experience a percept of apparent motion. Large spatiotemporal separation challenges the visual system to keep track of object identity along the apparent motion path, the so-called &quot;correspondence problem.&quot; Here, we use voltage-sensitive dye imaging in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys to show that intracortical connections within V1 can solve this issue by shaping cortical dynamics to represent the illusory motion. We find that the appearance of the second stimulus in V1 creates a systematic suppressive wave traveling toward the retinotopic representation of the first. Using a computational model, we show that the suppressive wave is the emergent property of a recurrent gain control fed by the intracortical network. This suppressive wave acts to explain away ambiguous correspondence problems and contributes to precisely encode the expected motion velocity at the surface of V1. Together, these results demonstrate that the nonlinear dynamics within retinotopic maps can shape cortical representations of illusory motion. Understanding these dynamics will shed light on how the brain links sensory stimuli across space and time, by preformatting population responses for a straightforward read-out by downstream areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traveling waves have recently been observed in different animal species, brain areas, and behavioral states. However, it is still unclear what are their functional roles. In the case of cortical visual processing, waves propagate across retinotopic maps and can hereby generate interactions between spatially and temporally separated instances of feedforward driven activity. Such interactions could participate in processing long-range apparent motion stimuli, an illusion for which no clear neuronal mechanisms have yet been proposed. Using this paradigm in awake monkeys, we show that suppressive traveling waves produce a spatiotemporal normalization of apparent motion stimuli. Our study suggests that cortical waves shape the representation of illusory moving stimulus within retinotopic maps for a straightforward read-out by downstream areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Antagonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the medial habenula (MHb) or interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) triggers withdrawal-like behaviors in mice chronically exposed to nicotine, implying that nicotine dependence involves the sensitization of nicotinic signaling. Identification of receptor and/or neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this sensitization is important, as it could promote novel therapeutic strategies to reduce tobacco use. Using an approach involving photoactivatable nicotine, we previously demonstrated that chronic nicotine (cNIC) potently enhances nAChR function in dendrites of MHb neurons. However, whether cNIC modulates downstream components of the habenulo-interpeduncular (Hb-IP) circuit is unknown. In this study, cNIC-mediated changes to Hb-IP nAChR function were examined in mouse (male and female) brain slices using molecular, electrophysiological, and optical techniques. cNIC enhanced action potential firing and modified spike waveform characteristics in MHb neurons. Nicotine uncaging revealed nAChR functional enhancement by cNIC on proximal axonal membranes. Similarly, nAChR-driven glutamate release from MHb axons was enhanced by cNIC. In IPN, the target structure of MHb axons, neuronal morphology, and nAChR expression is complex, with stronger nAChR function in the rostral subnucleus [rostral IPN (IPR)]. As in MHb, cNIC induced strong upregulation of nAChR function in IPN neurons. This, coupled with cNIC-enhanced nicotine-stimulated glutamate release, was associated with stronger depolarization responses to brief (1 ms) nicotine uncaging adjacent to IPR neurons. Together, these results indicate that chronic exposure to nicotine dramatically alters nicotinic cholinergic signaling and cell excitability in Hb-IP circuits, a key pathway involved in nicotine dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study uncovers several neuropharmacological alterations following chronic exposure to nicotine in a key brain circuit involved in nicotine dependence. These results suggest that smokers or regular users of electronic nicotine delivery systems (i.e., &quot;e-cigarettes&quot;) likely undergo sensitization of cholinergic circuitry in the Hb-IP system. Reducing the activity of Hb-IP nAChRs, either volitionally during smoking cessation or inadvertently via receptor desensitization during nicotine intake, may be a key trigger of withdrawal in nicotine dependence. Escalation of nicotine intake in smokers, or tolerance, may involve stimulation of these sensitized cholinergic pathways. Smoking cessation therapeutics are only marginally effective, and by identifying cellular/receptor mechanisms of nicotine dependence, our results take a step toward improved therapeutic approaches for this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Proprioceptive feedback from Group Ia/II muscle spindle afferents and Group Ib Golgi tendon afferents is critical for the normal execution of most motor tasks, yet how these distinct proprioceptor subtypes emerge during development remains poorly understood. Using molecular genetic approaches in mice of either sex, we identified 24 transcripts that have not previously been associated with a proprioceptor identity. Combinatorial expression analyses of these markers reveal at least three molecularly distinct proprioceptor subtypes. In addition, we find that 12 of these transcripts are expressed well after proprioceptors innervate their respective sensory receptors, and expression of three of these markers, including the heart development molecule &lt;i&gt;Heg1&lt;/i&gt;, is significantly reduced in mice that lack muscle spindles. These data reveal &lt;i&gt;Heg1&lt;/i&gt; as a putative marker for proprioceptive muscle spindle afferents. Moreover, they suggest that the phenotypic specialization of functionally distinct proprioceptor subtypes depends, in part, on extrinsic sensory receptor organ-derived signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sensory feedback from muscle spindle (MS) and Golgi tendon organ (GTO) sensory end organs is critical for normal motor control, but how distinct MS and GTO afferent sensory neurons emerge during development remains poorly understood. Using (bulk) transcriptome analysis of genetically identified proprioceptors, this work reveals molecular markers for distinct proprioceptor subsets, including some that appear selectively expressed in MS afferents. Detailed analysis of the expression of these transcripts provides evidence that MS/GTO afferent subtype phenotypes may, at least in part, emerge through extrinsic, sensory end organ-derived signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 (&lt;i&gt;SCN8A&lt;/i&gt;) is a major voltage-gated sodium channel in the mammalian CNS, and is highly concentrated at the axon initial segment (AIS). As previously demonstrated, the microtubule associated protein MAP1B binds the cytoplasmic N terminus of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6, and this interaction is disrupted by the mutation p.VAVP(77–80)AAAA. We now demonstrate that this mutation results in WT expression levels on the somatic surface but reduced surface expression at the AIS of cultured rat embryonic hippocampal neurons from both sexes. The mutation of the MAP1B binding domain did not impair vesicular trafficking and preferential delivery of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 to the AIS; nor was the diffusion of AIS inserted channels altered relative to WT. However, the reduced AIS surface expression of the MAP1B mutant was restored to WT levels by inhibiting endocytosis with Dynasore, indicating that compartment-specific endocytosis was responsible for the lack of AIS accumulation. Interestingly, the lack of AIS targeting resulted in an elevated percentage of persistent current, suggesting that this late current originates predominantly in the soma. No differences in the voltage dependence of activation or inactivation were detected in the MAP1B binding mutant relative to WT channel. We hypothesize that MAP1B binding to the WT Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 masks an endocytic motif, thus allowing long-term stability on the AIS surface. This work identifies a critical and important new role for MAP1B in the regulation of neuronal excitability and adds to our understanding of AIS maintenance and plasticity, in addition to identifying new target residues for pathogenic mutations of &lt;i&gt;SCN8A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 is a major voltage-gated sodium channel in human brain, where it regulates neuronal activity due to its localization at the axon initial segment (AIS). Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 mutations cause epilepsy, intellectual disability, and movement disorders. In the present work, we show that loss of interaction with MAP1B within the Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 N terminus reduces the steady-state abundance of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 at the AIS. The effect is due to increased Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 endocytosis at this neuronal compartment rather than a failure of forward trafficking to the AIS. This work confirms a new biological role of MAP1B in the regulation of sodium channel localization and will contribute to future analysis of patient mutations in the cytoplasmic N terminus of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Changes in inhibitory connections are essential for experience-dependent circuit adaptations. Defects in inhibitory synapses are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, but the molecular processes underlying inhibitory synapse formation are not well understood. Here we use high-resolution two-photon microscopy in organotypic hippocampal slices from GAD65-GFP mice of both sexes to examine the signaling pathways induced by the postsynaptic signaling molecule Semaphorin4D (Sema4D) during inhibitory synapse formation. By monitoring changes in individual GFP-labeled presynaptic boutons, we found that the primary action of Sema4D is to induce stabilization of presynaptic boutons within tens of minutes. Stabilized boutons rapidly recruited synaptic vesicles, followed by accumulation of postsynaptic gephyrin and were functional after 24 h, as determined by electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. Inhibitory boutons are only sensitive to Sema4D at a specific stage during synapse formation and sensitivity to Sema4D is regulated by network activity. We further examined the intracellular signaling cascade triggered by Sema4D and found that bouton stabilization occurs through rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. This could be mimicked by the actin-depolymerizing drug latrunculin B or by reducing ROCK activity. We discovered that the intracellular signaling cascade requires activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET, which is a well known autism risk factor. By using a viral approach to reduce MET levels specifically in inhibitory neurons, we found that their axons are no longer sensitive to Sema4D signaling. Together, our data yield important insights into the molecular pathway underlying activity-dependent Sema4D-induced synapse formation and reveal a novel role for presynaptic MET at inhibitory synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABAergic synapses provide the main inhibitory control of neuronal activity in the brain. We wanted to unravel the sequence of molecular events that take place when formation of inhibitory synapses is triggered by a specific signaling molecule, Sema4D. We find that this signaling pathway depends on network activity and involves specific remodeling of the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. We also reveal a previously unknown role for MET at inhibitory synapses. Our study provides novel insights into the dynamic process of inhibitory synapse formation. As defects in GABAergic synapses have been implied in many brain disorders, and mutations in MET are strong risk factors for autism, our findings urge for a further investigation of the role of MET at inhibitory synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alterations in pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a multifunctional neuropeptide, and its receptors have been identified as risk factors for certain psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Increasing evidence from human genetic and animal model studies suggest an association between various psychiatric disorders and altered dendritic spine morphology. In the present study, we investigated the role of exogenous and endogenous PACAP in spine formation and maturation. PACAP modified the density and morphology of PSD-95-positive spines in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Notably, PACAP increased the levels of microRNA (miR)-132 and decreased expression of corresponding miR-132 target genes and protein expression of p250GAP, a miR-132 effector known to be involved in spine morphology regulation. In corroboration, PSD-95-positive spines were reduced in PACAP-deficient (&lt;i&gt;PACAP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice versus WT mice. Golgi staining of hippocampal CA1 neurons revealed a reduced spine densities and atypical morphologies in the male &lt;i&gt;PACAP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Furthermore, viral miR-132 overexpression reversed the reduction in hippocampal spinal density in the male &lt;i&gt;PACAP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. These results indicate that PACAP signaling plays a critical role in spine morphogenesis possibly via miR-132. We suggest that dysfunction of PACAP signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, at least partly through its effects on spine formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) signaling dysfunction and dendritic spine morphology alterations have recently been suggested as important pathophysiological mechanisms underlying several psychiatric and neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated whether PACAP regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis. In a combination of pharmacological and viral gain- and loss-of-function approaches &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments, we found PACAP to increase the size and density of dendritic spines via miR-132 upregulation. Together, our data suggest that a dysfunction of PACAP signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, at least partly through abnormal spine formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The Golgi apparatus plays an indispensable role in posttranslational modification and transport of proteins to their target destinations. Although it is well established that the Golgi apparatus requires an acidic luminal pH for optimal activity, morphological and functional abnormalities at the neuronal circuit level because of perturbations in Golgi pH are not fully understood. In addition, morphological alteration of the Golgi apparatus is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we used anatomical and electrophysiological approaches to characterize morphological and functional abnormalities of neuronal circuits in Golgi pH regulator (GPHR) conditional knock-out mice. Purkinje cells (PCs) from the mutant mice exhibited vesiculation and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, followed by axonal degeneration and progressive cell loss. Morphological analysis provided evidence for the disruption of basket cell (BC) terminals around PC soma, and electrophysiological recordings showed selective loss of large amplitude responses, suggesting BC terminal disassembly. In addition, the innervation of mutant PCs was altered such that climbing fiber (CF) terminals abnormally synapsed on the somatic spines of mutant PCs in the mature cerebellum. The combined results describe an essential role for luminal acidification of the Golgi apparatus in maintaining proper neuronal morphology and neuronal circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation is critical for maintenance and modification of synapse strength. Specifically, NMDAR activation by spontaneous glutamate release has been shown to mediate some forms of synaptic plasticity as well as synaptic development. Interestingly, there is evidence that within individual synapses each release mode may be segregated such that postsynaptically there are distinct pools of responsive receptors. To examine potential regulators of NMDAR activation because of spontaneous glutamate release in cultured hippocampal neurons, we used GCaMP6f imaging at single synapses in concert with confocal and super-resolution imaging. Using these single-spine approaches, we found that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry activated by spontaneous release tends to be carried by GluN2B-NMDARs. Additionally, the amount of NMDAR activation varies greatly both between synapses and within synapses, and is unrelated to spine and synapse size, but does correlate loosely with synapse distance from the soma. Despite the critical role of spontaneous activation of NMDARs in maintaining synaptic function, their activation seems to be controlled factors other than synapse size or synapse distance from the soma. It is most likely that NMDAR activation by spontaneous release influenced variability in subsynaptic receptor position, release site position, vesicle content, and channel properties. Therefore, spontaneous activation of NMDARs appears to be regulated distinctly from other receptor types, notably AMPARs, within individual synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural network models for NLP are typically implemented without the explicit
encoding of language rules and yet they are able to break one performance
record after another. Despite much work, it is still unclear what the
representations learned by these networks correspond to. We propose here a
novel approach for interpreting neural networks that relies on the only
processing system we have that does understand language: the human brain. We
use brain imaging recordings of subjects reading complex natural text to
interpret word and sequence embeddings from 4 recent NLP models - ELMo, USE,
BERT and Transformer-XL. We study how their representations differ across layer
depth, context length, and attention type. Our results reveal differences in
the context-related representations across these models. Further, in the
transformer models, we find an interaction between layer depth and context
length, and between layer depth and attention type. We finally use the insights
from the attention experiments to alter BERT: we remove the learned attention
at shallow layers, and show that this manipulation improves performance on a
wide range of syntactic tasks. Cognitive neuroscientists have already begun
using NLP networks to study the brain, and this work closes the loop to allow
the interaction between NLP and cognitive neuroscience to be a true
cross-pollination.

 &lt;p&gt;A wide variety of complex systems exhibit large fluctuations both in space
and time that often can be attributed to the presence of some kind of critical
phenomena. Under such critical scenario it is well known that the properties of
the correlation functions in space and time are two sides of the same coin.
Here we test wether systems exhibiting a phase transition could self-tune to
its critical point taking advantage of such correlation properties. We describe
results in three models: the 2D Ising ferromagnetic model, the 3D Vicsek
flocking model and a small-world neuronal network model. We illustrate how the
feedback of the autocorrelation function of the order parameter fluctuations is
able to shift the system towards its critical point. Since the results rely on
universal properties they are expected to be relevant to a variety of other
settings.

 &lt;p&gt;To understand the learning process in brains, biologically plausible
algorithms have been explored by modeling the detailed neuron properties and
dynamics. On the other hand, simplified multi-layer models of neural networks
have shown great success on computational tasks such as image classification
and speech recognition. However, the computational models that can achieve good
accuracy for these learning applications are very different from the
bio-plausible models. This paper studies whether a bio-plausible model of a in
vitro living neural network can be used to perform machine learning tasks and
achieve good inference accuracy. A novel two-layer bio-hardware hybrid neural
network is proposed. The biological layer faithfully models variations of
synapses, neurons, and network sparsity in in vitro living neural networks. The
hardware layer is a computational fully-connected layer that tunes parameters
to optimize for accuracy. Several techniques are proposed to improve the
inference accuracy of the proposed hybrid neural network. For instance, an
adaptive pre-processing technique helps the proposed neural network to achieve
good learning accuracy for different living neural network sparsity. The
proposed hybrid neural network with realistic neuron parameters and variations
achieves a 98.3% testing accuracy for the handwritten digit recognition task on
the full MNIST dataset.

 &lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized AI due to their remarkable
performance in pattern recognition, comprising of both memorizing complex
training sets and demonstrating intelligence by generalizing to previously
unseen data (test sets). The high generalization performance in DNNs has been
explained by several mathematical tools, including optimization, information
theory, and resilience analysis. In humans, it is the ability to abstract
concepts from examples that facilitates generalization; this paper thus
researches DNN generalization from that perspective. A recent computational
neuroscience study revealed a correlation between abstraction and particular
neural firing patterns. We express these brain patterns in a closed-form
mathematical expression, termed the `Cognitive Neural Activation metric' (CNA)
and apply it to DNNs. Our findings reveal parallels in the mechanism underlying
abstraction in DNNs and those in the human brain. Beyond simply measuring
similarity to human abstraction, the CNA is able to predict and rate how well a
DNN will perform on test sets, and determines the best network architectures
for a given task in a manner not possible with extant tools. These results were
validated on a broad range of datasets (including ImageNet and random labeled
datasets) and neural architectures.

		<content type="html">
 Background: Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) were discovered nearly a century ago. This article aims to analyze the research literature landscape associated with MAOs as privileged class of neuronal enzymes (neuroenzymes) with key functions in the processes of neurodegeneration, serving as important biological targets in neuroscience. With the accumulating publications on this topic, we aimed to evaluate the publication and citation performance of the contributors, reveal the popular research themes, and identify its historical roots.
Methods: The electronic database of Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was searched to identify publications related to MAOs, which were analyzed according to their publication year, authorship, institutions, countries/regions, journal title, WoS category, total citation count, and publication type. VOSviewer was utilized to visualize the citation patterns of the words appearing in the titles and abstracts, and author keywords. CRExplorer was utilized to identify seminal references cited by the MAO publications.
Results: The literature analysis was based on 19,854 publications. Most of them were original articles (n = 15,148, 76.3%) and reviews (n = 2,039, 10.3%). The top five WoS categories of the analyzed MAO publications were Pharmacology/Pharmacy (n = 4,664, 23.5%), Neurosciences (n = 4,416, 22.2%), Psychiatry (n = 2,906, 14.6%), Biochemistry/Molecular Biology (n = 2,691, 13.6%), and Clinical Neurology (n = 1,754, 8.8%). The top ten institutions are scattered in the United States, UK, France, Sweden, Canada, Israel, and Russia, while the top ten countries/regions with the most intensive research on the field of MAOs are the United States, followed by European and Asian countries. More highly cited publications generally involved neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, as well as the MAO-A inhibitors moclobemide and clorgyline, and the irreversible MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline.
Conclusion: Through decades of research, the literature has accumulated many publications investigating the therapeutic effects of MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) on various neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and depression. We envision that MAO literature will continue to grow steadily, with more new therapeutic candidates being tested for better management of neurological conditions, in particular, with the development of multi-target acting drugs against neurodegenerative diseases.</content>

 Accumulation of misfolded proteins is a central paradigm in neurodegeneration. Because of the key role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in regulating protein homeostasis, in the last decade multiple reports implicated this organelle in the progression of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative illnesses. In PD, dopaminergic neuron loss or more broadly neurodegeneration has been improved by overexpression of genes involved in the ER stress response. In addition, toxic alpha-synuclein (αS), the main constituent of proteinacious aggregates found in tissue samples of PD patients, has been shown to cause ER stress by altering intracellular protein traffic, synaptic vesicles transport and Ca2+ homeostasis. In this review, we will be summarizing evidence correlating impaired ER functionality to PD pathogenesis, focusing our attention on how toxic, aggregated αS can promote ER stress and cell death.</content>

 The cross-regional neurons in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamus regulate the central nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, in a sleep–wake cycle-dependent manner. A characteristic brain wave, called slow wave, of about 1 Hz is observed during non-REM sleep, and the sleep homeostasis hypothesis proposes that the synaptic connection of a neural network is weakened during sleep. In the present study, in in vitro human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, we investigated the responses to the neuromodulator known to be involved in sleep–wake regulation. We also determined whether long-term depression (LTD)-like phenomena could be induced by 1 Hz low-frequency stimulation (LFS), which is within the range of the non-REM sleep slow wave. A dose-dependent increase was observed in the number of synchronized burst firings (SBFs) when 0.1–1000 nM of serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, orexin, or noradrenaline, all with increased extracellular levels during wakefulness, was administered to hiPSC-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons. The number of SBFs repeatedly increased up to 5 hours after 100 nM serotonin administration, inducing a 24-h rhythm cycle. Next, in human iPSC-derived glutamate neurons, 1 Hz LFS was administered four times for 15 min every 90 min. A significant reduction in both the number of firings and SBFs was observed in the 15 minutes immediately after LFS. Decreased frequency of spontaneous activity and recovery over time were repeatedly observed. Furthermore, we found that LFS attenuates synaptic connections, and particularly attenuates the strong connections in the neuronal network, and does not cause uniform attenuation. These results suggest sleep–wake states can be mimicked by cyclic neuromodulator administration and show that LTD-like phenomena can be induced by LFS in in vitro human iPSC-derived neurons. These results could be applied in studies on the mechanism of slow waves during sleep or in an in vitro drug efficacy evaluation depending on sleep–wake state.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Although the occurrence of Parkinsonian akinesia and tremor is traditionally associated to dopaminergic degeneration, the multifaceted neural processes that cause these impairments are not fully understood. As a consequence, current dopamine medications cannot be tailored to the specific dysfunctions of patients with the result that generic drug therapies produce different effects on akinesia and tremor. This article proposes a computational model focusing on the role of dopamine impairments in the occurrence of akinesia and resting tremor. The model has three key features, to date never integrated in a single computational system: (a) an architecture constrained on the basis of the relevant known system-level anatomy of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops; (b) spiking neurons with physiologically-constrained parameters; (c) a detailed simulation of the effects of both phasic and tonic dopamine release. The model exhibits a neural dynamics compatible with that recorded in the brain of primates and humans. Moreover, it suggests that akinesia might involve both tonic and phasic dopamine dysregulations whereas resting tremor might be primarily caused by impairments involving tonic dopamine release and the responsiveness of dopamine receptors. These results could lead to develop new therapies based on a system-level view of the Parkinson's disease and targeting phasic and tonic dopamine in differential ways.</content>

 Compensatory vascular mechanisms can restore cerebral blood flow but fail to protect against chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-mediated neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is known as a vasodilator to protect against ischemic injury in animal models, but its protective role in CCH remains unclear. To determine the effect of PGE1 on cerebral hemodynamics and cognitive functions in CCH, bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) was used to mimic CCH in rats, which were subsequently intravenously injected with PGE1 daily for 2 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging, immunofluorescence staining and Morris water maze (MWM) were used to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF), angiogenesis, and cognitive functions, respectively. We found that PGE1 treatment significantly restored CBF by enhancing vertebral artery dilation. In addition, PGE1 treatment increased the number of microvascular endothelial cells and neuronal cells in the hippocampus, and decreased the numbers of astrocyte and apoptotic cells. In the MWM test, we further showed that the escape latency of CCH rats was significantly reduced after PGE1 treatment. Our results suggest that PGE1 ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in CCH rats by enhancing CBF recovery, sustaining angiogenesis, and reducing astrocyte activation and neuronal loss.</content>

 The current clinical investigation examined high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) as a focal, non-invasive, anti-epileptic treatment in a child with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. We investigated the clinical impact of repetitive (20 daily sessions) cathode-centered 4x1 HD-tDCS (1 mA, 20 minutes, 4 cm ring radius) over the dominant seizure-generating cortical zone in a 40-month old child suffering from a severe neonatal epileptic syndrome known as Ohtahara syndrome (OS). Seizures and epileptiform activity were monitored and quantified using video-EEG over multiple days of baseline, intervention, and post intervention periods. Primary outcome measures were changes in seizure frequency and duration on the last day of intervention versus the last baseline day, preceding the intervention. In particular, we examined changes in tonic spasms, tonic-myoclonic seizures, and myoclonic seizures from baseline to post-intervention. A trend in tonic-myoclonic seizure (TM-S) frequency was observed indicating a reduction of 73% in TM-S frequency, which was non-significant (t(4) = 2.05, p = 0.1), and denoted a clinically significant change. Myoclonic seizure (M-S) frequency was significantly reduced (t(4) = 3.83, p = 0.019) by 68.42%, compared to baseline, and indicated a significant clinical change as well. A 73% decrease in interictal epileptic discharges (IED) frequency was also observed immediately after the intervention period, compared to IED frequency at three days prior to intervention. Post-intervention seizure-related peak delta desynchronization was reduced by 57%. Our findings represent a case-specific significant clinical response, reduction in IED, and change in seizure-related delta activity following the application of HD-tDCS. The clinical outcomes, as noted in the current study, encourage the further investigation of this focal, non-invasive neuromodulation procedure in other severe electroclinical syndromes (e.g., West syndrome) and in larger pediatric populations diagnosed with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.</content>

 We observed fine fibrin deposition along the paravascular spaces in naive animals, which increased dramatically following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Following SAH, fibrin deposits in the areas remote from the hemorrhage. Traditionally it is thought that fibrinogen enters subarachnoid space through damaged blood brain barrier. However, deposition of fibrin remotely from hemorrhage suggests that fibrinogen chains Aα, Bβ and  can originate in the brain. Here we demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that astroglia and neurons are capable of expression of fibrinogen chains.
SAH in mice was induced by the filament perforation of the circle of Willis. Four days after SAH animals were anesthetized, transcardially perfused and fixed. Whole brain was processed for immunofluorescent (IF) analysis of fibrin deposition on the brain surface or in brains slices processed for fibrinogen chains Aα, Bβ,  immunohistochemical detection.
Normal human astrocytes were grown media to confluency and stimulated with NOC-18 (100 μM), TNF-α (100 nM), ATP--S (100 µM) for 24 hours. Culture was fixed and washed/permeabilized with 0.1% Triton and processed for IF.
Four days following SAH fibrinogen chains Aα IF associated with glia limitans and superficial brain layers increased 3.2 and 2.5 times (p&amp;lt;0.05 and p&amp;lt;0.01) on the ventral and dorsal brain surfaces respectively; fibrinogen chains Bβ increased by 3 times (p&amp;lt;0.01) on the dorsal surface and fibrinogen chain  increased by 3 times (p&amp;lt;0.01) on the ventral surface compared to sham animals. 
Human cultured astrocytes and neurons constitutively expressed all three fibrinogen chains. Their expression changed differentially when exposed for 24 hours to biologically significant stimuli: TNFα, NO or ATP. Western blot and RT-qPCR confirmed presence of the products of the appropriate molecular weight and respective mRNA.
We demonstrate for the first time that mouse and human astrocytes and neurons express fibrinogen chains suggesting potential presence of endogenous to the brain fibrinogen chains differentially changing to biologically significant stimuli. SAH is followed by increased expression of fibrinogen chains associated with glia limitans remote from the hemorrhage. We conclude that brain astrocytes and neurons are capable of production of fibrinogen chains, which may be involved in various normal and pathological processes.</content>

 Due to consuming hedonic products unnecessary to basic well-being, consumers need justifications for pleasure. However, different justifications have differential influences in promotion of hedonic purchases, such as price and quantity promotions (PP and QP), the difference between which is that the latter requires purchasing additional units to get the same discount as the former. In the present study, even-related potentials (ERPs) was applied to revealing timing of brain activities for further understand of how promotion information consisted of promotion type (PP and QP) and discount depth, deep and shallow discounts (DD and SD) on hedonic products was processed. Behaviorally, consumers were more willing to purchase items in PP and DD conditions than QP and SD conditions respectively, and spent more time making final purchase decision in QP and DD condition or PP and SD condition compared to PP and DD condition. Neurophysiologically, DD recruited automatically attentional resources than SD and led a higher P2 amplitude. QP and DD condition or PP and SD condition evoked a larger N2 amplitude and enhanced perceptual conflict compared to PP and DD condition. During late stage, PP and DD elicited a more positive LPP amplitude in contrast to QP and SD respectively, indicating that people have stronger purchase intention and positive affect in PP and DD contexts. These findings provided evidence for the differential influences between PP and QP and what ultimately made consumers buy hedonic products or not.</content>

 Magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging non-invasively measures cerebral perfusion, which describes the blood's passage through the brain's vascular network. Therefore it is widely used to assess cerebral ischaemia. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) constitute the state-of-the-art method in automatic pattern recognition and hence, in segmentation tasks. But none of the CNN architectures developed to date have achieved high accuracy when segmenting ischaemic stroke lesions, being the main reasons their heterogeneity in location, shape, size, image intensity and texture, especially in this imaging modality.  We use a freely available CNN framework, developed for MR imaging lesion segmentation, as core algorithm to evaluate the impact of enhanced machine learning techniques, namely data augmentation, transfer learning and post-processing, in the segmentation of stroke lesions using the ISLES 2017 dataset, which contains expert annotated diffusion-weighted perfusion and diffusion brain MRI of 43 stroke patients. Of all the techniques evaluated, data augmentation with binary closing achieved the best results, improving the mean Dice score in 17\% over the baseline model. Consistent with previous works, better performance was obtained in the presence of large lesions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The comorbidity of chronic pain and opioid addiction is a serious problem that has been growing with the practice of prescribing opioids for chronic pain. Neuroimaging research has shown that chronic pain and opioid dependence both affect brain structure and function, but this is the first study to evaluate the neurophysiological alterations in patients with comorbid chronic pain and addiction. Eighteen participants with chronic low back pain and opioid addiction were compared with eighteen age- and sex-matched healthy individuals in a pain-induction fMRI task. Unified structural equation modeling (SEM) with Lagrange multiplier (LM) testing yielded a network model of pain processing for patient and control groups based on 19 a priori defined regions. Tests of differences between groups on specific regression parameters were determined on a path-by-path basis using z-tests corrected for the number of comparisons. Patients with the chronic pain and addiction comorbidity had increased connection strengths; many of these connections were interhemispheric and spanned regions involved in sensory, affective, and cognitive processes. The affected regions included those that are commonly altered in chronic pain or addiction alone, indicating that this comorbidity manifests with neurological symptoms of both disorders. Understanding the neural mechanisms involved in the comorbidity is crucial to finding a comprehensive treatment, rather than treating the symptoms individually.</content>

 Most research on cultural neuroscience focuses on one dimension of culture: group membership or individual orientation. However, it is especially important to examine the intersection between the two to better understand the acculturation process. To examine the role of culture in the neural correlates of risky exploration, the current study recruited 22 American and 24 Chinese international students. Participants reported on their independent self-construal, a measure defining the self in terms of emphasizing unique attributes, and underwent an fMRI scan while completing a risk-taking task. At the group level, American (vs. Chinese) participants showed greater risky exploration on the task. Moreover, while independent self-construal was not related to American individuals’ behavioral performance and neural correlates of risky exploration, Chinese participants who reported greater independent self-construal recruited greater activation in regions of the cognitive control system (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and affective system (e.g., anterior insula), which was related to greater risky exploration. Taken together, our findings suggest that culture as group membership and individual orientation may interact with each other and relate to neural systems underlying risky exploration. This study highlights the importance of studying the role of culture at both group and individual level, which is particularly important to understand individuals as they acculturate to a new environment.</content>

 Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique subset of T lymphocytes with the expression of T cell receptor (TCR) and NK cell lineage receptors. These cells can rapidly release large quantities of cytokines and function as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. To date, multiple reports have investigated the role of NKT cells under various pathological conditions, such as cancer, autoimmune disease and infection. Knowledge about NKT cells in neurological diseases is increasing, albeit limited. Here, we review evidence for the involvement of NKT cells in neurological diseases, and discuss immunotherapeutic potential and future study goals. As the development and function of NKT cells become increasingly well understood, the next few years should yield many new insights into NKT cell function and mechanistic regulation in neurological disorders.</content>

 There is growing recognition of the important role of interaction between neurons and glial cells for brain longevity. The extracellular ATP have been shown to bring significant contribution into bi-directional glia-neuron communications, in particular into astrocyte-driven modulation of synaptic plasticity. To elucidate a putative impact of brain aging on neuron-glia networks, we explored the ageing-related plasticity of the purinoreceptors-mediated signalling in cortical neurons and astrocytes.
We investigated the age- and experience-related alterations in purinergic components of neuronal synaptic currents and astroglial calcium signalling in the layer2/3 of neocortex of mice exposed to the mild caloric restriction (CR) and environmental enrichment (EE) which included ad libitum physical exercise. We observed the considerable age-related decline in the neuronal P2X receptor-mediated miniature spontaneous currents which originated from the release of ATP from both synapses and astrocytes. We also found out that purinergic astrocytic Ca2+-signalling underwent the substantial age-related decline but EE and CR rescued astroglial signalling, in particular mediated by P2X1, P2X1/5 and P2Y1 receptors.
Our data showed that age-related attenuation in the astroglial calcium signalling caused a substantial decrease in the exocytosis of ATP leading to impairment of astroglia-derived purinergic modulation of excitatory synaptic currents and GABAergic tonic inhibitory currents. On a contrary, exposure to EE and CR, which enhanced purinergic astrocytic calcium signalling, up-regulated the excitatory and down-regulated the inhibitory currents in neurons of old mice, thus counterbalancing the impact of ageing on synaptic signalling.
Combined, our results strongly support the physiological importance of ATP-mediated signalling for glia-neuron interactions and brain function. Our data also show that P2 purinoreceptor-mediated communication between astrocytes and neurons in the neocortex undergoes remodelling during brain ageing and decrease in the ATP release may contribute to the age-related impairment of synaptic transmission.</content>

 Schwann cell reprogramming and differentiation are crucial prerequisites for neuronal regeneration and re-myelination to occur following injury to peripheral nerves. The neurotrophin receptor p75NTR has been identified as a positive modulator for Schwann cell myelination during development and implicated in promoting nerve regeneration after injury. However, most studies base this conclusion on results obtained from complete p75NTR knockout mouse models and cannot dissect the specific role of p75NTR expressed by Schwann cells. In this present study, a conditional knockout model selectively deleting p75NTR expression in Schwann cells was generated, where p75NTR expression is replaced with that of an mCherry reporter. Silencing of Schwann cell p75NTR expression was confirmed in the sciatic nerve in vivo and in vitro, without altering axonal expression of p75NTR. No difference in sciatic nerve myelination during development or following sciatic nerve crush injury was observed, as determined by quantification of both myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fiber densities, myelinated axonal diameter and myelin thickness. However, the absence of Schwann cell p75NTR reduced motor nerve conduction velocity after crush injury. 
Our data indicate that the absence of Schwann cell p75NTR expression in vivo is not critical for axonal regrowth or remyelination following sciatic nerve crush injury, but does play a key role in functional recovery. Overall, this represents the first step in redefining the role of p75NTR in the peripheral nervous system, suggesting that the Schwann cell-axon unit functions as a syncytium, with the previous published involvement of p75NTR in remyelination most likely depending on axonal/neuronal p75NTR and/or mutual glial-axonal interactions.</content>

 Abstract: CD73, an ectonucleotidase, participates in the regulation of immune responses by controlling the conversion of extracellular AMP to adenosine. In this study, we investigated whether any type of neural cells, especially neuroglia cells, exhibit altered CD73 expression, localization or activity upon experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAE) induction and whether altered CD73 manipulates the activation of effector T cells that interact with such cell types. First, the amount of cell membrane-exposed CD73 was detected by flow cytometry in various types of neural cells collected from either naïve or EAE mice. Compared to that in astrocytes from naïve control mice, the amount of membrane-bound CD73 was significantly decreased in astrocytes from EAE mice, while no significant differences were detected in other cell types. Thereafter, wild-type and CD73-/- astrocytes were used to study whether CD73 influences the function of inflammatory astrocytes, such as the production of cytokines/chemokines and the activation of effector T cells that interact with astrocytes. The results indicated that the addition of exogenous AMP significantly inhibited cytokine/chemokine production by wild type astrocytes but had no effect on CD73-/- astrocytes and that the effect of AMP effect was almost completely blocked by the addition of either a CD73 inhibitor (APCP) or an adenosine receptor A1 subtype (ARA1) antagonist (SLV320). Although the addition of AMP did not affect CD73-/- astrocytes, the addition of adenosine successfully inhibited their cytokine/chemokine production. The antigen-specific interaction of astrocytes with invading CD4 cells caused CD73 downregulation in astrocytes from mice that underwent EAE induction. Collectively, our findings support the conclusion that, upon EAE induction, likely due to an interaction with invading CD4+ cells, astrocytes lose most of their membrane-localized CD73; this inhibits the generation of adenosine in the local microenvironment. As adenosine has anti-inflammatory effects on astrocytes and CNS-infiltrating effector T cells in EAE, the downregulation of CD73 in astrocytes may be considered a pro-inflammatory process for facilitating the pathogenesis of EAE.</content>

 Introduction: With an ageing population there is an important need for the development of effective treatments for the amelioration of cognitive decline. Multiple mechanisms underlie age-related cognitive decline including cerebrovascular disease, oxidative stress, reduced antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial dysfunction.  CoQ10 is a novel treatment which has the potential to improve brain function in healthy elderly populations due to established beneficial effects on mitochondrial function, vascular function and oxidative stress.  Methods and Analysis: We describe the protocol for a 90-day randomized controlled trial which examines the efficacy of Ubiquinol (200mg/day) versus placebo for the amelioration of cognitive decline in a healthy (non-demented) elderly sample, aged 60 years and over.  The primary outcome is the effect of Ubiquinol at 90-days compared to baseline on CogTrack composite measures of cognition.  Additional cognitive measures, as well as measures of cardiovascular function, oxidative stress, liver function and mood will also be monitored across 30-, 60- and 90- day time points. Data analyses will involve repeated measures analysis of variance. Discussion: This study will be the first of its kind to provide important clinical and mechanistic data regarding the efficacy of Ubiquinol as a treatment for age-related cognitive decline in the healthy elderly with important implications for productivity and quality of life within this age group. Ethics and Dissemination: The study has been approved by the institutional ethics committee and all participants will provide written informed consent. Additionally, the trial has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTRN12618001841268).</content>

 Fluorescent transcriptional reporters are widely used as signaling reporters and biomarkers to monitor pathway activities and determine cell type identities. However, a large amount of dynamic information is lost due to the long half-life of the fluorescent proteins. To better detect dynamics, fluorescent transcriptional reporters can be destabilized to shorten their half-lives. However, applications of this approach &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are limited due to significant reduction of signal intensities. To overcome this limitation, we enhanced translation of a destabilized fluorescent protein and demonstrate the advantages of this approach by characterizing spatio-temporal changes of transcriptional activities in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, by combining a fast-folding destabilized fluorescent protein and a slow-folding long-lived fluorescent protein, we generated a dual-color transcriptional timer that provides spatio-temporal information about signaling pathway activities. Finally, we demonstrate the use of this transcriptional timer to identify new genes with dynamic expression patterns.</content>

 Lung cancer and chronic lung diseases impose major disease burdens worldwide and are caused by inhaled noxious agents including tobacco smoke. The cellular origins of environmental-induced lung tumors and of the dysfunctional airway and alveolar epithelial turnover observed with chronic lung diseases are unknown. To address this, we combined mouse models of genetic labeling and ablation of airway (club) and alveolar cells with exposure to environmental noxious and carcinogenic agents. Club cells are shown to survive &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; mutations and to form lung tumors after tobacco carcinogen exposure. Increasing numbers of club cells are found in the alveoli with aging and after lung injury, but go undetected since they express alveolar proteins. Ablation of club cells prevents chemical lung tumors and causes alveolar destruction in adult mice. Hence club cells are important in alveolar maintenance and carcinogenesis and may be a therapeutic target against premalignancy and chronic lung disease.</content>

 Thyroid hormone (TH) regulates diverse developmental events and can drive disparate cellular outcomes. In zebrafish, TH has opposite effects on neural crest derived pigment cells of the adult stripe pattern, limiting melanophore population expansion, yet increasing yellow/orange xanthophore numbers. To learn how TH elicits seemingly opposite responses in cells having a common embryological origin, we analyzed individual transcriptomes from thousands of neural crest derived cells, reconstructed developmental trajectories, identified pigment cell-lineage specific responses to TH, and assessed roles for TH receptors. We show that TH promotes maturation of both cell types but in distinct ways. In melanophores, TH drives terminal differentiation, limiting final cell numbers. In xanthophores, TH promotes accumulation of orange carotenoids, making the cells visible. TH receptors act primarily to repress these programs when TH is limiting. Our findings show how a single endocrine factor integrates very different cellular activities during the generation of adult form.</content>

		<content type="html">
 There is still a controversial debate regarding, where in the processing hierarchy of the central nervous system (CNS) selective attention takes effect. The auditory system can influence cochlear processes via direct and mediated (by the inferior colliculus) projections from the auditory cortex to the superior olivary complex (SOC). Studies illustrating attentional modulations of cochlear responses have so far been limited to sound evoked responses. The aim of the present study was to investigate intermodal (audiovisual) selective attention in humans simultaneously at the cortical and cochlear level during a stimulus-free cue-target period. We found that cochlear activity in the silent cue-target periods was modulated by a theta-rhythmic pattern (~4 Hz). While this pattern was present independently of attentional focus, cochlear theta activity was clearly enhanced when attending to the upcoming auditory input. On a cortical level classical posterior alpha and beta power enhancements were found during auditory selective attention. Interestingly, participants with a stronger attentional modulation of cochlear theta activity show to lesser extent the classical posterior alpha effect. These results hint at a putative theta-rhythmic sampling of auditory input at the cochlear level. Furthermore, our results point to an interindividual variability to what extent efferent pathways are engaged in an attentional context and linked to neural processes outside of the auditory system.</content>

 Genetically influenced changes in brain organization occur over the course of development. Large-scale brain imaging studies by the ENIGMA Consortium identified structural changes associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is not clear why some brain regions are impaired and others spared by the etiological risks for ADHD. We hypothesized that spatial variation in brain cell organization and/or pathway expression levels contribute to selective brain region vulnerability (SBRV) in ADHD. In this study, we used the largest available collection of imaging results from the ADHD ENIGMA Consortium along with high-resolution postmortem brain microarray data from Allen Brain Atlas from 22 sub-cortical and cortical brain regions to investigate our selective brain region vulnerability (SBRV) hypothesis. We performed deconvolution of the bulk transcriptomic data to determine abundances of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the brain. We then assessed the relationships between gene set expression levels, cell abundance, and standardized effect sizes representing regional changes in brain sizes in cases of ADHD. Our analysis yielded significant correlations between apoptosis, autophagy, and neurodevelopment genes with reductions in regional brain sizes in ADHD, along with associations to regional abundances of dopaminergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neural progenitor cells. This works provides novel mechanistic insights into SBRV in ADHD.</content>

 A medical student learning to perform a laparoscopic procedure as well as a recently paralyzed user of a powered wheelchair must learn to operate machinery via interfaces that translate their actions into commands for the external device. Mathematically, we describe this type of learning as a deterministic dynamical process, whose state is the evolving forward and inverse internal models of the interface. The forward model predicts the outcomes of actions while the inverse model generates actions designed to attain desired outcomes. Both the mathematical analysis of learning dynamics and the performance observed in a group of subjects demonstrate first-order exponential convergence of the learning process toward a particular state that depends only on the initial inverse and forward models and on the supplied sequence of targets. Noise is not only present but necessary for the convergence of learning through the minimization of the difference between actual and predicted outcomes.</content>

 The hippocampal local field potential (LFP) displays large irregular activity (LIA) during quiet wakefulness and theta oscillations during exploratory behaviors. The hippocampal CA3 subregion is important for rapid memory encoding and integrates multimodal information processed in the entorhinal cortex. We have explored the intracellular dynamics of CA3 pyramidal cells (PCs) in awake mice using whole-cell and LFP recordings in awake head-fixed mice combined with measurements of pupil diameter and running speed. We have examined how single properties contribute to network processing across brain states. LIA coincides with higher synaptic and network noise and in some cells, starts with a transient increase in Vm and firing. During theta, most CA3 PCs hyperpolarize, reduce firing, and have lower Vm variance. However, a small subpopulation of CA3 PCs depolarizes and increases firing. These intracellular modulations during theta and LIA allow sparse coding in CA3 across different brain states.</content>

 Recently, genes associated with immune response and inflammation have been identified as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). One of them is the rare p.Arg47His (R47H) variant within triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which has been shown to increase the risk for developing AD 2-3-fold. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a model of LOAD using lymphoblast-derived iPSCs from patients harbouring the R47H mutation in TREM2 (AD TREM2 iPSCs), as well as from control individuals without dementia (CON iPSCs). iPSCs efficiently differentiate into mature neuronal cultures and comparative global transcriptome analysis identified a distinct gene expression profile in AD TREM2 neuronal cultures. Furthermore, manipulation of the iPSC-derived functional neuronal cultures with an A{beta}-S8C dimer highlighted metabolic pathways, phagosome and immune response as the most perturbed pathways in AD TREM2 neuronal cultures. Through the construction of an A{beta}-induced gene regulatory network, we were able to identify an A{beta} signature linked to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which emphasised ER-stress, as a potential causal role in LOAD. Overall, this study has shown that our AD-iPSC based model can be used for in-depth studies to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology of LOAD and provides new opportunities for screening of potential therapeutic targets.</content>

 Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induces ischemia characterized by a densely ischemic focus, and a less densely ischemic penumbral zone in which neurons and astrocytes display age dependent dynamic variations in spontaneous Calcium activities. However, it is unknown whether penumbral nerve cells respond to sensory stimulation early after stroke onset, which is critical for understanding stimulation induced stroke therapy. In this study, we investigated the ischemic penumbral capacity to respond to somatosensory input. We examined adult (3 to 4 months old) and old (18 to 24 months old) male mice at 2 to 4 hours after MCAO, using two photon microscopy to record somatosensory stimulation induced neuronal and astrocytic Calcium signals in the ischemic penumbra. In both adult and old mice, MCAO abolished spontaneous and stimulation induced electrical activity in the penumbra, and strongly reduced stimulation induced Calcium responses in neuronal somas (35 to 82%) and neuropil (92 to 100%) in the penumbra. In comparison, after stroke, stimulation induced astrocytic Calcium responses in the penumbra were only moderately reduced (by 54 to 62%) in adult mice, and were even better preserved (reduced by 31 to 38%) in old mice. Our results suggest that somatosensory stimulation evokes astrocytic Calcium activity in the ischemic penumbra. We hypothesize that the relatively preserved excitability of astrocytes, most prominent in aged mice, may modulate protection from ischemic infarcts during early somatosensory activation of an ischemic cortical area. Future neuroprotective efforts in stroke may target spontaneous or stimulation-induced activity of astrocytes in the ischemic penumbra.</content>

 Background and objectives: Cognitive deficits in MS are common, also early in the disease course. We aimed to identify if estimated brain age from MRI could serve as an imaging marker for early cognitive symptoms in a longitudinal MS study. Methods: A group of 76 MS patients (mean age 34 years, 71% females, 96% relapsing-remitting) was examined 1, 2 and 5 years after diagnosis. A machine-learning model using Freesurfer-processed T1-weighted brain MRI data from 3208 healthy controls, was applied to develop a prediction model for brain age. The difference between estimated and chronological brain age was calculated (brain age gap). Tests of memory, attention and executive functions were performed. Associations between brain age gap and cognitive performance were assessed using linear mixed effects (LME) models and corrected for multiple testing. Results: LME models revealed a significant association between the Color Naming condition of Color-Word Interference Test and brain age gap (t=2.84, p=0.005). Conclusions: In this study, decreased information processing speed correlated with increased brain age gap. Our findings suggest that brain age estimation using MRI provides a useful semi-automated approach applying machine learning for individual level brain phenotyping and correlates with information processing speed in the early course of MS.</content>

 Previous studies based on the 'Quantal Model' for synaptic transmission suggested that neurotransmitter release is mediated by a single release site at individual synaptic contacts in the neocortex. However, recent studies seem to contradict this hypothesis and indicate that multi-vesicular release (MVR) could better explain the synaptic response variability observed in vitro. In this study we present a novel method to estimate the number of release sites per synapse, also known as the size of the readily-releasable pool (NRRP), from paired whole-cell recordings of layer 5 thick tufted pyramidal cell (L5_TTPC) connections in the somatosensory neocortex. Our approach extends the work of Loebel and colleagues to take advantage of a recently reported data-driven biophysical model of neocortical tissue. Using this approach, we estimated NRRP to be between two to three for connections between L5-TTPC. To constrain NRRP values for other connections in the microcircuit, we developed and validated a generalization approach using data on post-synaptic potential (PSP) coefficient of variations (CVs) from literature and matching to in silico experiments. Our study shows that synaptic connections in the neocortex generally are mediated by MVR and provides a data-driven approach to constrain the MVR model parameters of the microcircuit.</content>

 Changing sleep rhythms in adolescents often lead to sleep deficits and increased variability in sleep schedules. The adolescent brain, and in particular the rapidly developing structures involved in emotional control, are vulnerable to external and internal factors. In our previous study in adolescents at age 14, we observed a strong relationship between weekend sleep schedules and regional medial prefrontal cortex grey matter volumes. Here, we aimed to assess whether this relationship remained in this group of adolescents of the general population at the age of 16 (n=101; mean age 16.8 years; 55% girls). We further examined grey matter volumes in the hippocampi and the amygdalae, calculated with voxel-based morphometry. In addition, we investigated the relationship between regional grey matter volumes with psychological functioning. Sleep was assessed with self-reports and psychological functioning with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and tests on working memory and impulsivity. Later weekend wake-up times were associated with smaller grey matter volumes in the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdalae, and greater weekend delays in wake-up time were associated with smaller grey matter volumes in the right hippocampus and amygdala. The medial prefrontal cortex region mediated the correlation between weekend wake up time and both externalising and internalising symptoms. Paying attention to regular sleep habits during adolescence could act as a protective factor against the emergence of psychopathology via enabling favourable brain development.</content>

Motivation: Recently, copy number variation (CNV) has gained considerable interest as a type of genomic variation that plays an important role in complex phenotypes and disease susceptibility. Since a number of CNV detection methods have recently been developed, it is necessary to help investigators choose suitable methods for CNV detection depending on their objectives. For this reason, this study compared ten commonly used CNV detection applications, including CNVnator, ReadDepth, RDXplorer, LUMPY and Control-FREEC, benchmarking the applications by sensitivity, specificity and computational demands. Taking the DGV gold standard variants as a standard dataset, we evaluated the ten applications with real sequencing data at sequencing depths from 5X to 50X. Among the ten methods benchmarked, LUMPY performs the best for both high sensitivity and specificity at each sequencing depth. For the purpose of high specificity, Canvas is also a good choice. If high sensitivity is preferred, CNVnator and RDXplorer are better choices. Additionally, CNVnator and GROM-RD perform well for low-depth sequencing data. Our results provide a comprehensive performance evaluation for these selected CNV detection methods and facilitate future development and improvement in CNV prediction methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jyx7m2HRmyI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Drug screening studies typically involve assaying the sensitivity of a range of cancer cell lines across an array of anti-cancer therapeutics. Alongside these sensitivity measurements high dimensional molecular characterizations of the cell lines are typically available, including gene expression, copy number variation and genomic mutations. We propose a sparse multitask regression model which learns discriminative latent characteristics that predict drug sensitivity and are associated with specific molecular features. We use ideas from Bayesian nonparametrics to automatically infer the appropriate number of these latent characteristics. The resulting analysis couples high predictive performance with interpretability since each latent characteristic involves a typically small set of drugs, cell lines and genomic features. Our model uncovers a number of drug-gene sensitivity associations missed by single gene analyses. We functionally validate one such novel association: that increased expression of the cell-cycle regulator C/EBP&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; decreases sensitivity to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N2A0MuxvsGA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from anti‐CD20 therapies demonstrate that B‐ and T‐cell interaction is a major driver of multiple sclerosis (MS). The local presence of B‐cell follicle‐like structures and oligoclonal bands in MS patients indicate that certain B cells infiltrate the CNS to mediate pathology. Which peripheral triggers underlie the development of CNS‐infiltrating B cells is not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; flow cytometry was used to assess chemokine receptor profiles of B cells in blood, CSF, meningeal and brain tissues of MS patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=10). Similar analyses were performed for distinct memory subsets in the blood of untreated and natalizumab‐treated MS patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=38). To assess T‐bet(CXCR3)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; B‐cell differentiation, we cultured B cells from MS patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=21) and healthy individuals (n=34) under T helper 1 and TLR9‐inducing conditions. Their CNS transmigration capacity was confirmed using brain endothelial monolayers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3)‐expressing B cells were enriched in different CNS compartments of MS patients. Treatment with clinically effective drug natalizumab prevented the recruitment of CXCR3&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; IgG1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subsets, corresponding to their increased ability to cross CNS barriers &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Blocking of IFN‐γ reduced the transmigration potential and antigen‐presenting cell function of these cells. IFN‐γ‐induced B cells from MS patients showed increased T‐bet expression and plasmablast development. Additional TLR9 triggering further upregulated T‐bet and CXCR3, and was essential for IgG1 switching.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that T‐bet&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; IgG1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; B cells are triggered by IFN‐γ and TLR9 signals, likely contributing to enhanced CXCR3‐mediated recruitment and local reactivity in the CNS of MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 Mitochondria in neurons, in addition to their primary role in bioenergetics, also contribute to specialized functions, including regulation of synaptic transmission, Ca2+ homeostasis, neuronal excitability, and stress adaptation.

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Acquisition of social proficiency entails behavioral adaptations to social experience, including both behavioral flexibility and inhibition of behaviors inappropriate in specific social contexts. Here, we investigated the contributions of testosterone and FosB, a transcription factor linked to experience-dependent neural plasticity, to the adolescent maturation of social proficiency in male-female social interactions. To determine whether pubertal testosterone organizes circuits underlying social proficiency, we first compared behavioral adaptations to sexual experience in male Syrian hamsters that were deprived of testosterone during puberty (prepubertal castration; NoT@P) to those of males deprived of testosterone for an equivalent period of time in adulthood (postpubertal castration; T@P). All males were given testosterone replacement in adulthood for two weeks before sexual behavior testing, where males were allowed to interact with a receptive female once per week for five consecutive weeks. T@P males showed the expected decrease in ectopic (mis-directed) mounts with sexual experience, whereas NoT@P males did not. In addition, sexual experience induced &lt;i&gt;FosB&lt;/i&gt; gene products expression in the infralimbic cortex (IL) in T@P, but not NoT@P, males. Over-expression of FosB via an adeno-associated viral vector in the IL of NoT@P males prior to sexual behavior testing was sufficient to produce a behavioral phenotype similar to that of experienced T@P males. Finally, over-expression of FosB in IL increased the density of immature spines on IL dendrites. Our findings provide evidence that social proficiency acquired through sexual experience is organized by pubertal testosterone through the regulation of FosB in the IL, possibly through increasing synaptic lability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Social proficiency is the ability to make experience-dependent behavioral adaptations that enhance the success of subsequent social interactions. In male rodents, social proficiency in adulthood is programmed by the pubertal rise in testosterone, but neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying this behavioral plasticity are not understood. We show that pubertal testosterone is necessary for both sexual proficiency and experience-dependent induction of FosB in the infralimbic (IL) medial prefrontal cortex in adulthood. Furthermore, over-expression of FosB in the IL increases immature dendritic spines on IL neurons and is sufficient to restore a socially proficient phenotype in males that lacked testosterone during puberty. Hormonal programming of experience-dependent regulation of prefrontal FosB is a novel mechanism of adolescent development of behavioral and neural plasticity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Skilled motor behavior relies on the ability to control the body and to predict the sensory consequences of this control. While there is ample evidence that manual dexterity depends on handedness, it remains unclear whether control and prediction are similarly impacted. To address this issue, right-handed human participants performed two tasks either with the right or the left hand. In the first task, participants had to move a cursor with their hand so as to track a target that followed a quasi-random trajectory. This hand tracking task allowed testing the ability to control the hand along an imposed trajectory. In the second task, participants had to track with their eyes a target that was self-moved through voluntary hand motion. This eye tracking task allowed testing the ability to predict the visual consequences of hand movements. As expected, results showed that hand tracking was more accurate with the right hand than with the left hand. In contrast, eye tracking was similar in terms of spatial and temporal gaze attributes whether the target was moved by the right or the left hand. While these results extend previous evidence for different levels of control by the two hands, they show that the ability to predict the visual consequences of self-generated actions does not depend on handedness. We propose that the greater dexterity exhibited by the dominant hand in many motor tasks stems from advantages in control, not in prediction. Finally these findings support the notion that prediction and control are distinct processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans often exhibit greater manual dexterity with the dominant hand. Here we assessed whether handedness similarly impacts control and prediction, two key processes for skilled motor behavior. Using two eye-hand coordination tasks that differently rely on control and prediction, we show that, even though handedness impacts the accuracy of hand movement control, it has virtually no influence on the ability to predict the visual consequences of hand movements. We propose that the superior performance of the dominant hand stems from advantages in control, not in prediction. In addition, these findings provide further evidence that prediction and control are distinct neural processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Goodman, Azad Bonni&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precise temporal and spatial control of gene expression is essential for brain development. Besides DNA sequence-specific transcription factors, epigenetic factors play an integral role in the control of gene expression in neurons. Among epigenetic mechanisms, chromatin remodeling enzymes have emerged as essential to the control of neural circuit assembly and function in the brain. Here, we review recent studies on the roles and mechanisms of the chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding (Chd) family of chromatin remodeling enzymes in the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity in the mammalian brain. We explore the field through the lens of Chd3, Chd4, and Chd5 proteins, which incorporate into the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, and the related proteins Chd7 and Chd8, implicated in the pathogenesis of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. These studies have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate neuronal connectivity in brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders of cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Small-world structures are often used to describe structural connections in
the brain. In this work, we compare the structural connection of cortical areas
of a healthy brain and a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease with artificial
small-world networks. Based on statistics analysis, we demonstrate that similar
small-world networks can be constructed using Newman-Watts procedure. The
network quantifiers of both structural matrices are identified inside the
probabilistic valley. Despite of similarities between structural connection
matrices and sampled small-world networks, increased assortativity can be found
in the Alzheimer brain. Our results indicate that network quantifiers can be
helpful to identify abnormalities in real structural connection matrices.

 &lt;p&gt;People act upon their desires, but often, also act in adherence to implicit
social norms. How do people infer these unstated social norms from others'
behavior, especially in novel social contexts? We propose that laypeople have
intuitive theories of social norms as behavioral constraints shared across
different agents in the same social context. We formalize inference of norms
using a Bayesian Theory of Mind approach, and show that this computational
approach provides excellent predictions of how people infer norms in two
scenarios. Our results suggest that people separate the influence of norms and
individual desires on others' actions, and have implications for modelling
generalizations of hidden causes of behavior.

 &lt;p&gt;We predicted residual fluid intelligence scores from T1-weighted MRI data
available as part of the ABCD NP Challenge 2019, using morphological similarity
of grey-matter regions across the cortex. Individual structural covariance
networks (SCN) were abstracted into graph-theory metrics averaged over nodes
across the brain and in data-driven communities/modules. Metrics included
degree, path length, clustering coefficient, centrality, rich club coefficient,
and small-worldness. These features derived from the training set were used to
build various regression models for predicting residual fluid intelligence
scores, with performance evaluated both using cross-validation within the
training set and using the held-out validation set. Our predictions on the test
set were generated with a support vector regression model trained on the
training set. We found minimal improvement over predicting a zero residual
fluid intelligence score across the sample population, implying that structural
covariance networks calculated from T1-weighted MR imaging data provide little
information about residual fluid intelligence.

 &lt;p&gt;We applied several regression and deep learning methods to predict fluid
intelligence scores from T1-weighted MRI scans as part of the ABCD
Neurocognitive Prediction Challenge (ABCD-NP-Challenge) 2019. We used voxel
intensities and probabilistic tissue-type labels derived from these as features
to train the models. The best predictive performance (lowest mean-squared
error) came from Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR; $\lambda=10$), which produced a
mean-squared error of 69.7204 on the validation set and 92.1298 on the test
set. This placed our group in the fifth position on the validation leader board
and first place on the final (test) leader board.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Finite mixture models for clustering can often be improved by adding a
regularization that is specific to the topology of the data. For instance,
mixtures are common in unsupervised image segmentation, and typically rely on
averaging the posterior mixing probabilities of spatially adjacent data points
(i.e. smoothing). However, this approach has had limited success with natural
images. Here we make three contributions. First, we show that a Dirichlet prior
with an appropriate choice of parameters allows -- using the
Expectation-Maximization approach -- to define any linear update rule for the
mixing probabilities, including many smoothing regularizations as special
cases. Second, we demonstrate how to use this flexible design of the update
rule to propagate segmentation information across layers of a deep network, and
to train mixtures jointly across layers. Third, we compare the standard
Gaussian mixture and the Student-t mixture, which is known to better capture
the statistics of low-level visual features. We show that our models achieve
competitive performance in natural image segmentation, with the Student-t
mixtures reaching state-of-the art on boundaries scores. We also demonstrate
how to exploit the resulting multilayer probabilistic generative model to
synthesize naturalistic images beyond uniform textures.

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromodulations as observed in the extracellular electrical potential
recordings obtained from Electroencephalograms (EEG) manifest as organized,
transient patterns that differ statistically from their featureless noisy
background. Leveraging on this statistical dissimilarity, we propose a
noniterative robust classification algorithm to isolate, in time, these
neuromodulations from the temporally disorganized but structured background
activity while simultaneously incorporating temporal sparsity of the events.
Specifically, we exploit the ability of correntropy to asses higher - order
moments as well as imply the degree of similarity between two random variables
in the joint space regulated by the kernel bandwidth. We test our algorithm on
DREAMS Sleep Spindle Database and further elaborate on the hyperparameters
introduced. Finally, we compare the performance of the algorithm with two
algorithms designed on similar ideas; one of which is a quick, simple norm
based technique while the other parallels the state-of-the-art Robust Principal
Component Analysis (RPCA) to achieve classification. The algorithm is able to
match the performance of the state-of-the-art techniques while saving
tremendously on computation time and complexity.

		<updated>2019-05-28T01:30:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Spreading processes are conventionally monitored on a macroscopic level by
counting the number of incidences over time. The spreading process can then be
modeled either on the microscopic level, assuming an underlying interaction
network, or directly on the macroscopic level, assuming that microscopic
contributions are negligible. The macroscopic characteristics of both
descriptions are commonly assumed to be identical. In this work, we show that
these characteristics of microscopic and macroscopic descriptions can be
different due to coalescence, i.e., a node being activated at the same time by
multiple sources. In particular, we consider a (microscopic) branching network
(probabilistic cellular automaton) with annealed connectivity disorder, record
the macroscopic activity, and then approximate this activity by a (macroscopic)
branching process. In this framework, we analytically calculate the effect of
coalescence on the collective dynamics. We show that coalescence leads to a
universal non-linear scaling function for the conditional expectation value of
successive network activity. This allows us to quantify the difference between
the microscopic model parameter and established macroscopic estimates. To
overcome this difference, we propose a non-linear estimator that correctly
infers the model branching parameter for all system sizes.

 The images projected onto the retina can vary widely for a single object. Despite these transformations primates can quickly and reliably recognize objects. At the neural level, transformation tolerance in monkey inferotemporal cortex is affected by the temporal contiguity statistics of the visual input. Here we investigated whether temporal contiguity learning also influences the basic feature detectors in lower levels of the visual hierarchy, in particular the independent coding of orientation and spatial frequency (SF) in primary visual cortex. Eight male Long Evans rats were repeatedly exposed to a temporal transition between two gratings that changed in SF and had either the same (control SF) or a different (swap SF) orientation. Electrophysiological evidence showed that the responses of single neurons during this exposure were sensitive to the change in orientation. Nevertheless, the tolerance of orientation selectivity for changes in SF was unaffected by the temporal contiguity manipulation, as observed in 239 single neurons isolated pre-exposure and 234 post-exposure. Temporal contiguity learning did not affect orientation selectivity in V1. The basic filter mechanisms that characterize V1 processing seem unaffected by temporal contiguity manipulations.</content>

 Signaling through bioactive lipids regulates nervous system development and functions. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a membrane-derived lipid mediator particularly enriched in brain, is able to induce many responses in neurons and glial cells by affecting key processes like synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, differentiation and proliferation. Early studies noted sustained elevations of neuronal intracellular calcium, a primary response to LPA exposure, suggesting functional modifications of NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors. However, the crosstalk between LPA signaling and glutamatergic transmission has only recently been shown. Stimulation of presynaptic LPA receptors in hippocampal neurons regulates glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal, while excess of LPA signaling results in overexcitation and hippocampal epilepsy. Further evidences indicating a role of LPA in the modulation of neuronal transmission has been inferred from animal models with deficits on LPA receptors, mainly LPA1 which is the most prevalent receptor in human and mouse brain tissue. LPA1 null-mice exhibit cognitive and attention deficits characteristic of schizophrenia which are related with altered glutamatergic transmission and reduced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, silencing of LPA1 receptor in mice induced a severe down-regulation of the main glutaminase isoform (GLS) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, along with a parallel sharp decrease on active matrix-metalloproteinase 9. The downregulation of both enzymes correlated with an altered morphology of glutamatergic pyramidal cells dendritic spines towards a less mature phenotype, indicating important implications of LPA in synaptic excitatory plasticity which may contribute to the cognitive and memory deficits shown by LPA1-deficient mice. In this review, we present an updated account of current evidences pointing to important implications of LPA in the modulation of synaptic excitatory transmission.</content>

 Fragile Syndrome X (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability. It is produced by mutation of the Fmr1 gene that encodes for the Fragile Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an important RNA-binding protein that regulates the expression of multiple proteins located in neuronal synapses. Individuals with FXS exhibit abnormal sensory information processing frequently leading to hypersensitivity across sensory modalities and consequently a wide array of behavioral symptoms.  Insects and mammals engage primarily their sense of smell to create proper representations of the external world and guide adequate decision-making processes. This feature in combination with the exquisitely organized neuronal circuits found throughout the olfactory system and the wide expression of FMRP in brain regions that process olfactory information makes it an ideal model to study sensory alterations in FXS models. In the last decade several groups have taken advantage of these features and have used the olfactory system of fruit fly and rodents to understand neuronal alteration giving rise to sensory perception issues. In this review we will discuss molecular, morphological and physiological aspects of the olfactory information processing in FXS models. We will highlight the decreased inhibitory/excitatory synaptic balance and the diminished synaptic plasticity found in this system resulting in behavioral alteration of individuals in the presence of odorant stimuli.</content>

 Early life experiences program lifelong responses to stress. In agreement, resilience and vulnerability to psychopathologies, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), have been suggested to depend on the early background. New therapies have targeted memory reconsolidation as a strategy to modify the emotional valence of traumatic memories. Here, we used animal models to study the molecular mechanism through which early experiences may later affect aversive memory reconsolidation. Handling (H) – separation of pups from dams for 10 minutes - or maternal separation (MS) – 3-hour separation - were performed from PDN1-10, using non-handled (NH) litters as controls. Adult males were trained in a contextual fear conditioning task; 24 hours later, a short reactivation session was conducted in the conditioned or in a novel context, followed by administration of midazolam 3 mg/kg i.p. (mdz), known to disturb reconsolidation, or vehicle; a test session was performed 24 hours after. The immunocontent of relevant proteins was studied 15 and 60 minutes after memory reactivation in the dorsal hippocampus (dHc) and basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Mdz-treated controls (NH) showed decreased freezing to the conditioned context, consistent with reconsolidation impairment, but H and MS were resistant to labilization. Additionally, MS males showed increased freezing to the novel context, suggesting fear generalization; H rats showed lower freezing than the other groups, in accordance with previous suggestions of reduced emotionality facing adversities. Increased levels of Zif268, GluN2B, β-actin and polyubiquitination found in the BLA of all groups suggest that memory reconsolidation was triggered. In the dHc, only NH showed increased Zif268 levels after memory retrieval; also, a delay in ERK1/2 activation was found in H and MS animals. We showed here that reconsolidation of a contextual fear memory is insensitive to interference by a GABAergic drug in adult male rats exposed to different neonatal experiences; surprisingly, we found no differences in the reconsolidation process in the BLA, but the dHc appears to suffer temporal desynchronization in the engagement of reconsolidation. Our results support a hippocampal-dependent mechanism for reconsolidation resistance in models of early experiences, which aligns with current hypotheses for the etiology of PTSD.</content>

 Brain cells normally respond adaptively to the oxidative stress or bioenergetic challenges, resulting from ongoing activity in neuronal circuits. During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, these mechanisms are compromised. In fact, neurons show unique age-related changes in function and metabolism, resulting in greater susceptibility to insults and diseases. Aging affects the cells in the nervous system much as do cells in other organ systems. More precisely, as the nervous system ages, neuron metabolism may change, inducing glucose hypometabolism, impaired transport of critical substrates underlying metabolism, alterations in calcium signalling, mitochondrial dysfunction and so on. Moreover, in neuronal aging an accumulation of dysfunctional and aggregated proteins and mitochondria is observed, as a result of an oxidative imbalance: reduced antioxidant defenses and/or increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These changes lead to greater vulnerability of neurons in various regions of the brain and increasing susceptibility to various diseases. In particular, in this review we will focus on neuronal cell rearrangement during aging, in response to changes in metabolism and oxidative stress.</content>

 Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability with limited therapeutic options. Resulting inflammatory mechanisms after reperfusion (removal of the thrombus) result in cytokine activation, calcium influx, and leukocytic infiltration to the area of ischemia. In particular, leukocytes migrate toward areas of inflammation by use of integrins, particularly integrins B1 and B2. Integrins have been shown to be necessary for leukocyte adhesion and migration, and thus are of immediate interest in many inflammatory diseases, including ischemic stroke. In this review, we identify the main integrins involved in leukocytic migration following stroke (aLb2, aDb2, a4b1, and a5b1) and targeted clinical therapeutic interventions.</content>

 Herpes zoster (HZ) can cause a blistering skin rash with severe neuropathic pain. Pharmacotherapy is the most common treatment for HZ patients. However, most of these patients are the elderly and immunocompromised, thus often suffering from side effects and easily getting intractable post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) if medication fails. It is challenging for clinicians to tailor treatment for patients, due to the lack of prognosis information regarding neurological pathogenesis underlying HZ. In the current study, we aimed at characterizing the brain structural pattern of HZ before medication treatment that could help predict medication responses. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 14 right-handed HZ patients (aged 61.0±7.0, 8 males) with poor response and 15 (aged 62.6±8.3, 5 males) age- (p = 0.58), gender-matched (p = 0.20) patients responding well were acquired and analyzed. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) with searchlight algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) was applied to identify the spatial pattern of gray matter (GM) volume with high predicting accuracy. The predictive regions with accuracy higher than 79% located within the cerebellum, posterior insular cortex (pIC), middle and orbital frontal lobes (mFC, OFC), anterior and middle cingulum (ACC, MCC), precuneus (PCu) and cuneus. Among these regions, mFC, pIC and MCC displayed significant increases of GM volumes in patients with poor response than those with good response. Combination of sMRI and MVPA might be a useful tool to explore the neuroanatomical imaging biomarkers of HZ-related pain associating with medication responses.</content>

 Improving the long-term performance of neural electrode interfaces requires overcoming severe biological reactions such as neuronal cell death, glial cell activation, and vascular damage in the presence of implanted intracortical devices. Past studies traditionally observe neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and blood-brain barrier disruption around inserted microelectrode arrays. However, analysis of these factors alone yields poor correlation between tissue inflammation and device performance. Additionally, these studies often overlook significant biological responses that can occur during acute implantation injury. The current study employs additional histological markers that provide novel information about neglected tissue components—oligodendrocytes and their myelin structures, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and blood-brain barrier-associated pericytes—during the foreign body response to inserted devices at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days post-insertion. Our results reveal unique temporal and spatial patterns of neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss, axonal and myelin reorganization, glial cell reactivity, and pericyte deficiency both acutely and chronically around implanted devices. Furthermore, probing for immunohistochemical markers that highlight mechanisms of cell death or patterns of proliferation and differentiation have provided new insight into inflammatory tissue dynamics around implanted intracortical electrode arrays.</content>

 Although research on the mismatch negativity (MMN) has been ongoing for 40 years, the generation process of the MMN remains largely unknown. In this study, we used a single-trial EEG-fMRI coupling method which can analyse neural activity with both high temporal and high spatial resolution and thus assess the generation process of the MMN. We elicited the MMN with an auditory oddball paradigm while recording simultaneous EEG and fMRI. We divided the MMN into five equal-durational phases. Utilizing the single-trial variability of the MMN, we analysed the neural generators of the five phases, thereby determining the spatiotemporal generation process of the MMN. We found two distinct bottom-up prediction error propagations: first from the auditory cortex to the motor areas and then from the auditory cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Our results support the regularity-violation hypothesis of MMN generation.</content>

 Abstract

Objective: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an essential measure to investigate the human brain's spontaneous activity and intrinsic functional connectivity. Several studies including own previous work have shown that the brain controls the regulation of energy expenditure and food intake behavior. Accordingly, we expected different metabolic states to influence connectivity and activity patterns in neuronal networks

Methods: The influence of hunger and satiety on rs-fMRI was investigated using three connectivity models (local connectivity, global connectivity and amplitude rs-fMRI signals). After extracting the connectivity parameters of 90 brain regions for each model, we used sequential forward floating selection strategy in conjunction with a linear support vector machine classifier and permutation tests to reveal which connectivity model differentiates best between metabolic states (hunger vs. satiety).

Results: We found that the amplitude of rs-fMRI signals is slightly more precise than local and global connectivity models in order to detect resting brain changes during hunger and satiety with a classification accuracy of 81%.

Conclusion: The amplitude of rs-fMRI signals serves as a suitable basis for machine learning based classification of brain activity. This opens up the possibility to apply this combination of algorithms to similar research questions, such as the characterization of brain states (e.g., sleep stages) or disease conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, minimal cognitive impairment).</content>

 The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a common target for Deep Brain Stimulation treatment in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) but much less frequently targeted for other disorders. Here we report the results of simultaneous local field potential recordings and magnetoencephalography in a single patient who was implanted bilaterally in the STN for the treatment of dystonia induced by chorea-acanthocytosis. Consistent with the previous results in PD, the dystonia patient showed significant subthalamo-cortical coherence in the high beta band (28-35Hz) on both sides localised to the mesial sensorimotor areas. In addition, on the right side significant coherence was found in the theta-alpha band (4-12Hz) that localised to the medial prefrontal cortex with the peak in the anterior cingulate gyrus. Comparison of STN power spectra with a previously reported PD cohort showed increased power in the theta and alpha bands and decreased power in the low beta band in dystonia which is consistent with most of the previous studies. The present report extends the range of disorders for which cortico-subthalamic oscillatory connectivity has been characterised. Our results strengthen the evidence that at least some of the subthalamo-cortical oscillatory coherent networks are a feature of the healthy brain, although we do not rule out that coherence magnitude could be affected by disease.</content>

 Today, face biometric systems are becoming widely accepted as a standard method for identity authentication in many security settings. For example, their deployment in automated border control gates plays a crucial role in accurate document authentication and reduced traveller flow rates in congested border zones. The proliferation of such systems is further spurred by the advent of portable devices. On the one hand, modern smartphone and tablet cameras have in-built user authentication applications while on the other hand, their displays are being consistently exploited for face spoofing. Similar to biometric systems of other physiological biometric identifiers, face biometric systems have their own unique set of potential vulnerabilities. In this work, these vulnerabilities (presentation attacks) are being explored via a biologically-inspired presentation attack detection model which is termed ‘BIOPAD’. Our model employs Gabor features in a feedforward hierarchical structure of layers that progressively process and train from visual information of people’s faces, along with their presentation attacks, in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. BIOPAD’s performance is directly compared with other popular biologically-inspired layered models such as the ‘Hierarchical Model And X’ (HMAX) that applies similar handcrafted features, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that discover low-level features through stochastic descent training. BIOPAD shows superior performance to both HMAX and CNN in all of the three presentation attack databases examined and these results were consistent in two different classifiers (Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbour). In certain cases, our findings have shown that BIOPAD can produce authentication rates with 99% accuracy. Finally, we further introduce a new presentation attack database with visible and near-infrared information for direct comparisons. Overall, BIOPAD’s operation, which is to fuse information from different spectral bands at both feature and score levels for the purpose of face presentation attack detection, has never been attempted before with a biologically-inspired algorithm. Obtained detection rates are promising and confirm that near-infrared visual information significantly assists in overcoming presentation attacks.</content>

 Many brain regions communicate information through synchronized network activity. Electrical coupling among the dendrites of interneurons in the cortex has been implicated in forming and sustaining such activity in the cortex. Evidence for the existence of electrical coupling among cortical pyramidal cells, however, has been largely absent. A recent experimental study measured properties of electrical connections between  pyramidal cells in the cortex, deemed &quot;electrotonic couplings.&quot; These junctions were seen to occur pair-wise, sparsely, and often coexist with electrically-coupled interneurons. Here, we construct a network model to investigate possible roles for these rare, electrotonically-coupled pyramidal-cell pairs. Through simulations, we show that electrical coupling among pyramidal-cell pairs significantly enhances coincidence-detection capabilities and increases network spike-timing precision. Further, a network containing multiple pairs possesses a rich coding structure, exhibiting large variability in its firing pattern.</content>

 The mouse primary visual cortex (V1) has become an important brain area for exploring how neural circuits process information. Optogenetic tools have helped to outline the connectivity of a local V1 circuit comprising excitatory pyramidal neurons and several genetically-defined inhibitory interneuron subtypes that express parvalbumin, somatostatin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide. Optogenetic modulation of individual interneuron subtypes can alter the visual responsiveness of pyramidal neurons with distinct forms of inhibition and disinhibition. However, different interneuron subtypes have potentially opposing actions, and the potency of their effects relative to each other remains unclear. Therefore, in this study we simultaneously optogenetically activated all interneuron subtypes during visual processing to explore whether any single inhibitory effect would predominate. This aggregate interneuron activation consistently inhibited pyramidal neurons in a divisive manner, which was essentially identical to the pattern of inhibition produced by activating parvalbumin-expressing interneurons alone.</content>

 Spectrin cytoskeletons are found in all metazoan cells, and their physical interactions between actin and ankyrins establish a meshwork that provides cellular structural integrity. With advanced super-resolution microscopy, the intricate spatial organization and associated functional properties of these cytoskeletons can now be analyzed with unprecedented clarity. Long neuronal processes like peripheral sensory and motor axons may be subject to intense mechanical forces including bending, stretching, and torsion.  The spectrin-based cytoskeleton is essential to protect axons against these mechanical stresses. Additionally, spectrins are critical for the assembly and maintenance of axonal excitable domains including the axon initial segment and the nodes of Ranvier.  These sites facilitate rapid and efficient action potential initiation and propagation in the nervous system. Recent studies revealed that pathogenic spectrin variants and diseases that protealyze and breakdown spectrins are associated with congenital neurological disorders and nervous system injury. Here, we review recent studies of spectrins in the nervous system and focus on their functions in axonal health and disease.</content>

 It has been shown that nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) is constitutively activated in glioblastoma (GBM), suggesting the pathway could be a therapeutic target. Glycyrrhetic acid (GA), a compound isolated from licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), has been shown to decrease cell viability and increases apoptosis in human cancer cell lines by NF-κB signaling pathway suppression. Dipotassium glycyrrhizinate (DPG), a dipotassium salt of GA, has anti-inflammatory properties without toxicity. The current study examined the effectiveness of DPG as an anti-tumor in U87MG and T98G GBM cell lines. Additionally, we assessed DPG as a candidate for combinational therapy in GBM with temozolomide (TMZ). Our results demonstrated that the viability of U87MG and T98G cells significantly decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner after DPG treatment, and the apoptotic ratio of DPG-treated groups was significantly higher than control groups. In addition, DPG in combination with TMZ, revealed synergistic effects. Furthermore, the expression of NF-κB-luciferase-reporter in transfected GBM cell lines was remarkably reduced after DPG exposure by up-regulating miR16 and miR146a, which down-regulate its target genes, IRAK2 and TRAF6. A reduced neuro-sphere formation was also observed after DPG in both GBM cells. In conclusion, DPG presented anti-tumoral effect on GBM cell lines through decrease on proliferation and increase on apoptosis. In addition, our data also suggest that DPG anti-tumoral effect is related to NF-κB suppression, where IRAK2- and TRAF6-mediating miR16 and miR146a, respectively, might be a potential therapeutic target of DPG.</content>

 Autophagy is a vital lysosomal degradation and recycling pathway in the eukaryotic cell, responsible for maintaining an intricate balance between cell survival and cell death, necessary for neuronal survival and function. This dual role played by autophagy raises the question whether this process is a protective or a destructive pathway, the contributor of neuronal cell death or a failed attempt to repair aberrant processes? De-regulated autophagy at different steps of the pathway, whether excessive or downregulated, has been proposed to be associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's-, Huntington's- and Parkinson's-disease, known for their intracellular accumulation of protein aggregates. Recent observations of impaired autophagy also appeared in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggesting an additional contribution to the pathophysiology of mental illness. Here we review the current understanding of autophagy's role in various neuropsychiatric disorders and, hitherto, the prevailing new potential autophagy-related therapeutic strategies for their treatment.</content>

 Serotonin is an important biogenic amine that acts as a neural circuit modulator.  It is widespread in the central nervous system of insects. However, little is known about the distribution of serotonin in the nervous system of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. In the present study, we performed immunohistochemical experiments with anti-serotonin serum to examine the distribution of serotonin in the central nervous system of H. armigera larvae. We found about 40 serotonin-immunoreactive neurons in the brain and about 20 in the gnathal ganglion. Most of these neurons are wide-field neurons giving rise to processes throughout the neuropils of the brain and the gnathal ganglion. In the central brain, serotonin-immunoreactive processes are present bilaterally in the tritocerebrum, the deutocerebrum, and major regions of the protocerebrum, including the central body, lateral accessory lobes, clamps, crepine, superior protocerebrum, and lateral protocerebrum. The central body, anterior ventrolateral protocerebrum, and posterior optic tubercle contain extensive serotonin-immunoreactive process terminals. However, the regions of mushroom bodies, the lateral horn, and protocerebral bridges are devoid of serotonin-immunoreactivity. In the gnathal ganglion, the serotonin-immunoreactive processes are also widespread throughout the neuropil, and some process projections extend to the tritocerebrum. Our results provide the first comprehensive description of the serotonergic neuronal network in H. armigera larvae, and they reveal the neural architecture and the distribution of neural substance, allowing us to explor the neural mechanisms of behaviors by using electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches on the target regions.</content>

 In this article, we explore a specific controversy about animal experimentation and animal models in the recent history of deep brain stimulation (DBS), and we question its ramifications. DBS development intertwines clinical practice with fundamental research, and stands at the crossroads of multiple legacies. We take up the various issues and controversies embedded in this rarely addressed dispute, from a standpoint that combines socio-anthropological and legal aspects. Our starting point is a debate on the role of animal experimentation in the development of DBS between Jarrod Bailey, a researcher promoting the abolition of animal experimentation, and Alim Louis Benabid, Marwan Hariz, and Mahlon DeLong, three key figures in the area of DBS and neuroscience. By clarifying the positions of the different protagonists and retracing the issues raised in these discussions, our objective is to show how this specific debate has extended from its initial space and how it provides an object of study with heuristic scope. We first present this partially polemic discussion about the history of DBS, and its link with a more general debate on the validity and use of animal models and the need for animal experiments. Then, we raise the issue of the relations and interactions between experiments on animals and on humans in the logics of biomedical innovation. The third step is to situate the discussion within the wider framework of opposition towards animal experimentation and the promotion of animal’ rights. Finally, combining these interweaved issues, possible implications emerge regarding the future of DBS. We show that behind these several controversies lie the question of translational research and the model of medicine upheld by DBS. We describe how the technology contributes to blurring the lines between research (fundamental, preclinical and clinical research) and care, as well as between humans and animals as substrates and objects of knowledge. The dynamics of DBS future development might then become a point of convergence for neuroscientists and animal rights defenders’ interests.</content>

 There is increasing evidence indicating that inflammation represents a key pathological component of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A possible factor that may contribute to this process is netrin-1, a neuronal guidance molecule. This molecule has been shown to exert an unexpected immunomodulatory function. However, the potential changes and correlations of netrin-1 with T helper 17/regulatory T cells (Th17/Tregs) as related to inflammation in AD has yet to be examined. In this study, netrin-1 and Th17/Tregs balance were investigated, and the relationship among netrin-1, Th17/Tregs and cognitive function were analyzed in a rat model of AD. In this model, a bilateral intracerebroventricular administration of Amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42) was used to produce spatial learning and memory deficits, as well as increased neuronal apoptosis, which were detected 7 days after injection for AD7d group and 14 days for AD14d group. Netrin-1 concentrations were significantly down regulated in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these AD rats, effects which were strongly correlated with cognitive deficits.  Increased levels of interleukin (IL)-17 and deceased IL-10 were observed in both the circulation and CSF and were also correlated with the percent of time spent in the target quadrant of AD in these rats. These changes resulted in netrin-1 concentrations being negatively correlated with IL-17 but positively correlated with IL-10 concentrations in the serum and CSF. We also found that the Th17/Tregs balance was disrupted in these AD rats. Collectively, these findings reveal that the reduction in netrin-1 and correlated disruption of Th17/Tregs balance in AD rats, may diminish the immunosuppressive effect of netrin-1 on Th17/Tregs in AD pathogenesis.</content>

 Introduction: Human tau seeding and spreading occur following intracerebral inoculation into different grey matter regions of brain homogenates obtained from tauopathies in transgenic mice expressing wild or mutant tau, and in wild-type (WT) mice. However, little is known about tau propagation following inoculation in the white matter.   
Objectives: The present study is geared to learning about the patterns of tau seeding and cells involved following unilateral inoculation in the corpus callosum of homogenates from sporadic Alzheimer’s disease and primary tauopathies. 
Methods: Adult WT mice were inoculated unilaterally in the lateral corpus callosum with sarkosyl-insoluble fractions or with sarkosyl-soluble fractions from the mentioned tauopathies; mice were killed from 4 to 7 months after inoculation. Brains were fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and processed for immunohistochemistry. 
Results: Tau seeding occurred in the ipsilateral corpus callosum and was also detected in the contralateral corpus callosum. Phospho-tau deposits were found in oligodendrocytes similar to coiled bodies and in threads. Moreover, tau deposits co-localized with active (phosphorylated) tau kinases p38 and ERK 1/2, suggesting active tau phosphorylation of murine tau. TSAs, GAIs, GOIs, tufted astrocytes, and tau-containing fibrillar astrocytes were not seen in any case. Tau deposits were often associated with slight myelin disruption and the presence of small PLP1-immunoreactive globules and dots in the ipsilateral corpus callosum six months after inoculation of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from every tauopathy.   
Conclusions: Seeding and spreading of human tau in the corpus callosum of WT mice occurs in oligodendrocytes, thereby supporting the idea of a role of oligodendrogliopathy in tau seeding and spreading in the white matter in tauopathies. Slight differences in the predominance of threads or oligodendroglial deposits suggest disease differences in the capacity of tau seeding and spreading among tauopathies.</content>

 RNA degradation pathways enable RNA processing, the regulation of RNA levels, and the surveillance of aberrant or poorly functional RNAs in cells. Here we provide transcriptome-wide RNA-binding profiles of 30 general RNA degradation factors in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. The profiles reveal the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes. They are consistent with the canonical degradation pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling based on mRNA half-lives suggests that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, consistent with rapid degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. Global analysis suggests that the nuclear surveillance machinery, including the complexes Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes snoRNAs.</content>

 Intrinsically disordered transcription factor transactivation domains (TADs) function through structural plasticity, adopting ordered conformations when bound to transcriptional co-regulators. Many transcription factors contain a negative regulatory domain (NRD) that suppresses recruitment of transcriptional machinery through autoregulation of the TAD. We report the solution structure of an autoinhibited NRD-TAD complex within FoxM1, a critical activator of mitotic gene expression. We observe that while both the FoxM1 NRD and TAD are primarily intrinsically disordered domains, they associate and adopt a structured conformation. We identify how Plk1 and Cdk kinases cooperate to phosphorylate FoxM1, which releases the TAD into a disordered conformation that then associates with the TAZ2 or KIX domains of the transcriptional co-activator CBP. Our results support a mechanism of FoxM1 regulation in which the TAD undergoes switching between disordered and different ordered structures.</content>

 To persist in microbial communities, the bacterial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila &lt;/i&gt;must withstand competition from neighboring bacteria. Here, we find that &lt;i&gt;L. pneumophila&lt;/i&gt; can antagonize the growth of other &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; species using a secreted inhibitor: HGA (homogentisic acid). Unexpectedly, &lt;i&gt;L. pneumophila &lt;/i&gt;can itself be inhibited by HGA secreted from neighboring, isogenic strains. Our genetic approaches further identify &lt;i&gt;lpg1681 &lt;/i&gt;as a gene that modulates &lt;i&gt;L. pneumophila &lt;/i&gt;susceptibility to HGA. We find that &lt;i&gt;L. pneumophila&lt;/i&gt; sensitivity to HGA is density-dependent and cell intrinsic. This resistance is not mediated by the stringent response nor the previously described &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; quorum-sensing pathway. Instead, &lt;i&gt;L. pneumophila &lt;/i&gt;cells secrete HGA only when they are conditionally HGA-resistant, which allows these bacteria to produce a potentially self-toxic molecule while restricting the opportunity for self-harm. We propose that established &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; communities may deploy molecules such as HGA as an unusual public good that can protect against invasion by low-density competitors.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a heterogeneous disease comprised of a basal-like subtype with mesenchymal gene signatures, undifferentiated histopathology and worse prognosis compared to the classical subtype. Despite their prognostic and therapeutic value, the key drivers that establish and control subtype identity remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PDA subtypes are not permanently encoded, and identify the GLI2 transcription factor as a master regulator of subtype inter-conversion. GLI2 is elevated in basal-like PDA lines and patient specimens, and forced GLI2 activation is sufficient to convert classical PDA cells to basal-like. Mechanistically, GLI2 upregulates expression of the pro-tumorigenic secreted protein, Osteopontin (OPN), which is especially critical for metastatic growth in vivo and adaptation to oncogenic KRAS ablation. Accordingly, elevated GLI2 and OPN levels predict shortened overall survival of PDA patients. Thus, the GLI2-OPN circuit is a driver of PDA cell plasticity that establishes and maintains an aggressive variant of this disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Coordination of the cellular response to DNA damage is organised by multi-domain 'scaffold' proteins, including 53BP1 and TOPBP1, which recognise post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitylation on other proteins, and are themselves carriers of such regulatory signals. Here we show that the DNA damage checkpoint regulating S-phase entry is controlled by a phosphorylation-dependent interaction of 53BP1 and TOPBP1. BRCT domains of TOPBP1 selectively bind conserved phosphorylation sites in the N-terminus of 53BP1. Mutation of these sites does not affect formation of 53BP1 or ATM foci following DNA damage, but abolishes recruitment of TOPBP1, ATR and CHK1 to 53BP1 damage foci, abrogating cell cycle arrest and permitting progression into S-phase. TOPBP1 interaction with 53BP1 is structurally complimentary to its interaction with RAD9-RAD1-HUS1, allowing these damage recognition factors to bind simultaneously to the same TOPBP1 molecule and cooperate in ATR activation in the G1 DNA damage checkpoint.</content>

 Transposable elements (TEs), the movement of which can damage the genome, are epigenetically silenced in eukaryotes. Intriguingly, TEs are activated in the sperm companion cell – vegetative cell (VC) – of the flowering plant &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. However, the extent and mechanism of this activation are unknown. Here we show that about 100 heterochromatic TEs are activated in VCs, mostly by DEMETER-catalyzed DNA demethylation. We further demonstrate that DEMETER access to some of these TEs is permitted by the natural depletion of linker histone H1 in VCs. Ectopically expressed H1 suppresses TEs in VCs by reducing DNA demethylation and via a methylation-independent mechanism. We demonstrate that H1 is required for heterochromatin condensation in plant cells and show that H1 overexpression creates heterochromatic foci in the VC progenitor cell. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the natural depletion of H1 during male gametogenesis facilitates DEMETER-directed DNA demethylation, heterochromatin relaxation, and TE activation.</content>

 Cancer evolves through a multistep process that occurs by the temporal accumulation of genetic mutations. Tumor-derived exosomes are emerging contributors to tumorigenesis. To understand how exosomes might contribute to cell transformation, we utilized the classic two-step NIH/3T3 cell transformation assay and observed that exosomes isolated from pancreatic cancer cells, but not normal human cells, can initiate malignant cell transformation and these transformed cells formed tumors in vivo. However, cancer cell exosomes are unable to transform cells alone or to act as a promoter of cell transformation. Utilizing proteomics and exome sequencing, we discovered cancer cell exosomes act as an initiator by inducing random mutations in recipient cells. Cells from the pool of randomly mutated cells are driven to transformation by a classic promoter resulting in foci, each of which encode a unique genetic profile. Our studies describe a novel molecular understanding of how cancer cell exosomes contribute to cell transformation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The proportion and distribution of local inhibitory neurons (interneurons) in the thalamus varies widely across mammals. This is reflected in the structure of thalamic local circuits, which is more complex in primates compared to smaller-brained mammals like rodents. An increase in the number of thalamic interneurons could arise from addition of novel interneuron types or from elaboration of a plesiomorphic ontogenetic program, common to all mammals. The former has been proposed for the human brain, with migration of interneurons from the ventral telencephalon into higher order thalamus as one of its unique features (Letinic and Rakic, 2001). Here, we identify a larger than expected complexity and distribution of interneurons across the mouse thalamus. All thalamic interneurons can be traced back to two developmental programs: one specified in the midbrain and the other in the forebrain. Interneurons migrate to functionally distinct thalamic nuclei, where the midbrain-derived cells populate the sensory thalamus, and forebrain-generated interneurons only the higher order regions. The latter interneuron type may be homologous to the one previously considered to be human-specific, while we also observe that markers for the midbrain-born class are abundantly expressed in the primate thalamus. These data therefore point to a shared ontogenetic organization of thalamic interneurons across mammals.</content>

 A common human experience is noticing that emotional life events are more vividly remembered than dull ones. Studies show that the amygdala plays a central role in such emotionally driven enhancement of memory. With this in mind, we investigated the effect of electrical brain stimulation of the left human amygdala on performance on an emotional perception and emotional memory task. We randomly applied sub-threshold 50 Hz stimulation to the left amygdala in 10 patients (5 female and 5 male) with intracranial electrodes during the encoding portion of an emotional valence perception and emotional memory task. We found that amygdala stimulation did not affect reported valence for neutral stimuli (non-stimulated group average valence 5.34, stimulated 5.38, p=0.68) but it did affect positively (non-stimulated group average valence 7.31, stimulated 6.70, p=0.004) and negatively (non-stimulated group average valence 2.79, stimulated 3.55, p=0.0002) valenced stimuli in effect reporting both valence categories as more neutral. Furthermore, we found that stimulation did not significantly disrupt memory for neutral stimuli (68% vs. 61% correctly remembered p=0.48) or positive stimuli (87% vs. 70% correct, trend towards significant difference p=0.09) but did for negative stimuli (83% vs. 67% correct, p=0.03). These results suggest that electrical brain stimulation by our parameters likely reversibly inhibits amygdala function disrupting neural networks responsible for emotional perception and memory. This effect may have clinical implications in treatment of certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as emotional dysregulation and post-traumatic stress disorder.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether systemic cytokine release is associated with central nervous system inflammatory responses and glial injury in immune effector cell‐associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)‐T cell therapy in children and young adults.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prospective cohort study of clinical manifestations as well as imaging, pathology, CSF, and blood biomarkers on 43 subjects ages 1 to 25 who received CD19‐directed CAR/T cells for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurotoxicity occurred in 19 of 43 (44%) subjects. Nine subjects (21%) had CTCAE grade 3 or 4 neurological symptoms, with no neurotoxicity‐related deaths. Reversible delirium, headache, decreased level of consciousness, tremor, and seizures were most commonly observed. Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) scores ≥9 had 94% sensitivity and 33% specificity for grade ≥3 neurotoxicity, and 91% sensitivity and 72% specificity for grade ≥2 neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity correlated with severity of cytokine release syndrome, abnormal past brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and higher peak CAR‐T cell numbers in blood, but not cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF levels of S100 calcium‐binding protein B and glial fibrillary acidic protein increased during neurotoxicity, indicating astrocyte injury. There were concomitant increases in CSF white blood cells, protein, interferon‐γ (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)‐6, IL‐10, and granzyme B (GzB), with concurrent elevation of serum IFNγ IL‐10, GzB, granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, but not IL‐6. We did not find direct evidence of endothelial activation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data are most consistent with ICANS as a syndrome of systemic inflammation, which affects the brain through compromise of the neurovascular unit and astrocyte injury. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease 4B1 and 4B2 (CMT4B1/B2) are characterized by recessive inheritance, early onset, severe course, slowed nerve conduction, and myelin outfoldings. CMT4B3 shows a more heterogeneous phenotype. All are associated with myotubularin‐related protein (MTMR) mutations. We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study to better characterize CMT4B.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collected clinical and genetic data from CMT4B subjects in 18 centers using a predefined minimal data set including Medical Research Council (MRC) scores of nine muscle pairs and CMT Neuropathy Score.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 50 patients, 21 of whom never reported before, carrying 44 mutations, of which 21 were novel and six representing novel disease associations of known rare variants. CMT4B1 patients had significantly more‐severe disease than CMT4B2, with earlier onset, more‐frequent motor milestones delay, wheelchair use, and respiratory involvement as well as worse MRC scores and motor CMT Examination Score components despite younger age at examination. Vocal cord involvement was common in both subtypes, whereas glaucoma occurred in CMT4B2 only. Nerve conduction velocities were similarly slowed in both subtypes. Regression analyses showed that disease severity is significantly associated with age in CMT4B1. Slopes are steeper for CMT4B1, indicating faster disease progression. Almost none of the mutations in the &lt;i&gt;MTMR2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MTMR13&lt;/i&gt; genes, responsible for CMT4B1 and B2, respectively, influence the correlation between disease severity and age, in agreement with the hypothesis of a complete loss of function of MTMR2/13 proteins for such mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest CMT4B series ever reported, demonstrating that CMT4B1 is significantly more severe than CMT4B2, and allowing an estimate of prognosis. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00023"/>

 In this work, we aim to investigate whether information based metrics of neural activity are a useful tool for the quantification of consciousness before and shortly after birth. Neural activity is measured using fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG) in human fetuses and neonates. Based on recent theories on consciousness, information-based metrics are established to measure brain complexity and to assess different levels of consciousness. Different metrics (measures of entropy, compressibility and fractality) are, thus, explored in a reference population and their usability is evaluated. For comparative analysis, two fMEG channels were selected: one where brain activity was previously detected and one at least 15cm away, that represented a control channel. The usability of each metric was evaluated and results from the brain and control channel were compared. Concerning the ease of use with fMEG data, Lempel-Ziv-Complexity (LZC) was evaluated as best, as it is unequivocal and needs low computational effort. The fractality measures have a high number of parameters that need to be adjusted prior to analysis  and therefore forfeit comparability, while entropy measures require a higher computational effort and more parameters to adjust compared to LZC. Comparison of a channel with brain activity and a control channel in neonatal recordings showed significant differences in most complexity metrics. This clear difference can be seen as proof of concept for the usability of complexity metrics in fMEG. For fetal data, this comparison produced less clear results which can be related to leftover maternal signals included in the control channel. Further work is necessary to conclusively interpret results from the analysis of fetal recordings. Yet this study shows that complexity metrics can be used for fMEG data on early consciousness and the evaluation gives a guidance for future work. The inconsistency of results from different metrics highlights the challenges of working with complexity metrics as neural correlates of consciousness, as well as the caution one should apply to interpret them.</content>

 Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor often diagnosed in childhood. Despite intense efforts to develop a successful treatment, current available therapies are still challenged by high rates of resistance, recurrence and progression, most notably in advanced cases and highly malignant tumors. Emerging evidence proposes that this might be due to a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) found in the bulk of the tumor. Therefore, the development of more targeted therapy is highly dependent on the identification of the molecular signatures and genetic aberrations characteristic to this subpopulation of cells. This review aims at providing an overview of the key molecular players involved in NB CSCs and focuses on the experimental evidence from NB cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and primary tumors. It also provides some novel approaches of targeting multiple drivers governing the stemness of CSCs to achieve better anti-tumor effects than the currently used therapeutic agents.</content>

 The translational gap of treatments based on gene therapy has been shortened in recent years, due to the improvement of gene editing tools such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system and its variations. This has allowed the development of more precise therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, where access is privileged, therefore the engineer of complexes that can access the Central Nervous System (CNS), with the least possible inconvenience are fundamental. In this review we describe current alternatives to generate systems based on CRISPR/Cas9, which can cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and be possibly use further in the clinical area for improve neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer disease.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00205"/>

		<content type="html">
 Synaptic plasticity of the neuronal circuits associated with feeding behavior is regulated by peripheral signals as a response to changes in the energy status of the body. These signals include glucose, free fatty acids, leptin and ghrelin and are released into circulation, being able to reach the brain. To date, ghrelin, a small peptide released from the stomach, is the only known orexigenic hormone produced in peripheral organs, and its action regulates food intake, body weight and glucose homeostasis. Behavioral studies show that ghrelin is implicated in the regulation of both hedonic and homeostatic feeding and of cognition. Ghrelin-induced synaptic plasticity has been described in neuronal circuits associated with these behaviors.

In this review, we discuss the neuromodulatory mechanisms induced by ghrelin in regulating synaptic plasticity in three main neuronal circuits previously associated with feeding behaviors, namely hypothalamic (homeostatic feeding), ventral tegmental (hedonic and motivational feeding) and hippocampal (cognitive) circuits. Given the central role of ghrelin in regulating feeding behaviors, and the disrupted ghrelin levels associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and anorexia, it is of paramount relevance to understand the effects of ghrelin on synaptic plasticity of neuronal circuits associated with feeding behaviors.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00106"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00106</id>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Iron is important in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) specifically related to degeneration of the substantia nigra (SN). Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to measure brain iron in the entire structure but this approach is insensitive to regional changes in iron content.   
Objectives: The goal of this work was to use quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* to quantify both global and regional brain iron in PD patients and healthy controls (HC) to ascertain if regional changes correlate with clinical conditions and can be used to discriminate patients from controls.
Methods: Susceptibility and R2* maps of 25 PD and 24 HC subjects were reconstructed from data collected on a 3T GE scanner. For the susceptibility maps, three-dimensional regions-of-interest (ROIs) were traced on 8 deep gray matter structures and an age-based threshold was applied to define regions of high iron content. The same multi-slice ROIs were duplicated on the R2* maps as well. Mean susceptibility values of both global and regional high iron content along with global R2* values were measured and compared not only between the two cohorts, but also to susceptibility and R2* baselines as a function of age. Finally, clinical features were compared for those PD patients lying above and below the upper 95% regional susceptibility-age prediction intervals. 
Results: The SN was the only structure showing significantly higher susceptibility in PD patients compared to controls globally (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and regionally (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The R2* values were also higher only in the SN of PD patients compared to the healthy cohort (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, those patients with abnormal susceptibility values lying above the upper 95% prediction intervals had significantly higher united Parkinson’s diagnostic rating scores. R2* values had larger errors and showed larger dispersion as a function of age than QSM data for global analysis while the dispersion was significantly less for QSM using the regional high iron content. 
Conclusions: Abnormal iron deposition in the SN, especially in regional high iron areas, could serve as a biomarker to distinguish PD patients from HC and to assess disease severity.</content>

		<content type="html">
 BackgroundNerve excitability tests in sciatic motor axons are sensitive to anaesthetic choice. Results using ketamine/xylazine (KX) are different from those using sodium pentobarbital (SP). It is not clear which results are most similar to the awake condition, though results using SP appear more similar to human results.nnMethodsNerve excitability in tail motor axons was tested in 8 adult female rats with a chronic sacral spinal cord injury. These animals have no behavioural response to electrical stimulation of the tail and were tested awake and then anaesthetized using SP.nnResultsThe nerve excitability test results in the awake condition were indistinguishable from the results when the same rats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Summary plots of the test results overlap within the boundaries of the standard error and paired t-tests on the 42 discrete measures generated by nerve excitability testing yielded no significant differences (after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons).nnConclusionsNerve excitability test results in rat motor axons are the same whether the animals are awake or anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital.</content>

 Striatal projection neurons, the medium spiny neurons (MSNs), play a crucial role in various motor and cognitive functions. MSNs express either D1 or D2 type dopamine receptors and initiate the direct-pathway (dMSNs) or indirect pathways (iMSNs) of the basal ganglia, respectively. dMSNs have been shown to receive more inhibition than iMSNs from intrastriatal sources. Based on these findings, computational modelling of the striatal network has predicted that under healthy conditions dMSNs should receive more excitatory input than iMSNs. To test this prediction, we analyzed in vivo whole-cell recordings from dMSNs and iMSNs in healthy and dopamine-depleted (6OHDA) anaesthetized mice. By comparing their membrane potential fluctuations, we found that dMSNs exhibited considerably larger membrane potential fluctuations over a wide frequency range. Furthermore, by comparing the spike-triggered average membrane potentials, we found that dMSNs depolarized towards the spike threshold significantly faster than iMSNs did. Together, these finding corroborate the theoretical prediction that direct-pathway MSNs receive stronger input than indirect-pathway neurons. Finally, we found that dopamine-depleted mice exhibited no difference between the membrane potential fluctuations of dMSNs and iMSNs. These data provide new insights into the question how a lack of dopamine may lead to behavior deficits associated with Parkinsons disease.nnSignificance statementThe direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia originate from the D1 and D2 type dopamine receptor expressing medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs), respectively. To understand the role of the striatum in brain function and dysfunction it is important to characterize the differences in synaptic inputs to the two MSN types. Theoretical results predicted that dMSNs should receive stronger excitatory input than iMSNs. Here, we studied membrane potential fluctuation statistics of MSNs recorded in vivo in anaesthetized mice and found that dMSNs, indeed, received stronger synaptic input than iMSNs. We corroborated this finding by spike-triggered membrane potential analysis, showing that dMSNs spiking required more synaptic input than iMSNs spiking did, as had been predicted by computational models.</content>

 While Granger Causality (GC) has been employed in a large number of problems in network neuroscience, the vast majority of GC applications are based on linear multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models. However, it is well known that real-life systems (and biological networks in particular) exhibit notable nonlinear behavior, hence undermining that validity of MVAR-based GC (MVAR-GC) approaches. Current nonlinear approaches to GC estimation only cater for additive nonlinearities or, alternatively, are based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) or Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which present considerable training difficulties and/or the need to be carefully tailored to specific applications. We define a novel approach to estimating nonlinear, directed within-network interactions based on a specific class of RNNs termed echo-state networks (ESN), where training is replaced by random initialization and the internal basis is built through orthonormal matrices. We reformulate the classical GC framework in terms of ESN-based models for arbitrarily complex networks, and characterize the ability of our ESN-based Granger Causality (ES-GC) estimator to capture nonlinear causal relations in a network of noisy Duffing oscillators, showing a net advantage of ES-GC in detecting nonlinear, causal links. We then explore the structure of ES-GC networks in the human brain employing functional MRI data from 1003 healthy subjects scanned at rest at 3T within the human connectome project, demonstrating the existence of previously unknown directed within-brain interactions. In summary, ES-GC performs better than commonly used and recently developed GC detection approaches, making it a valuable tool for the analysis of e.g. multivariate biological networks.</content>

 Diffusion MRI (dMRI) allows for non-invasive investigation of brain tissue microstructure. By fitting a model to the dMRI signal, various quantitative measures can be derived from the data, such as fractional anisotropy, neurite density and axonal radii maps. The uncertainty in these dMRI measures is often ignored, while previous work in functional MRI has shown that incorporating uncertainty estimates can lead to group statistics with a higher statistical power. We propose the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a generally applicable method for quantifying the parameter uncertainties in non-linear diffusion MRI models. In direct comparison with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, the FIM produces similar uncertainty estimates at lower computational cost. Using acquired and simulated data, we then list several characteristics that influence the parameter variances, like data complexity and signal-to-noise ratio. In individual subjects, the parameter standard deviations can help in detecting white matter artifacts as patches of relatively large standard deviations. In group statistics, we recommend using the parameter standard deviations by means of variance weighted averaging. Doing so can reduce the overall variance in group statistics and reduce the effect of data artifacts without discarding data from the analysis. Both these effects can lead to a higher statistical power in group studies.</content>

 Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) encode position using a distributed representation across multiple neural populations (modules), each possessing a distinct spatial scale. The modular structure of the representation confers the grid cell neural code with large capacity. Yet, the modularity poses significant challenges for the neural circuitry that maintains the representation, and updates it based on self motion. Small incompatible drifts in different modules, driven by noise, can rapidly lead to large, abrupt shifts in the represented position, resulting in catastrophic readout errors. Here we propose a theoretical model of coupled modules. The coupling suppresses incompatible drifts, allowing for a stable embedding of a two dimensional variable (position) in a higher dimensional neural attractor, while preserving the large capacity. We propose that coupling of this type may be implemented by recurrent synaptic connectivity within the mEC with a relatively simple and biologically plausible structure.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Cocaine is known to increase the extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of these monoamines. However, individuals with reduced monoamine reuptake transporter expression do not display a reduction in cocaine intake, suggesting that a mechanism other than inhibition of monoamine reuptake contributes to the rewarding and addictive effects of the psychostimulant. Here we report that cocaine depletes the dopaminergic and serotonergic storage vesicles of the rat nucleus accumbens. This cocaine-induced vesicle depletion gave rise to acute increases in the extracellular levels of DA and 5-HT, which in turn correlated with monoamine-type-specific changes in behavior. Both the neurochemical and behavioral responses to cocaine varied among individual animals, which was not due to individual differences in the reuptake of DA and 5-HT, but rather to individual differences in their vesicular release. Furthermore, we found that reserpine-induced depletion of storage vesicles reduced both short and long access cocaine self-administration, and the degree of reduction was linked to the vesicular storage capacity of the animals. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which cocaine increases the extracellular concentrations of accumbal DA and 5-HT, namely via release from storage vesicles. Furthermore, individual differences in cocaine-induced vesicular monoamine release shape individual differences in not only the acute behavioral and neurochemical effects of the stimulant, but also in its intake. Thus, intracellular storage vesicles represent an attractive novel drug target to combat psychostimulant addiction.</content>

 Excitatory neurons of the mammalian cerebral cortex are organized into six functional layers characterized by unique patterns of connectivity, as well as distinctive physiological and morphological properties. Developmentally, cortical layers emerge after a highly regulated neuronal migration process from the ventricular zone, where proliferating cells reside, toward the superficial layers, where the early cortex starts to develop. Importantly, defects in this radial migration process have been implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases. Here we report that during the final stages of migration, transcription factor Neurogenic Differentiation 2 (Neurod2) contributes to terminal cellular positioning within the cortical plate and alignment of nascent dendrites toward the marginal zone. In mice, in utero knockdown of Neurod2 results in misaligned primary dendrites of migrating neurons within the nascent cortical plate. Our ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq analyses of NEUROD2-regulated genes in the developing cortex identify Reelin (Reln), a critical regulator of neuronal migration, as a key downstream target. NEUROD2 binds to conserved E-box elements in multiple introns of the Reln gene, and binding is associated with suppression of gene expression. These data reveal a new role for NEUROD2 during neuronal migration and suggest that fine-tuning of Reln gene expression in migrating neurons is important for terminal cellular positioning of neurons upon arrival to the cortical plate.</content>

 Spatial demonstratives are powerful linguistic tools used to establish joint attention. Identifying the meaning of semantically underspecified expressions like &quot;this one&quot; hinges on the integration of linguistic and visual cues, attentional orienting and pragmatic inference. This synergy between language and extralinguistic cognition is pivotal to language comprehension in general, but especially prominent in demonstratives.nnIn this study, we aimed to elucidate which neural architectures enable this intertwining between language and extralinguistic cognition using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm. In our experiment, 28 participants listened to a specially crafted dialogical narrative with a controlled number of spatial demonstratives. A fast multiband-EPI acquisition sequence (TR = 388ms) combined with FIR modelling of the hemodynamic response was used to capture signal changes at word-level resolution.nnWe found that spatial demonstratives bilaterally engage a network of parietal areas, including the supramarginal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and precuneus, implicated in information integration and visuospatial processing. Moreover, demonstratives recruit frontal regions, including the right FEF, implicated in attentional orienting and reference frames shifts. Finally, using multivariate similarity analyses, we provide evidence for a general involvement of the dorsal (&quot;where&quot;) stream in the processing of spatial expressions, as opposed to ventral pathways encoding object semantics.nnOverall, our results suggest that language processing relies on a distributed architecture, recruiting neural resources for perception, attention, and extra-linguistic aspects of cognition in a dynamic and context-dependent fashion.</content>

 How does the brain allow us to interact with others, and above all how does it handle situations when the goals of the interactors overlap (i.e. cooperation) or differ (i.e. competition)? Social neuroscience has already provided some answers to these questions but has tended to treat high-level, cognitive interpretations of social behavior separately from the sensorimotor mechanisms upon which they rely. The goal here is to identify the underlying neural processes and mechanisms linking sensorimotor coordination and intention attribution. We combine the Human Dynamic Clamp (HDC), a novel paradigm for studying realistic social behavior between self and other in well-controlled laboratory conditions, with high resolution electroencephalography (EEG). The collection of humanness and intention attribution reports, kinematics and neural data affords an opportunity to relate brain activity to the behavior of the HDC as well as to what the human is doing. Behavioral results demonstrate that sensorimotor coordination influences judgements of cooperativeness and humanness. Analysis of brain dynamics reveals two distinct networks related to integration of visuo-motor information from self and other. The two networks overlap over the right parietal region, an area known to be important for interpersonal motor interactions. Furthermore, connectivity analysis highlights how the judgement of humanness and cooperation of others modulate the connection between the right parietal hub and prefrontal cortex. These results reveal how distributed neural dynamics integrates information from 'low-level' sensorimotor mechanisms and 'high-level' social cognition to support the realistic social behaviors that play out in real time during interactive scenarios.</content>

In light of increased co-prescription of multiple drugs, the ability to discern and predict drug-drug interactions (DDI) has become crucial to guarantee the safety of patients undergoing treatment with multiple drugs. However, information on DDI profiles is incomplete and the experimental determination of DDIs is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Although previous studies have explored various feature spaces for &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; screening of interacting drug pairs, their use of conventional cross-validation prevents them from achieving generalizable performance on drug pairs where neither drug is seen during training. Here we demonstrate for the first time targets of adversely interacting drug pairs are significantly more likely to have synergistic genetic interactions than non-interacting drug pairs. Leveraging genetic interaction features and a novel training scheme, we construct a gradient boosting-based classifier that achieves robust DDI prediction even for drugs whose interaction profiles are completely unseen during training. We demonstrate that in addition to classification power—including the prediction of 432 novel DDIs—our genetic interaction approach offers interpretability by providing plausible mechanistic insights into the mode of action of DDIs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L-FImT3I1tA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Visual performance depends on polar angle, even when eccentricity is held constant; on many psychophysical tasks observers perform best when stimuli are presented on the horizontal meridian, worst on the upper vertical, and intermediate on the lower vertical meridian. This variation in performance ‘around’ the visual field can be as pronounced as that of doubling the stimulus eccentricity. The causes of these asymmetries in performance are largely unknown. Some factors in the eye, e.g. cone density, are positively correlated with the reported variations in visual performance with polar angle. However, the question remains whether these correlations can quantitatively explain the perceptual differences observed ‘around’ the visual field. To investigate the extent to which the earliest stages of vision–optical quality and cone density–contribute to performance differences with polar angle, we created a computational observer model. The model uses the open-source software package ISETBIO to simulate an orientation discrimination task for which visual performance differs with polar angle. The model starts from the photons emitted by a display, which pass through simulated human optics with fixational eye movements, followed by cone isomerizations in the retina. Finally, we classify stimulus orientation using a support vector machine to learn a linear classifier on the photon absorptions. To account for the 30% increase in contrast thresholds for upper vertical compared to horizontal meridian, as observed psychophysically on the same task, our computational observer model would require either an increase of ~7 diopters of defocus or a reduction of 500% in cone density. These values far exceed the actual variations as a function of polar angle observed in human eyes. Therefore, we conclude that these factors in the eye only account for a small fraction of differences in visual performance with polar angle. Substantial additional asymmetries must arise in later retinal and/or cortical processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mDA_OVqU33Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The activity of neural populations in the brains of humans and animals can exhibit vastly different spatial patterns when faced with different tasks or environmental stimuli. The degrees of similarity between these neural activity patterns in response to different events are used to characterize the representational structure of cognitive states in a neural population. The dominant methods of investigating this similarity structure first estimate neural activity patterns from noisy neural imaging data using linear regression, and then examine the similarity between the estimated patterns. Here, we show that this approach introduces spurious bias structure in the resulting similarity matrix, in particular when applied to fMRI data. This problem is especially severe when the signal-to-noise ratio is low and in cases where experimental conditions cannot be fully randomized in a task. We propose Bayesian Representational Similarity Analysis (BRSA), an alternative method for computing representational similarity, in which we treat the covariance structure of neural activity patterns as a hyper-parameter in a generative model of the neural data. By marginalizing over the unknown activity patterns, we can directly estimate this covariance structure from imaging data. This method offers significant reductions in bias and allows estimation of neural representational similarity with previously unattained levels of precision at low signal-to-noise ratio, without losing the possibility of deriving an interpretable distance measure from the estimated similarity. The method is closely related to Pattern Component Model (PCM), but instead of modeling the estimated neural patterns as in PCM, BRSA models the imaging data directly and is suited for analyzing data in which the order of task conditions is not fully counterbalanced. The probabilistic framework allows for jointly analyzing data from a group of participants. The method can also simultaneously estimate a signal-to-noise ratio map that shows where the learned representational structure is supported more strongly. Both this map and the learned covariance matrix can be used as a structured prior for maximum &lt;i&gt;a posteriori&lt;/i&gt; estimation of neural activity patterns, which can be further used for fMRI decoding. Our method therefore paves the way towards a more unified and principled analysis of neural representations underlying fMRI signals. We make our tool freely available in Brain Imaging Analysis Kit (BrainIAK).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vpqHL6kU_2c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcome prediction in patients after cardiac arrest (CA) is challenging. EEG reactivity (EEG‐R) might be a reliable predictor. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of EEG‐R using a standardized assessment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a prospective cohort study, a strictly defined EEG‐R assessment protocol was executed twice a day in adult patients after CA. EEG‐R was classified as ‘present’ or ‘absent’ by three EEG readers, blinded for patient characteristics. Uncertain reactivity was classified as ‘present’. Primary outcome was best Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) in six months after CA, dichotomized as ‘good’ (CPC 1‐2) or ‘poor’ (CPC 3‐5). EEG‐R was considered reliable for predicting poor outcome if specificity was ≥ 95%. For good outcome prediction, a specificity of ≥ 80% was used. Added value of EEG‐R was the increase in specificity when combined with EEG background, neurological examination and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 160 patients enrolled, 149 were available for analyses. Absence of EEG‐R for poor outcome prediction had specificity of 82% and sensitivity of 73%. For good outcome prediction, specificity was 73% and sensitivity 82%. Specificity for poor outcome prediction increased from 98% to 99% when EEG‐R was added to a multimodal model. For good outcome prediction, specificity increased from 70% to 89%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEG‐R testing in itself is not sufficiently reliable for outcome prediction in patients after CA. For poor outcome prediction it has no substantial added value to EEG background, neurological examination and SSEP. For prediction of good outcome, EEG‐R seems to have added value.&lt;/p&gt;

MEF2 proteins are regulated by neuronal synaptic activity, and they recruit several epigenetic enzymes to influence chromatin structure and gene expression during development and throughout adulthood. Here, we provide a brief review of the recent literature reporting important roles for MEF2 during early brain development and function, and we highlight emerging roles for MEF2 as a risk factor for multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and mental illnesses, such as autism, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising tool for modulation of learning and memory, allowing to transiently change cortical excitability of specific brain regions with physiological and behavioral outcomes. A detailed exploration of factors that can moderate tDCS effects on episodic long-term memory (LTM) is of high interest due to the clinical potential for patients with traumatic or pathological memory deficits and with cognitive impairments. This commentary discusses findings by Marián et al. (2018) recently published in &lt;i&gt;Cortex&lt;/i&gt; within a broad context of brain stimulation in memory research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Here we discuss the recent study of Marián et al. (2018) that demonstrated a disruption of long-term retention of remote memory after application of tDCS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We address methodological issues of tDCS application such as timing, site of stimulation, electrode montage and stimulation parameters (intensity, duration). Moreover, since tDCS effects are often under debate in terms of reliability, we point at the importance of the statistical design and at the consistency with previous evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is hypothesized to convey error information in reinforcement learning tasks with explicit appetitive or aversive cues. However, during motor skill learning feedback signals arise from an animal’s evaluation of sensory feedback resulting from its own behavior, rather than any external reward or punishment. It has previously been shown that intact dopaminergic signaling from the ventral tegmental area – substantia nigra compacta complex (VTA/SNc) is necessary for vocal learning when songbirds modify their vocalizations to avoid hearing distorted auditory feedback (playbacks of white noise). However, it remains unclear whether dopaminergic signaling underlies vocal learning in response to more naturalistic errors (pitch-shifted feedback delivered via headphones). We used male Bengalese finches (&lt;i&gt;Lonchura striata&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;domestica&lt;/i&gt;) to test the hypothesis that the necessity of dopamine signaling is shared between the two types of learning. We combined 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of dopaminergic terminals within Area X, a basal ganglia nucleus critical for song learning, with a headphones learning paradigm that shifted the pitch of auditory feedback and compared their learning to that of unlesioned controls. We found that 6-OHDA lesions affected song behavior in two ways. First, over a period of days lesioned birds systematically lowered their pitch regardless of the presence or absence of auditory errors. Second, 6-OHDA lesioned birds also displayed severe deficits in sensorimotor learning in response to pitch-shifted feedback. Our results suggest roles for dopamine in both motor production and auditory error processing, and a shared mechanism underlying vocal learning in response to both distorted and pitch-shifted auditory feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine has been hypothesized to convey a reward prediction error signal in learning tasks involving external reinforcement. However the role dopamine plays in tasks involving self-guided error correction in the absence of external reinforcement is much less clear. To address this question, we studied the role of dopamine in sensorimotor adaptation using male Bengalese finches, which spontaneously produce a complex motor behavior (song) and are capable of modulating their behavioral output in response to induced auditory errors. Our results reveal that in addition to conveying errors in motor performance, dopamine may also have a role in modulating effort and in choosing a corrective response to the auditory error.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thymidine kinase 2, encoded by the nuclear gene &lt;i&gt;TK2&lt;/i&gt;, is required for mitochondrial DNA maintenance. Autosomal recessive &lt;i&gt;TK2&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause depletion and multiple deletions of mtDNA that manifest predominantly as a myopathy usually beginning in childhood and progressing relentlessly. We investigated safety and efficacy of deoxynucleoside monophosphate and deoxynucleoside therapies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We administered deoxynucleoside monophosphates and deoxynucleoside to 16 TK2‐deficient patients under a compassionate use program.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 5 patients with early onset and severe disease, survival and motor functions were better than historical untreated patients. In 11 childhood‐ and adult‐onset patients, clinical measures stabilized or improved. Three of 8 patients who were non‐ambulatory at baseline gained ability to walk on therapy; 4 of 5 patients who required enteric nutrition were able to discontinue feeding tube use; and 1 of 9 patients who required mechanical ventilation became able to breath independently. In motor functional scales, improvements were observed in the: 6‐minute walk test performance in 7 of 8 subjects, Egen Klassification in 2 of 3, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment in all 5 tested. Baseline elevated GDF‐15 levels decreased with treatment in all 7 patients tested. A side‐effect observed in 8 of the 16 patients was dose‐dependent diarrhea, which did not require withdrawal of treatment. Among 12 other TK2 patients treated with deoxynucleoside, two adults developed elevated liver enzymes that normalized following discontinuation of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This open‐label study indicates favorable side‐effect profiles and clinical efficacy of deoxynucleoside monophosphate and deoxynucleoside therapies for TK2 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

 The advent of optogenetic methods has made it possible to use endogeneously produced molecules to image and manipulate cellular, subcellular and synaptic activity. It has also led to the development of photoactivatable calcium-dependent indicators that mark active synapses, neurons and circuits. Furthermore, calcium-dependent photoactivation can be used to trigger gene expression in active neurons. Here we describe two sets of protocols, one using CaMPARI and a second one using Cal-Light. CaMPARI, a calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator, enables rapid network-wide, tunable, all-optical functional circuit mapping. Cal-Light, a photoactivatable calcium sensor, while slower to respond than CaMPARI, has the capacity to trigger the expression of genes, including effectors, activators, indicators or other constructs. Here we describe the rationale and provide procedures for using these two calcium-dependent constructs (1) in vitro in dissociated primary neuronal cell cultures (CaMPARI &amp;amp; Cal-Light); (2) in vitro in acute brain slices for circuit mapping (CaMPARI); (3) in vivo for triggering photoconversion or gene expression (CaMPARI &amp;amp; Cal-Light); and finally, (4) for recovering photoconverted neurons post-fixation with immunocytochemistry (CaMPARI). The approaches and protocols we describe are examples of the potential uses of both CaMPARI and Cal-Light. The ability to mark and manipulate neurons that are active during specific epochs of behavior has a vast unexplored experimental potential.</content>

 Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal Na+-permeable ion channels that are activated by extracellular acidification and are involved in fear sensing, learning, neurodegeneration after ischemia, and in pain sensation. We have recently found that the human ASIC1a (hASIC1a) wild type clone which has been used by many laboratories in recombinant expression studies contains a point mutation that occurs with a very low frequency in humans. Here we compared the function and expression of ASIC1a wild type and of this rare variant, in which the highly conserved residue Gly212 is substituted by Asp. Residue 212 is located at a subunit interface that undergoes changes during channel activity. We show that the modulation of channel function by commonly used ASIC inhibitors and modulators, and the pH dependence, are the same or only slightly different between hASIC1a-G212 and –D212. hASIC1a-G212 has however a higher current amplitude per surface-expressed channel and considerably slower current decay kinetics than hASIC1a-D212, and its current decay kinetics display a higher dependency on the type of anion present in the extracellular solution. We demonstrate for a number of channel mutants previously characterized in the hASIC1a-D212 background that they have very similar effects in the hASIC1a-G212 background. Taken together, we show that the variant hASIC1a-D212 that has been used as wild type in many studies is in fact a mutant, and that the properties of hASIC1a-D212 and hASIC1a-G212 are sufficiently close that the conclusions made in previous pharmacology and structure-function studies remain valid.</content>

 THIP (gaboxadol), a superagonist of the delta subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, produces persistent neuroplasticity in dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), similarly to rewarding drugs of abuse. However, unlike them THIP lacks abuse potential and induces conditioned place aversion in mice. The mechanism underlying the aversive effects of THIP remains elusive. Here, we show that mild aversive effects of THIP were detected 2 hours after administration likely reflecting an anxiety-like state with increased corticosterone release and with central recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor CRF1 receptors. A detailed immunohistochemical c-Fos expression mapping for THIP-activated brain areas revealed a correlation between the activation of CRF-expressing neurons in the oval nucleus of the bed nuclei of stria terminalis and THIP-induced aversive effects. In addition, the neuroplasticity of mesolimbic DA system (24 hours after administration) and conditioned place aversion by THIP after 4 daily acute sessions were dependent on extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (abolished in delta-GABAA receptor knockout mice) and activation of the CRF1 receptors (abolished in wildtype mice by a CRF1 receptor antagonist). A selective THIP-induced activation of CRF-expressing neurons in the oval part of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis may constitute a novel mechanism for inducing plasticity in a population of VTA DA neurons and aversive behavioral states.</content>

 C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred mouse strains are highly variable genetically and differ in a large number of behavioral traits related to striatal function, including depression, anxiety, stress response, and response to drugs of abuse. The genetic basis of these phenotypic differences are, however, unknown. Here, we present a comparison of the striatal proteome between B6 and D2 and relate differences at the protein level to strain differences at the mRNA level. We also leverage a recombinant inbred BXD population derived from B6 and D2 strains to investigate the role of genetic variation on regulation of mRNA and protein levels. Finally, we test the hypothesis that differential protein expression contributes to differential behavioral responses between the B6 and D2 strain. We detected the expression over 2,500 proteins in membrane enriched protein fractions from B6 and D2 striatum. Of these, 160 proteins demonstrated significant differential expression between B6 and D2 strains at a 10% false discovery level, including COMT, GABRA2, and CNR1—key proteins involved in synaptic transmission and behavioral response. Similar to previous reports, there was little overlap between protein and transcript levels (25%). However, overlap was greater (51%) for proteins demonstrating genetic regulation of cognate gene expression . We also found that striatal proteins with significantly higher or lower relative expression in B6 and D2 were enriched for dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses and processes involved in synaptic plasticity (e.g. LTP and LTD). Finally, we validated higher expression of CNR1 in B6 striatum and demonstrated greater sensitivity of this strain to the locomotor inhibiting effects of the CNR1 agonist, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Our study is the first comparison of differences in striatal proteins between the B6 and D2 strains, and suggests that alterations in the striatal proteome may underlie strain differences in related behaviors, such as drug response. Furthermore, we propose that genetic variants that impact transcript levels are more likely to also exhibit differential expression at the protein level.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The centrosomal protein γ-tubulin complex protein 3 (Tubgcp3/GCP3) is required for the assembly of γ-tubulin small complexes (γ-TuSCs) and γ-tubulin ring complexes (γ-TuRCs), which play critical roles in mitotic spindle formation during mitosis. However, its function in vertebrate embryonic development is unknown. Here, we generated the zebrafish tubgcp3 mutants using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and found that the tubgcp3 mutants exhibited the small eye phenotype. Tubgcp3 is required for the cell cycle progression of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and its depletion caused cell cycle arrest in mitotic (M) phase. The M-phase arrested RPCs exhibited aberrant monopolar spindles and abnormal distributed centrioles and γ-tubulin. Moreover, these RPCs underwent apoptosis finally. Our study provides the in vivo model for the functional study of Tubgcp3 and shed lights on the roles of centrosomal γ-tubulin complexes in vertebrate development.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Although deep brain stimulation of the entorhinal cortex has recently shown promise in the treatment of early forms of cognitive decline, the underlying neurophysiological processes remain elusive. Therefore, the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) was stimulated with trains of continuous 5 Hz and 20 Hz pulses or with bursts of 100 Hz pulses to visualize activated neuronal networks, i.e., neuronal responses in the dentate gyrus and BOLD responses in the entire brain were simultaneously recorded.
Electrical stimulation of the LEC caused a wide spread pattern of BOLD responses. Dependent on the stimulation frequency, BOLD responses were only triggered in the amygdala, infralimbic, prelimbic, and dorsal peduncular cortex (5 Hz), or in the nucleus accumbens, piriform cortex, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus (20 Hz), and contralateral entorhinal cortex (100 Hz). In general, LEC stimulation caused stronger BOLD responses in frontal cortex regions than in the hippocampus. Identical stimulation of the perforant pathway, a fiber bundle projecting from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, and subiculum, mainly elicited significant BOLD responses in the hippocampus but rarely in frontal cortex regions. Consequently, BOLD responses in frontal cortex regions are mediated by direct projections from the LEC rather than via signal propagation through the hippocampus. Thus, the beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation of the entorhinal cortex on cognitive skills might depend more on an altered prefrontal cortex than hippocampal function.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is caused by accumulation of Lewy bodies, destruction of mitochondria, and excess of glutamate in synapses, which eventually leads to excitotoxicity, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairments. Ceftriaxone (CEF) reduces excitotoxicity by increasing glutamate transporter 1 expression and glutamate reuptake. We investigated whether CEF can prevent cognitive decline and neurological deficits and increase neurogenesis in DLB rats. Male Wistar rats infused with viral vector containing human alpha-synuclein (α-syn) gene, SNCA, in the lateral ventricle were used as a rat model of DLB. CEF (100 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was injected in these rats for 27 days. The active avoidance test and object recognition test was performed. Finally, the brains of all the rats were immunohistochemically stained to measure α-syn, neuronal density, and newborn cells in the hippocampus and substantia nigra. The results revealed that DLB rats had learning and object recognition impairments and exhibited cell loss in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, and hippocampal CA1, and dentate gyrus (DG). Additionally, DLB rats had fewer newborn cells in the DG and substantia nigra pars reticulata and more α-syn immune-positive cells in the DG. Treatment with CEF improved cognitive function, reduced cell loss, and increased the number of newborn cells in the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that CEF prevents loss of neurogenesis in the brain of DLB rats. CEF may therefore has clinical potential for treating DLB.</content>

 Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons in the adult brain, is important for memory formation and extinction. One of the most studied external interventions that affect the rate of adult neurogenesis is physical exercise. Physical exercise promotes adult neurogenesis via several factors including Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here, we identified L-lactate, a physical exercise-induced metabolite, as a factor that promotes adult hippocampal neurogenesis. While prolonged exposure to L-lactate promoted neurogenesis, no beneficial effect was exerted on cognitive learning and memory. Systemic pharmacological blocking of Monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2), which transports L-lactate to the brain, prevented lactate-induced neurogenesis, while 3,5-DHBA, an agonist for the lactate-receptor hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1), did not affect adult neurogenesis. These data suggest that L-lactate partially mediates the effect of physical exercise on adult neurogenesis, but not cognition, in a MCT2-dependent manner.</content>

 Intertemporal choice refers to decisions involving tradeoffs between costs and benefits occurring at different times. Studies have found that weighting the time and benefits during decision-making involves a complex neural network that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, in contrast to literature regarding intertemporal choice for gains, studies have not provided causal evidence that the DLPFC is involved in intertemporal choice for losses. We examined whether bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the right and left prefrontal cortex can alter the balance of intertemporal preference in the loss condition. A total of 60 participants performed delay discounting tasks for losses while receiving either right anodal/left cathodal, left anodal/right cathodal, or sham stimulation. The results showed that participants tended to choose larger delayed losses after receiving left anodal/right cathodal tDCS. Left anodal/right cathodal tDCS significantly decreased the discounting rate compared with the sham stimulation. These findings confirm that DLPFC activity is critical during intertemporal decision-making for losses.</content>

 Clustering is a powerful machine learning tool for detecting structures in datasets. In the medical field, clustering has been proven to be a powerful tool for discovering patterns and structure in labeled and unlabeled datasets. Unlike supervised methods,  clustering is an unsupervised method that works on datasets in which there is no outcome (target) variable nor is anything known about the relationship between the observations, that is, unlabeled data. In this paper, we focus on studying and reviewing clustering methods that have been applied to datasets of neurological diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aim is to provide insights into which clustering technique is more suitable for partitioning patients of AD based on their similarity. This is important as clustering algorithms can find patterns across patients which are difficult for medical practitioners to find. We further discuss the implications of the use of clustering algorithms in the treatment of AD. We found that clustering analysis can point to several features that underlie the conversion from early-stage AD to advanced AD. Furthermore, future work can apply semi-clustering algorithms on AD datasets, which will enhance clusters by including additional information.</content>

 Previous studies have shown that the auditory cortex can enhance the perception of behaviorally important sounds in the presence of background noise, but the mechanisms by which it does this are not yet elucidated. Rapid plasticity of spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) in the primary (A1) cortical neurons is observed during behavioral tasks that require discrimination of particular sounds. This rapid task-related change is believed to be one of the processing strategies utilized by the auditory cortex to selectively attend to one stream of sound in the presence of mixed sounds. However, the mechanism by which the brain evokes this rapid plasticity in the auditory cortex remains unclear. This paper uses a neural network model to investigate mechanisms by which cortical neurons can change their receptive fields. A sound signal was used as input to a model of the cochlea and auditory periphery, which activated or inhibited integrate-and-fire neuron models to represent networks in the primary auditory cortex. Each neuron in the network was tuned to a different frequency. All neurons were interconnected with excitatory or inhibitory synapses of varying strengths. Action potentials in one of the model neurons were used to calculate the receptive field using reverse correlation, which were directly compared to previously recorded electrophysiological data from ferrets performing behavioral tasks that require discrimination of particular sounds. This neural network model could reproduce complex STRFs observed experimentally through optimizing the synaptic drives in the model. The model predicts that altering synaptic drive between cortical neurons can account for rapid task-related changes observed experimentally by A1 neurons. By identifying changes in the synaptic drive during behavioral tasks, the model provides insights into the neural mechanisms utilized by the auditory cortex to enhance the perception of important sounds in the presence of background noise.</content>

 Background: Perinatal asphyxia, leading to neonatal encephalopathy, is one of the leading causes for child mortality and long-term morbidities. Neonatal encephalopathy rates are significantly increased in newborns with perinatal infection. Therapeutic hypothermia is only neuroprotective in 50% of cooled asphyxiated newborns. As shown experimentally, cooling has failed to be neuroprotective after inflammation-sensitized hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injury. Microglia are thought to be key players after inflammation-sensitized HI brain injury. We performed this study investigating early microglia phenotype polarization in our newborn animal model of inflammation-sensitized HI brain injury, better understanding the underlying pathophysiological processes.   
Methods: Seven day old Wistar rat pups were injected with either vehicle (NaCl 0.9%) or E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by left carotid ligation combined with global hypoxia inducing a mild unilateral hypoxic-ischemic injury. Pups were randomized to (1) Sham group (n=41), (2) LPS only group (n=37), (3) Veh/HI group (n=56) and (4) LPS/HI group (n=79). On postnatal day 8 and 14 gene-expression analysis or immunohistochemistry was performed describing early microglia polarization in our model. 
Results: We confirmed that LPS pre-sensitization significantly increases brain area loss and induced microglia activation and neuronal injury after mild hypoxia-ischemia. Additionally, we show that microglia upregulate pro-inflammatory genes involving NLRP-3 inflammasome gene expression 24 h after inflammation-sensitized hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that microglia are early key mediators of the inflammatory response following inflammation-sensitized HI brain injury and that they polarize into a predominant pro-inflammatory phenotype 24 h post HI. This may lead to new treatment options altering microglia phenotype polarization early after HI brain injury.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Status epilepticus (SE, a prolonged seizure activity) impairs brain-blood barrier (BBB) integrity, which results in secondary complications following SE. The non-integrin 67-kDa laminin receptor (67-kDa LR) plays a role in cell adherence to laminin (a major glycoprotein component in basement membrane), and participates laminin-mediated signaling pathways including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Thus, we investigated the role of 67-kDa LR in SE-induced vasogenic edema formation in the rat piriform cortex (PC). SE diminished 67-kDa LR expression, but increased laminin expression, in endothelial cells accompanied by the reduced SMI-71 (a rat BBB barrier marker) expression. Astroglial 67-kDa LR expression was also reduced in the PC due to massive astroglial loss. 67-kDa LR neutralization led to serum extravasation in the PC concomitant with the reduced SMI-71 expression. 67-kDa LR neutralization also decreased expressions of dystrophin and aquaporin-4 (AQP4). In addition, it increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), laminin and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which were abrogated by SB202190, a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Therefore, our findings indicate that 67-kDa LR dysfunction may disrupt dystrophin-AQP4 complex, which would evoke vasogenic edema formation and subsequent laminin over-expression via activating p38 MAPK/VEGF axis.</content>

 Autophagy, a catabolic degradation system, is utilized for destroying and recycling the damaged or unnecessary cellular components. Brain plasticity refers to the remarkable characteristics of brain neurons that change their structure and function according to previous experience. This review was performed by searching the relevant articles in databases of SCIENCEDIRECT, PUBMED, and Web of Science, from respective inception to January 2019. Here, we review the neuroprotective effect of autophagy in neurological diseases and the mechanism of autophagy in brain plasticity. Moreover, the mechanism of autophagy in the process of brain plasticity can provide the possibility for the development of new treatment methods in the future, thus benefiting patients with neurological diseases. In summary, autophagy and brain plasticity play important roles in neurological diseases.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) is a rare genetic disease characterized by the accumulation of endocytosed cholesterol and other lipids in the endosome/lysosome compartments. In the brain, the accumulation/mislocalization of unesterified cholesterol, gangliosides and sfingolipids is responsible for the appearance of neuropathological hallmarks and progressive neurological decline in patients. The imbalance of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids, including GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, alters a number of signaling mechanisms impacting on the overall homeostasis of neurons.
In particular, lipid depletion experiments have shown that lipid rafts regulate the cell surface expression of dopamine transporter and modulate its activity. Dysregulated dopamine transporter’s function results in imbalanced dopamine levels at synapses and severely affects dopamine-induced locomotor responses and dopamine receptor-mediated synaptic signaling.
Recent studies begin to correlate dopaminergic stimulation with the length and function of the primary cilium, a non-motile organelle that coordinates numerous signaling pathways. In particular, the absence of dopaminergic D2 receptor stimulation induces the elongation of dorso-striatal neuron’s primary cilia.
This study has used a mouse model of the NPC1 disease to correlate cholesterol dyshomeostasis with dorso-striatal anomalies in terms of dopamine transporter expression and primary cilium length and morphology. 
We found that juvenile Npc1nmf164 mice display a reduction of dorso-striatal dopamine transporter expression, with associated alterations of primary cilium number, length-frequency distribution and tortuosity.</content>

 Santiago Ramón y Cajal was still young when he came across the reazione nera, discovered by the Italian Camillo Golgi. Cajal became absolutely entranced by the fine structure of the nervous system this technique revealed, which led him to embark on one of the last truly epic endeavors in modern History: the characterization of nervous cells, and of their organization to form the brain. Cajal remained in Spain throughout his scientific career, working for years alone. With international recognition, Cajal began recruiting brilliant students as collaborators. A handful of his pupils also made decisive discoveries that served to lay the foundations of modern Neuroscience. Cajal´s brother Pedro, Tello, Domingo Sánchez, Achúcarro, Lafora, Río-Hortega, de Castro and Lorente de Nó worked side by side with El Maestro. While Cajal himself pronounced some of the basic rules that have helped us to understand the nervous system (the neuron theory, the law of dynamic polarization of the neuron), as well as providing innumerable details about the histological organization of the different neural structures, it was Pío del Río-Hortega who identified two of the four main cell types in the CNS (oligodendrocytes and microglia), and Fernando de Castro who described the innervation of the blood vessels and identified the first chemoreceptors in the carotid body. Together, this group of scientists is known as the Spanish Neurological School, and if they had not existed the History of Neuroscience would surely have been quite a different story; and proof that Cajal was a truly exceptional scientist but he was not an exception for Spanish Science.</content>

 For British neurologists, one case was considered to represent significant evidence regarding the organization of language in the brain in the second half of the 19th century. The interpretation of its significance was based on repeated standard clinical assessment of behavioral deficits, the use of a psychological model of processing, and lesion localization to inform understanding of clinic-pathological correlation. The aphasic deficits experienced by a single case were observed and recorded by London neurologist Henry Charlton Bastian (1837-1915) over a period of 18 years, and used as a demonstration of clinico-pathological reasoning regarding language function.  This case was well documented in many of Bastian’s publications; presented in teaching demonstrations; included in discussions at medical society meetings and public lectures; and reported widely in the medical press.  When this patient died, the autopsy findings were added to the extensive record of his language deficits. Some aspects of the size and site of the lesion were consistent with Bastian’s clinical predictions arising from his model of language processing, while others presented more of a paradox.  This single case was a significant source of discussion and reflection in the medical community throughout the second half of the 19th century. Examination of various interpretations of this case reveal the assumptions regarding the functional architecture of language processing, and more general theoretical considerations of how evidence from cases of acquired neurogenic aphasia can be employed in developing such models. This long view into a historical case sheds light on the challenges of clinic-pathological correlation methods difficulties in understanding  in the understanding of localization of language functions regarding language processing which remain today.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Identification of pro-regenerative approaches to improve tendon healing is critically important as the fibrotic healing response impairs physical function. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that S100a4 haploinsufficiency or inhibition of S100a4 signaling improves tendon function following acute injury and surgical repair in a murine model. We demonstrate that S100a4 drives fibrotic tendon healing primarily through a cell non-autonomous process, with S100a4 haploinsufficiency promoting regenerative tendon healing. Moreover, inhibition of S100a4 signaling via antagonism of its putative receptor, RAGE, also decreases scar formation. Mechanistically, S100a4 haploinsufficiency decreases myofibroblast and macrophage content at the site of injury, with both cell populations being key drivers of fibrotic progression. Moreover, S100a4-lineage cells become α-SMA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; myofibroblasts, via loss of S100a4 expression. Using a combination of genetic mouse models, small molecule inhibitors and in vitro studies we have defined S100a4 as a novel, promising therapeutic candidate to improve tendon function after acute injury.</content>

 Ribosome biogenesis is a complex and energy-demanding process requiring tight coordination of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal protein (RP) production. Given the extremely high level of RP synthesis in rapidly growing cells, alteration of any step in the ribosome assembly process may impact growth by leading to proteotoxic stress. Although the transcription factor Hsf1 has emerged as a central regulator of proteostasis, how its activity is coordinated with ribosome biogenesis is unknown. Here we show that arrest of ribosome biogenesis in the budding yeast &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;triggers rapid activation of a highly specific stress pathway that coordinately up-regulates Hsf1 target genes and down-regulates RP genes. Activation of Hsf1 target genes requires neo-synthesis of RPs, which accumulate in an insoluble fraction and presumably titrate a negative regulator of Hsf1, the Hsp70 chaperone. RP aggregation is also coincident with that of the RP gene activator Ifh1, a transcription factor that is rapidly released from RP gene promoters. Our data support a model in which the levels of newly-synthetized RPs, imported into the nucleus but not yet assembled into ribosomes, work to continuously balance Hsf1 and Ifh1 activity, thus guarding against proteotoxic stress during ribosome assembly.</content>

 Human NimA-related kinases (Neks) have multiple mitotic and non-mitotic functions, but few substrates are known. We systematically determined the phosphorylation-site motifs for the entire Nek kinase family, except for Nek11. While all Nek kinases strongly select for hydrophobic residues in the -3 position, the family separates into four distinct groups based on specificity for a serine versus threonine phospho-acceptor, and preference for basic or acidic residues in other positions. Unlike Nek1-Nek9, Nek10 is a dual-specificity kinase that efficiently phosphorylates itself and peptide substrates on serine and tyrosine, and its activity is enhanced by tyrosine auto-phosphorylation. Nek10 dual-specificity depends on residues in the HRD+2 and APE-4 positions that are uncommon in either serine/threonine or tyrosine kinases. Finally, we show that the phosphorylation-site motifs for the mitotic kinases Nek6, Nek7 and Nek9 are essentially identical to that of their upstream activator Plk1, suggesting that Nek6/7/9 function as phospho-motif amplifiers of Plk1 signaling.</content>

 Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enable the production and processing of time-dependent signals such as those involved in movement and working memory. Classic gradient-based algorithms for training RNNs have been available for decades, but are inconsistent with biological features of the brain, such as causality and locality. We derive an approximation to gradient-based learning that comports with these constraints by requiring synaptic weight updates to depend only on local information about pre- and postsynaptic activities, in addition to a random feedback projection of the RNN output error. In addition to providing mathematical arguments for the effectiveness of the new learning rule, we show through simulations that it can be used to train an RNN to perform a variety of tasks. Finally, to overcome the difficulty of training over very large numbers of timesteps, we propose an augmented circuit architecture that allows the RNN to concatenate short-duration patterns into longer sequences.</content>

 Enhancers are important regulatory elements that can control gene activity across vast genetic distances. However, the underlying nature of this regulation remains obscured because it has been difficult to observe in living cells. Here, we visualize the spatial organization and transcriptional output of the key pluripotency regulator &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt; and its essential enhancer &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt; Control Region (SCR) in living embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We find that &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt; and SCR show no evidence of enhanced spatial proximity and that spatial dynamics of this pair is limited over tens of minutes. &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt; transcription occurs in short, intermittent bursts in ESCs and, intriguingly, we find this activity demonstrates no association with enhancer proximity, suggesting that direct enhancer-promoter contacts do not drive contemporaneous &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt; transcription. Our study establishes a framework for interrogation of enhancer function in living cells and supports an unexpected mechanism for enhancer control of &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt; expression that uncouples transcription from enhancer proximity.</content>

Analysis methods based on simulations and optimization have been previously developed to estimate relative translation rates from next-generation sequencing data. Translation involves molecules and chemical reactions, hence bioinformatics methods consistent with the laws of chemistry and physics are more likely to produce accurate results. Here, we derive simple equations based on chemical kinetic principles to measure the translation-initiation rate, transcriptome-wide elongation rate, and individual codon translation rates from ribosome profiling experiments. Our methods reproduce the known rates from ribosome profiles generated from detailed simulations of translation. By applying our methods to data from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; and mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that the extracted rates reproduce expected correlations with various molecular properties, and we also find that mouse embryonic stem cells have a global translation speed of 5.2 AA/s, in agreement with previous reports that used other approaches. Our analysis further reveals that a codon can exhibit up to 26-fold variability in its translation rate depending upon its context within a transcript. This broad distribution means that the average translation rate of a codon is not representative of the rate at which most instances of that codon are translated, and it suggests that translational regulation might be used by cells to a greater degree than previously thought.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IEyz9tV6gdo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Health planners use forecasts of key metrics associated with influenza-like illness (ILI); near-term weekly incidence, week of season onset, week of peak, and intensity of peak. Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions. Although reduction of forecast subjectivity should be a long-term goal, some degree of human intervention is likely to improve forecast accuracy in the medium-term in parallel with the systematic consideration of more sophisticated ensemble approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/j79UB0H6-wc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The effectiveness of a mass vaccination program can engender its own undoing if individuals choose to not get vaccinated believing that they are already protected by herd immunity. This would appear to be the optimal decision for an individual, based on a strategic appraisal of her costs and benefits, even though she would be vulnerable during subsequent outbreaks if the majority of the population argues in this manner. We investigate how voluntary vaccination can nevertheless emerge in a social network of rational agents, who make informed decisions whether to be vaccinated, integrated with a model of epidemic dynamics. The information available to each agent includes the prevalence of the disease in their local network neighborhood and/or globally in the population, as well as the fraction of their neighbors that are protected against the disease. Crucially, the payoffs governing the decision of agents vary with disease prevalence, resulting in the vaccine uptake behavior changing in response to contagion spreading. The collective behavior of the agents responding to local prevalence can lead to a significant reduction in the final epidemic size, particularly for less contagious diseases having low basic reproduction number R 0. Near the epidemic threshold (R 0 ≈ 1) the use of local prevalence information can result in divergent responses in the final vaccine coverage. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in the risk perception resulting from the spatio-temporal evolution of an epidemic differentially affects agents’ payoffs, which is a critical determinant of the success of voluntary vaccination schemes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/32m1qNH1d_E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Recent large cancer studies have measured somatic alterations in an unprecedented number of tumours. These large datasets allow the identification of cancer-related sets of genetic alterations by identifying relevant combinatorial patterns. Among such patterns, &lt;i&gt;mutual exclusivity&lt;/i&gt; has been employed by several recent methods that have shown its effectiveness in characterizing gene sets associated to cancer. Mutual exclusivity arises because of the complementarity, at the functional level, of alterations in genes which are part of a group (e.g., a &lt;i&gt;pathway&lt;/i&gt;) performing a given function. The availability of quantitative target profiles, from genetic perturbations or from clinical phenotypes, provides additional information that can be leveraged to improve the identification of cancer related gene sets by discovering groups with complementary functional associations with such targets. In this work we study the problem of finding groups of mutually exclusive alterations associated with a quantitative (functional) target. We propose a combinatorial formulation for the problem, and prove that the associated computational problem is computationally hard. We design two algorithms to solve the problem and implement them in our tool UNCOVER. We provide analytic evidence of the effectiveness of UNCOVER in finding high-quality solutions and show experimentally that UNCOVER finds sets of alterations significantly associated with functional targets in a variety of scenarios. In particular, we show that our algorithms find sets which are better than the ones obtained by the state-of-the-art method, even when sets are evaluated using the statistical score employed by the latter. In addition, our algorithms are much faster than the state-of-the-art, allowing the analysis of large datasets of thousands of target profiles from cancer cell lines. We show that on two such datasets, one from project Achilles and one from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer project, UNCOVER identifies several significant gene sets with complementary functional associations with targets.

In a flipped classroom, students complete automated modules to replace a traditional lecture, allowing the time devoted for the lecture to be devoted to constructive tasks reinforcing student knowledge. Yet although the flipped classroom offers a compelling approach for fostering a constructivist, student-centric learning environment, research on the efficacy of flipped classes has been mixed. For that matter, is it possible to successfully flip a classroom in an advanced, heavily specialized course like a bioinformatics algorithms course? Over the past several years, the author has implemented a flipped version of such a course and will discuss some of the successes and pitfalls encountered.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mZsslISQP14&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reelin (Reln) and Disabled-1 (Dab1) participate in the Reelin-signaling pathway and when either is deleted, mutant mice have the same spinally mediated behavioral abnormalities – increased sensitivity to noxious heat and a profound loss in mechanical sensitivity. Both Reln and Dab1 are highly expressed in dorsal horn areas that receive and convey nociceptive information – laminae I-II, lateral lamina V, and the lateral spinal nucleus. Lamina I contains both projection neurons and interneurons that express Neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs) and they transmit information about noxious heat both within the dorsal horn and to the brain. Here we ask if the increased heat nociception in &lt;i&gt;Reln&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;/i&gt; mutants is due to incorrectly positioned dorsal horn neurons that express NK1Rs. We found more NK1R-expressing neurons in &lt;i&gt;Reln&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; laminae I-II than in their respective wild-type mice, and some NK1R neurons co-expressed Dab1 and the transcription factor Lmx1b, confirming their excitatory phenotype. Importantly, heat stimulation in &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;mice induced Fos in incorrectly positioned NK1R neurons in laminae I-II. Next we asked if these ectopically placed and noxious-heat responsive NK1R neurons participated in pain behavior. Ablation of the superficial NK1Rs with an intrathecal injection of a substance P analog conjugated to the toxin Saporin eliminated the thermal hypersensitivity of &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, without altering their mechanical insensitivity. These results suggest that ectopically positioned NK1R-expressing neurons underlie the heat hyperalgesia of Reelin-signaling pathway mutants, but do not contribute to their profound mechanical insensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Mutants deficient in Reelin signaling have increased sensitivity to noxious heat and decreased mechanical sensitivity, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we ask if the heat hyperalgesia results from additional activation of misplaced dorsal horn neurons that express Neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs). Compared to wild-type mice, &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice have more NK1R- expressing neurons in the superficial dorsal horn and these neurons express Fos in response to noxious heat stimulation. Ablation of these neurons by intrathecal injection of a substance P analog conjugated to Saporin abolished the hypersensitivity of the heat responses of mutant mice, but the mechanical insensitivity was preserved. Mispositioned NK1R-expressing neurons, therefore, underlie the heat hyperalgesia that characterizes Reelin-signaling mutant mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Allosteric HIV-1 integrase (IN) inhibitors (ALLINIs) are a promising new class of antiretroviral agents that disrupt proper viral maturation by inducing hyper-multimerization of IN. Here we show that lead pyridine-based ALLINI KF116 exhibits striking selectivity for IN tetramers versus lower order protein oligomers. IN structural features that are essential for its functional tetramerization and HIV-1 replication are also critically important for KF116 mediated higher-order IN multimerization. Live cell imaging of single viral particles revealed that KF116 treatment during virion production compromises the tight association of IN with capsid cores during subsequent infection of target cells. We have synthesized the highly active (-)-KF116 enantiomer, which displayed EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of ~7 nM against wild type HIV-1 and ~10-fold higher, sub-nM activity against a clinically relevant dolutegravir resistant mutant virus suggesting potential clinical benefits for complementing dolutegravir therapy with pyridine-based ALLINIs.</content>

 One of the challenges faced by global disease surveillance efforts is the lack of comparability across systems. Reporting commonly focuses on overall incidence, despite differences in surveillance quality between and within countries. For most immunizing infections, the age distribution of incident cases provides a more robust picture of trends in transmission. We present a framework to estimate transmission intensity for dengue virus from age-specific incidence data, and apply it to 359 administrative units in Thailand, Colombia, Brazil and Mexico. Our estimates correlate well with those derived from seroprevalence data (the gold standard), capture the expected spatial heterogeneity in risk, and correlate with known environmental drivers of transmission. We show how this approach could be used to guide the implementation of control strategies such as vaccination. Since age-specific counts are routinely collected by many surveillance systems, they represent a unique opportunity to further our understanding of disease burden and risk for many diseases.</content>

 A small subset of interneurons that are generated earliest as pioneer neurons are the first cohort of neurons that enter the neocortex. However, it remains largely unclear whether these early-generated interneurons (EGIns) predominantly regulate neocortical circuit formation. Using inducible genetic fate mapping to selectively label EGIns and pseudo-random interneurons (pRIns), we found that EGIns exhibited more mature electrophysiological and morphological properties and higher synaptic connectivity than pRIns in the somatosensory cortex at early postnatal stages. In addition, when stimulating one cell, the proportion of EGIns that influence spontaneous network synchronization is significantly higher than that of pRIns. Importantly, toxin-mediated ablation of EGIns after birth significantly reduce spontaneous network synchronization and decrease inhibitory synaptic formation during the first postnatal week. These results suggest that EGIns can shape developing networks and may contribute to the reﬁnement of neuronal connectivity before the establishment of the adult neuronal circuit.</content>

Many biological problems involve the response to multiple perturbations. Examples include response to combinations of many drugs, and the effects of combinations of many mutations. Such problems have an exponentially large space of combinations, which makes it infeasible to cover the entire space experimentally. To overcome this problem, several formulae that predict the effect of drug combinations or fitness landscape values have been proposed. These formulae use the effects of single perturbations and pairs of perturbations to predict triplets and higher order combinations. Interestingly, different formulae perform best on different datasets. Here we use Pareto optimality theory to quantitatively explain why no formula is optimal for all datasets, due to an inherent bias-variance (noise-precision) tradeoff. We calculate the Pareto front of log-linear formulae and find that the optimal formula depends on properties of the dataset: the typical interaction strength and the experimental noise. This study provides an approach to choose a suitable prediction formula for a given dataset, in order to best overcome the combinatorial explosion problem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mcVDX50DSXQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the brain non-uniformly, causing hippocampal memory deficits long before wide-spread brain degeneration becomes evident. Here we addressed whether mossy fiber inputs from the dentate gyrus onto CA3 principal cells are affected in an AD mouse model before amyloid β plaque deposition. We recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells in a slice preparation from 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice, and studied synaptic properties and intrinsic excitability. In parallel we performed a morphometric analysis of mossy fiber synapses following viral based labeling and 3D-reconstruction. We found that the basal structural and functional properties as well as presynaptic short-term plasticity at mossy fiber synapses are unaltered at 6 months in APP/PS1 mice. However, transient potentiation of synaptic transmission mediated by activity-dependent release of lipids was abolished. Whereas the presynaptic form of mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP) was not affected, the postsynaptic LTP of NMDAR-EPSCs was reduced. In addition, we also report an impairment in feedforward inhibition in CA3 pyramidal cells. This study, together with our previous work describing deficits at CA3–CA3 synapses, provides evidence that early AD affects synapses in a projection-dependent manner at the level of a single neuronal population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Because loss of episodic memory is considered the cognitive hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to study whether synaptic circuits involved in the encoding of episodic memory are compromised in AD mouse models. Here we probe alterations in the synaptic connections between the dentate gyrus and CA3, which are thought to be critical for enabling episodic memories to be formed and stored in CA3. We found that forms of synaptic plasticity specific to these synaptic connections are markedly impaired at an early stage in a mouse model of AD, before deposition of β amyloid plaques. Together with previous work describing deficits at CA3–CA3 synapses, we provide evidence that early AD affects synapses in an input-dependent manner within a single neuronal population.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Obesity and insulin resistance elicit blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in humans and animal models, but the relative contributions of the two pathologies remain poorly understood. These studies initially addressed the temporal progression of cerebrovascular dysfunction relative to dietary obesity or diet-induced insulin resistance in male mice. Obesity increased BBB permeability to the low molecular weight fluorophore sodium fluorescein (NaFl), whereas diet-induced insulin resistance increased permeability to both NaFl and Evans blue, which forms a high molecular weight complex with serum albumin. Serial section transmission electron microscopy analysis of hippocampal capillaries revealed that diabetes promotes involution of tight junctions, fenestration of endothelial cells, and pericyte regression. Chronic activation of adenosine receptor 2a (Adora2a) erodes tight junctions between endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature in other models of chronic neuropathology, and we observed that acute Adora2a antagonism normalized BBB permeability in wild-type mice with diet-induced insulin resistance. Experiments in mice with inducible deletion of Adora2a in endothelial cells revealed protection against BBB breakdown with diet-induced insulin resistance, despite comparable metabolic dysfunction relative to nontransgenic littermates. Protection against BBB breakdown was associated with decreased vascular inflammation, recovery of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and restoration of hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in vascular endothelial cells disrupts the BBB in dietary obesity, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the underlying mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The blood–brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of circulating factors into the brain, but obesity promotes BBB breakdown in humans and animal models. We used transgenic mice with resistance to BBB breakdown to investigate the role of neurovascular dysfunction in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive impairment. Transgenic mice with inducible ablation of Adora2a in endothelial cells were protected against BBB breakdown on HFD, despite comparable metabolic impairments relative to normal mice. Transgenic mice were also resistant to HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction and were protected against deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. These findings indicate that Adora2a-mediated signaling in endothelial cells mediates obesity-induced BBB breakdown, and implicate cerebrovascular dysfunction as the mechanism for deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition with obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Pain is a multidimensional experience and negative affect, or how much the pain is &quot;bothersome&quot;, significantly impacts the sufferers' quality of life. It is well established that the  opioid system contributes to depressive and dysphoric states, but whether this system contributes to the negative affect precipitated by the occurrence of chronic pain remains tenuous. Using a model of persistent pain, we show by quantitative real-time-PCR, florescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, Western blotting and GTPgS autoradiography an upregulation of expression and the function of  opioid receptors (KORs) and its endogenous ligand dynorphin in the mesolimbic circuitry in animals with chronic pain compared with surgical controls. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis and microinjection of drugs into the mesolimbic dopamine system, we demonstrate that inhibiting KORs reinstates evoked dopamine release and reward-related behaviors in chronic pain animals. Chronic pain enhanced KOR agonist-induced place aversion in a sex-dependent manner. Using various place preference paradigms, we show that activation of KORs drives pain aversive states in male but not female mice. However, KOR antagonist treatment was effective in alleviating anxiogenic and depressive affective-like behaviors in both sexes. Finally, ablation of KORs from dopamine neurons using AAV-TH-cre in KOR&lt;sup&gt;loxP&lt;/sup&gt; mice prevented pain-induced aversive states as measured by place aversion assays. Our results strongly support the use of KOR antagonists as therapeutic adjuvants to alleviate the emotional, tonic-aversive component of chronic pain, which is argued to be the most significant component of the pain experience that impacts patients' quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show that KORs are sufficient to drive the tonic-aversive component of chronic pain; the emotional component of pain that is argued to significantly impact a patient's quality of life. The impact of our study is broadly relevant to affective disorders associated with disruption of reward circuitry and thus likely contributes to many of the devastating sequelae of chronic pain, including the poor response to treatment of many patients, debilitating affective disorders (other disorders including anxiety and depression that demonstrate high comorbidity with chronic pain) and substance abuse. Indeed, coexisting psychopathology increases pain intensity, pain-related disability and effectiveness of treatments (Jamison and Edwards, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Attention Periodically Binds Visual Features As Single Events Depending on Neural Oscillations Phase-Locked to Action</title>
		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/21/4153?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Recent psychophysical studies have demonstrated that periodic attention in the 4–8 Hz range facilitates performance on visual detection. The present study examined the periodicity of feature binding, another major function of attention, in human observers (3 females and 5 males for behavior, with 7 males added for the EEG experiment). In a psychophysical task, observers reported a synchronous pair of brightness (light/dark) and orientation (clockwise/counterclockwise) patterns from two combined brightness–orientation pairs presented in rapid succession. We found that temporal binding performance exhibits periodic oscillations at ~8 Hz as a function of stimulus onset delay from a self-initiated button press in conditions where brightness–orientation pairs were spatially separated. However, as one would expect from previous studies on pre-attentive binding, significant oscillations were not apparent in conditions where brightness–orientation pairs were spatially superimposed. EEG results, while fully compatible with behavioral oscillations, also revealed a significant dependence of binding performance across trials on prestimulus neural oscillatory phases within the corresponding band. The peak frequency of this dependence was found to be correlated with intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) around the timing of button press in parietal sensors. Moreover, the peak frequency of the ITPC was found to predict behavioral frequency in individual observers. Together, these results suggest that attention operates periodically (at ~8 Hz) on the perceptual binding of multimodal visual information and is mediated by neural oscillations phase-locked to voluntary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies in neuroscience suggest that the brain's attention network operates rhythmically at 4–8 Hz. The present behavioral task revealed that attentional binding of visual features is performed periodically at ~8 Hz, and EEG analysis showed a dependence of binding performance on prestimulus neural oscillatory phase. Furthermore, this association between perceptual and neural oscillations is triggered by voluntary action. Periodic processes driven by attention appear to contribute not only to sensory processing but also to the temporal binding of diverse information into a conscious event synchronized with action.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are the post-synaptic targets of excitatory synaptic inputs that undergo extensive proliferation and maturation during the first postnatal month in mice. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate spines during this critical period is limited. Previous work has shown that Pannexin 1 (Panx1) regulates neurite growth and synaptic plasticity. We therefore investigated the impact of global Panx1 KO on spontaneous cortical neuron activity using Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; network analysis. Panx1 KO increased both the number and size of spontaneous co-active cortical neuron network ensembles. To understand the basis for these findings, we investigated Panx1 expression in postnatal synaptosome preparations from early postnatal mouse cortex. Between 2 and 4 postnatal weeks, we observed a precipitous drop in cortical synaptosome protein levels of Panx1, suggesting it regulates synapse proliferation and/or maturation. At the same time points, we observed significant enrichment of the excitatory postsynaptic density proteins PSD-95, GluA1 and GluN2a in cortical synaptosomes from global Panx1 knockout mice. &lt;i&gt;Ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; analysis of pyramidal neuron structure in somatosensory cortex revealed a consistent increase in dendritic spine densities in both male and female Panx1 KO mice. Similar findings were observed in an excitatory neuron-specific Panx1 KO line (Emx1-Cre driven; Panx1 cKO&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;) and in primary Panx1 KO cortical neurons cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro.&lt;/i&gt; Altogether, our study suggests that Panx1 negatively regulates cortical dendritic spine development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our findings reveal an important regulatory role for Pannexin 1 (Panx1) in the formation of connections between nerve cells. We found that removal of the Panx1 altered the ability of nerve cells from the cerebral cortex to fire together. We studied the impact of removing Panx1 on the formation of 'dendritic spines', which are microscopic protrusions that receive information from other nerve cells. We found that removing Panx1 increased the expression of proteins involved in dendritic spine function and also increased the density of dendritic spines on nerve cells of the cerebral cortex. Together these findings suggest Panx1 is a 'brake' on the development of dendritic spines with important implications for the development of nerve cell connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The Golgi apparatus plays an indispensable role in posttranslational modification and transport of proteins to their target destinations. Although it is well established that the Golgi apparatus requires an acidic luminal pH for optimal activity, morphological and functional abnormalities at the neuronal circuit level because of perturbations in Golgi pH are not fully understood. In addition, morphological alteration of the Golgi apparatus is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we used anatomical and electrophysiological approaches to characterize morphological and functional abnormalities of neuronal circuits in Golgi pH regulator conditional knockout mice. Purkinje cells (PCs) from the mutant mice exhibited vesiculation and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, followed by axonal degeneration and progressive cell loss. Morphological analysis provided evidence for the disruption of basket cell (BC) terminals around PC soma, and electrophysiological recordings showed selective loss of large amplitude responses, suggesting BC terminal disassembly. In addition, the innervation of mutant PCs was altered such that climbing fiber terminals abnormally synapsed on the somatic spines of mutant PCs in the mature cerebellum. The combined results describe an essential role for luminal acidification of the Golgi apparatus in maintaining proper neuronal morphology and neuronal circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The Golgi luminal acidic condition is essential for normal activity of the Golgi apparatus and its dysregulation contributes to several human diseases. In neurons, however, pharmacological tools cannot be used for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies because they lack specificity. Here, the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; role of Golgi luminal acidification by inactivation of the Golgi pH regulator (GPHR) in cerebellar neurons is reported. The GPHR is indispensable for neuronal survival, normal Golgi morphology and axonal integrity. Intriguingly, after formation of Pinceau structures, basket cells exhibited significant loss of function, resulting in an alteration of neuronal circuitry around Purkinje cells. These results highlight an essential role of the Golgi luminal pH in the maintenance of gross axonal morphology and subcellular structures in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a great opportunity to recapitulate both normal and pathological development of brain tissues. Recently, three research teams have developed human-PSC technology and direct somatic cell reprogramming to allow induction of human serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine) neurons in vitro. While preclinical studies have repeatedly shown that 5-HT suppresses 5-HT neuronal firing activity, one group has tested the effect of 5-HT on the neuronal activity of those 5-HT-like cells and found a paradoxical excitatory action of 5-HT. Here, we argue that few cautions in translational interpretations have to be taken into account. Nonetheless, utilizing patient-derived cells for generating disease relevant cell types truly offers a new and powerful approach for investigating mechanisms playing fundamental roles in psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated sorting are powerful techniques that hold great promise for studying heterogeneous populations of submicron particles such as synaptosomes, but many technical challenges arise in these experiments. To date, most flow cytometry studies of synaptosomes have relied on particle detection using forward scatter (FSC) measurements and size estimation with polystyrene (PS) bead standards. However, these practices have serious limitations, and special care must be taken to overcome the poor sensitivity of conventional flow cytometers in the analysis of submicron particles. Technical artifacts can confound these experiments, especially the detection of multiple particles as a single event. Here, we compared analysis of P2 crude synaptosomal preparations from murine forebrain on multiple flow cytometers using both FSC- and fluorescence-triggered detection. We implemented multicolor fluorescent dye-based assays to quantify coincident particle detection and aggregation, and we assessed the false colocalization of antigens in immunostaining analyses. Our results demonstrate that fluorescence-triggering and proper dilution can control for coincident particle detection, but not particle aggregation. We confirmed previous studies showing that FSC-based size estimation with PS beads underestimates biological particle size, and we identified pervasive aggregation in the FSC range analyzed in most synaptosome flow cytometry studies. We found that analyzing P2 samples in sucrose/tris/EDTA (SET) buffer reduces aggregation compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), but does not completely eliminate the presence of aggregates, especially in immunostaining experiments. Our study highlights challenges and pitfalls in synaptosome flow cytometry and provides a methodological framework for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Synaptosomes are an invaluable model for synaptic biology, but these synaptic particles are traditionally analyzed in bulk preparations rather than at the level of single particles. Although flow cytometry is a powerful technique for high throughput particle analysis, submicron particles present unique challenges. Here, the authors investigate key elements of synaptosome flow cytometry experiments, especially those related to artifacts that confound the analysis of single synaptosomes. They identify aggregation as especially problematic and implement methods to minimize its impact on flow cytometry analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether cognitive reserve modifies the risk of dementia attributable to apolipoprotein ε4 (&lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4), a well‐known genetic risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed 2,556 cognitively intact participants aged ≥60 years from the ongoing prospective community‐based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC‐K). Dementia was ascertained through clinical and neuropsychological assessments and diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition criteria. Structural equation modeling was used to generate a cognitive reserve indicator from 4 previously validated contributors: early life education, midlife substantive work complexity, late life leisure activities, and late life social networks. Cox proportional hazard models estimated dementia risk in relation to cognitive reserve indicator. The interaction between the cognitive reserve indicator and &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 was assessed on multiplicative and additive scales.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an average of 6.3 years (range = 2.1–10.7) of follow‐up, 232 dementia cases were ascertained. Relative to individuals in the lowest tertile of cognitive reserve indicator, those with moderate and high reserve were at a reduced risk of dementia. There was no multiplicative interaction between &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 status and cognitive reserve indicator (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.113). Additive interaction was statistically significant. Relative to &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 carriers with low cognitive reserve, ε4 carriers with high reserve had a reduced risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13–0.59). The magnitude of risk reduction was similar in ε4 noncarriers with a high cognitive reserve indicator (HR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.15–0.40).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifelong engagement in reserve‐enhancing activities attenuates the risk of dementia attributable to &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4. Promoting cognitive reserve might be especially effective in subpopulations with high genetic risk of dementia. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Formation of synapses between neurons depends in part on binding between axonal and dendritic cell surface synaptic organizing proteins, which recruit components of the developing presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations. One of these presynaptic organizing molecules is protein tyrosine phosphatase σ (PTPσ). Although the protein domains involved in adhesion between PTPσ and its postsynaptic binding partners are known, the mechanisms by which it signals into the presynaptic neuron to recruit synaptic vesicles and other necessary components for regulated transmitter release are not well understood. One attractive candidate to mediate this function is liprin-α, a scaffolding protein with well-established roles at the synapse. We systematically mutated residues of the PTPσ intracellular region and used the yeast dihydrofolate reductase protein complementation assay to screen for disrupted interactions between these mutant forms of PTPσ and its various binding partners. Using a molecular replacement strategy, we show that disrupting the interaction between PTPσ and liprin-α, but not between PTPσ and itself or another binding partner, caskin, abolishes presynaptic differentiation. Furthermore, phosphatase activity of PTPσ and binding to extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans are dispensable for presynaptic induction. Previous reports have suggested that binding between PTPσ and liprin-α is mediated by the PTPσ membrane-distal phosphatase-like domain. However, we provide evidence here that both of the PTPσ phosphatase-like domains mediate binding to liprin-α and are required for PTPσ-mediated presynaptic differentiation. These findings further our understanding of the mechanistic basis by which PTPσ acts as a presynaptic organizer.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Integration of sensory and motor information is one-step, among others, that underlies the successful production of goal-directed hand movements necessary for interacting with our environment. Disruption of sensorimotor integration is prevalent in many neurologic disorders, including stroke. In most stroke survivors, persistent paresis of the hand reduces function and overall quality of life. Current rehabilitative methods are based on neuroplastic principles to promote motor learning that focus on regaining motor function lost due to paresis, but the sensory contributions to motor control and learning are often overlooked and currently understudied. There is a need to evaluate and understand the contribution of both sensory and motor function in the rehabilitation of skilled hand movements after stroke. Here, we will highlight the importance of integration of sensory and motor information to produce skilled hand movements in healthy individuals and individuals after stroke. We will then discuss how compromised sensorimotor integration influences relearning of skilled hand movements after stroke. Finally, we will propose an approach to target sensorimotor integration through manipulation of sensory input and motor output that may have therapeutic implications.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objectives
To define normal signal intensity values of amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in different brain regions.
Materials and Methods
Twenty healthy subjects (9 females, mean age 29 years, range 19 – 37 years) underwent MR imaging at 3 Tesla. 3D APTw (RF saturation B1,rms = 2 T, duration 2 s, 100% duty cycle) and 2D T2-weighted turbo spin echo images were acquired. Postprocessing (image fusion, ROI measurements of APTw intensity values in 22 different brain regions) was performed and controlled by two independent neuroradiologists. Values were measured separately for each brain hemisphere. A subject was scanned both in prone and supine position to investigate differences between hemispheres. A mixed model on a 5% significance level was used to assess the effect of gender, brain region and side on APTw intensity values.
Results
Mean APTw intensity values in the hippocampus and amygdala varied between 1.13 - 1.57%, in the deep subcortical nuclei (putamen, globus pallidus, head of caudate nucleus, thalamus, red nucleus, substantia nigra) between 0.73 - 1.84%, in the frontal, occipital and parietal cortex between 0.56 - 1.03%; in the insular cortex between 1.11 - 1.15%, in the temporal cortex between 1.22 - 1.37%, in the frontal, occipital and parietal white matter between 0.32 - 0.54% and in the temporal white matter between 0.83 - 0.89%.
APTw intensity values were significantly impacted both by brain region (p&amp;lt;0.001) and by side (p&amp;lt;0.001), whereby overall values on the left side were higher than on the right side (1.13 vs 0.9%). Gender did not significantly impact APTw intensity values (p=0.24). APTw intensity values between the left and the right side were reversed after changing the position of one subject from supine to prone.
Conclusions

 Obesity is known to induce leptin and insulin resistance. Leptin is a peptide hormone synthesized in adipose tissue that mainly regulates food intake. It has been shown that insulin stimulates the production of leptin when adipocytes are exposed to glucose to encourage satiety; while leptin, via a negative feedback, decreases the insulin release and enhances tissue sensitivity to it, leading to glucose uptake for energy utilization or storage. Therefore, resistance to insulin is closely related to leptin resistance. Obesity in middle age has also been related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In recent years, the relation between impaired leptin signaling pathway and the onset of AD has been studied. In all this context the role of the blood brain barrier (BBB) is crucial. Slow excitotoxicity happens in AD due to an excess of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Since leptin has been shown to regulate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, we want to review the link between these pathological pathways, and how they are affected by other AD triggering factors and its role in the onset of AD.</content>

 1.	Abstract

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a vital source of imaging data for identifying anatomical connections in the living human brain that form the substrate for information transfer between brain regions. dMRI can thus play a central role towards our understanding of brain function. The quantitative modeling and analysis of dMRI data deduces the features of neural fibers at the voxel level, such as direction and density. The modeling methods that have been developed range from deterministic to probabilistic approaches. Currently, the Ball-and-Stick model serves as a widely implemented probabilistic approach in the tractography toolbox of the popular FSL software package and FreeSurfer/TRACULA software package. However, estimation of the features of neural fibers is complex under the scenario of two crossing neural fibers, which occurs in a sizeable proportion of voxels within the brain. A Bayesian non-linear regression is adopted, comprised of a mixture of multiple nonlinear components. Such models can pose a difficult statistical estimation problem computationally. To make the approach of Ball-and-Stick model more feasible and accurate, we propose a simplified version of Ball-and-Stick model that reduces parameter space dimensionality. This simplified model is vastly more efficient in the terms of computation time required in estimating parameters pertaining to two crossing neural fibers through Bayesian simulation approaches. Moreover, the performance of this new model is comparable or better in terms of bias and estimation variance as compared to existing models.</content>

 Japanese martial arts, Budo, have been reported to improve cognitive function, especially attention. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of the effect of Budo on attention processing has not yet been investigated. Kendo, a type of fencing using bamboo swords, is one of the most popular forms of Budo worldwide. We investigated the difference in functional connectivity (FC) between Kendo players (KPs) and non-Kendo players (NKPs) during an attention-related auditory oddball paradigm and during rest. The analyses focused on the brain network related to “motivation”. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and task-based fMRI using the oddball paradigm were performed in healthy male volunteers (14 KPs and 11 NKPs). Group differences in FC were tested using CONN-software within the motivation network, which consisted of 22 brain regions defined by a previous response-conflict task-based fMRI study with a reward cue. Daily general physical activities were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). We also investigated the impact of major confounders, namely, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, IPAQ score, body mass index, and reaction time (RT) in the oddball paradigm. Resting-state fMRI revealed that KPs had a significantly lower FC than NKPs between the right nucleus accumbens and right frontal eye field within the motivation network. Conversely, KPs exhibited a significantly higher FC than NKPs between the left intraparietal sulcus and the left precentral gyrus within the network during the auditory oddball paradigm (statistical thresholds, FDR &amp;lt; 0.05). These results remained significant after controlling for major covariates. Our results suggest that attenuated motivation network integrity at rest together with enhanced motivation network integrity during attentional demands might underlie the instantaneous concentration abilities of KPs.</content>

 Creativity has been defined as requiring both novelty and effectiveness, but little is known about how this standard definition applies in music. Here we present results from a pilot study in which we combine behavioral testing in musical improvisation and structural neuroimaging to relate brain structure to performance in a creative musical improvisation task. Thirty-eight subjects completed a novel improvisation continuation task and underwent T1 MRI. Recorded performances were rated by expert jazz instructors for creativity. Voxel-based morphometric analyses on T1 data showed that creativity ratings were negatively associated with grey matter volume in the right inferior temporal gyrus and bilateral hippocampus. The duration of improvisation training, which was significantly correlated with creativity ratings, was negatively associated with grey matter volume in the rolandic operculum. Together, results show that musical improvisation ability and training are associated with grey matter volume in regions that are previously linked to learning and memory formation, perceptual categorization, and sensory integration. The present study takes a first step towards understanding the neuroanatomical basis of musical creativity by relating creative musical improvisation to individual differences in grey matter structure.</content>

 Brain oscillations and connectivity have emerged as promising measures of evaluating memory processes, including encoding, maintenance, and retrieval, as well as the related executive function. Although many studies have addressed the neural mechanisms underlying working memory, most of these studies have focused on the visual modality. Neurodynamics and functional connectivities related to auditory working memory have yet been well established. In this study, we explored the dynamic of high density (128-channel) electroencephalography (EEG) in a musical delayed match-to-sample task (DMST), in which thirty-six participants were recruited and were instructed to recognize and distinguish the target melodies from similar distractors. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs), event-related phase-amplitude coupling (ERPAC), and phase-locking value (PLV) were used to determine the corresponding brain oscillations and connectivities. First, we observed that low-frequency oscillations in the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions were increased during the processing of both target and distracting melodies. Second, cross-frequency coupling between low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude was elevated in the frontal and parietal regions when the participants were distinguishing between the target and distractor, suggesting that phase-amplitude coupling could be an indicator of the neural mechanisms underlying memory retrieval. Finally, phase-locking, an index evaluating brain functional connectivity, revealed that there was fronto-temporal phase-locking in theta band and fronto-parietal phase-locking in alpha band during the recognition of both the two stimuli. These findings suggest the existence of functional connectivity and phase-amplitude coupling in the neocortex during musical memory retrieval, and provide a highly resolved timeline to evaluate brain dynamics. Furthermore, inter-regional phase-locking and phase-amplitude coupling among the frontal, temporal and parietal regions occurred at the very beginning of musical memory retrieval, which might reflect the precise timing when cognitive resources are involved in the retrieval of targets and the rejection of similar distractions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first EEG study employing a naturalistic task to study auditory memory processes and functional connectivity during memory retrieval, by which can shed light on the use of natural stimuli in studies that are closer to the real-life applications of cognitive evaluations, mental treatments, and brain-computer interface.</content>

 Monitoring the hypnotic component of anesthesia during surgeries is critical to prevent intraoperative awareness and reduce adverse side effects. For this purpose, electroencephalographic methods complementing measures of autonomic functions and behavioral responses are in use in clinical practice. However, in human neonates and infants existing methods may be unreliable and the correlation between brain activity and anesthetic depth is still poorly understood. Here, we characterize the effects of different anesthetics on activity of several brain areas in neonatal mice and develop machine learning approaches to identify electrophysiological features predicting inspired or end-tidal anesthetic concentration as a proxy for anesthetic depth. We show that similar features from electroencephalographic recordings can be applied to predict anesthetic concentration in neonatal mice, and human neonates and infants. These results might support a novel strategy to monitor anesthetic depth in human newborns.</content>

 ABSTRACT 
Growing evidence suggests that synaptic signalling is compromised in the ageing brain and in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), contributing to synaptic decline. Wnt signalling is a prominent pathway at the synapse and is required for synaptic plasticity and maintenance in the adult brain. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on deregulation of Wnt signalling in the context of ageing and AD. Emerging studies suggest that enhancing Wnt signalling could boost synaptic function during ageing, and ameliorate synaptic pathology in AD. Although further research is needed to determine the precise contribution of deficient Wnt signalling to AD pathogenesis, targeting Wnt signalling components may provide novel therapeutic avenues for synapse protection or restoration in the brain.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Inner hair cell (IHC) Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels are multifunctional channels mediating Ca2+ influx for exocytosis at ribbon synapses, the generation of Ca2+ action potentials in pre-hearing IHCs and gene expression. IHCs of deaf systemic Cav1.3-deficient (Cav1.3-/-) mice stay immature because they fail to up-regulate voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels but persistently express small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK2) channels. In pre-hearing wildtype mice, cholinergic neurons from the superior olivary complex (SOC) exert efferent inhibition onto spontaneously active immature IHCs by activating their SK2 channels. Because Cav1.3 plays an important role for survival, health and function of superior olivary complex (SOC) neurons, SK2 channel persistence and lack of BK channels in systemic Cav1.3-/- IHCs may result from malfunctioning neurons of the SOC. Here we analyze cochlea-specific Cav1.3 knockout mice with green fluorescent protein (GFP) switch reporter function, Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/flex and Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/-. Profound hearing loss, lack of BK channels and persistence of SK2 channels in Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/- mice recapitulated the phenotype of systemic Cav1.3-/- mice, indicating that in wildtype mice, regulation of SK2 and BK channel expression is independent of Cav1.3 expression in SOC neurons. In addition, we noticed dose-dependent GFP toxicity leading to death of basal coil IHCs of Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/flex mice, likely because of high GFP concentration and small repair capacity. This and the slower time course of Pax2-driven Cre recombinase in switching two rather than one Cacna1d-eGFPflex allele lead us to study Pax2::cre;Cacna1d-eGFPflex/- mice. Notably, control Cacna1d-eGFPflex/- IHCs showed a significant reduction in Cav1.3 channel cluster sizes and currents, suggesting that the intronic construct interfered with gene translation or splicing. These pitfalls are likely to be a frequent problem of many genetically modified mice with complex or multiple gene-targeting constructs or fluorescent proteins. Great caution and appropriate controls are therefore required.</content>

 Peripheral Nerve Injury (PNI) is common following blunt or penetrating trauma with an estimated prevalence of 2% among the trauma population. The resulting economic and societal impacts are significant.

Nerve regeneration is a key biological process in those recovering from neural trauma. Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and RNA sequencing (RNA seq) are investigative methods that are often deployed by researchers to characterise the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin this process. However, the ethical and practical challenges associated with studying human nerve injury have meant that studies of nerve injury have largely been limited to rodent models of reinnervation. 

In some circumstances it is possible to liberate human nerve tissue for study, for example during reconstructive nerve repair. This complex surgical environment affords numerous challenges for optimising the yield of RNA in sufficient quantity and quality for downstream RT-qPCR and/or RNA seq applications. This study characterised the effect of: 1) Time delays between surgical liberation and cryopreservation and 2) contact with antiseptic surgical reagents, on the quantity and quality of RNA isolated from human and rodent nerve samples.

It was found that time delays of greater than 3 minutes between surgical liberation and cryopreservation of human nerve samples significantly decreased RNA concentrations to be sub-optimal for downstream RT-qPCR/RNA seq applications (&amp;lt;5 ng/µl). Minimising the exposure of human nerve samples to antiseptic surgical reagents significantly increased yield of RNA isolated from samples. The detrimental effect of antiseptic reagents on RNA yield was further confirmed in a rodent model where RNA yield was impaired by 8.3-fold lower compared to non-exposed samples.

In summary, this study has shown that changes to the surgical tissue collection protocol can have significant effects on the yield of RNA isolated from nerve samples. This will enable the optimisation of protocols in future studies, facilitating characterisation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin the regenerative capacity of the human peripheral nervous system.</content>

 The corticotectal projections, together with the corticobulbar (corticoreticular) projections, work in parallel with the corticospinal tract to influence motoneurons in the spinal cord both directly and indirectly via the brainstem descending pathways. The tectospinal tract originates in the deep layers of the superior colliculus. In the present study we analysed the corticotectal projections from two motor cortical areas, namely the premotor cortex (PM) and the primary motor cortex (M1) in eight macaque monkeys subjected to either a cortical lesion of the hand area in M1 (n=4) or Parkinson’s disease-like symptoms PD (n=4). A subgroup of monkeys with cortical lesion was subjected to anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment whereas all PD monkeys were transplanted with Autologous Neural Cell Ecosystems (ANCE). The anterograde tracer BDA was used to label the axonal boutons both en passant and terminaux in the ipsilateral superior colliculus. Individual axonal boutons were charted in the different layers of the superior colliculus. In intact animals, we previously observed that corticotectal projections were denser when originating from PM than from M1. In the present M1 lesioned monkeys, as compared to intact ones the corticotectal projection originating from PM was decreased when treated with anti-Nogo-A antibody but not in untreated monkeys. In PD-like symptoms’ monkeys, on the other hand, there was no consistent change affecting the corticotectal projection as compared to intact monkeys. The present pilot study overall suggests that the corticotectal projection is less affected by M1 lesion or PD symptoms than the corticoreticular projection previously reported in the same animals.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with dysregulation of brain cholesterol homeostasis. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), beyond the known role in the regulation of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, was firstly identified in the brain with a potential involvement on brain development and apoptosis. However, its role in the central nervous system and in AD pathogenesis is still far from being understood. While in vitro and in vivo evidence led to controversial results, genetic studies did not apparently find an association between PCSK9 loss of function mutations and AD risk or prevalence. In addition, a potential impairment of cognitive performances by the treatment with the PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab and evolocumab, have been excluded, although ongoing studies with longer follow-up will provide further insights. PCSK9 is able to affect the expression of neuronal receptors involved in cholesterol homeostasis and neuroinflammation and higher PCSK9 concentrations have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. In this review, we critically examined the science of PCSK9 with respect to its modulatory role of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, based on literature data, we made the hypothesis to consider brain PCSK9 as a negative modulator of brain cholesterol homeostasis and neuroinflammation and a potential pharmacological target for treatment.</content>

 Recent works have extensively investigated the possibility to predict brain aging from T1-weighted MRI brain scans. The main purposes of these studies are the investigation of subject-specific aging mechanisms and the development of accurate models for age prediction. Deviations between predicted and chronological age are known to occur in several neurodegenerative diseases; as a consequence, reaching higher levels of age prediction accuracy is of paramount importance to develop diagnostic tools. In this work, we propose a novel complex network model for brain based on segmenting T1-weighted MRI scans in rectangular boxes, called patches, and measuring pairwise similarities using Pearson's correlation to define a subject-specific connectivity network. We fed a deep neural network with nodal metrics, evaluating both the intensity and the uniformity of connections, to predict subjects' ages. Our model reaches high accuracies which compare favorably with state-of-the-art approaches. We observe that the complex relationships involved in this brain description cannot be accurately modeled with standard machine learning approaches, such as Ridge and Lasso regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, instead a deep neural network has to be used.</content>

 Paul Greengard died suddenly and peacefully on April 13, 2019, at the age of 93. He was a giant of molecular neuroscience during the last decades of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. His achievements were recognized by a host of awards, most notably the Nobel Prize in 2000. I had the privilege and thrill of working in Paul’s laboratory as an undergraduate in 1969 and 1970. That single year a half century ago had a profound influence on my career and sparked a life-long friendship. This does not explain why I was asked to write this memorial, but it may help excuse my accepting the offer.</content>

 We guarantee that you’ve never met anyone quite like Charlie Gross, an iconoclast and pioneer who blazed a trail through the uncharted territories of the cerebral cortex. Charles Gordon Gross was unconventional from the moment he was born on a leap day, February 29, 1936, to Communist parents (a “red-diaper baby”). Charlie was, by his own account, a mediocre young student, but he turned it around. He became a Westinghouse Science Finalist, the youngest Eagle Scout in Brooklyn, a Harvard graduate, and a Fulbright Scholar.</content>

The interaction among multiple microbial strains affects the spread of infectious diseases and the efficacy of interventions. Genomic tools have made it increasingly easy to observe pathogenic strains diversity, but the best interpretation of such diversity has remained difficult because of relationships with host and environmental factors. Here, we focus on host-to-host contact behavior and study how it changes populations of pathogens in a minimal model of multi-strain interaction. We simulated a population of identical strains competing by mutual exclusion and spreading on a dynamical network of hosts according to a stochastic susceptible-infectious-susceptible model. We computed ecological indicators of diversity and dominance in strain populations for a collection of networks illustrating various properties found in real-world examples. Heterogeneities in the number of contacts among hosts were found to reduce diversity and increase dominance by making the repartition of strains among infected hosts more uneven, while strong community structure among hosts increased strain diversity. We found that the introduction of strains associated with hosts entering and leaving the system led to the highest pathogenic richness at intermediate turnover levels. These results were finally illustrated using the spread of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; in a long-term health-care facility where close proximity interactions and strain carriage were collected simultaneously. We found that network structural and temporal properties could account for a large part of the variability observed in strain diversity. These results show how stochasticity and network structure affect the population ecology of pathogens and warn against interpreting observations as unambiguous evidence of epidemiological differences between strains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/76azSIoRDBg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful markers of neuronal activation and essential components of neuronal response. While studies of gastropods have provided many insights into the basic learning and memory mechanisms, the genome-wide assessment of IEGs has been mainly restricted to vertebrates. In this study, we identified IEGs in the terrestrial snail &lt;i&gt;Helix lucorum&lt;/i&gt;. In the absence of the genome, we conducted &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome assembly using reads with short and intermediate lengths cumulatively covering more than 98 billion nucleotides. Based on this assembly, we identified 37 proteins corresponding to contigs differentially expressed (DE) in either the parietal ganglia (PaG) or two giant interneurons located within the PaG of the snail in response to the neuronal stimulation. These proteins included homologues of well-known mammalian IEGs, such as &lt;i&gt;c-jun/jund&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C/EBP&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-fos/fosl2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Egr1&lt;/i&gt;, as well as homologues of genes not yet implicated in the neuronal response.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is used for the treatment of dystonia in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy; however, the current level of evidence for the effect is low. The primary aim of this study was to provide evidence for the effect of intrathecal baclofen treatment on individual goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was performed at 2 university medical centers in the Netherlands. Patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Functioning Classification System level IV–V) aged 4 to 24 years who were eligible for intrathecal baclofen were included. Patients were assigned by block randomization (2:2) for treatment with intrathecal baclofen or placebo for 3 months via an implanted microinfusion pump. The primary outcome was goal attainment scaling of individual treatment goals (GAS T score). A linear regression model was used for statistical analysis with study site as a covariate. Safety analyses were done for number and type of (serious) adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six patients were recruited from January 1, 2013, to March 31, 2018. Data for final analysis were available for 17 patients in the intrathecal baclofen group and 16 in the placebo group. Mean (standard deviation) GAS T score at 3 months was 38.9 (13.2) for intrathecal baclofen and 21.0 (4.6) for placebo (regression coefficient = 17.8, 95% confidence interval = 10.4‐25.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Number and types of (serious) adverse events were similar between groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is superior to placebo in achieving treatment goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 One of the key pathways implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis is abnormal RNA processing. Studies to date have focussed on defects in RNA stability, splicing, and translation, but this review will focus on the largely overlooked RNA processing mechanism of RNA trafficking, with particular emphasis on the importance of glia. In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes can extend processes to myelinate and metabolically support up to 50 axons and astrocytes can extend processes to cover up to 100,000 synapses, all with differing local functional requirements. Furthermore, many of the proteins required in these processes are large, aggregation-prone proteins which would be difficult to transport in their fully translated, terminally-folded state. This therefore highlights a critical requirement in these cells for local control of protein translation, which is achieved through specific trafficking of mRNAs to each process and local translation therein. Given that a large number of RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in ALS, and RNA-binding proteins are essential for trafficking mRNAs from the nucleus to glial processes for local translation, RNA misprocessing in glial cells is a likely source of cellular dysfunction in ALS. To date, neurons have been the focus of ALS research, but a cell autonomous deficit in glia, namely astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, could have an additive effect on declining neuronal function in ALS. This review aims to highlight the key evidence that supports the contention that RNA trafficking deficits in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes may contribute to in ALS.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The small GTPases from the Ras superfamily play crucial roles in basic cellular processes during practically the entire process of neurodevelopment, including neurogenesis, differentiation, gene expression, membrane and protein traffic, vesicular trafficking, and synaptic plasticity. Small GTPases are key signal transducing enzymes that link extracellular cues to the neuronal responses required for the construction of neuronal networks, as well as for synaptic function and plasticity. Different subfamilies of small GTPases have been linked to a number of non-neoplastic cerebral diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, drug addiction, Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a large number of idiopathic cerebral diseases. Here, we attempted to make a clearer illustration of the relationship between Ras superfamily GTPases and non-neoplastic cerebral diseases, as well as their roles in the neural system. In future studies, potential treatments for non-neoplastic cerebral diseases which are based on small GTPase related signaling pathways should be explored further. In this paper, we review all the available literature in support of this possibility.</content>

Accordingly, deficits in GS activity contribute to epilepsy and neurodegeneration. Despite its central role in brain physiology, the mechanisms that regulate GS activity are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that GS is directly phosphorylated on threonine residue 301 (T301) within the enzyme active site by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of T301 leads to a dramatic decrease in glutamine synthesis. Enhanced T301 phosphorylation was evident in a mouse model of epilepsy, which may contribute to decreased GS activity seen during this trauma. Thus, our results highlight a novel molecular mechanism that determines GS activity under both normal and pathological conditions.</content>

 Research suggests that maternal exercise in pregnancy may have beneficial effects on the brain function of offspring. This study sought to determine if voluntary wheel running during pregnancy improves depression-like behavior, temporal order memory, and hippocampal neurogenesis in both female and male offspring mice. Pregnant mice were allowed to run voluntarily by introducing running wheels into the housing cages throughout the gestational period. Male and female mice offspring at the age of 8- to 9-week-old offspring were then tested for temporal order test and forced swim test, then euthanized for immunostaining for examining adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Results showed that both male and female pups have reduced depression-like behavior, while only male offspring demonstrated improvement in temporal order memory. Immunostaining revealed that male offspring showed an increase in number of immature neurons in the ventral hippocampus, whereas female offspring show enhanced cell proliferation in the dorsal hippocampus. The findings confirm that maternal physical exercise benefits both female and male offspring on reducing depression-like behaviour, but with gender effect on promoting hippocampal cell proliferation and newborn neurons.</content>

 Throughout the past decade, silicon-based neural probes comprising sophisticated integrated CMOS electronics providing a large number of recording sites along slender probe shanks have become a driving force in neural engineering. Using such neural probes in a chronic setting often requires them to be mechanically anchored with respect to the skull. However, any relative motion between brain and implant causes recording instabilities and tissue responses such as glial scarring, thereby shielding recordable neurons from the recording sites integrated on the probe and decreasing the signal quality. In the current work, we present we present a comparison of results obtained using mechanically fixed and floating silicon neural probes implanted into the cortex of a non-human primate. We demonstrate that the neural signal quality of the floating probe is initially superior to the fixed device. Nonetheless, the skull-fixed probe also allowed long-term recording of multi-unit activity and low frequency signals over several months, especially once pulsations of the brain were properly controlled.</content>

 The process through which neurons are labeled is a key methodological choice in measuring neuron morphology. However little is known about how this choice may bias measurements. To quantify this bias we compare the extracted morphology of neurons collected from the same rodent species, experimental condition, gender distribution, age distribution, brain region and putative cell type, but obtained with 19 distinct staining methods. We found strong biases on measured features of morphology. These were largest in features related to the coverage of the dendritic tree, e.g. the total dendritic tree length. Understanding measurement biases is crucial for interpreting morphological data.</content>

 Slow waves, the EEG hallmark of deep sleep, can be systematically manipulated by acoustic stimulation: Stimulation time-locked to the down phase of slow waves reduces, whereas stimulation time-locked to the up phase increases slow waves. Spike-waves during sleep seem to be related to slow waves, raising the question whether spike-waves can be systematically influenced by such acoustic stimulation. In 5 patients, all-night EEG was recorded, combined with real-time slow wave detection. Throughout the night, acoustic stimulation was performed in a 3 x 5-min-block design (no stimulation - stimulation - no stimulation). Tones were applied time-locked either to the up or to the down phase of the detected slow waves in an alternating pattern. All patients tolerated the acoustic stimulation during sleep well. They showed high sleep quality and no signs of clinical or non-convulsive electrographic seizures. Our preliminary analysis shows no systematic effect of acoustic stimulation on spike-wave activity. Moreover, with our stimulation approach tones were distributed over a rather broad phase-range during the DOWN or UP stimulation and showed inter-individual differences in their distribution. In this study we applied for the first time an acoustic closed-loop slow wave stimulation tool for a non-invasive manipulation of spike-wave activity. Thus, our pilot data shows that closed-loop acoustic stimulation is feasible and well tolerated in children with spike wave activity during sleep. Improved precision in phase targeting and personalized stimulation parameters in a larger sample of subjects might be needed to show systematic effects.</content>

 Language representation in the bilingual brain is the result of many factors, of which age of appropriation (AoA) and proficiency of the second language (L2) are probably the most studied. Many studies indeed compared early and late bilinguals, although it is not clear the role of the so-called critical period for L2 learning. In this study, we carried out coordinate-based meta-analysis to address this issue and to inspect the role of proficiency besides that of AoA. After the preliminary inspection of the early (also very early) and late bilinguals’ language networks, we explored the specific activations associated with each language and compared them within and between the groups. Results confirmed that the language network associated with L2 was wider than that associated with L1 irrespective to AoA, although differences were more relevant in the late bilinguals’ group. In particular, L2 entailed a greater enrollment of the brain areas devoted to executive functions, and this was observed also in proficient bilinguals.. Also the early bilinguals showed a wide language network and as well activated areas involved in cognitive control. Interestingly, these regions activated even in L1 of both early and late bilinguals groups, although less consistently. Overall, these findings suggest that bilinguals in general are constantly subjected to cognitive effort to monitor and regulate the language use, although early AoA and high proficiency are likely to reduce it.</content>

 Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, β-amyloid play a leading role in the pathogenesis of AD. TFEB, a main regulating factor of autophagy and lysosome biosynthesis, is involved in the pathogenesis of AD by regulating autophagy-lysosomal pathways. To date, the choice of anesthetics during surgery in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and evaluation of the effects and underlying mechanisms in these patients have rarely been reported. In this study, the HEK293-APP cells overexpressing APP and Hela cells were used. The cells were treated with midazolam at different concentrations and different times, then lysosomes were stained by lysotracker and their morphology were observed under a fluorescence microscope. The number and size of lysosomes were analyzed using the imagj j software. The levels of TFEB in the nucleus and APP-cleaved proteins intracellular were detected by nuclear separation and Western Blot. Finally, ELISA was used to detect the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the cells after drug treatment. We found that 30μM midazolam decreased the number of lysosomes and increased its size in HEK293 and HeLa cells. However, 15μM midazolam transiently disturbed lysosomal homeostasis at 24h and recovered it at 36h. Notably, there was no significant difference in the extent to which lysosomal homeostasis was disturbed between treatments of different concentrations of midazolam at 24 hours. In addition, 30 μM midazolam prevents the transport of TFEB to the nucleus in either normal or starved cells. Finally, the intracellular CTFβ, CTFα, Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were all significantly elevated in 30μM midazolam-treated HKE293-APP cells. Collectively, the inhibition of TFEB transport to nucleus may be involved in midazolam-disturbed lysosomal homeostasis and its induced β-amyloid accumulation in vitro. The results indicated the risk of accelerating the pathogenesis of AD by midazolam and suggested that TFEB might be a candidate target for reduction of midazolam-dependent neurotoxicity.</content>

 The sole output of the retina to the brain is a signal that results from the integration of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs at the level of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs) are found throughout the central nervous system where they modulate synaptic excitability. Cannabinoid receptors and their ligands have been localized to most retinal neurons in mammals, yet their impact on retinal processing is not well known. Here, we set out to investigate the role of the cannabinoid system in retinal signalling using electrophysiological recordings from ON sustained (ON-S) RGCs that displayed morphological and physiological signatures of ON alpha RGCs in dark adapted mouse retina. We studied the effect of the cannabinoid agonist WIN55212-2 and the inverse agonist AM251 on the spatial tuning of ON-S RGCs. WIN55212-2 significantly reduced their spontaneous spiking activity and responses to optimal spot size as well as altered their spatial tuning by reducing light driven excitatory and inhibitory inputs to RGCs. AM251 produced the opposite effect, increasing spontaneous spiking activity and peak response as well as increasing inhibitory and excitatory inputs. In addition, AM251 sharpened the spatial tuning of ON-S RGCs by increasing the inhibitory effect of the surround. These results demonstrate the presence of a functional cannabinergic system in the retina as well as sensitivity of ON-RGCs to cannabinoids. These results reveal a neuromodulatory system that can regulate the sensitivity and excitability of retinal synapses in a dynamic, activity dependent manner and that endocannabinoids may play a significant role in retinal processing.</content>

 The striatum is predominantly composed of medium spiny projection neurons, with the remaining neurons consisting of several types of interneurons. Among the interneurons are a group of cells that express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Although the intrinsic electrical properties of these TH-expressing interneurons have been characterized, there is no agreement on the number of TH-expressing cell types and their electrical properties. Here we have used transgenic mice in which YFP-tagged channelrhodopsin-2 was expressed in putative TH-expressing cells in a Cre-dependent manner. We found that the YFP+ neurons in the striatum were heterogeneous in their intrinsic electrical properties; unbiased clustering indicated that there are three main neuronal subtypes. One population of neurons had aspiny dendrites with high-frequency action potential firing and plateau potentials, resembling the TH interneurons (THIN) described previously. A second, very small population of labelled neurons resembled MSN. The third population of neurons had dendrites with an intermediated density of spines, showed substantial action potential adaptation and generated prolonged spikes. This type of striatal neuron has not been previously identified in the adult mouse and we have named them Frequency-Adapting Neurons with Spines (FANS). Because of their distinctive properties, FANS may play a unique role in striatal information processing.</content>

 Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are multipotential stem cells considered to have immense clinical value for revascularization. However, the clinical application of EPCs has been hampered by their clinical potency in ischemic anoxic environments. This study aimed to explore the effect of microRNA-210 (miR-210) on EPCs under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. We generated a model of EPCs cultured under OGD conditions to simulate ischemia and explore the expression of miR-210 in vitro. With longer exposure to hypoxia, we found that miR-210-3p expression was highly upregulated in OGD groups compared to that in controls from 4 to 24 h,but not miR-210-5p. We then transfected a miR-210-3p mimic and inhibitor into EPCs, and after 24 h, we exposed them to OGD conditions for 4 h to simulate ischemia. We detected miR-210 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and tested the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of normal EPCs and OGD-treated EPCs by CCK-8, transwell chamber, and Matrigel assays, respectively. The direct targets of miR-210-3p were predicted using miRWalk. Compared to that in normal EPCs, higher miR-210-3p expression was found in OGD-treated EPCs (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, upregulation of miR-210-3p was found to promote proliferation, migration, and tube formation in EPCs under normal and OGD conditions (p &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas down-regulation inhibited these abilities in OGD-treated EPCs (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMA), a negative regulator of angiogenesis, was predicted to be a target of miR-210-3p. Accordingly, upregulation of miR-210-3p was found to inhibit its expression at the protein level in OGD-treated EPCs, whereas downregulation of miR-210-3p inhibited its expression (p&amp;lt;0.05). A dual-luciferase reporter system confirmed that RGMA is a direct target of miR-210-3p. MicroRNA-210-3p overexpression enhances the angiogenic properties of OGD-treated EPCs by inhibiting RGMA.</content>

 The amygdala, and more precisely its lateral nucleus, is thought to confer emotional valence to external stimuli by generating long-term plasticity changes at long-range projections to principal cells. Aversive experience has also been shown to modify pre- and post-synaptic markers in the amygdala, suggesting their possible role in the structural organization of adult amygdala networks.  Here, we focused on the maturation of cortical and thalamic long-term projections on principal neurons and interneurons in the lateral amygdala (LA) and on how it is affected by deletion of the presynaptic protein synapsin I. We firstly performed dual electrophysiological recordings of identified cells in juvenile and adult GAD67-GFP mice after independent stimulation of cortical and thalamic afferent systems. The results demonstrate that synaptic strengthening occurs during development at synapses projecting to LA principal neurons, but not interneurons.  As synaptic strengthening underlying fear conditioning depends on the presence and increasing expression of synapsin I, we successively tested if synapsin I contributes to synaptic strengthening during development. Interestingly, the physiological strengthening of cortical and thalamic synapses projecting to LA principal neurons was virtually abolished in synapsin I knockout mice, while no differences were observed in the excitatory projections to interneurons, suggesting that the synapse-specificity of synaptic strengthening by synapsin I is attributable to its neuronal target. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that the presence of synapsin I is restricted to excitatory contacts projecting to principal neurons in LA of adult mice. These results indicate that synapsin I is a key regulator of the maturation of synaptic connectivity in this brain region and that is expression is dependent on postsynaptic identity.</content>

 Tau protein aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles in the central nervous system contributes to the etiology of certain neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Though the mechanism of tau destabilization is not fully understood yet, tau protein has been found to be hyperphosphorylated in tau aggregates. To investigate this further, we developed a highly sensitive and specific mass spectrometry (MS) method using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to identify tau phosphorylation sites. This method enables us to compare the abundance of phosphorylation sites in tau proteins in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in humans with and without AD. 
We detected 29 distinct phosphorylated tau (p-tau) sites in full-length tau from soluble human brain lysate and 12 sites on truncated tau in CSF, mainly in the mid-domain. Brain soluble tau phosphorylation sites are localized on 3 domains including a proline rich mid-domain, the C-terminus, and a cluster on the N-terminal projection domain not previously characterized. Some phosphorylation sites increased in CSF, while others decreased compared to brain. Notably, phosphorylation on T205 and S208, recognized by AT8 antibody defining Braak stages of brain tau aggregation, were not detected in normal brain soluble tau but were found in the CSF. Comparison of the p-tau rates from the brain and the CSF indicated that the abundance of phosphorylated sites varied in a site-specific manner. CSF tau proteins from non-AD participants were significantly hyperphosphorylated on T111, T205, S208, T217 and T231. In AD CSF, hyperphosphorylation on these sites was exacerbated, and phosphorylation on T153 and T175 specifically were detected. This supports the hypothesis that tau hyperphosphorylation could be a physiological process amplified by AD pathology. Conversely, we found that S199 and S202 were hypophosphorylated in CSF and were not hyperphosphorylated in AD, demonstrating that phosphorylated tau isoforms could have different metabolisms depending on which sites are phosphorylated. 
These site-specific p-tau rates are independent from tau concentration and distinct from current CSF tau and p-tau assays measuring tau isoforms levels. Targeted MS multiplexing ability and high-througput capacity lets us envision the use of these new p-tau measurements as promising biomarkers for AD diagnosis and tracking therapeutic responses.</content>

 Playing video games is a prevalent leisure activity in current daily life, and studies have found that video game experience has positive effects in several cognitive domains. However, few studies have examined the effect of video game experience on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) among older adults. In the current study, we compared behavioral performance in the flanker task and ALFF activities of older adults, of whom fifteen were video game players (VGPs) and eighteen non-video game players (NVGPs). The results showed that VGPs outperformed NVGPs in the flanker task and that VGPs showed significantly increased ALFF relative to NVGPs in the left inferior occipital gyrus, left cerebellum and left lingual gyrus. Furthermore, the ALFF in the left inferior occipital gyrus and left lingual gyrus was positively correlated with cognitive performance as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination scores. These results revealed that playing video games might improve behavioral performance and change intrinsic brain activity in older adults. Future video game training studies in older adults are warranted to provide more evidence of the positive effects of video game experience on behavioral and brain function.</content>

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes the progressive deterioration of neural connections, disrupting structural connectivity (SC) networks within the brain. Graph-based analyses of SC networks have shown that topological properties can reveal the course of AD propagation. Different whole-brain parcellation schemes have been developed to define the nodes of these SC networks, although it remains unclear which scheme can best describe the AD-related deterioration of SC networks. In this study, four whole-brain parcellation schemes with different numbers of parcels were used to define SC network nodes. SC networks were constructed based on high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) tractography for a mixed cohort that includes 20 normal controls (NC), 20 early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 20 late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 20 AD patients, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Parcellation schemes investigated in this study include the OASIS-TRT-20 (62 regions), AAL (116 regions), HCP-MMP (180 regions), and Gordon-rsfMRI (333 regions), which have all been widely used for the construction of brain structural or functional connectivity networks. Topological characteristics of the SC networks, including the network strength, global efficiency, clustering coefficient, rich-club, characteristic path length, k-core, rich-club coefficient, and modularity, were fully investigated at the network level. Statistical analyses were performed on these metrics using Kruskal-Wallis tests to examine the group differences that were apparent at different stages of AD progression. Results suggest that the HCP-MMP scheme is the most robust and sensitive to AD progression, while the OASIS-TRT-20 scheme is sensitive to group differences in network strength, global efficiency, k-core, and rich-club coefficient at k-levels from 18 and 39. With the exception of the rich-club and modularity coefficients, AAL could not significantly identify group differences on other topological metrics. Further, the Gordon-rsfMRI atlas only significantly differentiates the groups on network strength, characteristic path length, k-core, and rich-club coefficient. Results show that the topological examination of SC networks with different parcellation schemes can provide important complementary AD-related information and thus contribute to a more accurate and earlier diagnosis of AD.</content>

 Background: Genetic factors have a well-known influence on Parkinson disease (PD) susceptibility, however, no previous studies have investigated the inﬂuence of SNCA mutations on the natural history of Parkinson’s disease using prospective follow-up study. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors of variation of SNCA on the prognosis symptoms of PD patients.
Methods: Fifty PD patients were recruited with 38 v-PSG confirmed PD+RBD patients, and the median follow-up period was 30 months. All patients underwent a comprehensive clinical evaluation at baseline and follow-up, and six SNPs of SNCA (rs356165, rs3857053, rs1045722, rs894278, rs356186, and rs356219) were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier plot analysis were used to assess the associations between the SNCA variation and the primary and secondary progression outcomes.
Results: Based on the clinical assessment, we found that hyposmia was substantially easier to aggravate. Regression analysis showed that patients with T allele of rs1045722 and G allele of rs356219 presented a 34% and 20% decreased risk of progression to the H-Y stage respectively (p=0.022; p=0.005). While for rs894278, G allele-patients showed a 47% decreased risk of olfactory dysfunction (p=0.029). Further subgroup analysis showed that PD+RBD patients with rs356219/G exhibited a 30% and 20% decreased risk of progression on the H-Y stage and MOCA score (p=0.038; p=0.045). 
Conclusions: Our results indicated that genetic variation in SNCA may contribute to variability natural progression of PD and could possibly be used as a prognostic marker.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The study of blood-based biomarkers has been lasted for a long time in AD, because it supports the concept that peripheral changes involve in AD pathology. But there is still unclear that how peripheral blood is involved in the temporal characteristic molecular mechanisms of AD from aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD and which cells are responsible for the molecular mechanisms. The main purpose of our study is to gain a systematic and comprehensive understanding of temporal characteristic networks of peripheral blood in AD using whole blood samples with 329 case-control samples including 104  control (CTL), 80 MCI who are susceptible to AD, and 145 AD by the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The module-trait relationships were constructed and validated in independent datasets GSE63061, GSE97760, GSE18309, GSE29378, GSE28146 and GSE29652. Our results indicate that the down-regulated of protein modification and ubiquitin degradation systems and the up-regulated of insulin resistance play a major role in MCI, while the up-regulated of inflammatory cascade dominates in AD, which is mainly mediated by monocytes, macrophages, and microglia. Although there are mixed activation of M1 and M2 macrophages in all stage of AD, the immune neutral state or M2 polarization may predominates in MCI, and M1 polarization may predominates in AD. Moreover, we found that TRPV2, NDUFV1, ATF4, LUC7L3 may mediate the pathological changes in MCI, while SIRPA, LAMP-2, NDUFB5, FPR2 may mediate the conversion from MCI-AD or the pathological changes in AD, which provide a basis for the treatment based on the peripheral blood system. In addition, we also found that the combined diagnosis based on a panel of genes from the red, blue, and brown modules have a moderate diagnostic effect on distinguishing MCI and AD from CTL, suggesting that those panels of genes may be used for detection of MCI and prediction of this conversion from MCI to AD. Our research emphasizes that pathological changes based on temporal characteristics of peripheral blood providing a theoretical basis for targeted peripheral treatment based on appropriate times and identified several panel of genes markers.</content>

Human microbiome research is rife with studies attempting to deduce microbial correlation networks from sequencing data. Standard correlation and/or network analyses may be misleading when taken as an indication of taxon interactions because “correlation is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish causation”; environmental filtering can lead to correlation between non-interacting taxa. Unfortunately, microbial ecologists have generally used correlation as a proxy for causality although there is a general consensus about what constitutes a causal relationship: causes both precede and predict effects. We apply one of the first causal models for detecting interactions in human microbiome samples. Specifically, we analyze a long duration, high resolution time series of the human microbiome to decipher the networks of correlation and causation of human-associated microbial genera. We show that correlation is not a good proxy for biological interaction; we observed a weak negative relationship between correlation and causality. Strong interspecific interactions are disproportionately positive, whereas almost all strong intraspecific interactions are negative. Interestingly, intraspecific interactions also appear to act at a short time-scale causing vast majority of the effects within 1–3 days. We report how different taxa are involved in causal relationships with others, and show that strong interspecific interactions are rarely conserved across two body sites whereas strong intraspecific interactions are much more conserved, ranging from 33% between the gut and right-hand to 70% between the two hands. Therefore, in the absence of guiding assumptions about ecological interactions, Granger causality and related techniques may be particularly helpful for understanding the driving factors governing microbiome composition and structure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K6AVJdHj6UU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control cellular signaling and responses. Many of these GPCRs are modulated by cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which have been shown to co-exist with saturated lipids in ordered membrane domains. However, the lipid compositions of such domains extracted from the brain cortex tissue of individuals suffering from GPCR-associated neurological disorders show drastically lowered levels of PUFAs. Here, using free energy techniques and multiscale simulations of numerous membrane proteins, we show that the presence of the PUFA DHA helps helical multi-pass proteins such as GPCRs partition into ordered membrane domains. The mechanism is based on hybrid lipids, whose PUFA chains coat the rough protein surface, while the saturated chains face the raft environment, thus minimizing perturbations therein. Our findings suggest that the reduction of GPCR partitioning to their native ordered environments due to PUFA depletion might affect the function of these receptors in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, where the membrane PUFA levels in the brain are decreased. We hope that this work inspires experimental studies on the connection between membrane PUFA levels and GPCR signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0m2M7u1HivE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

High-throughput drug screening has facilitated the discovery of drug combinations in cancer. Many existing studies adopted a full matrix design, aiming for the characterization of drug pair effects for cancer cells. However, the full matrix design may be suboptimal as it requires a drug pair to be combined at multiple concentrations in a full factorial manner. Furthermore, many of the computational tools assess only the synergy but not the sensitivity of drug combinations, which might lead to false positive discoveries. We proposed a novel cross design to enable a more cost-effective and simultaneous testing of drug combination sensitivity and synergy. We developed a drug combination sensitivity score (CSS) to determine the sensitivity of a drug pair, and showed that the CSS is highly reproducible between the replicates and thus supported its usage as a robust metric. We further showed that CSS can be predicted using machine learning approaches which determined the top pharmaco-features to cluster cancer cell lines based on their drug combination sensitivity profiles. To assess the degree of drug interactions using the cross design, we developed an S synergy score based on the difference between the drug combination and the single drug dose-response curves. We showed that the S score is able to detect true synergistic and antagonistic drug combinations at an accuracy level comparable to that using the full matrix design. Taken together, we showed that the cross design coupled with the CSS sensitivity and S synergy scoring methods may provide a robust and accurate characterization of both drug combination sensitivity and synergy levels, with minimal experimental materials required. Our experimental-computational approach could be utilized as an efficient pipeline for improving the discovery rate in high-throughput drug combination screening, particularly for primary patient samples which are difficult to obtain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/umAf3OS2eYk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation is critical for maintenance and modification of synapse strength. Specifically, NMDAR activation by spontaneous glutamate release has been shown to mediate some forms of synaptic plasticity as well as synaptic development. Interestingly, there is evidence that within individual synapses each release mode may be segregated such that postsynaptically there are distinct pools of responsive receptors. In order to examine potential regulators of NMDAR activation due to spontaneous glutamate release in cultured hippocampal neurons, we utilized GCaMP6f imaging at single synapses in concert with confocal and super-resolution imaging. Using these single spine approaches, we found that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry activated by spontaneous release tends to be carried by GluN2B-NMDARs. Additionally, the amount of NMDAR activation varies greatly both between synapses and within synapses, and is unrelated to spine and synapse size, but does correlate loosely with synapse distance from the soma. Despite the critical role of spontaneous activation of NMDARs in maintaining synaptic function, their activation seems to be controlled factors other than synapse size or synapse distance from the soma. It is most likely that NMDAR activation by spontaneous release influenced variability in subsynaptic receptor position, release site position, vesicle content, and channel properties. Therefore, spontaneous activation of NMDARs appears to be regulated distinctly from other receptor types, notably AMPARs, within individual synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the synaptic mechanisms of learning and memory is critically to the field of neuroscience and for human health. A key neurotransmitter receptor involved in learning is the NMDA receptor, and exploration of its regulation is vital. Here, we optimized optical tools to allow detailed characterization of NMDA receptor activity at single synapses, along with analysis of synaptic structural features. The amount of receptor activation is independent of synapse size, but weakly dependent on synapse position within the dendritic tree. Notably, we found that NMDA receptors activated following spontaneous neurotransmitter release tend be GluN2B-containing receptors. The unique mechanisms that regulate the number and positioning of these receptors within synapses will have important consequences for control of synaptic development and signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neural activity in the beta frequency range (13-30 Hz) is excessively synchronized in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Previous work using invasive intracranial recordings and non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has shown that correlations between beta phase and broad-band gamma amplitude (i.e., phase amplitude coupling) are elevated in PD, perhaps a reflection of this synchrony. Recently, it has also been shown, in invasive human recordings, that nonsinusoidal features of beta oscillation shape also characterize PD. Here we show that these features of beta waveform shape also distinguish PD patients on and off medication using non-invasive recordings in a dataset of 15 PD patients with resting scalp EEG. Specifically, beta oscillations over sensorimotor electrodes in PD patients off medication had greater sharpness asymmetry and steepness asymmetry than on medication (sign rank, p&amp;lt;0.02, corrected). We also showed that beta oscillations over sensorimotor cortex most often had a canonical shape, and that using this prototypical shape as an inclusion-criteria increased the effect size of our findings. Together our findings suggest that novel ways of measuring beta synchrony that incorporate waveform shape could improve detection of PD pathophysiology in non-invasive recordings. Moreover, they motivate the consideration of waveform shape in future EEG studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Diagnosis and long-term monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly assessed via clinical rating scales which are subjective and can be imprecise. An objective measure of PD would be extremely valuable, especially one that could be acquired non-invasively. Here we show, using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), that the nonsinusoidal shape of beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations over sensorimotor cortex distinguishes PD patients on and off medication and patients off medication from controls. This change in waveform shape may reflect hypersynchronous input, possibly originating from basal ganglia. Thus, waveform shape is a putative non-invasive electrophysiology biomarker of PD state with potential utility for assessing treatments, monitoring disease, or diagnosis. This signature can be detected with a safe, affordable, and available method (i.e. EEG).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitability in the vertebrate brain is governed by the coordinated activity of both ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. In the cerebellum, spontaneous action potential (AP) firing of inhibitory stellate cells (SCs) is variable, typically operating within the 5-30 Hz frequency range. AP frequency is shaped by the activity of somatodendritic A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and the inhibitory effect of GABAergic transmission. An added complication, however, is that whole-cell recording from SCs induces a time-dependent and sustained increase in membrane excitability making it difficult to define the full range of firing rates. Here, we show that whole-cell recording in cerebellar SCs of both male and female mice augments firing rates by reducing the membrane potential at which APs are initiated. AP threshold is lowered due to a hyperpolarizing shift in the gating behavior of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Whole-cell recording also elicits a hyperpolarizing shift in the gating behavior of A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels which contributes to increased firing rates. Hodgkin-Huxley modeling and pharmacological experiments reveal that gating shifts in A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel activity do not impact AP threshold, but rather promote channel inactivation which removes restraint on the upper limit of firing rates. Taken together, our work reveals an unappreciated impact of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that work in coordination with A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels to regulate the firing frequency of cerebellar SCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The cerebellum is a brain region that fulfills critical roles in motor function in adults as well as being linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in the developing brain. Significant attention has been directed towards understanding connectivity within the cerebellum and how its neuronal circuits are regulated. Stellate cells are inhibitory GABAergic interneurons that make-up neuronal circuits that control the output from the cerebral cortex by regulating the firing properties of Purkinje cells. The strength of GABAergic inhibition of Purkinje cells is governed by the excitability of stellate cells which fire action potentials at a wide range of frequencies. Our study reveals an unappreciated role of voltage-gated sodium channels that work in coordination with A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels to establish stellate cell firing rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25499?af=R"/>
		<id>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25499?af=R</id>
		<updated>2019-05-20T09:25:10+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested 2 hypotheses regarding age at onset within familial epilepsies: (1) family members with epilepsy tend to have similar ages at onset, independent of epilepsy syndrome; and (2) age at onset is younger in successive generations after controlling for sampling bias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical data collected by the Epi4K Consortium (303 multiplex families, 1,120 individuals). To test hypothesis 1, we used both linear mixed models commonly used for heritability analysis and Cox regression models with frailty terms to assess clustering of onset within families after controlling for other predictors. To test hypothesis 2, we used mixed effects models, pairwise analyses, and survival analysis to address sampling‐related bias that may mimic anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding hypothesis 1, age at seizure onset was significantly heritable (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) after adjusting for epilepsy type, sex, site, history of febrile seizure, and age at last observation. This finding remained significant after adjusting for epilepsy syndromes, and was robust across statistical methods in all families and in generalized families. Regarding hypothesis 2, the mean age at onset decreased in successive generations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). After adjusting for age at last observation, this effect was not significant in mixed effects models (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14), but remained significant in pairwise (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0003) and survival analyses (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age at seizure onset is an independent familial trait, and may have genetic determinants distinct from the determinants of particular epilepsy syndromes. Younger onsets in successive generations can be explained in part by sampling bias, but the presence of genetic anticipation cannot be excluded. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In the last several years, technological advances improving our ability to identify mRNA modifications, coupled with the discovery of proteins that add and remove these marks, have substantially expanded our knowledge of how the epitranscriptome shapes gene expression. Efforts to uncover functional roles for mRNA modifications have begun to reveal important roles for some marks within the nervous system, and animal models have emerged which demonstrate severe neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive abnormalities resulting from the loss of mRNA modification machinery. Here, we review the recent advances in the field of neuroepitranscriptomics, with a particular emphasis on how modifications to mRNAs within the brain contribute to synaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spasticity is one of the most common symptoms manifested in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). The neural mechanisms contributing to its development are not yet understood. Using neurophysiological and imaging techniques, we examined the influence of residual descending motor pathways on spasticity in humans with SCI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured spasticity in 33 individuals with motor complete SCI (determined by clinical exam) without preservation of voluntary motor output in the quadriceps femoris muscle. To examine residual descending motor pathways, we used magnetic and electrical stimulation over the leg motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the quadriceps femoris muscle and structural magnetic resonance imaging to measure spinal cord atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that 60% of participants showed symptoms of spasticity while the other 40% showed no spasticity, demonstrating the presence of two clear subgroups of humans with motor complete SCI. MEPs were only present in individuals who had spasticity and MEP size correlated with the severity of spasticity. Spinal cord atrophy was greater in non‐spastic compared with spastic subjects. Notably, the degree of spared tissue in the lateral regions of the spinal cord was positively correlated with the severity of spasticity, indicating preservation of white matter related to motor tracts when spasticity was present.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results support the hypothesis that preservation of descending motor pathways influence spasticity in humans with motor complete SCI; a knowledge that might help the rehabilitation and assessment of people with SCI.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To define a distinct, dominantly inherited, mild skeletal myopathy associated with prominent and consistent tremor in two unrelated, three‐generation families.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical evaluations as well as exome and panel sequencing analyses were performed in affected and nonaffected members of two families to identify genetic variants segregating with the phenotype. Histological assessment of a muscle biopsy specimen was performed in 1 patient, and quantitative tremor analysis was carried out in 2 patients. Molecular modeling studies and biochemical assays were performed for both mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two novel missense mutations in &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; (p.E248K in family 1 and p.Y247H in family 2) were identified and shown to segregate perfectly with the myopathy/tremor phenotype in the respective families. &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; encodes slow myosin binding protein‐C (sMyBP‐C), a modular sarcomeric protein playing structural and regulatory roles through its dynamic interaction with actin and myosin filaments. The Y247H and E248K mutations are located in the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐terminal M‐motif of sMyBP‐C. Both mutations result in markedly increased binding of the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; terminus to myosin, possibly interfering with normal cross‐bridge cycling as the first muscle‐based step in tremor genesis. The clinical tremor features observed in all mutation carriers, together with the tremor physiology studies performed in family 2, suggest amplification by an additional central loop modulating the clinical tremor phenomenology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we link two novel missense mutations in &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; with a dominant, mild skeletal myopathy invariably associated with a distinctive tremor. The molecular, genetic, and clinical studies are consistent with a unique sarcomeric origin of the tremor, which we classify as “myogenic tremor.” ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Functional brain networks self-assemble during development, although the molecular basis of network assembly is poorly understood. Protocadherin-19 (&lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt;) is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and influences multiple cellular and developmental events in zebrafish. Although loss of &lt;i&gt;PCDH19&lt;/i&gt; in humans and model organisms leads to functional deficits, the underlying network defects remain unknown. Here, we employ multiplane, resonant-scanning &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium imaging of developing zebrafish, and use graph theory to characterize the development of resting state functional networks in both wild-type and &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; mutant larvae. We find that the brain networks of &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; mutants display enhanced clustering and an altered developmental trajectory of network assembly. Our results show that functional imaging and network analysis in zebrafish larvae is an effective approach for characterizing the developmental impact of lesions in genes of clinical interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

These include gains or losses of activity-responsiveness of certain genes and differences in gene induction profiles. Here, we discuss a possible origin of dissimilarities in activity-regulated transcription between species. We highlight that while synapse-to-nucleus signalling pathways are evolutionarily conserved, &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-regulatory plasticity has been driving species-specific remodelling of the activity-controlled enhancer landscape, thereby affecting gene regulation. In particular, evolutionary rearrangements of transcription factor binding site placements together with potential species-dependent developmental stage- and/or cell type-specific epigenetic and other &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt;-acting mechanisms are most likely at least in part accountable for between-species diversity in activity-regulated transcription. It is conceivable that &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-regulatory plasticity may have equipped the synaptic activity-driven adaptive gene program in human neurons with unique, species-specific qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 Responses of neuronal populations play an important role in the encoding of stimulus related information. However, the inherent multidimensionality required to describe population activity has imposed significant challenges and has limited the applicability of classical spike train analysis techniques. Here, we show that these limitations can be overcome. We first quantify the collective activity of neurons as multidimensional vectors (patterns). Then we characterize the behavior of these patterns by applying classical spike train analysis techniques: peri-stimulus time histograms, tuning curves and auto- and cross- correlation histograms. We find that patterns can exhibit a broad spectrum of properties, some ressembling and others substantially differing from those of their component neurons. We show that in some cases pattern behavior cannot be intuitively inferred from the activity of component neurons. Importantly, silent neurons play a critical role in shaping pattern expression. By correlating pattern timing with local-field potentials, we show that the method can reveal fine temporal coordination of cortical circuits at the mesoscale. Because of its simplicity and reliance on well understood classical analysis methods the proposed approach is valuable for the study of neuronal population dynamics.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In order to assess possible influences of occlusion on motor performance, we studied by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the changes in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal induced at brain level by a finger to thumb motor task in a population of subjects characterized by an asymmetric activation of jaw muscles during clenching (malocclusion). In these subjects, appropriate occlusal correction by an oral orthotic (bite) reduced the masticatory asymmetry. The finger to thumb task was performed while the subject’s dental arches were touching, in two conditions: a) with the teeth in direct contact (Bite OFF) and b) with the bite interposed between the arches (Bite ON). Both conditions required only a very slight activation of masticatory muscles. Maps of the BOLD signal recorded during the movement were contrasted with the resting condition (activation maps). Areas of increased BOLD signal in the activation maps were observed bilaterally, being larger in Bite OFF than Bite ON. These areas included the sensorimotor cortex, the supplementary-premotor cortex, the cerebellum and the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area). Between conditions comparison of the activation maps (Bite OFF/Bite ON) showed that, in Bite OFF, the BOLD signal was significantly higher at the level of the trigeminal sensorimotor region, the premotor cortex, the cerebellum, the parietal, temporal, occipital and limbic regions (bilaterally) as well as within the left Broca’s area. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that malocclusion makes movement performance more difficult, requiring a stronger activation of the Broca’s area, which participate in planning of the motor sequence, and of the cerebellum, which is essential in motor coordination. Moreover, malocclusion leads to a higher spread of activation in motor regions not directly involved in the control of the moving body parts and generates an higher engagement of regions involved in visuo-spatial and temporal processing, as well as in the control of cognitive activities and alertness levels.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive degeneration of the visual cells and abnormalities in retinal pigment epithelium, the vision is lost slowly and the final outcome is total blindness. The primary mutation responsible for RP is in rod but subsequently cone photoreceptors are also affected. The main modality of photoreceptor cell death is activation of apoptosis pathway but the biological mechanism linking the primary degeneration of rod to the secondary death of cone is still poorly understood. Possible causes of the secondary cone death are oxidative stress and/ or release of toxic factors from dying rods. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of nutraceutical molecules with antioxidant properties on the progression of the disease in an established animal model of RP, rd10 mice. We show that chronic treatment per os with a flavanone (naringenin) or a flavonol (quercetin) present in citrus fruits, grapes and apples, preserves retinal morphology and ameliorate functionality. These actions are associated with a significant reduction of stress-oxidative markers, such as the detoxifying enzymes Sod1 and Sod2. In addition, naringenin and quercetin treatment reduces the levels of acrolein staining associated with a reduction of ROS in the cellular environment. The study demonstrates the beneficial effects of naringenin and quercetin, two molecules that possess antioxidant properties, limiting neurodegeneration and thus preventing cone damage.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objectives: The utility of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) as index of cortical plasticity is limited by inadequate characterization of its test-retest reliability. Thus, we evaluated the reliability of cTBS aftereffects, and explored the roles of age, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms.

Methods: 28 healthy adults (age range 21–65) underwent two identical cTBS sessions (median interval = 9.5 days) targeting the motor cortex. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the log-transformed, baseline-corrected amplitude of motor evoked potentials (ΔMEP) at 5–60 minutes post-cTBS (T5–T60) were calculated. 

Results: ΔMEP at T50 was the most-reliable cTBS measure in the whole sample (ICC = 0.53). Area under-the-curve (AUC) of ΔMEPs was most reliable when calculated over the full 60 minutes post-cTBS (ICC = 0.40). cTBS measures were substantially more reliable in younger participants (&amp;lt; 35 yr) and those with BDNF Val66Val and APOE ε4– genotypes.

Conclusions: cTBS aftereffects are most reliable when assessed 50 minutes post-cTBS, or when cumulative ΔMEP measures are calculated over 30–60 minutes post-cTBS. Reliability of cTBS aftereffects is influenced by age, and BDNF and APOE polymorphisms. Reliability coefficients are used to adjust effect-size calculations for interpretation and planning of cTBS studies.</content>

 Cerebral micro-bleedings (CMBs) as a type of small chronic brain bleeding could have many side effects to patients who suffer from it, such as inducing stroke, loss of brain functions or side effects from other medications and treatment. Therefore, it is important and essential to detect CMBs timely and better to be in an early stage for prompt treatment. In this research, we proposed employing DenseNet 201 as the basic method, and transfer learning for CMBs detection. In order to generate the samples for training, we used sliding window to cover the whole image from left to right and from up to bottom, and based on the central pixel, we can decide target value. Considering the data imbalance, the cost matrix was used in this research. Then, based on the new model, we tested the classification accuracy, and it achieved 97.71%, which provides better performance than the state of art methods.</content>

MHC genes, which code for proteins responsible for presenting pathogen-derived antigens to the host immune system, show remarkable copy-number variation both between and within species. However, the evolutionary forces driving this variation are poorly understood. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate whether evolution of the number of MHC variants in the genome can be shaped by the number of pathogen species the host population encounters (pathogen richness). Our model assumed that while increasing a range of pathogens recognised, expressing additional MHC variants also incurs costs such as an increased risk of autoimmunity. We found that pathogen richness selected for high MHC copy number only when the costs were low. Furthermore, the shape of the association was modified by the rate of pathogen evolution, with faster pathogen mutation rates selecting for increased host MHC copy number, but only when pathogen richness was low to moderate. Thus, taking into account factors other than pathogen richness may help explain wide variation between vertebrate species in the number of MHC genes. Within population, variation in the number of unique MHC variants carried by individuals (INV) was observed under most parameter combinations, except at low pathogen richness. This variance gave rise to positive correlations between INV and host immunocompetence (proportion of pathogens recognised). However, within-population variation in host immunocompetence declined with pathogen richness. Thus, counterintuitively, pathogens can contribute more to genetic variance for host fitness in species exposed to fewer pathogen species, with consequences to predictions from “Hamilton-Zuk” theory of sexual selection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WrYdAi7ec8M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

GABAergic interneurons play an important role in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs). How the various inhibitory cell types contribute to neuronal information processing, however, is not resolved. Here, we propose a functional role for a widespread network motif consisting of parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. Following the idea that PV and SOM interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, we suggest that mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM cells translates weak inputs to VIP interneurons into large changes of somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, we show that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cHeR4X37sog&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;External thermosensation is crucial to regulate animal behavior and homeostasis, but the development of the mammalian thermosensory system is not well known. We investigated if temperature could play a role in the control of movements in a mammalian model born very immature, the opossum (&lt;i&gt;Monodelphis domestica&lt;/i&gt;). Like other marsupials, at birth the opossum performs alternate and rhythmic movements with its forelimbs to reach a teat where it attaches in order to continue its development. It was shown that forelimb movements can be induced by mechanical stimulation of the snout in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; preparations of newborns consisting of the neuraxis with skin and forelimbs intact. In the present study, we used puff ejections of cold, neutral (bath temperature) and hot liquid directed towards the snout to induce forelimb responses in such preparations. Either the responses were visually observed under a microscope or triceps muscle activity was recorded. Cold liquid systematically induced forelimb movements and triceps contractions, but neutral and hot temperatures were less potent to do so. Sections of the trigeminal nerves and removal of the facial skin diminished responses to cold and nearly abolished those to hot and neutral stimulations. TRPM8 being the major cold receptor cation channel in adult mammals, we employed immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR to test for its expression, but found that it is not expressed before 13 postnatal days. Overall our results indicate that cold thermosensation exerts a strong influence on motor behaviors in newborn opossums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; External thermosensation is crucial for survival, but its development in mammals is not well understood, particularly at the systemic level. Herein, we tested if temperature perceived by the face influences motor behaviors in newborn opossums, a marsupial with a gestation period one week shorter than rodents of comparable size, thus offering access to early developmental stages. We found that cold temperatures systematically induced forelimb motor responses, but neutral and hot temperatures rarely did so. Moreover, in newborn opossums, cold thermosensation does not involve the major cold receptor in adult mammals, TRPM8. Cold avoidance may be important to sustain motor behaviors of newborn marsupials, when they must find a teat and attach to it in order to pursue their development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The striatum is a key hub in the basal ganglia for processing neural information from the sensory, motor and limbic cortices. The massive and diverse cortical inputs entering the striatum allow the basal ganglia to perform a repertoire of neurological functions ranging from basic level of motor control to high level of cognition. The heterogeneity of the corticostriatal circuits, however, also renders the system susceptible to a repertoire of neurological diseases. Clinical and animal model studies have indicated that defective development of the corticostriatal circuits is linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Importantly, many neuropsychiatric disease-risk genes have been found to form the molecular building blocks of the circuit wiring at the synaptic level. It is therefore imperative to understand how corticostriatal connectivity is established during development. Here, we review the construction during development of these corticostriatal circuits at the synaptic level, which should provide important insights into the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders related to the basal ganglia and help the development of appropriate therapies for these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cortico-basal ganglia circuits control a range of neurobiological functions, ranging from motor control and reward to cognition. The functional diversity of cortico-basal ganglia circuits rests on their diverse inputs from the cerebral cortex. It is likely that the highly heterogeneous nature of corticostriatal inputs makes the corticostriatal circuits vulnerable to a broad range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here, we highlight the developmental progression and maturation of the morphology and physiology of corticostriatal pathways using neonatal and postnatal rodent brains. We also review the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental disorders that are related to dysfunctions of corticostriatal circuits. Exploring synaptic wiring of corticostriatal circuits should create a research window for the development of therapeutic approaches for treating basal ganglia-related neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reward-related behavior is complex and its dysfunction correlated with neuropsychiatric illness. Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have long been associated with different aspects of reward function, but it remains to be disentangled how distinct VTA dopamine neurons contribute to the full range of behaviors ascribed to the VTA. Here, a recently identified subtype of VTA neurons molecularly defined by NeuroD6 (NEX1M) was addressed. Among all VTA dopamine neurons, less than 15% were identified as positive for NeuroD6. In addition to dopaminergic markers, sparse NeuroD6 neurons expressed the &lt;i&gt;Vesicular glutamate transporter 2&lt;/i&gt; gene. To achieve manipulation of NeuroD6 VTA neurons, NeuroD6(NEX)-Cre-driven mouse genetics and optogenetics were implemented. First, expression of &lt;i&gt;Vesicular monoamine transporter 2&lt;/i&gt; was ablated to disrupt dopaminergic function in NeuroD6 VTA neurons. Comparing &lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;sup&gt;lox/lox;NEX-Cre&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockout (cKO) mice with littermate controls, it was evident that baseline locomotion, preference for sugar and ethanol, and place preference upon amphetamine- and cocaine-induced conditioning were similar between genotypes. However, locomotion upon repeated psychostimulant administration was significantly elevated above control level in cKO mice. Second, optogenetic activation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons was shown to induce dopamine release and glutamatergic post-synaptic currents within the nucleus accumbens. Third, optogenetic stimulation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; induced significant place preference behavior, while stimulation of VTA neurons defined by Calretinin failed to cause a similar response. The results show that NeuroD6 VTA neurons exert distinct regulation over specific aspects of reward-related behavior, findings that contribute to the current understanding of VTA neurocircuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Reward-related behavior is complex and its dysfunction is implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders, including drug addiction. Midbrain dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are crucial for reward behavior, but due to recently uncovered heterogeneity, it remains to be fully resolved how they regulate reward responsiveness and how their dysfunction might contribute to disease. Here we show that the recently described NeuroD6 (NEX) subtype of VTA dopamine neurons is involved in psychostimulant sensitization and that optogenetic stimulation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons induces dopamine release, glutamatergic post-synaptic currents and real time place preference behavior. NeuroD6 VTA neurons thus exert distinct regulation over specific aspects of reward-related behavior, findings that contribute to the current understanding of VTA neurocircuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Although we know a great deal about monosynaptic connectivity, transmission and integration in the mammalian nervous system from in vitro studies, very little is known in vivo. This is partly because it is technically difficult to evoke action potentials and simultaneously record small amplitude subthreshold responses in closely (&amp;lt; 150 µm) located pairs of neurons. To address this, we have developed in vivo two-photon targeted multiple (2 – 4) whole-cell patch clamp recordings of nearby neurons in superficial cortical layers 1 to 3. Here we describe a step-by-step guide to this approach in the anesthetised mouse primary somatosensory cortex, including: the design of the setup, surgery, preparation of pipettes, targeting and acquisition of multiple whole-cell recordings, as well as in vivo and post-hoc histology. The procedure takes ~ 4 hours from start of surgery to end of recording and allows examinations both into the electrophysiological features of unitary excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic inputs during different brain states as well as the synaptic mechanisms of correlated neuronal activity.</content>

 Background: Syndecan-1 is an important component of endothelial cell glycocalyx, and has been reported to be a negative regulator of various inflammatory processes. The clinical implication of circulating and CSF syndecan-1 (sCD138) in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis remains unclear.
Objective: We aimed to investigate the association of serum and CSF syndecan-1 levels in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients.
Methods: A total of 27 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, 11 viral meningoencephalitis and 22 controls were enrolled in this study. At the time of admission and 3-6-month follow-up, all patients, were measured sCD138, TNF-α, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in serum and CSF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
Results: Serum and CSF levels of sCD138 were significantly increased in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Furthermore, at 3-6 months follow-up, CSF levels of sCD138 were significantly decreased in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients. Changes of sCD138 levels also significantly correlated to ameliorate of mRS scores in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
Conclusions: In anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients, high circulating and CSF sCD138 is associated with inflammation and poor clinical prognosis. In this study, we present data supporting the sCD138 as a new biomarker for inflammation of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.</content>

 Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor neurons, primarily in young children. SMA is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMN functions in the assembly of spliceosomal RNPs and is well conserved in many model systems including mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, and fission yeast. Work in Drosophila has primarily focused on loss of SMN function during larval stages, primarily using null alleles or strong hypomorphs. A systematic analysis of SMA-related phenotypes in the context of moderate alleles that more closely mimic the genetics of SMA has not been performed in the fly, leading to debate over the validity and translational value of this model. We therefore examined fourteen Drosophila lines expressing SMA patient-derived missense mutations in Smn, with a focus on neuromuscular phenotypes in the adult stage. Animals were evaluated on the basis of organismal viability and longevity, locomotor function, neuromuscular junction structure, and muscle health. In all cases, we observed phenotypes similar to those of SMA patients, including progressive loss of adult motor function. The severity of these defects is variable, and forms a broad spectrum across the fourteen lines examined, recapitulating the full range of phenotypic severity observed in human SMA. This includes late-onset models of SMA, which have been difficult to produce in other model systems. The results provide direct evidence that SMA-related locomotor decline can be reproduced in the fly and support the use of patient-derived SMN missense mutations as a comprehensive system for modeling SMA.</content>

 Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is a focal neurodegenerative disease with a strong genetic background, that causes early onset dementia. The present knowledge about the risk loci and causative mutations of FTD mainly derives from genetic linkage analysis, studies of candidate genes, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) applications. In this review we report recent insights into the genetics of FTD, and, specifically, the results achieved thanks to GWAS and NGS approaches. Linkage studies of large FTD pedigrees have prompted the identification of causal mutations in different genes: mutations in C9orf72, MAPT and GRN genes explain the large majority of cases with a high family history of the disease. In cases with a less clear inheritance, GWAS and NGS have contributed to further understand the genetic picture of FTD. GWAS identified several common genetic variants with a modest risk effect. Of interest, many of these variants are in genes belonging to the endo-lysosomal pathway, the immune response and neuronal survival. On the opposite, the NGS approach allowed the identification of rare variants with a strong risk effect. These variants were identified in known FTD-associated genes and again in genes, involved in the endo-lysosomal pathway and in the immune response. Interestingly, both approaches demonstrated that several genes are associated to multiple neurodegenerative disorders including FTD. Thanks to these complementary approaches, the genetic picture of FTD is becoming more clear and novel key molecular processes are emerging. This will foster opportunities to move toward prevention and therapy for this incurable disease.</content>

 Embelin is well known in ethnomedicine and reported to have central nervous system activities. However, there is no report on blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of embelin. Here the BBB permeability of embelin was evaluated using in vitro primary porcine brain endothelial cell (PBEC) model of the BBB. Embelin was also evaluated for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and docking prediction for interaction with AChE and amyloid beta (Aβ) binding sites. Embelin was found to be non-toxic to the PBECs and did not disturb the PBEC barrier function. The PBECs showed restrictive tight junctions with average transendothelial electrical resistance of 365.37 ± 113.00 Ω.cm2, for monolayers used for permeability assays. Permeability assays were conducted from apical-to-basolateral direction (blood-to-brain side). Embelin showed apparent permeability (Papp) value of 35.46 + 20.33 × 10-6 cm/s with 85.53% recovery. In vitro AChE inhibitory assay demonstrated that embelin could inhibit the enzyme. Molecular docking study showed that embelin binds well to active site of AChE with CDOCKER interaction energy of -65.75 kcal/mol which correlates with the in vitro results. Docking of embelin with Aβ peptides also revealed the promising binding with low CDOCKER interaction energy. Thus, findings from this study indicate that embelin could be a suitable molecule to be further developed as therapeutic molecule to treat neurological disorders particularly Alzheimer's disease.</content>

 S100 proteins are calcium-binding proteins that regulate several processes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but whose contribution and direct involvement in disease pathophysiology remains to be fully established. Due to neuroinflammation in AD patients, the levels of several S100 proteins are increased in the brain and some S100s play roles related to the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), regulation of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) levels and Tau phosphorylation. S100 proteins are found associated with protein inclusions, either within plaques or as isolated S100-positive puncta, which suggests an active role in the formation of amyloid aggregates. Indeed, interactions between S100 proteins and aggregating Aβ indicate regulatory roles over the aggregation process, which may either delay or aggravate aggregation, depending on disease stage and relative S100 and Aβ levels. Additionally, S100s are also known to influence AD-related signaling pathways and levels of other cytokines. Recent evidence also suggests that metal-ligation by S100 proteins influences trace metal homeostasis in the brain, particularly of zinc, which is also a major deregulated process in AD. Altogether, this evidence strongly suggests a role of S100 proteins as key players in several AD-linked physiopathological processes, which we discuss in this review.</content>

 IMPORTANCE Accumulating evidence suggests that serum levels of S100B may play a role in epilepsy.
OBJECTIVE We performed a meta-analysis to quantitatively summarize the serum S100B data available for patients with epilepsy. 
DATA SOURCE Two independent researchers conducted a systematic s investigation of Harvard Hollis+, Open Grey, Clinicaltrials, Wanfangdata and CNKI databases through February 8, 2018, for all studies published in English and Chinese. The search terms included S100B, Calcium-binding protein B in combination with Epilepsy. 
STUDY SELECTION Original studies and reported data from these search terms are included. Studies that data were overlapped with other studies were excluded. 
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Investigators extracted, pooled and analysed data from the included studies using a Fixed-effects model in the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis3.3 and R software. 
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Peripheral blood levels of S100B in patients with epilepsy compared with controls. Aberrations in Peripheral blood levels of S100B were hypothesized to be related to epilepsy.
RESULTS A fixed -effects meta-analysis of all 18 studies, including 1057 unique participants, indicated that patients with Epilepsy had significantly increased peripheral blood levels of S100B compared to controls (Hedges g = 1.568, 95% CI =1.431-1.706, P 0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed that no single study significantly influenced the overall association of peripheral blood levels of S100B and the Epilepsy. Most of the subgroup analyses, including those of Country, assay type and publication language, demonstrated a statistically significant association between peripheral blood levels of S100B and the Epilepsy. Meta-regression analyses indicated that suggesting that more Gender and  Mean age might present serum S100B reductions, but samples size, years, assay type, publication language and country did not show moderating effects on the effect sizes. Furthermore, the trim-and-fill method used to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry in our meta-analysis confirmed that a positive outcome is unlikely to be due to publication bias.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The results of this meta-analysis provide evidence for a significant increase in serum S100B levels in patients with Epilepsy. Serum S100B is the most worthwhile biomarker of Epilepsy, which is helpful for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of epilepsy.</content>

 Much evidence suggests a protective role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and its major apolipoprotein apoA-I, in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biogenesis of nascent HDL derived from a first lipidation of apoA-I, which is synthesized by the liver and intestine but not in the brain, in a process mediated by ABCA1. The maturation of nascent HDL in mature spherical HDL is due to a subsequent lipidation step, LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification and the change of apoA-I conformation. Therefore, different subclasses of apoA-I-HDL simultaneously exist in the blood circulation. Here, we investigated if and how the lipidation state affects the ability of apoA-I-HDL to target and modulate the cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) content from the periphery, that is thus far unclear. In particular, different subclasses of HDL, each with different apoA-I lipidation state, were purified from human plasma and their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), to interact with Abeta aggregates, and to affect Abeta efflux across the BBB was assessed in vitro using a transwell system. The results showed that discoidal HDL displayed a superior capability to promote Abeta efflux in vitro (9 x 10-5 cm/min), when compared to apoA-I in other lipidation states. In particular, no effect on Abeta efflux was detected when apoA-I was in mature spherical HDL, suggesting that apoA-I conformation and lipidation could play a role in Abeta clearance from the brain. Finally, when apoA-I folded its structure in discoidal HDL, rather than in spherical ones, it was able to cross the BBB in vitro and strongly destabilize the conformation of Aβ fibrils by decreasing the order of the fibril structure (-24%) and the beta-sheet content (-14%).
These data suggest that the extent of apoA-I lipidation, and consequently its conformation, may represent crucial features that could exert their protective role in AD pathogenesis.</content>

 For adults age 65 and older, the brain shows acute functional connectivity decreases after total knee arthroplasty with the severity of change predicted by preoperative cognitive function and brain disease burden. The extent of acute structural microstructural brain changes acutely after surgery remains unknown within the literature. For the current study, we report on the severity of acute post-surgery microstructural brain changes as measured by diffusion imaging and free-water analysis. Participants who underwent total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia and non-surgery peers were part of a federally funded prospective cohort investigation involving participants. Recruitment occurred between 2013 – 2017. Data were collected in outpatient and inpatient settings within a university-affiliated medical center. A total of 232 TKA patients were referred by the study surgeon and contacted for study inclusion. Of these, 78 met inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed assessment. Five participants were excluded due to anesthetic protocol changes (spinal instead of general) with an additional 12 excluded for imaging-related complications. The total included sample size was 61. A total of 127 non-surgery participants were screened with 66 enrolled. One non-surgery participant was excluded for an imaging-related complication. Total knee arthroplasty and general anesthetic protocols were standardized. Participants received preoperative neurocognitive assessment and brain magnetic resonance imaging, with repeat imaging 48 hours after surgery or pseudosurgery. Free-water analyses were performed using diffusion weighted images and tract-based spatial statistics with baseline cognitive data used to predict free-water changes. Surgery participants had widespread increases in white matter free-water. Surgery participants with higher cognitive functions as measured by immediate memory and less evidence of brain atrophy and disease (i.e., brain integrity) had greater free-water increase. Non-surgery peers had no free-water change. We interpret the surgery group’s free-water change as indicating widespread brain white matter glial response, with greater change indicative of better brain response to the acute surgery/anesthesia experience.</content>

 Decline in information processing with age is well-documented in the scientific literature. However, some discrepancy remains in relation to which cognitive domains are most susceptible to the aging process and which may remain intact. Furthermore, information processing has not been investigated nor considered as a function of affect, familiarity and complexity of tasks in a single experimental study. Thus, the current study investigated rate of visual information processing in 67 young university students (Mage=19.64 years) and 33 educated healthy older adults (Mage=70.33 years), while accounting for depression, anxiety and stress symptoms using the DASS. Rates of visual processing were measured as minimum time of stimulus exposure duration required for correct object recognition on a simple visual task (Inspection Time [IT]), and on a more complex visual cognitive task known as Change Detection [CD]) as well as words per minute on a text reading task (FastaReada). Results demonstrated significantly slower performance by older adults on the IT and CD, but comparable rates of text reading on a semantically more complex, but ecologically valid and familiar visual task that requires organized sequential shifts in attention via eye movements, continuous visual processing, access to working memory and semantic comprehension. The results also demonstrated that affective influences did not play a role in the older adults task performance, and that changes in cognitive domains may begin with older adults being slower to attend to and identify newly appearing familiar objects, as well as slower to encode and embed new information in memory during tasks that require a less practiced/familiar task strategy.</content>

 Gestational infection causes various neurological deficits in offspring, such as age-related spatial learning and memory (SLM) decline. How inflammation causes age-related SLM dysfunction remains unknown. Previous research has indicated that histone modifications, such as phosphorylation of H3S10 (H3S10p) and trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3) may be involved. In our study, pregnant mice received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 or 25 μg/kg) or normal saline during gestational days 15–17. After normal parturition, the offspring were randomly separated into 1-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 22-month-old groups. SLM performance was assessed using a radial six-arm water maze. The hippocampal levels of H3S10p and H3K9me3 were detected using an immunohistochemical method. The results indicated that the offspring had significantly impaired SLM, with decreased H3S10p and increased H3K9me3 levels from 12 months onward. Maternal LPS exposure during late gestation significantly and dose-dependently exacerbated the age-related impairment of SLM, with the decrease in H3S10p and increase in H3K9me3 beginning at 12 months in the offspring. The histone modifications (H3S10p and H3K9me3) were significantly correlated with impairment of SLM. Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to inflammation could exacerbate age-related impairments of SLM and changes in histone modifications in CD-1 mice from 12 months onward, and SLM impairment might be linked to decreased H3S10p and increased H3K9me3.</content>

 Recent studies have shown that neurologic inflammation may both precipitate and sustain seizures, suggesting that inflammation may be involved not only in epileptogenesis but also in the development of the drug-resistant profile. Extensive literature data, during these last years, have identified a number of inflammatory markers involved in these processes of &quot;neuroimmunoinflammation&quot; in epilepsy, underlying a key role for other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as: IL-6, IL-17 and IL-17 Receptor (IL-17R) axis, Tumor-Necrosis-Factor Alpha (TNF-α) and Transforming-Growth-Factor Beta (TGF-β), all responsible for the induction of processes of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammation of the Central Nervous System (CNS) itself. Nevertheless, many of these inflammatory biomarkers have been also implicated in other neurologic pathologies, and future perspectives have to address the disease-individuality in order to identify panels of biomarkers that discriminate epilepsies from other diseases and among different epileptic semiology. 
In this context, markers of blood-brain barrier integrity and disruption are useful tools to determine the sequelae in a variety of neurologic diseases, but how these markers may predict the prognosis and the diagnosis of epileptic disorders is being currently investigated. 
Herein authors present a review of extensive literature data on the involvement of both systemic and neuronal immune system in the early onset of epileptic encephalopathy.</content>

 When faced with a novel object, we explore it to understand its shape. This way we combine information coming from different senses, as touch, proprioception and vision, together with the motor information embedded in our motor execution plan. The exploration process provides a structure and constrains this rich flow of inputs, supporting the formation of a unified percept and the memorization of the object features. However, how the exploration strategies are planned is still an open question. In particular, is the exploration strategy used to memorize an object different from the exploration strategy adopted in a recall task? To address this question we used iCube, a sensorized cube which measures its orientation in space and the location of the contacts on its faces. Participants were required to explore the cube faces where little pins were positioned in varying number. Participants had to explore the cube twice and individuate potential differences between the two presentations, which could be performed either haptically alone, or with also vision available. The haptic and visuo-haptic exploratory strategies changed significantly when finalized to memorize the structure of the object with respect to when the same object was explored to recall and compare it with its memorized instance. These findings indicate that exploratory strategies are finely tuned not only to the property of the object to be analyzed, but also to the prospective use of the resulting representation, be it memorization or recall. The results are discussed in light of the possibility of a systematic modeling of natural visuo-haptic exploration strategies.</content>

 Neuroimaging research is growing rapidly, providing expansive resources for synthesizing data. However, navigating these dense resources is complicated by the volume of research articles and variety of experimental designs implemented across studies. The advent of machine learning algorithms and text-mining techniques has advanced automated labeling of published articles in biomedical research to alleviate such obstacles. As of yet, a comprehensive examination of document features and classifier techniques for annotating neuroimaging articles has yet to be undertaken. Here, we evaluated which combination of corpus (abstract-only or full-article text), features (bag-of-words or Cognitive Atlas terms), and classifier (Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, or support vector classifier) resulted in the highest predictive performance in annotating a selection of 2,633 manually annotated neuroimaging articles. We found that, when utilizing full article text, data-driven features derived from the text performed the best, whereas if article abstracts were used for annotation, features derived from the Cognitive Atlas performed better. Additionally, we observed that when features were derived from article text, anatomical terms appeared to be the most frequently utilized for classification purposes and that cognitive concepts can be identified based on similar representations of these anatomical terms. Optimizing parameters for the automated classification of neuroimaging articles may result in a larger proportion of the neuroimaging literature being annotated with labels supporting the meta-analysis of psychological constructs.</content>

 Given the complicated pathological process, peripheral nerve injury has not yet been well resolved. SB216763 is a small molecular compound that can enhance remyelination of peripheral nerves by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). A previous study showed that GSK-3β inhibitor stimulated myelin gene expression and restored the myelin structure. Herein, we present the effect of small gap tubulization integrated with SB216763-loaded microspheres by using chitosan conduit. In vitro, SB216763 could promote DRGs axons growth. In vivo studies showed that SB216763 increased the number of myelinated axons and thickness of myelin sheaths. The electrophysiological examination and sciatic functional index results also indirectly indicated the role of SB216763 in repairing peripheral nerve injury. Meanwhile, SB216763 promoted the recovery of muscle function. In conclusion, combining SB216763-loaded PLGA microspheres with conduit small gap tubulization has promising potential applications in repairing peripheral nerve injury.</content>

 Tau-related dementias appear to involve specific to each disease aggregation pathways and morphologies of filamentous tau assemblies. Here we elucidate molecular mechanism of tau aggregation based on the PMO theory of protein secondary and tertiary structure (Cieplak, A. S. (2017). PLoS ONE 12: e0180905) and the recent structural evidence, aiming to account for the reported differences in fibril-core structure, cross-seeding of isoforms, response to non-reducing conditions, and homologs’ aggregation properties. The proposed model suggests that in contrast to Alzheimer’s disease, the assembly of tau prions in Pick’s disease would be facilitated by a moderate drop in pH that accompanies e.g. transit in the endosomal system, neuroinflammation or ischemic injury.</content>

 Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases with a complex, but often overlapping, genetic and pathobiological background and thus they are considered to form a disease spectrum. Although neurons are the principal cells affected in FTLD and ALS, increasing amount of evidence has recently proposed that other central nervous system-resident cells, including microglia and astrocytes, may also play roles in neurodegeneration in these diseases. Therefore, deciphering the mechanisms underlying the disease pathogenesis in different types of brain cells is fundamental in order to understand the etiology of these disorders. The major genetic cause of FTLD and ALS is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the intronic region of the C9orf72 gene. In neurons, specific pathological hallmarks, including decreased expression of the C9orf72 RNA and proteins and generation of toxic RNA and protein species, and their downstream effects have been linked to C9orf72 HRE-associated FTLD and ALS. In contrast, it is still poorly known to which extent these pathological changes are presented in other brain cells. Here, we summarize the current literature on the potential role of astrocytes and microglia in C9orf72 HRE-linked FTLD and ALS and discuss their possible phenotypic alterations and neurotoxic mechanisms that may contribute to neurodegeneration in these diseases.</content>

 Cerebral ischemia (CI) is a severe brain injury resulting in a variety of motor impairments combined with secondary injury in remote organs, especially the lung. This condition occurs due to insufficient blood supply to the brain during infancy. However, it has a molecular linkage that needs to be thoroughly covered. Here, we report on the role of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) in lung injury induced by CI. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was depended to establish the animal model of CI. Rats were used and brain ischemia was confirmed through TTC staining. Serum was used for protein chip analysis to study the proteomic interaction. Immunohistochemistry analyses were used to quantify and locate the VEGFC in the lung and brain. The role of VEGFC was detected by siVEGFC technology in SY5Y, HUCEV and A549 cell lines, under normal and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions in vitro. As a result, the TTC staining demonstrated that the model of brain ischemia was successfully established, and MPO experiments reported that lung damage was induced in MCAO rats. VEGFC levels were up-regulated in serum. On the other hand, immunohistochemistry showed that VEGFC increased significantly in the cytoplasm of neurons, the endothelium of small trachea and the lung cells of CI animals. On a functional level, siVEGFC effectively inhibited the proliferation of SY5Y cells and decreased the viability of HUVEC cells in normal cell lines. But under OGD conditions, siVEGFC decreased the growth of HUVEC and increased the viability of A549 cells, while no effect was noticed on SYSY cells. Therefore, we confirmed the different role of VEGFC played in neurons and lung cells in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. These findings may contribute to the understanding the molecular linkage of brain ischemia and lung injury, which therefore provides a new idea for the therapeutic approach to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.</content>

 To study the impact of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine on cognitive, functional, behavioral, global changes and adverse effects in patients with mild, moderate and severe Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we screened the literature published before September 2017 in the Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of Science Electronic databases according to the inclusion criteria. Thirty-six studies were finally determined from 1560 preliminary screened articles. The AD Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input scale (CIBIC+) were used as valid endpoints. Of the 36 trials included, meta-analyses of these placebo-control trials showed that there were significant differences between the donepezil, rivastigmine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and CIBIC+. Meta-analyses of these placebo-controlled trials showed that there were significant differences between the galantamine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, NPI, and CIBIC+. These observations suggest that memantine is beneficial for stabilizing or slowing the decline in ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL19 changes in AD patients. However, there was no significant effect according to the ADCS-ADL23, NPI, and CIBIC+ tests, which indicated that memantine treatment has no significant effect on these cognitive aspects of AD patients. Different effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, or memantine on AD were found in this study. According to the results, we conclude that galantamine is effective in treating all aspects of AD and is the first choice for the treatment of AD. However, due to limited data, we should consider additional data to obtain more stable results.</content>

 Learning a new language requires the use of extensive neural networks and can represent a potent tool to reorganize brain neuroplasticity. In this study, we analyze how 4-month long second language learning program (16, 2-h sessions) can lead to functional changes in the brain of healthy elderly individuals. A large number of studies point out a declining of brain-skills with age; here we analyze how cognition together with functional brain organization can be improved late in life. Twenty-six older adults (59 to 79 years old) were enrolled in the present study. A complete neuropsychological examination was administered pre- and post-intervention to measure global cognition level, short- and long-term memory, attention, language access, and executive functions. After the program, in the intervention group, we observed a significant improvement in global cognition together with increased functional connectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus and left superior parietal lobule. These findings can be added to the current neurobiological breakthroughs of reshaping brain networks with a short language learning practice in healthy elderly subjects. We, therefore, suggest that learning a foreign-language may represent a potentially helpful cognitive intervention for promoting healthy aging.</content>

 Reconstructing neuronal microcircuits through computational models is fundamental to simulate local neuronal dynamics. Here a scaffold model of the cerebellum has been developed in order to flexibly place neurons in space, connect them synaptically and endow neurons and synapses with biologically-grounded mechanisms. The scaffold model can keep neuronal morphology separated from network connectivity, which can in turn be obtained from convergence/divergence ratios and axonal/dendritic field 3D geometries. We first tested the scaffold on the cerebellar microcircuit, which presents a challenging 3D organization, at the same time providing appropriate datasets to validate emerging network behaviors. The scaffold was designed to integrate the cerebellar cortex with deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), including different neuronal types: Golgi cells, granule cells, Purkinje cells, stellate cells, basket cells and DCN principal cells. Mossy fiber inputs were conveyed through the glomeruli. An anisotropic volume (0.077 mm3) of mouse cerebellum was reconstructed, in which point-neuron models were tuned toward the specific discharge properties of neurons and were connected by exponentially decaying excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Simulations using both pyNEST and pyNEURON showed the emergence of organized spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal activity similar to those revealed experimentally in response to background noise and burst stimulation of mossy fiber bundles. Different configurations of granular and molecular layer connectivity consistently modified neuronal activation patterns, revealing the importance of structural constraints for cerebellar network functioning. The scaffold provided thus an effective workflow accounting for the complex architecture of the cerebellar network. In principle, the scaffold can incorporate cellular mechanisms at multiple levels of detail and be tuned to test different structural and functional hypotheses. A future implementation using detailed 3D multi-compartment neuron models and dynamic synapses will be needed to investigate the impact of single neuron properties on network computation.</content>

 Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is frequently used in rehabilitation therapy to improve motor recovery. To optimize the stimulatory effect of NMES, the parameters of NMES, including stimulation mode, location, current intensity, and duration, among others have been investigated; however, these studies mainly focused on the effects of changing parameters on the current plateau stage of the NMES cycle, while the impacts on other stages, such as the current rising stage, have yet to be investigated. In this paper, we studied the electroencephalograph (EEG) effects during NMES, with different rates of current change in the rising stage, and stable current intensity in the plateau stage. EEG signals (64-channel) were collected from 28 healthy subjects, who were administered with high, medium, or low current change rate (CCR) NMES through a right-hand wrist extensor. Time-frequency analysis and brain source analysis, using the LORETA method, were used to investigate neural activity in sensorimotor cortical areas. The strengths of cortical activity induced by different CCR conditions were compared. NMES with a high CCR activated the sensorimotor cortex, despite the NMES current intensity in the plateau stage lower than the motor threshold. Reduction of the Alpha 2 band (10–13 Hz) event related spectral power (ERSP) during NMES stimulation was significantly enhanced by increasing CCR (p &amp;lt; 0.05). LORETA-based source analysis demonstrated that, in addition to typical sensory areas, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), sensorimotor areas including primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), and somatosensory association cortex (SAC) were all activated by within threshold NMES. Furthermore, compared with the low CCR condition, cortical activity was significantly enhanced in the S1, M1, and PMC areas under high CCR conditions. This study shows CCR in the NMES rising stage can affect EEG responses in the sensorimotor cortex, and suggests that CCR is an important parameter applicable to the optimization of NMES treatment.</content>

 Consumer psychology research have found that individuals of different social status have different purchase intentions for different products. Individuals of high social status will simultaneously measure the status symbolic meaning and utilitarian value of the product, but they won’t show strong preferences for certain attributes; however, individuals of low social status show a strong purchasing tendency for hedonic products which contain status symbolic meanings and which satisfy their spiritual needs. This phenomenon may be due to their self-threat, which is caused by hedonic products. Based on the above, this study is the first to explore the cognitive process difference of hedonic and utilitarian label products in high- and low-social-status groups by recording event related potentials (ERPs). The result showed that under the P2, P3 and LPP components, low-social-status group elicited more negative deﬂections in hedonic label stimuli than in utilitarian label stimuli, while high-social-status group did not have significant difference in these components. These suggested that humans with low social status are more sensitive to hedonic products information, because high-status information contained in the hedonic label brings a sense of threat to them and generates their certain negative emotions, which make them preferentially process such information in the information processing.</content>

 The brain as a neuronal system has very complex structure with large diversity of neuronal types. The most basic complexity is seen from the structure of neuronal morphology, which usually has a complex tree-like structure with dendritic spines distributed in branches. For simulating a large-scale network with spiking neurons, the simple point neuron, such as integrate-and-fire neuron, is often used. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that the computational ability of a single neuron is largely enhanced
by its morphological structure, in particular, by various types of dendritic dynamics. As morphology reduction of detailed biophysical models is one of classic questions for systems neuroscience, much effort has been taken to simulate a neuron with a few compartments to include the interaction between soma and dendritic spines. 
Yet, novel reduction methods are still needed to deal with complex dendritic tree.
Here by using ten individual Purkinje cells of the cerebellum from three species of guinea-pig, mouse and rat, we consider four types of reduction methods and study their effects on the coding capacity of Purkinje cells in terms of firing rate, timing coding, spiking pattern, and modulated firing under different stimulation protocols. We find that there is a variation of reduction performance depending on individual cells and species, however, all reduction methods can preserve, to some degree, firing activity of the full model of Purkinje cell. Therefore, when stimulating large-scale network of neurons, one has to choose a proper type of reduced neuronal model depending on the questions addressed.
Among these reduction schemes, Branch method, that preserves the geometrical volume of neurons, can achieve the best balance among different performance measures of accuracy, simplification, and computational efficiency, and reproduce various phenomena shown in the full morphology model of Purkinje cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Branch reduction scheme seems to provide a general guideline for reducing complex morphology into a few compartments without loss of basic characteristics of firing property of neurons.</content>

 The human cerebral cortex is highly convoluted as convex gyri and concave sulci. In the past decades, extensive studies have consistently revealed substantial differences between gyri and sulci in terms of genetics, anatomy, morphology, axonal fiber connections, and function. Although interesting findings have been reported to date to elucidate the functional difference between gyri and sulci, the temporal variability of functional activity, which could explain individual differences in learning and higher-order cognitive functions, and as well as differences in gyri and sulci, remains to be explored. The present study explored the temporal variability of cortical gyral-sulcal resting state functional activity and its association with fluid intelligence measures on the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that the temporal variance of resting state fMRI BOLD signal was significantly larger in gyri than in sulci. We also found that the temporal variability of certain regions including middle frontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe and visual cortex was positively associated with fluid intelligence. Moreover, those regions were predominately located in gyri rather than in sulci. This study reports initial evidence for temporal variability difference of functional activity between gyri and sulci, and its association with fluid intelligence measures, and thus provides novel insights to understand the mechanism and functional relevance of gyri and sulci.</content>

 Social behavior, a highly adaptive and crucial component of mammalian life, is regulated by particularly sensitive regulatory brain mechanisms. Substantial evidence implicates classical epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and nucleosome remodeling as well as nonclassical mechanisms mediated by noncoding RNA in the regulation of social behavior. These mechanisms collectively form the ‘epigenetic network’ that orchestrates genomic integration of salient and transient social experiences.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroRNA (miRNA)‐mediated (dys)regulation of gene expression has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), although results of miRNA expression studies remain inconclusive. We aimed to identify miRNAs that show consistent differential expression across all published expression studies in PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic literature search on miRNA expression studies in PD and extracted data from eligible publications. After stratification for brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)‐derived specimen, we performed meta‐analyses across miRNAs assessed in three or more independent data sets. Meta‐analyses were performed using effect‐size– and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;‐value–based methods, as applicable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After screening 599 publications, we identified 47 data sets eligible for meta‐analysis. On these, we performed 160 meta‐analyses on miRNAs quantified in brain (n = 125), blood (n = 31), or CSF (n = 4). Twenty‐one meta‐analyses were performed using effect sizes. We identified 13 significantly (Bonferroni‐adjusted α = 3.13 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) differentially expressed miRNAs in brain (n = 3) and blood (n = 10) with consistent effect directions across studies. The most compelling findings were with hsa‐miR‐132‐3p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 6.37 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–5&lt;/sup&gt;), hsa‐miR‐497‐5p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.35 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;), and hsa‐miR‐133b (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.90 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) in brain and with hsa‐miR‐221‐3p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 4.49 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–35&lt;/sup&gt;), hsa‐miR‐214‐3p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 2.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–34&lt;/sup&gt;), and hsa‐miR‐29c‐3p (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–12&lt;/sup&gt;) in blood. No significant signals were found in CSF. Analyses of genome‐wide association study data for target genes of brain miRNAs showed significant association (α = 9.40 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–5&lt;/sup&gt;) of genetic variants in nine loci.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified several miRNAs that showed highly significant differential expression in PD. Future studies may assess the possible role of the identified brain miRNAs in pathogenesis and disease progression as well as the potential of the top blood miRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis, progression, or prediction of PD. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:835–851.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared outcomes after treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a recent cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an individual patient data analysis of seven prospective cohort studies. We included patients with AF and a recent cerebral ischemia (&amp;lt;3 months before starting oral anticoagulation) and a minimum follow‐up of 3 months. We analyzed the association between type of anticoagulation (DOAC versus VKA) with the composite primary endpoint (recurrent ischemic stroke [AIS], intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], or mortality) using mixed‐effects Cox proportional hazards regression models; we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 4,912 patients (median age, 78 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 71–84]; 2,331 [47.5%] women; median National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scale at onset, 5 [IQR, 2–12]); 2,256 (45.9%) patients received VKAs and 2,656 (54.1%) DOACs. Median time from index event to starting oral anticoagulation was 5 days (IQR, 2–14) for VKAs and 5 days (IQR, 2–11) for DOACs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.53). There were 262 acute ischemic strokes (AISs; 4.4%/year), 71 intracranial hemorrrhages (ICHs; 1.2%/year), and 439 deaths (7.4%/year) during the total follow‐up of 5,970 patient‐years. Compared to VKAs, DOAC treatment was associated with reduced risks of the composite endpoint (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67–1.00; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05) and ICH (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24–0.71; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); we found no differences for the risk of recurrent AIS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.70–1.19; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5) and mortality (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.03; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.09).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOAC treatment commenced early after recent cerebral ischemia related to AF was associated with reduced risk of poor clinical outcomes compared to VKA, mainly attributed to lower risks of ICH. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:823–834.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X‐linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by a single mutation: SINE‐VNTR‐Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion in &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt;. Recently, a (CCCTCT)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; repeat within the SVA insertion has been reported as an age‐at‐onset (AAO) modifier in XDP. Here we investigate the role of this hexanucleotide repeat in modifying expressivity of XDP.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We genotyped the hexanucleotide repeat in 355 XDP patients and correlated the repeat number (RN) with AAO (n = 295), initial clinical manifestation (n = 294), site of dystonia onset (n = 238), disease severity (n = 28), and cognitive function (n = 15). Furthermore, we investigated i) repeat instability by segregation analysis and Southern blotting using postmortem brain samples from two affected individuals and ii) relative &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; expression in blood RNA from 31 XDP patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RN showed significant inverse correlations with AAO and with &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; expression and a positive correlation with disease severity and cognitive dysfunction. Importantly, AAO (and not RN) was directly associated with whether dystonia or parkinsonism will manifest at onset. RN was lower in patients affected by mouth/tongue dystonia compared with blepharospasm. RN was unstable across germline transmissions with an overall tendency to increase in length and exhibited somatic mosaicism in brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hexanucleotide repeat within the SVA insertion acts as a genetic modifier of disease expressivity in XDP. RN‐dependent &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; repression and subsequent differences in &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels in patients may be potentiated in the brain through somatic variability leading to the neurological phenotype. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:812–822.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common variants near &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; associate with risk of developing frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Emerging evidence suggests a role for &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; in neurodegenerative processes beyond FTD. We evaluate the effect of &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; genotype on cognitive decline across multiple neurogenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We longitudinally followed 870 subjects with diagnoses of Parkinson disease (PD; n = 179), FTD (n = 179), Alzheimer disease (AD; n = 300), memory‐predominant mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 75), or neurologically normal control subjects (NC; n = 137) at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). All participants had annual Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE; median follow‐up duration = 3.0 years) and were genotyped at &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; index single nucleotide polymorphism rs1990622. Genotype effects on cognition were confirmed by extending analyses to additional cognitive instruments (Mattis Dementia Rating Scale‐2 [DRS‐2] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) and to an international validation cohort (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative [PPMI], N = 371).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; rs1990622&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; allele, linked to increased risk of FTD, associated with greater MMSE decline over time in PD subjects but not in AD or MCI subjects. For FTD subjects, rs1990622&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; associated with more rapid decrease in MMSE only under the minor‐allele, rs1990622&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, dominant model. Among PD patients, rs1990622&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; carriers from the UPenn cohort demonstrated more rapid longitudinal decline in DRS‐2 scores. Finally, in the PPMI cohort, &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; risk allele carriers demonstrated more rapid longitudinal decline in MoCA scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of cognitive instrument or cohort assessed, &lt;i&gt;TMEM106B&lt;/i&gt; acts as a genetic modifier for cognitive trajectory in PD. Our results implicate lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in 2 different proteinopathies. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:801–811.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Flow diverters are new generation stents that have recently garnered a large amount of interest for use in treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Flow diverters reduce blood flow into the aneurysm, with redirection along the path of the parent vessel. Flow stagnation into the aneurysm and neck coverage with subsequent endothelialization are the important synergistic mechanisms by which the therapy acts. Several studies have examined the mechanisms by which flow diverters subsequently lead to aneurysm occlusion. This review aims to provide a general overview of the flow diverters and their mechanism of action and potential implications. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:793–800.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Huntington’s Disease (HD) is a heritable neurological disorder that affects cognitive and motor performance in patients carrying the mutated huntingtin (HTT) gene. In mouse models of HD, previous reports showed a significant increase in spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). In this study, using optogenetics and slice electrophysiology, we examined the contribution of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons to the increase in GABA neurotransmission using the Q175 (heterozygote) mouse model of HD. Patch clamp recordings in voltage-clamp mode, were performed on SPNs from brain slices of presymptomatic (2 month) and symptomatic (8 and 12 month) Q175 mice and wildtype (WT) littermates. While inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked in SPNs following optical activation of PV- and SOM-expressing interneurons differed in amplitude, no genotype-dependent differences were observed at all ages from both interneuron types; however, responses evoked by either type were found to have faster kinetics in symptomatic mice. Since SOM-expressing interneurons are constitutively active in striatal brain slices, we then examined the effects of acutely silencing these neurons in symptomatic mice with halorhodopsin (eNpHR). Optically silencing SOM-expressing interneurons resulted in a greater decrease in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in a subset of SPNs from Q175 mice compared to WTs, suggesting that SOM-expressing interneurons are the main contributors to the overall increased GABA synaptic activity in HD SPNs. Additionally, the effects of activating GABAB and cannabinoid (CB1) receptors were investigated to determine whether these receptors were involved in modulating interneuron-specific GABA synaptic transmission and if this modulation differed in HD mice. When selectively activating PV- and SOM-expressing interneurons in the presence of the CB1 receptor agonist WIN-55,212, the magnitudes of the evoked IPSCs in SPNs decreased for both interneuron types although this change was less prominent in symptomatic Q175 SPNs during SOM-expressing interneuron activation. Overall, these findings show that dysfunction of SOM-expressing interneurons contributes to the increased GABA synaptic activity found in HD mouse models and that dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system may contribute to this effect.</content>

 Neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have shown promise as neuroprotective agents, indicating their potential in therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disease. However, the inherent bioactivity and pharmaceutical limitations of BDNF compromise its clinical efficacy. Research has documented the beneficial effects of electroacupuncture (EA) against neurodegeneration, possibly by BDNF-mediated mechanisms. The present study was designed to clarify whether EA can mount a neuroprotective effect in mice lesioned with MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) via stimulation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. We found that EA not only ameliorated the motor dysfunction but also restored the dopaminergic neuronal function and upregulated BDNF expression in MPTP-lesioned mice. Interestingly, the TrkB inhibitor K252a abolished the neuroprotective effects of EA. Western blot analyses further demonstrated that EA might recover the level of phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, and BDNF against MPTP neurotoxicity via reversing the imbalance between TrkB FL and TrkB T1. Taken together, the results of the present study show that EA stimulation can ameliorate MPTP-induced parkinsonism in mice. Such a neuroprotective effect may be partially mediated via restoring TrkB neurotrophic signaling.</content>

 Groupwise image registration tackles biases that can potentially arise from inappropriate template selection. It typically involves simultaneous registration of a cohort of images to a common space that is not specified a priori. Existing groupwise registration methods are computationally complex and are only effective for image populations without large anatomical variations. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to rapidly estimate large deformations between images to significantly reduce structural variability. Specifically, we employ a multi-level graph coarsening method to agglomerate similar images into clusters, each represented by an exemplar image. We then use a deep learning framework to predict the initial deformations between images. Warping with the estimated deformations brings the images closer in the image manifold and their alignment can be further refined using conventional groupwise registration algorithms. We evaluated the effectiveness of our method in groupwise registration of MR brain images and compared it against state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. Experimental results indicate that deformation initialization enables groupwise registration to converge significantly faster with competitive accuracy, therefore facilitates large-scale imaging studies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 To study the interplay of metabolic state (hungry vs. satiated) and glucose administration (including hormonal modulation) on brain function, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and blood samples were obtained in 24 healthy normal-weight men in a repeated measurement design. Participants were measured twice: once after a 36 hours fast (except water) and once under satiation (three meals/day for 36 hours). During each session, rs-fMRI and hormone concentrations were recorded before and after a 75 g oral dose of glucose. We calculated the amplitude map from BOLD signals by using the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) approach for each volunteer per condition. Using multiple linear regression analysis the interdependence of brain activity, plasma insulin and blood glucose was investigated. We observed a modulatory impact of fasting state on intrinsic brain activity in the posterior cingulate cortex. Strikingly, differences in plasma insulin levels between hunger and satiety states after glucose administration at the time of the scan were negatively related to brain activity in the posterior insula and superior frontal gyrus, while plasma glucose levels were positively associated with activity changes in the fusiform gyrus. Furthermore, we could show that changes in plasma insulin enhanced the connectivity between the posterior insula and superior frontal gyrus. Our results indicate that hormonal signals like insulin alleviate an acute hemostatic energy deficit by modifying the homeostatic and frontal circuitry of the human brain.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Perceived challenge of walking is a broad term that we use to encompass walking-related anxiety, balance self-efficacy/confidence, and fear of falling. Evidence shows that even after accounting for physical performance capabilities, a higher perceived challenge can cause individuals to self-impose restrictions in walking-related activities. Perceived challenge is typically measured by self-report, which is susceptible to subjective measurement bias and error. We assert that measurement of perceived challenge can be enhanced by augmenting self-report with objective, physiologically based measures. A promising approach that has emerged in the literature is measurement of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity by recording skin conductance. Heightened SNS activity is a physiological stress response to conditions that are cognitively, emotionally, or physically challenging. In the present article we explain the rationale and physiological basis for measuring SNS activity to assess perceived challenge of walking. We also present existing and new evidence supporting the feasibility of this approach for assessing perceived challenge in lab-based and real-world walking environments. Future research directions are also discussed.</content>

 Sleep is a very critical process that constitutes up to one third of daytime of a healthy adult. It is known to be an active period where body and brain is refreshed for the next day. It is both part of a larger cycle, i.e. circadian rhythm, and has subcsycles in it, i.e. sleep stages. Although hemodynamics of these stages have been investigated especially in the last two decades, there are still points in the hemodynamics to be illuminated especially in terms of refreshment. This study aims to investigate refreshing property of sleep in terms of sleep stages using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for measuring prefrontal cortex (PFC) hemodynamics.
Nine healthy subjects slept in sleep laboratories, monitored by polysomnography and fNIRS before, during, and after night sleep. REM stage had lower oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and total hemoglobin (HbT) than the other sleep stages and wakefulness. Deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) did not differ between any stages. All sleep stages and wakefulness stage at the end of the sleep had higher HbO and lower HbR than the beginning of the sleep. HbT levels did not differ between the beginning and the end of the sleep for any stages.
During REM sleep, PFC seems to get lower blood supply, possibly due to increased demand in other brain regions. Regardless of the stage, PFC has higher oxygenation towards the end of sleep, indicating refreshment.
Overall, our brain seems to be on duty during sleep throughout the night for “cleaning” and “refreshing” itself. Hemodynamic changes from the beginning to end of sleep might be the indicator of this work. Thus, accordingly REM stage seems to be at a central point for this work.</content>

 It is generally assumed that different EEG frequency bands are somehow related to different computational modes in the brain. Integration of these computational modes is reflected in the phenomenon of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). On slow temporal scales, CFC may reflect trait-like properties, which posits a question of its developmental trends. This is the first study that explored source-level CFC measures in developmental perspective using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. CFC measures demonstrated good test-retest stability and proved to be higher in adults in cortical areas participating in sensory-motor integration, response inhibition, and attentional control. In children, greater CFC was observed in parietal regions involved in self-centered cognition. Over the period from 7 to 10 years, CFC demonstrated nonlinear growth trajectories. Introversion was associated with higher CFC in cortical areas related to emotion, attention, and social cognition implying that the association between introversion and CFC appears early in the development.</content>

 Understanding the mechanisms of vision in health and disease requires knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the eye and the neural pathways relevant to visual perception. As such, development of imaging techniques for the visual system is crucial for unveiling the neural basis of visual function or impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers non-invasive probing of the structure and function of the neural circuits without depth limitation, and can help identify abnormalities in brain tissues in vivo. Among the advanced MRI techniques, manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) involves the use of active manganese contrast agents that positively enhance brain tissue signals in T1-weighted imaging with respect to the levels of connectivity and activity. Depending on the routes of administration, accumulation of manganese ions in the eye and the visual pathways can be attributed to systemic distribution or their local transport across axons in an anterograde fashion, entering the neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels. The use of the paramagnetic manganese contrast in MRI has a wide range of applications in the visual system from imaging normal neurodevelopment to assessing and monitoring neurodegeneration, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. In this review, we present four major domains of scientific inquiry where MEMRI can be put to imperative use — deciphering neuroarchitecture, tracing neuronal tracts, detecting neuronal activity, and identifying or differentiating glial activity. We deliberate upon each category studies that have successfully employed MEMRI to examine the visual system, including the delivery protocols, spatiotemporal characteristics, and biophysical interpretation. Based on this literature, we have identified some critical challenges in the field in terms of toxicity, and sensitivity and specificity of manganese enhancement. We also discuss the pitfalls and alternatives of MEMRI which will provide new avenues to explore in the future.</content>

 Down syndrome (DS), a genetic disorder caused by partial or complete triplication of chromosome 21, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. DS mouse models and cell lines display defects in cellular adaptive stress responses including autophagy, unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. We tested the ability of hydroxyurea (HU), an FDA-approved pharmacological agent that activates adaptive cellular stress response pathways, to improve the cognitive function of Ts65Dn mice. The chronic HU treatment started at a stage when early mild cognitive deficits are present in this model (~3 months of age) and continued until a stage of advanced cognitive deficits in untreated mice (~ 5-6 months of age). The HU effects on cognitive performance were analyzed using a battery of water maze tasks designed to detect changes in different types of memory with sensitivity wide enough to detect deficits as well as improvements in spatial memory. The most common characteristic of cognitive deficits observed in trisomic mice at 5-6 months of age was their inability to rapidly acquire new information for long-term storage, a feature akin to episodic-like memory. On the background of severe cognitive impairments in untreated trisomic mice, HU-treatment produced mild but significant benefits in Ts65Dn by improving memory acquisition and short-term retention of spatial information. In control mice, HU treatment facilitated memory retention in constant (reference memory) as well as time-variant conditions (episodic-like memory) implicating a robust nootropic effect. This was the first proof-of-concept study of HU treatment in a DS model, and indicates that further studies are warranted to assess a window to optimize timing and dosage of the treatment in this pre-clinical phase. Findings of this study indicate that HU has potential for improving memory retention and cognitive flexibility that can be harnessed for the amelioration of cognitive deficits in normal aging and in cognitive decline (dementia) related to DS and other neurodegenerative diseases.</content>

 Activation of microglia, the primary mediators of inflammation in the brain, is a major component of gliosis and neuronal loss in a number of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease.  The role of activated microglia in white matter, and its relationship to cognitive decline during aging, are unknown. The current study evaluated microglia densities in white matter of postmortem specimens from cognitively normal young adults, cognitively normal older adults, and cognitive “SuperAgers”, a unique group of individuals over age 80 whose memory test scores are at a level equal to or better than scores of 50-to-65-year-olds. 

Specimens from cognitively-normal old, young, and “SuperAgers” were cut into whole hemisphere sections and immunohistochemical procedures were used to visualize activated microglia with HLA-DR antibody. Densities of HLA-DR-positive activated microglia underlying five cortical regions were evaluated.  

Statistical findings showed a significant main effect of group on differences in microglia density where cognitively-normal old showed highest densities; no difference between SuperAgers and young specimens were detected.  In two autopsied SuperAgers with MRI FLAIR available, prominent hyperintensities in periventricular regions were observed, and interestingly, examination of corresponding postmortem sections showed only sparse microglia densities. 

In conclusion, activated microglia appear to respond to age-related pathologic changes in cortical white matter, and this phenomenon is largely spared in SuperAgers. Findings offer insights into the relationship between white matter neuroinflammatory changes and cognitive integrity during aging.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Across cultures and throughout history, human beings have reported a variety of spiritual experiences and the concomitant perceived sense of union that transcends one’s ordinary sense of self. Nevertheless, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms of spiritual experiences, particularly when examined across different traditions and practices. By adapting an individualized guided-imagery task, we investigated neural correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences as compared with stressful and neutral-relaxing experiences. We observed in the spiritual condition, as compared with the neutral-relaxing condition, reduced activity in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a result that suggests the IPL may contribute importantly to perceptual processing and self-other representations during spiritual experiences. Compared with stress cues, responses to spiritual cues showed reduced activity in the medial thalamus and caudate, regions associated with sensory and emotional processing. Overall, the study introduces a novel method for investigating brain correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences and suggests neural mechanisms associated with broadly defined and personally experienced spirituality.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Despite decades of research, current therapeutic interventions for Parkinson`s disease (PD) are insufficient as they fail to modify disease progression by ameliorating the underlying pathology. Cellular proteostasis (protein homeostasis) is an essential factor in maintaining a persistent environment for neuronal activity. Proteostasis is ensured by mechanisms including regulation of protein translation, chaperone-assisted protein folding and protein degradation pathways. It is generally accepted that deficits in proteostasis are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases including PD. While the proteasome fails to degrade large protein aggregates, particularly alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) in PD, drug-induced activation of autophagy can efficiently remove aggregates and prevent degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Therefore, maintenance of these mechanisms is essential to preserve all cellular functions relying on a correctly folded proteome. The correlations between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) that aims to restore proteostasis within the secretory pathway are well established. However, while mild insults increase the activity of chaperones, prolonged cell stress or insufficient adaptive response causes cell death. Modulating the activity of molecular chaperones, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) which assists refolding and contributes to the removal of unfolded proteins, and their associated pathways may offer a new approach for disease-modifying treatment. Here, we summarize some of the key concepts and emerging ideas on the relation of protein aggregation and imbalanced proteostasis with an emphasis on PD as our area of main expertise. Furthermore, we discuss recent insights into the strategies for reducing the toxic effects of protein unfolding in PD by targeting the ER UPR pathway.</content>

 Objective The notion that cerebellar pathology may contribute to cognitive impairment in ALS, especially in patients with C9orf72 repeated expansion, has been inconsistently reported. This study aimed exploring the relationship between cerebellar involvement, cognitive impairment and C9orf72repeated expansion of patients with ALS.
Methods Quantitative in-vivo assessment of cerebellar lobules has been investigated in 66 non-demented patients with ALS and 28 healthy controls. Pathologic C9orf72 repeated expansion was found in 13 patients. Mild cognitive and/or behavioral impairment was diagnosed in 22 C9orf72 negative ALS patients. Measures of cortical volume (CV) and cortical thickness (CT) of cerebellar lobules of all participants were used for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify clusters of lobular measures highly correlated with each other. PCA outcomes were used for between group comparisons and correlation analyses with neuropsychological and clinical features. 
Results Disease severity measured with ALS functional rating scale and index of disease progression rate significantly correlated with CV reduction of the second PCA cluster loading CV measures of anterior lobules. In all patients, cognitive impairment, measured with verbal fluency, was related to CV reduction of the third cluster comprising posterior lobules. No specific cortical thinning or volume reduction of cerebellar clustering patterns could be detected in ALS subgroups. 
Conclusion Our data show that specific patterns of subregional cerebellar involvement are associated with physical disability or cognitive impairment in ALS, in line with the topographic organization of the cerebellum. However, there was no specific correlation between cerebellar degeneration and cognitive syndromes or C9orf72 mutations.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine (METH) are widely abused psychostimulants, which produce a variety of psychomotor, autonomic and neurotoxic effects. The behavioral and neurotoxic effects of both compounds (from now on defined as AMPHs) stem from a fair molecular and anatomical specificity for catecholamine-containing neurons, which are placed in the brainstem reticular formation. In fact, the structural cross-affinity joined with the presence of shared molecular targets between AMPHs and catecholamine provides the basis for a quite selective recruitment of brainstem catecholamine neurons following AMPHs administration. A great amount of investigations, commentary manuscripts and books reported a pivotal role of mesencephalic dopamine (DA)-containing neurons in producing behavioral and neurotoxic effects of AMPHs. Instead, the present review focuses on catecholamine reticular neurons of the low brainstem. In fact, these nuclei add on DA mesencephalic cells to mediate the effects of AMPHs. Among these, we also include two pontine cholinergic nuclei. Finally, we discuss the conundrum of a mixed neuronal population, which extends from the pons to the periaqueductal gray. In this way, a number of reticular nuclei beyond classic DA mesencephalic cells are considered to extend the scenario underlying the neurobiology of AMPHs abuse. The mechanistic approach followed here to describe the action of AMPHs within the reticular formation is rooted on the fine anatomy of this region of the brainstem. This is exemplified by a few medullary catecholamine neurons, which play a pivotal role compared with the bulk of peripheral sympathetic neurons in sustaining most of the cardiovascular effects induced by AMPHs.</content>

 Background.  Increasingly favorable mortality prognosis in multiple sclerosis (MS) raises questions regarding MS-specific cognitive aging and the presence of comorbidities such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
Objective.  To assess elderly with MS (EwMS) and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) using both MS- and AD-specific psychometrics.  
Methods.  EwMS (n=104) and 56 HCs were assessed on a broad spectrum of language, visual-spatial processing, memory, processing speed, and executive function tests.  Using logistic regression analysis, we examined cognitive performance differences between the EwMS and HC groups.  Cognitive impairment (CI) was defined using a -1.5 SD threshold relative to age and education years-matched HCs, in two cognitive domains. 
Results.  CI was observed in 47.1% of EwMS with differences most often seen on tests emphasizing cognitive processing speed as measured by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) (d=0.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) and verbal fluency (both category-based d=0.87, p&amp;lt;0.001; letter-based d=0.67, p&amp;lt;0.001).  After adjusting for age, sex and years of education, MS/HC diagnosis was the best predicted (R2=0.27) by differences in category-based verbal fluency (Wald=9.935, p=0.002) and SDMT (Wald=13.937, p&amp;lt;0.001).  
Conclusion.  This study confirms the common hallmark of slowed cognitive processing speed in MS among elderly patients. Defective verbal fluency, less often observed in younger cohorts, may represent emerging cognitive pathology due to other etiologies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 It is believed that Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF) increases the interlimb transfer but the exact mechanism is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to compare between a bimanual task (BM) and a MVF task, within functionally rather than geometrically defined cortical domains. Measure Projection Analysis (MPA) approach was applied to compare the dynamic oscillatory activity (event-related synchronisation/desynchronisation ERS/ERD) between and within domains. EEG was recorded in 14 healthy participants performing a BM and an MVF task with the right hand. The MPA was applied on fitted equivalent current dipoles based on independent components to define domains containing functionally similar areas.  The measure of intradomain similarity was a “signed mutual information”, a parameter based on the coherence. Domain analysis was performed for joint tasks (BM and MVF) and for each task separately. MVF created 9 functional domains while MB task had only 4 functionally distinctive domains, two over the left hemispheres and two bilateraly. For all domains identified for BM task alone, similar domains could be identified in MVF and joint tasks analysis. In addition MVF had domains related to motor planning on the right hemisphere and to self-recognition of action. For joint tasks analysis, seven domains were identified, with similar functions for the left and the right hand with exception of a domain covering BA32 (self-recognition of action) of the left hand only.  In joint task domain analysis, the ERD/ERS showed a larger difference between domains than between tasks. All domains which involved the sensory cortex had a visible beta ERS at the onset of movement, and post movement beta ERS. The frequency of ERD varied between domains.  Largest difference between tasks existed in domains responsible for the awareness of action. In conclusion, functionally distinctive domains have different ERD/ERS patterns, similar for both tasks.  MVF activates contralateral hemisphere in similar manner to BM movements, while at the same time also activating the ipsilateral hemisphere. Significance: Following stroke cortical activation and interhemispheric inhibition from the contralesional side is reduced. MVF creates stronger ipsilateral activity than BM, which is highly relevant of neurorehabilitation of movements.</content>

 A unique nucleus, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus, has recently been recognized in the brain parenchyma. The outstanding feature of this nucleus is that the neural somas are located in the parenchyma, but their processes stretch into the CSF, implying that it may be a key structure bridging the nervous and body fluids-regulating systems and may play a pivotal role in modulating physiological activities. However, the true biological significance of this nucleus needs to be uncovered. The morphology of a nucleus is one of the most important parameters for neuroscience studies. For this reason, a common experimental animal, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, was chosen. The position, adjacent structures, neuronal distribution, size, three-dimensional reconstruction, and core coordinates of the CSF-contacting nucleus in SD rats of different weights (90-400 g) were illustrated for the first time. Furthermore, the formulas for calculating the core coordinates of the CSF-contacting nucleus in rats of different weights were revealed. Finally, the possible biological functions uncovered by past research are reviewed in this paper. This study provides an indispensable methodology and a significant reference for researchers interested in this unique nucleus.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is reportedly associated with the accumulation of calcium ions (Ca2+), and this accumulation is responsible for the phosphorylation of tau. Although several lines of evidence demonstrate the above phenomenon, the inherent mechanisms remain unknown. Using APP/PS1 Tg mice and neuroblastoma (N)2a cells as in vivo and in vitro experimental models, we observed that Ca2+ stimulated the phosphorylation of tau by activating microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES1) in a prostaglandin (PG) E2-dependent EP receptor-activating manner. Specifically, the highly accumulated Ca2+ stimulated the expression of mPGES1 and the synthesis of PGE2. Treatment with the inhibitor of Ca2+ transporter, NMDAR, attenuated the expression of mPGES1 and the production of PGE2 were attenuated in S(+)-ketamine-treated APP/PS1 Tg mice. Elevated levels of PGE2 were responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of tau in an EP-1-, EP-2- and EP-3-dependent but not EP4-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 5-activating manner. Reciprocally, the knockdown of the expression of mPGES1 ameliorated the expected cognitive decline by inhibiting the phosphorylation of tau in APP/PS1 Tg mice. Moreover, CDK5 was found to be located downstream of EP1-3 to regulate the phosphorylation of tau though the cleavage of p35 to p25. Finally, the phosphorylation of tau by Ca2+ contributed to the cognitive decline of APP/PS1 Tg mice.</content>

 We aimed to evaluate the effect of multi-ingredient nutritional supplementation, with and without exercise training, on cognitive function in healthy older men. Forty-nine sedentary men (age: 73±6years [mean±SD]; body mass index: 28.5±3.6kg/m2) were randomized to consume a supplement (SUPP n=25; 1500mg n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, 30g whey protein, 2.5g creatine, 500IU vitamin D, and 400mg calcium) or control beverage (CON n=24; 22g maltodextrin) twice daily for 20wk consisting of Phase 1: SUPP/CON followed by Phase 2: 12-wk resistance exercise training plus high-intensity interval training, while continuing to consume the study beverages (SUPP/CON+EX). At baseline, 6wk, and 19wk we assessed cognitive function (Montréal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA]), memory (word recall during the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT]), and executive functions (working memory inhibition control), and nutrient bioavailability. We did not observe changes to any aspect of cognitive function after Phase 1; however, significant improvements in the following cognitive function outcomes were detected following Phase 2: MOCA scores increased (6wk: 23.5±3.3 vs. 19wk: 24.4±2.5, p=0.013); number of words recalled during the RAVLT (6wk: 6.6±3.6 vs. 19wk: 7.6±3.8, p=0.047); and reaction time improved (6wk: 567±49ms vs. 19wk: 551±51ms, p=0.002). Although between-group differences in these outcomes were not significant, we observed within-group improvements in composite cognitive function scores over the course of the entire study only in the SUPP group (Δ = 0.58±0.62, p=0.004) but not in the CON group (Δ = 0.31±0.61, p=0.06). We observed a progressive increase in n-3 index, and a concomitant decrease in the ratio of arachidonic acid (ARA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) within erythrocyte plasma membranes, in the SUPP group only. At week 19, n-3 index (r=0.49, p=0.02) and the ARA:EPA ratio (r=-0.44, p=0.03) were significantly correlated with composite cognitive function scores. Our results show that 12 weeks of RET + HIIT resulted in improved MOCA scores, word recall, and reaction time during an executive functions task; and suggest that a multi-ingredient supplement combined with this exercise training program may improve composite cognitive function scores in older men possibly via supplementation-mediated alterations to n-3 PUFA bioavailability. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02281331).</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR), as an index of sensorimotor gating, is one of the most extensively used paradigms in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders. Few studies have examined how prenatal stress (PS) regulates the sensorimotor gating during the lifespan and how PS modifies the development of amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology in brain areas underlying the PPI formation. We followed alternations in corticosterone levels, learning and memory, and the PPI of the ASR measures in APP&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NL-G-F/NL-G-F&lt;/span&gt; offspring of dams exposed to gestational noise stress. In-depth quantifications of the Aβ plaque accumulation were also performed at 6 months. The results indicated an age-dependent deterioration of sensorimotor gating, long-lasting PS-induced abnormalities in PPI magnitudes, as well as deficits in spatial memory. The PS also resulted in a higher Aβ aggregation predominantly in brain areas associated with the PPI modulation network. The findings suggest the contribution of a PS-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity in regulating the PPI modulation substrates leading to the abnormal development of the neural protection system in response to disruptive stimuli. The long-lasting HPA axis dysregulation appears to be the major underlying mechanism in precipitating the Aβ deposition, especially in brain areas contributed to the PPI modulation network.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The question whether the attentional control of working memory (WM) is shared across sensory modalities remains controversial. Here, we investigated whether attention shifts in visual and tactile WM are regulated independently. Participants memorized visual and tactile targets in a first memory sample set (S1) before encoding targets in a second sample set (S2). Importantly, visual or tactile S2 targets could appear on the same side as the corresponding S1 targets, or on opposite sides, thus, requiring shifts of spatial attention in visual or tactile WM. The activation of WM representations in modality-specific visual and somatosensory areas was tracked by recording visual and tactile contralateral delay activity (CDA/tCDA). CDA/tCDA components emerged contralateral to the side of visual or tactile S1 targets, and reversed polarity when S2 targets in the same modality appeared on the opposite side. Critically, the visual CDA was unaffected by the presence versus absence of concurrent attention shifts in tactile WM, and the tactile CDA remained insensitive to visual attention shifts. Visual and tactile WM performance was also not modulated by attention shifts in the other modality. These results show that the dynamic control of visual and tactile WM activation processes operates in an independent modality-specific fashion.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Holding a conversation means that speech must be started, maintained, and stopped continuously. The brain networks that underlie these aspects of speech motor control remain poorly understood. Here we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants produced normal and fast rate speech in response to sequences of visually presented objects. We took a non-conventional approach to fMRI data analysis that allowed us to study speech motor behavior as it unfolded over time. To this end, whole-brain fMRI signals were extracted in stimulus-locked epochs using slice-based fMRI. These data were then subjected to group independent component analysis to discover spatially independent networks that were associated with different temporal activation profiles. The results revealed two basic brain networks with different temporal dynamics: a cortical network that was activated continuously during speech production, and a second cortico-subcortical network that increased in activity during the initiation and suppression of speech production. Additional analyses explored whether key areas involved in motor suppression such as the right inferior frontal gyrus, sub-thalamic nucleus and pre-supplementary motor area provide first-order signals to stop speech. The results reveal for the first time the brain networks associated with the initiation, maintenance, and suppression of speech motor behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 Previous research demonstrates that the underlying state of the brain influences how sensory stimuli are processed. Canonically, the state of the brain has been defined by quantifying the spectral characteristics of spontaneous fluctuations in local field potentials (LFP). Here, we utilized isoflurane and propofol anesthesia to parametrically alter the spectral state of the murine brain. With either drug, we produce slow wave delta dominant (1- 4Hz) activity, with low anesthetic doses, or burst suppression, with higher doses. We find that while spontaneous LFP oscillations were similar, the average visual-evoked potential (VEP) was always smaller in amplitude and shorter in duration under propofol than under comparable doses of isoflurane. This diminished average VEP results from increased trial-to-trial variability in VEPs under propofol.  One feature of single trial VEPs that was consistent in all animals was visual-evoked gamma band oscillation (20-60Hz). This gamma band oscillation was coherent between trials in the early phase (&amp;lt;250 ms) of the visual evoked potential under isoflurane. Inter trial phase coherence (ITPC) of gamma oscillations was dramatically attenuated in the same propofol anesthetized mice despite similar spontaneous oscillations in the LFP. This suggests that while both anesthetics lead to loss of consciousness, elicit slow oscillations and burst suppression, only the isoflurane permits phase resetting of gamma oscillations by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate that accurate characterization of a brain state must include both spontaneous as well as stimulus-induced perturbations of brain activity.</content>

 The well documented precision of the cerebellar sagittal organization is commonly used to compose a comprehensive view on principles of cerebellar function. However, the physiological manifestation of this organization is either limited to information derived from single unit recordings or from imaging of a small group of closely located neurons. Here we used large scale imaging to monitor calcium concentration changes in the entire vermal area of folia V and VI in anesthetize mice. We found that the response to a strong auditory input or electrical shock to the tail area is composed of an early and a late component that differ in their spatiotemporal properties. The early component occurs throughout the scanned area whereas the late component reflects synchronous activation of Purkinje cells located along symmetric parasagittal bands that correspond well to sagittal band 2+ (Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004).  Similar organization was found in the rigorously disorganized cerebellum of Cxcr4 KO mice, suggesting that the sagittal organization is determined by the climbing fibers input to the cerebellar cortex. The responses for both stimuli are followed by prolonged recovery period but the rate of recovery from auditory stimulus is much longer reflecting different site of adapting process. We suggest that these sensory inputs, which are commonly used to evoke startle response, activate two sets of climbing fiber inputs that differ in their spatiotemporal properties and contribute to the motor organization and habituation of the startle response.</content>

 Recent neuroimaging studies have indicated that abnormalities in brain structure and function may play an important role in the etiology of lifelong premature ejaculation (LPE). LPE patients have exhibited aberrant cortical structure, altered brain network function and abnormal brain activation in response to erotic pictures. However, it remains unclear whether resting-state whole brain functional connectivity (FC) is altered in LPE patients. Machine learning analysis has the advantage of screening the best classification features from high-throughput data (such as FC), which has the potential to identify the pathophysiological targets of disease by establishing classification indicators for patients and healthy controls (HCs). Therefore, the supported vector machine based classification model using FC as features was used in the present study to confirm the most specific FCs that distinguish LPE patients from healthy controls. After feature selection, the remained features were used to build the classification model, with an accuracy 0.85 ± 0.14, sensitivity of 0.92 ± 0.18, specificity of 0.72 ± 0.30, and recall index of 0.85 ± 0.17 across 1000 testing groups (100 times 10-folds cross validation). After that, two-sample t tests with family-wise error correction were used to compare these features that occurring more than 500 times during training steps between LPE patients and HCs. Four FCs, 1) between left medial part of orbital frontal cortex (mOFC) and right mOFC, 2) between the left rectus and right post-central gyrus, 3) between the right insula and left pallidum and 4) between the right middle part of temporal pole and right inferior part of temporal gyrus showed significant group difference. These results demonstrate that resting-state brain FC might be a discriminating feathers to distinguish LPE patients from HCs. These classification features, especially the FC between bilateral mOFC, provide underlying abnormal central functional targets in LPE etiology, which offers a novel alternative target for future intervention in LPE treatment.</content>

 EEG recordings are generally affected by interference from physiological and non physiological sources which may obscure underlying brain activity and hinder effective EEG analysis. In particular, cardiac interference can be caused by the electrical activity of the heart and/or cardiovascular activity related to blood flow. Successful EEG application in sports science settings requires a method for artifact removal that is automatic and flexible enough to be applied in a variety of acquisition conditions without requiring simultaneous ECG recordings that could restrict movement.

We developed an automatic method for classifying and removing both electrical cardiac and cardiovascular artifacts (ARCI) that does not require additional ECG recording. Our method employs independent component analysis (ICA) to isolate data independent components (ICs) and identifies the artifactual ICs by evaluating specific IC features in the time and frequency domains. We applied ARCI to EEG datasets with cued artifacts and acquired during an eyes-closed condition. Data were recorded using a standard EEG wet cap with either 128 or 64 electrodes and using a novel dry electrode cap with either 97 or 64 dry electrodes. All data were decomposed into different numbers of components to evaluate the effect of ICA decomposition level on effective cardiac artifact detection. ARCI performance was evaluated by comparing automatic ICs classifications with classifications performed by experienced investigators. Automatic and investigator classifications were highly consistent resulting in an overall accuracy greater than 99% in all datasets and decomposition levels, and an average sensitivity greater than 90%. Best results were attained when data were decomposed into a fewer number of components where the method achieved perfect sensitivity (100%). Performance was also evaluated by comparing automatic component classification with externally recorded ECG. Results showed that ICs automatically classified as artifactual were significantly correlated with ECG activity whereas the other ICs were not. We also assessed that the interference affecting EEG signals was reduced by more than 82% after automatic artifact removal.

Overall, ARCI represents a significant step in the detection and removal of cardiac-related EEG artifacts and can be applied in a variety of acquisition settings making it ideal for sports science applications.</content>

 Developing technologies for coupling neural activity and artificial neural components, is key for advancing neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics. We present a biohybrid experimental setting, where the activity of a biological neural network is coupled to a biomimetic hardware network. The implementation of the hardware network (denoted NeuroSoC) exhibits complex dynamics with a multiplicity of time-scales, emulating 2880 neurons and 12.7M synapses, designed on a VLSI chip. This network is coupled to a neural network in-vitro, where the activities of both the biological and the hardware networks can be recorded, processed and integrated bidirectionally in real-time. This experimental setup enables an adjustable and well-monitored coupling, while at the same time providing access to the key functional features of neural networks. We demonstrate the feasibility to functionally couple the two networks and of implementing control circuits to modify the biohybrid activity. Overall, we provide an experimental model for neuromorphic-neural interfaces, hopefully to advance the capability to interface with neural activity, and with its irregularities in pathology</content>

 Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve is an emerging treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) can produce unwanted side effects. Here, we investigated whether stimulating the vagus nerve closer to the end organ has fewer off-target effects, while reducing intestinal inflammation. An electrode array was developed to stimulate and record vagal neural responses in rats. Acute VNS off-target experiment: The cervical and abdominal vagus nerves of anaesthetised rats (n=5) were acutely implanted with an electrode array, stimulation delivered (10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase) and changes to heart rate, respiration and blood pressure assessed. Chronic VNS efficacy experiment: The abdominal vagus nerve was chronically implanted with an electrode array. After 2 weeks, the intestine was inflamed with TNBS (2.5% 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid), an established method for rodent models of IBD. Rats were randomly selected to receive therapeutic VNS (n=7; 10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase; 3 hours/day) or no stimulation (n=8) for 5 days. Stool quality, C-reactive protein in blood and histology of the inflamed intestine were assessed. VNS off-target experiment: Abdominal VNS had no effect (two-way RM-ANOVA: P&amp;gt;0.05) on cardiac, respiratory and blood pressure parameters. However, during cervical VNS heart rate decreased by 31 ± 9 beats/minute (P&amp;gt;0.05), respiration was inhibited and blood pressure decreased. VNS efficacy experiment: During the implantation period, electrically-evoked neural response thresholds remained stable (one-way RM ANOVA: P&amp;gt;0.05), and were below stimulation levels. VNS rats, compared to unstimulated rats, had improved stool quality (two-way RM ANOVA: P&amp;lt;0.0001), no blood in faeces (P&amp;lt;0.0001), reduced plasma C-reactive protein (two-way RM ANOVA: P&amp;lt;0.05) and a reduction in resident inflammatory cell populations within the intestine (Kruskal-Wallis: P&amp;lt;0.05). Abdominal VNS did not evoke off-target effects, is an effective treatment of TNBS-induced inflammation, and may be an effective treatment of IBD in humans.</content>

 Big Data promises to advance science through data-driven discovery. However, many standard lab protocols rely on manual examination, which is not feasible for large-scale datasets. Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of expert examination. We propose to 1) start with expertly labelled data, 2) amplify labels through web applications that engage citizen scientists, and 3) train machine learning on amplified labels, to emulate the experts. Demonstrating this, we developed a system to quality control brain magnetic resonance images. Expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC=0.99). Combining citizen science and deep learning can generalize and scale expert decision making; this is particularly important in disciplines where specialized, automated tools do not yet exist.</content>

 Synaptic plasticity serves as an essential mechanism underlying cognitive processes as learning and memory. For a better understanding detailed theoretical models combine experimental underpinnings of synaptic plasticity and match experimental results. However, these models are mathematically complex impeding the comprehensive investigation of their link to cognitive processes generally executed on the neuronal network level. Here, we derive a mathematical framework enabling the simplification of such detailed models of synaptic plasticity facilitating further mathematical analyses. By this framework we obtain a compact, firing-rate-dependent mathematical formulation, which includes the essential dynamics of the detailed model and, thus, of experimentally verified properties of synaptic plasticity. Amongst others, by testing our framework by abstracting the dynamics of two well-established calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity models, we derived that the synaptic changes depend on the square of the presynaptic firing rate, which is in contrast to previous assumptions. Thus, the here-presented framework enables the derivation of biologically plausible but simple mathematical models of synaptic plasticity allowing to analyze the underlying dependencies of synaptic dynamics from neuronal properties such as the firing rate and to investigate their implications in complex neuronal networks.</content>

 Histological studies of myelin-stained sectioned cadaver brain and in-vivo myelin-weighted magnetic resonance imaging show that the cerebral cortex is organized into cortical areas with generally well-defined boundaries, which have consistent internal patterns of myelination. The process of myelination is largely driven by neural experience, in which the axonal passage of action potentials stimulates neighbouring oligodendrocytes to perform their task. This bootstrapping process, such that the traffic of action potentials facilitates increased traffic, suggests the hypothesis that the specific pattern of myelination (myeloarchitecture) in each cortical area reveals the principal cortical microcircuits required for the function of that area. If this idea is correct, the observable sequential maturation of specific brain areas can provide evidence for models of the stages of cognitive development.</content>

 Parental migration has caused millions of children left behind, especially in China and India. Left behind children (LBC) have a high risk of mental disorders and may present negative life outcomes in the future. However, little is known whether there are cerebral structural alterations in LBC in relative to those with parents. This study is to explore the effect of parental migration on brain maturation by comparing gray matter volume (GMV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of LBC with well-matched non-LBC. Thirty-eight LBC (21 boys, age=9.60±1.8yrs) and 30 non-LBC (19 boys, age=10.00±1.95yrs) were recruited and underwent brain scans in 3.0 T MR. IQ and other factors including family income, guardians’ educational level and separation time et al., were also acquired. Gray matter volume (GMV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured for each participant and compared between groups using 2-sample t-tests with atlas-based analysis. Compared to non-LBC, LBC exhibited greater GMV in emotional and cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, and altered FA in bilateral superior occipitofrontal fasciculi and right medial lemniscus (P&amp;lt;0.05, Cohen's d&amp;gt;0.89, corrected for false-discovery rate). The increased GMV in bilateral parahippocampi was negatively correlated with IQ. Other factors including family income, guardians’ educational level and separation time were not associated with these brain changes. Our study provides empirical evidence of altered brain structure in LBC compared to non-LBC, responsible for emotion regulation and processing, which may account for mental disorders and negative life outcome of LBC. Our study suggests that absence of direct biological parental care may impact children's brain development. Therefore, public health efforts may be needed to provide additional academic and social/emotional supports to LBC when their parents migrate to seeking better economic circumstances, which has become increasingly common in developing countries.</content>

 The communication of the neurons is maintained by synapses, which play a crucial role in the functioning of the nervous system. Therefore, synaptic failure may impair information processing in the brain, to the extent of the loss of consciousness, as well as may underlie many neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, a number of studies suggested that anesthetics regulate conscious state by affecting synaptic transmission primarily of network hubs and subsequently reducing the coherence in the network activity. Here, we studied network-wide spatio-temporal patterning in scale-free networks with two types of synaptic failure: activity-dependent and activity-independent. Further, we defined scale-free network structures based on the dominating direction of the connections at the hub neurons: incoming and outgoing. We found that the two structures have significantly different dynamical properties. Moreover, synaptic failure may not only lead to the loss of coherence but, under some conditions, also can facilitate its emergence unintuitively. We showed that this is because activity-dependent synaptic failure homogenizes the activity levels in the network creating a dynamical substrate for the observed coherence increase. Our results indicate that coherence breakdown due to the synaptic failure may not be enough to explain the loss of consciousness, but at the same time can lead to such pathologies as epilepsy.</content>
