 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2), which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to the other countries in a short period of time. We report a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to suffering from progressive vertigo and ataxia for 7 days prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar dysfunction, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted edema of the cerebellar hemisphere associated with leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal and CSF specimens. As a result, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated, and patient symptoms and signs improved significantly during the course of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute cerebellitis associated with COVID-19 disease which is reported in the literature so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) can be associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and poor clinical outcome, but whether this holds true for patients with diffuse glioma is unknown. With blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(−): 0.08 ± 0.11 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007 and 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with diffuse glioma is associated with impaired supratentorial cerebrovascular reactivity and worse clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is primarily characterized by migraine, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline. Ataxia has seldom been reported as a presenting symptom. Here, we review reports of CADASIL presenting as ataxia and compare these to the first pathologically confirmed case of CADASIL presenting with progressive ataxia. A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed white matter hyperintensities in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, external capsules, and periventricular areas, but not the cerebellum. Electron microscopy of skin biopsy material revealed multiple granular osmiophilic materials. Genetic testing confirmed a c.4552C &amp;gt; A mutation in exon 25 of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NOTCH3&lt;/em&gt; gene. CADASIL is a rare cause of progressive ataxia, and only four cases of CADASIL presenting with ataxia have been reported in the literature. We also discuss the possible pathophysiology of cerebellar ataxia associated with CADASIL.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Balance control is essential to maintain a stable body position and to prevent falls. The aim of this study was to determine whether balance control could be improved by using cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and visual feedback in a combined approach. A total of 90 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to six groups defined by the delivery of tDCS (cathodal or anodal or sham) and the provision or not of visual feedback on balance during the acquisition phase. tDCS was delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant leg for 20 min at 2 mA during a unipedal stance task. Body sway (i.e., ankle angle and hip position) was measured as an overall maximal unit in anteroposterior and mediolateral direction, together with participant rating of perception of stability, before (baseline), during (acquisition), and after (final) the intervention. We found a reduction in body sway during the acquisition session when visual feedback alone was provided. When the visual feedback was removed (final session), however, body sway increased above baseline. Differently, the reduction in overall maximal body sway was maintained during the final session when the delivery of cathodal tDCS and visual feedback was combined. These findings suggest that cathodal tDCS may support the short-term maintenance of the positive effects of visual feedback on balance and provide the basis for a new approach to optimize balance control, with potential translational implications for the elderly and patients with impaired posture control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Predictive coding accounts of action perception sustain that kinematics information is compared with contextual top-down predictions (i.e., priors) to understand actions in conditions of perceptual ambiguity. It has been previously shown that the cerebellum contributes to motor simulation of observed actions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific contribution of the cerebellum to action perception is to provide contextual priors that guide the sampling of perceptual kinematic information. To this aim, we compared the performance of 42 patients with childhood brain tumor affecting infratentorial (ITT) or supratentorial (STT) areas with that of peers with typical development in an action prediction task. First, participants were exposed to videos depicting a child performing different reaching-to-grasp actions, which were associated with contextual cues in a probabilistic fashion. Then, they were presented with shortened versions of the same videos and asked to infer the action outcome; since kinematics was ambiguous, we expected their responses would be biased toward the previously learned contextual priors. We found that patients with brain tumor were impaired in predicting actions when compared to healthy controls. However, STT patients presented a reliable probabilistic effect, while ITT patients, who had cerebellar damage, did not rely on contextual priors in predicting actions. Furthermore, we found an association between the use of contextual priors and the ability to infer others’ mental states as assessed by a standardized test. These results suggest that the cerebellum provides contextual priors to understand others’ actions and this predictive function might underlie complex social cognition abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by unstable expanded CAG repeats (expCAGs) in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATXN3&lt;/em&gt;. Factors associated with intergenerational instability (delta-expCAG) and genetic anticipation in SCA3 have never been reported in Chinese mainland. Here, we demonstrated that unstable transmissions occurred more often in sons than in daughters (91% vs 72%, Fisher’s exact test, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). The extended delta-expCAG of father-son transmissions was greater than that of mother-son transmissions (3.8 ± 2.3 repeats vs 1.6 ± 1.0 repeats, Mann-Whitney &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;U&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). Genetic anticipation was frequently observed between generations but not affected by the delta-expCAG.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Response inhibition as an executive function refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate but prepotent responses. Several brain regions have been implicated in the process underlying inhibitory control, including the cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in executive functioning, particularly in response inhibition. For this purpose, we transitorily inhibited cerebellar activity by means of cathodal tDCS and studied the effects of this inhibition on ERP components elicited during a Go/NoGo task in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy subjects underwent a Go/NoGo task prior to and after cathodal and sham cerebellar tDCS in separate sessions. A reduction in N2-NoGo amplitude and a prolongation in N2-NoGo latency emerged after cathodal tDCS whereas no differences were detected after sham stimulation. Moreover, commission errors in NoGo trials were significantly higher after cathodal tDCS than at the basal evaluation. No differences emerged between performances in Go trials and those after sham stimulation. These data indicate that cerebellar inhibition following cathodal stimulation alters the ability to allocate attentional resources to stimuli containing conflict information and the inhibitory control. The cerebellum may regulate the attentional mechanisms of stimulus orientation and inhibitory control both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by controlling the functioning of the cerebral cortical areas involved in the perception of conflict signals and of the basal ganglia involved in the inhibitory control of movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Two recent studies have demonstrated that the dendritic Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal associated with a climbing fibre (CF) input to the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) depends on the membrane potential (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;). Specifically, when the cell is hyperpolarised, this signal is mediated by T-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; in contrast, when the cell is firing, the CF-PN signal is mediated by P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. When the CF input is paired with parallel fibre (PF) activity, the signal is locally amplified at the sites of PF-activated synapses according to the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; at the time of the CF input, suggesting that the standing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is a critical parameter for the induction of PF synaptic plasticity. In this review, I analyse how the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can potentially play a role in cerebellar learning focussing, in particular, on the hyperpolarised state that appears to occur episodically, since PNs are mostly firing under physiological conditions. By revisiting the recent literature reporting in vivo recordings and synaptic plasticity studies, I speculate on how a putative role of the PN &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can provide an interpretation for the results of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate lobule-specific cerebellar structural alterations relevant to clinical behavioral characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We performed a case-control study of 21 Japanese individuals with PWS (age; median 21.0, range 13–50 years, 14 males, 7 females) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with typical development. Participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional T&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images were assessed for cerebellar lobular volume and adjusted for total intracerebellar volume (TIV) using a spatially unbiased atlas template to give a relative volume ratio. A region of interest analysis included the deep cerebellar nuclei. A correlation analysis was performed between the volumetric data and the clinical behavioral scores derived from the standard questionnaires (hyperphagia, autism, obsession, and maladaptive index) for global intelligence assessment in paired subgroups. In individuals with PWS, TIV was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected; mean [standard deviation], 1014.1 [93.0] mm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Decreased relative lobular volume ratios were observed in posterior inferior lobules with age, sex, and TIV as covariates (Crus I, Crus II, lobules VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, and IX). However, increased ratios were found in the dentate nuclei bilaterally in individuals with PWS (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); the mean (standard deviation) × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; was as follows: left, 1.58 (0.26); right, 1.67 (0.30). The altered lobular volume ratios showed negative correlations with hyperphagic and autistic characteristics and positive correlations with obsessive and intellectual characteristics. This study provides the first objective evidence of topographic patterns of volume differences in cerebellar structures consistent with clinical behavioral characteristics in individuals with PWS and strongly suggests a cerebellar contribution to altered functional brain connectivity in PWS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Reading in children has been associated with microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the white matter pathways connecting the cerebellum to the cerebrum. In this study, we used two independent neuroimaging modalities to assess which features of the cerebellar peduncles would be associated with reading. Twenty-three 8-year-old children were evaluated on word reading efficiency and imaged using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and quantitative T1 relaxometry (qT1). We segmented the superior (SCP), middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles and extracted two metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) from dMRI and R1 from qT1. Tract-FA was significantly correlated with tract-R1 in left and right SCPs (left: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = .63, right: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = .76, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ .001) suggesting that FA of these peduncles, at least in part, indexed myelin content. Tract-FA and tract R1 were not correlated in the other cerebellar peduncles. Reading efficiency negatively correlated with tract-FA of the left (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = − .43, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .040) and right SCP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = − .37, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .079). Reading efficiency did not correlate with tract-R1 in the SCPs. The negative association of reading efficiency with tract-FA and the lack of association of reading efficiency with tract-R1 implicate properties other than myelin content as relevant to the information flow between the cerebellum and the cerebrum for individual differences in reading skills in children.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Essential tremor (ET) has recently been reconceptualized by many as a degenerative disease of the cerebellum. Until now, though, there has been no attempt to frame it within the context of these diseases. Here, we compare the clinical and postmortem features of ET with other cerebellar degenerations, thereby placing it within the broader context of these diseases. Action tremor is the hallmark feature of ET. Although often underreported in the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), action tremors occur, and it is noteworthy that in SCA12 and 15, they are highly prevalent, often severe, and can be the earliest disease manifestation, resulting in an initial diagnosis of ET in many cases. Intention tremor, sometimes referred to as “cerebellar tremor,” is a common feature of ET and many SCAs. Other features of cerebellar dysfunction, gait ataxia and eye motion abnormalities, are seen to a mild degree in ET and more markedly in SCAs. Several SCAs (e.g., SCA5, 6, 14, and 15), like ET, follow a milder and more protracted disease course. In ET, numerous postmortem changes have been localized to the cerebellum and are largely confined to the cerebellar cortex, preserving the cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje cell loss is modest. Similarly, in SCA3, 12, and 15, Purkinje cell loss is limited, and in SCA12 and 15, there is preservation of cerebellar nuclei and relative sparing of other central nervous system regions. Both clinically and pathologically, there are numerous similarities and intersection points between ET and other disorders of cerebellar degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels contribute to the resting membrane potential of many neurons and play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. Although previous studies have revealed a high expression of GIRK subunits in the cerebellum, their functional role has never been clearly described. Using patch-clamp recordings in mice cerebellar slices, we examined the properties of the GIRK currents in Purkinje cells (PCs) and investigated the effects of a selective agonist of GIRK1-containing channels, ML297 (ML), on PC firing and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that GIRK channel activation decreases the PC excitability by inhibiting both sodium and calcium spikes and, in addition, modulates the complex spike response evoked by climbing fiber stimulation. Our results indicate that GIRK channels have also a marked effect on synaptic plasticity of the parallel fiber-PC synapse, as the application of ML297 increased the expression of LTP while preventing LTD. We, therefore, propose that the recruitment of GIRK channels represents a crucial mechanism by which neuromodulators can control synaptic strength and membrane conductance for proper refinement of the neural network involved in memory storage and higher cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar involvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies, but it is unknown whether cognitive functioning in depressed individuals is related to cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. Impaired attention and executive dysfunction are characteristic cognitive deficits in MDD, and critically, they often persist despite remission of mood symptoms. In this study, we investigated cerebellar GMV in patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) that showed persistent cognitive impairment. We applied cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry in 37 patients with rMDD and with cognitive deficits, in 12 patients with rMDD and without cognitive deficits, and in 36 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, rMDD patients with cognitive deficits had lower GMV in left area VIIA, crus II, and in vermal area VIIB. In patients with rMDD, regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between GMV reductions in both regions and impaired attention and executive dysfunction. Compared with HC, patients without cognitive deficits showed increased GMV in bilateral area VIIIB. This study supports cerebellar contributions to the cognitive dimension of MDD. The data also point towards cerebellar area VII as a potential target for non-invasive brain stimulation to treat cognitive deficits related to MDD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The traditional view on the cerebellum is that it controls motor behavior. Although recent work has revealed that the cerebellum supports also nonmotor functions such as cognition and affect, only during the last 5 years it has become evident that the cerebellum also plays an important social role. This role is evident in social cognition based on interpreting goal-directed actions through the movements of individuals (social “mirroring”) which is very close to its original role in motor learning, as well as in social understanding of other individuals’ mental state, such as their intentions, beliefs, past behaviors, future aspirations, and personality traits (social “mentalizing”). Most of this mentalizing role is supported by the posterior cerebellum (e.g., Crus I and II). The most dominant hypothesis is that the cerebellum assists in learning and understanding social action sequences, and so facilitates social cognition by supporting optimal predictions about imminent or future social interaction and cooperation. This consensus paper brings together experts from different fields to discuss recent efforts in understanding the role of the cerebellum in social cognition, and the understanding of social behaviors and mental states by others, its effect on clinical impairments such as cerebellar ataxia and autism spectrum disorder, and how the cerebellum can become a potential target for noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most recent empirical findings and techniques for understanding and manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans. Cerebellar circuitry appears now as a key structure to elucidate social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a multifactorial disorder caused by environmental and genetic factors. Studies have shown that various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the binding sites of microRNAs contribute to the risk of developing SCZ. We aimed to investigate whether the variants located in the 3′-UTR region of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LIF&lt;/em&gt; (rs929271T&amp;gt;G) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATF6B&lt;/em&gt; (rs8283G&amp;gt;A) were associated with increased susceptibility to SCZ in a population from the south-east of Iran. In this case-control study, a total of 396 subjects were recruited. SNPs were genotyped via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Genotyping results showed that the G allele of rs929271 significantly increased the risk of SCZ (OR = 1.58 95%CI = 1.19–2.10, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). As for rs929271, the GG genotype of co-dominant (OR = 2.54 95%CI = 1.39–4.64, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002) and recessive (OR = 2.91 95%CI = 1.77–4.80, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) models were strongly linked to SCZ. No significant differences were observed between rs8283 polymorphism and predisposition to SCZ. In silico analyses predicted that rs929271 might alter the binding sites of microRNAs, which was believed to have an unclear role in the development of SCZ. Moreover, rs929271 polymorphism changed the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LIF&lt;/em&gt;-mRNA folding structure. These findings provide fine pieces of evidence regarding the possible effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LIF&lt;/em&gt; polymorphism in the development of SCZ and regulation of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LIF&lt;/em&gt; gene targeted by microRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; is a member of the WD40 repeat-containing gene family. Mutations of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; have been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Although the phenotypes of some patients have been described in single studies, few studies have reviewed the genotype and phenotype relationships using a relatively large cohort of patients with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. Herein, we report a new de novo frameshift mutation in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; (NM_024665.4, c.388_389delAC, p.T130Sfs*14) in a patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To explore the correlations between genotypes and phenotypes for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; in NDDs, we manually curated and analyzed 38 variants and the associated phenotypes from 50 individuals with NDDs. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; mutations lead to a wide range of phenotypic defects. We conclude that the most common phenotypes associated with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; mutations were language and motor developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, facial deformity, hypotonia, and microcephaly. Our study provides a comprehensive spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes caused by &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; mutations, which is important for genetic diagnosis and precision clinical management.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disease that causes acute or chronic hemolytic anemia and potentially leads to severe jaundice in response to oxidative agents. Capicua transcriptional repressor (CIC) is an important gene associated with mental retardation, autosomal dominant 45. Affiliated tissues including skin, brain, bone, and related phenotypes are intellectual disability and seizures. Clinical, biochemical, and whole exome analysis are carried out in a Turkish family. Mutation analysis of G6PD and CIC genes by Sanger sequencing in the whole family was carried out to reveal the effect of these mutations on the patient’s clinical outcome. Here, we present the case of epilepsy in an 8-year-old child with a hemizygous variation in G6PD gene and heterozygous mutation in CIC gene, resulting in focal epileptiform activity and hypsarrhythmia in electroencephalography (EEG), seizures, psychomotor retardation, speech impairment, intellectual disability, developmental regression, and learning difficulties. Whole exome sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of X-linked increased susceptibility for hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency and mental retardation type 45 due to CIC variant, which explained the development of epileptic seizures. Considering CIC variant and relevant relation with the severity and course of the disease, G6PD mutations sustained through the family are defined as hereditary. Our findings could represent the importance of variants found in G6PD as well as CIC genes linked to the severity of epilepsy, which was presumed based on the significant changes in protein configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ketamine is a recreational drug that causes emotional and cognitive impairments, but its specific mechanisms of action are still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that Tau protein phosphorylation and targeted delivery to the postsynaptic area are closely related to its neurotoxicity, and our recent studies have shown that long-term ketamine administration causes excessive Tau protein phosphorylation. However, the regulatory mechanism of Tau protein phosphorylation induced by ketamine has not been clarified. In the present study, we administered a single ketamine injection and long-term (6 months) ketamine injections in C57BL/6 mice, to investigate the effects of different doses of ketamine on the expression levels of Tau protein and its phosphorylation, the expression levels and activities of the related protein phosphokinases GSK-3β and CDK5, and the expression levels and activities of the related protein phosphatases PP2A and PP2B in the mouse hippocampus. Our results showed that both single-dose and long-term ketamine administration induced excessive phosphorylation of the Tau protein at ser202/thr205 and ser396. A single ketamine administration caused an increase in the activity of GSK-3β (at high doses) and a decrease in the activity of PP2A. On the other hand, long-term ketamine administration resulted in an increase in the activities of GSK-3β (at high doses) and CDK5, and a decrease in the activity of PP2A. Our results indicate that GSK-3β, CDK5, and PP2A may be involved in ketamine-induced Tau protein phosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To understand the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1)-PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) signaling pathway on the cognitive function of sevoflurane-anesthetized aged rats. Aged rats were divided into Normal group, Sevo group (Sevoflurane anesthesia), Sevo + AICAR (the AMPK activator) group, Sevo + EX527 group (the AMPK inhibitor), and Sevo + AICAR + EX527 group. The cognitive function of rats was determined by the Morris water maze. Hippocampal neuronal apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was detected by immunohistochemistry. ROS, SOD, and MDA levels and the fluorescence intensity of GFAP in the hippocampus were assayed. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial mass, ATP level, and the expression of AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α were determined by the corresponding methods. Rats in the Sevo group manifested significant extension in the escape latency, with fewer platform crossings; and meanwhile, the apoptotic rate, the number of FJC-positive cells, and the fluorescence intensity of GFAP of neurons were elevated, with up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, the level of MDA and ROS was increased evidently, with significant down-regulation of SOD activity, ATP, mitochondrial mass and MMP levels, and AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC-1α protein expressions. However, sevoflurane-induced changes above were improved after the administration of AICAR, and EX527 could reverse AICAR-induced improvements in Sevo-anesthetized aged rats. Activating AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α pathway can improve the cognitive function and mitigate the neuronal injury in Sevo-anesthetized aged rats by antagonizing the oxidative stress and maintaining the mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sepsis can induce acute and chronic changes in the central nervous system termed sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Not only cognitive deficits but also anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder are common in severe sepsis survivors. In this study, we demonstrated that amitriptyline, a classic tricyclic antidepressant, reduced sepsis-induced brain damage through the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) signaling pathway. Amitriptyline ameliorated neuronal loss assessed by Nissl staining in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)–induced sepsis model. Furthermore, amitriptyline reduced early gliosis assessed by immunofluorescence and late cognitive deficits assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Moreover, amitriptyline treatment attenuated oxidative stress indicated by less superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity consumption and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. Interestingly, those protective effects of amitriptyline could be abolished by GW441756, a TrkA signaling pathway inhibitor. Immunoblot directly showed that TrkA signaling pathway–associated proteins, such as Akt and GSK3β, were involved in the neuroprotective effects of amitriptyline. Thus, amitriptyline appears to be an encouraging candidate to treat cognitive deficits and depression after severe sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Endothelial dysfunction greatly contributes to microcirculation disorder. The role of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in cerebral microcirculation was explored in vitro. LPS (0.5 or 1 μg/ml) was added to induce injury in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC/D3). CCK-8 was applied to check viabilities of HCMEC/D3 before and after LPS treatment. Western blot witnessed the changes in protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α. Caspase-3/7 activity was analyzed and so were the protein expressions of pro-apoptotic gene BAX and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. mRNA expressions of eNOS and GTPCH1 were evaluated by RT-qPCR. After overexpressing eNOS or GTPCH1 in LPS-induced HCMEC/D3 cells, viabilities, inflammatory cytokines, caspase-3/7 activity, and apoptosis-related genes were detected. The modulation of PGE1 in eNOS and GTPCH1 production, viability, inflammation, and apoptosis was investigated. The inhibitor of eNOS or GTPCH1 was introduced to examine impacts of eNOS or GTPCH1 could have on the PGE1 function. LPS decreased cell viabilities, eNOS and GTPCH1 expression, and promoted inflammation and apoptosis in HCMEC/D3 cells. Overexpressed eNOS or GTPCH1 promoted cell viabilities and suppressed inflammation and apoptosis. PGE1 enhanced viability and decreased inflammation and apoptosis in cells treated by LPS. PGE1 activated eNOS and GTPCH1 and inhibition of eNOS or GTPCH1 led to the attenuation of the protective functions of PGE1 in LPS-induced cells. PGE1 protected HCMEC/D3 cells from injuries induced by LPS by activation of eNOS and GTPCH1, suggesting that PGE1 might be used to help maintain cerebral microcirculation in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We propose a model-agnostic pipeline to recover graph signals from an expert
system by exploiting the content addressable memory property of restricted
Boltzmann machine and the representational ability of a neural network. The
proposed pipeline requires the deep neural network that is trained on a
downward machine learning task with clean data, data which is free from any
form of corruption or incompletion. We show that denoising the representations
learned by the deep neural networks is usually more effective than denoising
the data itself. Although this pipeline can deal with noise in any dataset, it
is particularly effective for graph-structured datasets.

 &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, deep convolutional networks have become the reference
for many machine learning tasks, especially in computer vision. However, large
computational needs make them hard to deploy on resource-constrained hardware.
Pruning has emerged as a standard way to compress such large networks. Yet, the
severe perturbation caused by most pruning approaches is thought to hinder
their efficacy. Drawing inspiration from Lagrangian Smoothing, we introduce a
new technique, Selective Weight Decay (SWD), which achieves continuous pruning
throughout training. Our approach deviates significantly from most methods of
the literature as it relies on a principle that can be applied in many
different ways, for any problem, network or pruning structure. We show that SWD
compares favorably to other approaches in terms of performance/parameters ratio
on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet ILSVRC2012 datasets. On CIFAR-10 and unstructured
pruning, with a parameters target of 0.1%, SWD attains a Top-1 accuracy of
81.32% while the reference method only reaches 27.78%. On CIFAR-10 and
structured pruning, with a parameters target of 2.5%, the reference technique
drops at 10% (random guess) while SWD maintains the Top-1 accuracy at 93.22%.
On the ImageNet ILSVRC2012 dataset with unstructured pruning, for a parameters
targer of 2.5%, SWD attains 84.6% Top-5 accuracy instead of the 77.07% reached
by the reference.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative
disease causing parkinsonian symptoms. Altered DNA methylation of the
microtubule-associated protein tau gene correlates with the expression changes
in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease brains. However, few studies
examine the sequences beyond the constitutive promoter.Objectives: Because
activating different microtubule associated protein tau gene control regions
via methylation might regulate the differential tau expression constituting the
specific signatures of individual tauopathies, we compared methylation of a
candidate promoter, intron 0.Methods: We assessed DNA methylation in the brains
of patients with different tauopathies (35 Alzheimer's disease, 10 corticobasal
degeneration, and 18 PSP) and 19 controls by intron 0 pyrosequencing. We also
evaluated methylation in an independent cohort of 11 PSP cases and 12 controls.
Frontal (affected by tau pathology) and occipital (unaffected) cortices were
analyzed.Results: In the initial samples, one CpG island site in intron 0
(CpG1) showed significant hypomethylation in PSP-affected frontal cortices when
compared with controls (p = 0.022). Such hypomethylation was observed in
replicate samples, but not in occipital cortices or other tauopathies. PSP and
control samples (combining the initial and replicate samples) remained
significantly different after adjustment for potential confounding factors
(age, H1/H1 diplotype; p = 0.0005). PSP-affected tissues exhibited
microtubule-associated protein tau RNA hyperexpression when compared with
controls (p = 0.004), although no correlation with CpG1 methylation was
observed.Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that regions other than
the constitutive promoter may be involved in microtubule-associated protein tau
gene regulation in tauopathies and that intron 0 hypomethylation may be a
specific epigenetic signature of PSP. These preliminary findings require
confirmation.

 &lt;p&gt;Logic locking is a prominent technique to protect the integrity of hardware
designs throughout the integrated circuit design and fabrication flow. However,
in recent years, the security of locking schemes has been thoroughly challenged
by the introduction of various deobfuscation attacks. As in most research
branches, deep learning is being introduced in the domain of logic locking as
well. Therefore, in this paper we present SnapShot: a novel attack on logic
locking that is the first of its kind to utilize artificial neural networks to
directly predict a key bit value from a locked synthesized gate-level netlist
without using a golden reference. Hereby, the attack uses a simpler yet more
flexible learning model compared to existing work. Two different approaches are
evaluated. The first approach is based on a simple feedforward fully connected
neural network. The second approach utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve more
complex convolutional neural network architectures specialized for the given
task. The attack flow offers a generic and customizable framework for attacking
locking schemes using machine learning techniques. We perform an extensive
evaluation of SnapShot for two realistic attack scenarios, comprising both
reference benchmark circuits as well as silicon-proven RISC-V core modules. The
evaluation results show that SnapShot achieves an average key prediction
accuracy of 82.60% for the selected attack scenario, with a significant
performance increase of 10.49 percentage points compared to the state of the
art. Moreover, SnapShot outperforms the existing technique on all evaluated
benchmarks. The results indicate that the security foundation of common logic
locking schemes is build on questionable assumptions. The conclusions of the
evaluation offer insights into the challenges of designing future logic locking
schemes that are resilient to machine learning attacks.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Homozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are associated with
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 11 (CLN11), a rare lysosomal-storage disorder
characterized by cerebellar ataxia, seizures, retinitis pigmentosa, and
cognitive disorders, usually beginning between 13 and 25 years of age. This is
a rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast,
heterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia
associated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified
homozygous GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much
broader than previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations,
depending on the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by
classical CLN11 symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly, other
homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal
dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar
ataxia. Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not
have the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of
some mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma
progranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a
homozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is
a new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on
replacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous
carrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease.
Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43
cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous
mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43
pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing
observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some
neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process
preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study
has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis.
Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic
counseling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as
they are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More
broadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to
different phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a
challenge for genetic diagnosis.

 &lt;p&gt;Recently, numerous meta-heuristic based approaches are deliberated to reduce
the computational complexities of several existing approaches that include
tricky derivations, very large memory space requirement, initial value
sensitivity etc. However, several optimization algorithms namely firefly
algorithm, sine cosine algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm have
few drawbacks such as computational complexity, convergence speed etc. So to
overcome such shortcomings, this paper aims in developing a novel Chaotic Sine
Cosine Firefly (CSCF) algorithm with numerous variants to solve optimization
problems. Here, the chaotic form of two algorithms namely the sine cosine
algorithm (SCA) and the Firefly (FF) algorithms are integrated to improve the
convergence speed and efficiency thus minimizing several complexity issues.
Moreover, the proposed CSCF approach is operated under various chaotic phases
and the optimal chaotic variants containing the best chaotic mapping is
selected. Then numerous chaotic benchmark functions are utilized to examine the
system performance of the CSCF algorithm. Finally, the simulation results for
the problems based on engineering design are demonstrated to prove the
efficiency, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

 &lt;p&gt;Storytelling plays a central role in human socializing and entertainment.
However, much of the research on automatic storytelling generation assumes that
stories will be generated by an agent without any human interaction. In this
paper, we introduce the task of collaborative storytelling, where an artificial
intelligence agent and a person collaborate to create a unique story by taking
turns adding to it. We present a collaborative storytelling system which works
with a human storyteller to create a story by generating new utterances based
on the story so far. We constructed the storytelling system by tuning a
publicly-available large scale language model on a dataset of writing prompts
and their accompanying fictional works. We identify generating sufficiently
human-like utterances to be an important technical issue and propose a
sample-and-rank approach to improve utterance quality. Quantitative evaluation
shows that our approach outperforms a baseline, and we present qualitative
evaluation of our system's capabilities.

 &lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks are among the most widely applied machine learning tools
showing outstanding performance in a broad range of tasks. We present a method
for folding a deep neural network of arbitrary size into a single neuron with
multiple time-delayed feedback loops. This single-neuron deep neural network
comprises only a single nonlinearity and appropriately adjusted modulations of
the feedback signals. The network states emerge in time as a temporal unfolding
of the neuron's dynamics. By adjusting the feedback-modulation within the
loops, we adapt the network's connection weights. These connection weights are
determined via a modified back-propagation algorithm that we designed for such
types of networks. Our approach fully recovers standard Deep Neural Networks
(DNN), encompasses sparse DNNs, and extends the DNN concept toward dynamical
systems implementations. The new method, which we call Folded-in-time DNN
(Fit-DNN), exhibits promising performance in a set of benchmark tasks.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity quantifies the statistical dependencies between the
activity of brain regions, measured using neuroimaging data such as functional
MRI BOLD time series. The network representation of functional connectivity,
called a Functional Connectome (FC), has been shown to contain an individual
fingerprint allowing participants identification across consecutive testing
sessions. Recently, researchers have focused on the extraction of these
fingerprints, with potential applications in personalized medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that a mathematical operation denominated degree-normalization
can improve the extraction of FC fingerprints. Degree-normalization has the
effect of reducing the excessive influence of strongly connected brain areas in
the whole-brain network. We adopt the differential identifiability framework
and apply it to both original and degree-normalized FCs of 409 individuals from
the Human Connectome Project, in resting-state and 7 fMRI tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that degree-normalization systematically improves three
fingerprinting metrics, namely differential identifiability, identification
rate and matching rate. Moreover, the results related to the matching rate
metric suggest that individual fingerprints are embedded in a low-dimensional
space.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that low-dimensional functional fingerprints lie in part
in weakly connected subnetworks of the brain, and that degree-normalization
helps uncovering them. This work introduces a simple mathematical operation
that could lead to significant improvements in future FCs fingerprinting
studies.

 &lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia (SCZ) is an inherited disease, with the familial risk being among the most important factors when evaluating an individual’s risk for SCZ. However, robust imaging biomarkers for the disease that can be used for diagnosis and determination of the prognosis are lacking. Here, we explore the potential of functional connectivity (FC) for use as a biomarker for the early detection of high-risk first-degree relatives (FDRs). Thirty-eight first-episode SCZ patients, 38 healthy controls (HCs), and 33 FDRs were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The subjects’ brains were parcellated into 200 regions using the Craddock atlas, and the FC between each pair of regions was used as a classification feature. Multivariate pattern analysis using leave-one-out cross-validation achieved a correct classification rate of 88.15% [sensitivity 84.06%, specificity 92.18%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.93] for differentiating SCZ patients from HCs. FC located within the default mode, frontal-parietal, auditory, and sensorimotor networks contributed mostly to the accurate classification. The FC patterns of each FDR were input into each classification model as test data to obtain a corresponding prediction label (a total of 76 individual classification scores), and the averaged individual classification score was then used as a robust measure to characterize whether each FDR showed an SCZ-type or HC-type FC pattern. A significant negative correlation was found between the average classification scores of the FDRs and their semantic fluency scores. These findings suggest that FC combined with a machine learning algorithm could help to predict whether FDRs are likely to show an SCZ-specific or HC-specific FC pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The tsunami effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting many aspects of scientific activities. Multidisciplinary experimental studies with international collaborators are hindered by the closing of the national borders, logistic issues due to lockdown, quarantine restrictions, and social distancing requirements. The full impact of this crisis on science is not clear yet, but the above-mentioned issues have most certainly restrained academic research activities. Sharing innovative solutions between researchers is in high demand in this situation. The aim of this paper is to share our successful practice of using web-based communication and remote control software for real-time long-distance control of brain stimulation. This solution may guide and encourage researchers to cope with restrictions and has the potential to help expanding international collaborations by lowering travel time and costs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Afferents from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are a major source of input into the ventral pallidum (VP). Research reveals that these afferents are GABAergic, however, stimulation of these afferents induces both excitatory and inhibitory responses within the VP. These are likely to be partially mediated by enkephalin and substance P (SP), which are also released by these afferents, and are known to modulate VP neurons. However, less is known about the potentially differential effects stimulation of these afferents has on subpopulations of neurons within the VP and the cellular mechanisms by which they exert their effects. The current study aimed to research this further using brain slices containing the VP, stimulation of the NAc afferents, and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings of their VP targets. Stimulation of the NAc afferents induced a pause in the tonic firing in 58% of the neurons studied in the VP, while 42% were not affected. Measures used to reveal the electrophysiological difference between these groups found no significant differences in firing frequency, coefficient of variation, and spike half-width. There were however significant differences in the pause duration between neurons in the dorsal and ventral VP, with stimulation of NAc afferents producing a significantly longer pause (0.48 ± 0.06 s) in tonic firing in dorsal VP neurons, compared to neurons in the ventral VP (0.21 ± 0.09 s). Pauses in the tonic firing of VP neurons, as a result of NAc afferent stimulation, were found to be largely mediated by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, as the application of picrotoxin significantly reduced their duration. Opioid agonists and antagonists were found to have no significant effects on the pause in tonic activity induced by NAc afferent stimulation. However, NK-1 receptor antagonists caused significant decreases in the pause duration, suggesting that SP may contribute to the inhibitory effect of NAc afferent stimulation via activation of NK-1 receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Worldwide environmental tragedies of anthropogenic origin causing massive release of metals and other pollutants have been increasing considerably. These pollution outbreaks affect the ecosystems and impact human health. Among those tragedies, recent large-scale environmental disasters in Brazil strongly affected riverside populations, leading to high-risk exposure to methylmercury (MeHg). MeHg is highly neurotoxic to the developing brain. This toxicant causes neural stem cell dysfunction and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. However, less is known about the effects of MeHg in the postnatal neurogenic niche, which harbors neural stem cells and their progeny, in the adult brain. Therefore, taking in consideration the impact of MeHg in human health it is urgent to clarify possible associations between exposure to mercury, accelerated cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this perspectives paper, we discuss the neurotoxic mechanisms of MeHg on postnatal neurogenesis and the putative implications associated with accelerated brain aging and early-onset cognitive decline in populations highly exposed to this environmental neurotoxicant.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Frontostriatal disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), are characterized by progressive disruption of cortico-subcortical dopaminergic loops involved in diverse higher-order domains, including language. Indeed, syntactic and emotional language tasks have emerged as potential biomarkers of frontostriatal disturbances. However, relevant studies and models have typically considered these linguistic dimensions in isolation, overlooking the potential advantages of targeting multidimensional markers. Here, we examined whether patient classification can be improved through the joint assessment of both dimensions using sentential stimuli. We evaluated 31 early PD patients and 24 healthy controls via two syntactic measures (functional-role assignment, parsing of long-distance dependencies) and a verbal task tapping social emotions (envy, Schadenfreude) and compared their classification accuracy when analyzed in isolation and in combination. Complementarily, we replicated our approach to discriminate between patients on and off medication. Results showed that specific measures of each dimension were selectively impaired in PD. In particular, joint analysis of outcomes in functional-role assignment and Schadenfreude improved the classification accuracy of patients and controls, irrespective of their overall cognitive and affective state. These results suggest that multidimensional linguistic assessments may better capture the complexity and multi-functional impact of frontostriatal disruptions, highlighting their potential contributions in the ongoing quest for sensitive markers of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;White matter lesions induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion are associated with cognitive impairment in vascular dementia (VaD). Previous studies have shown that acupuncture can ameliorate the cognitive deficits of individuals with VaD. However, the neuroimaging mechanisms of acupuncture on white matter perfusion and integrity remain elusive. In this study, the VaD model was induced by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (BCCAO) in rats. Novel object recognition task and Morris water maze were performed to evaluate short-term memory and spatial learning and memory. Arterial spin labeling and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the white matter integrity. Pathological examinations detected the myelin loss and concomitant neuroinflammation. The results demonstrate that BCCAO rats with reduced CBF exhibited worse performance and altered DTI parameters, including decreased fractional anisotropy, increased radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity in white matter regions. Acupuncture ameliorated cognitive impairment, increased CBF, and protected the myelin sheath integrity but not the axons of BCCAO rats. These protective effects of acupuncture on white matter were significantly correlated with improved CBF. Pathological examination confirmed that the loss of myelin basic protein and microglial accumulation associated IL-1β and IL-6 production were attenuated by acupuncture treatment. Our findings suggest that acupuncture protects cognitive function of BCCAO rats by improving white matter perfusion and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It may be caused by oxidative stress, inflammation, and cerebrovascular dysfunctions in the brain. LongShengZhi Capsule (LSZ), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease. LSZ contains several neuroprotective ingredients, including Hirudo, Astmgali Radix, Carthami Flos (Honghua), Persicae Semen (Taoren), Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma (Shichangpu), and Acanthopanax Senticosus (Ciwujia). In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of LSZ on the AD process. Double transgenic mice expressing the amyloid-β precursor protein and mutant human presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) to model AD were treated with LSZ for 7 months starting at 2 months of age. LSZ significantly improved the cognition of the mice without adverse effects, indicating its high degree of safety and efficacy after a long-term treatment. LSZ reduced AD biomarker Aβ plaque accumulation by inhibiting β-secretase and γ-secretase gene expression. LSZ also reduced p-Tau expression, cell death, and inflammation in the brain. Consistently, in vitro, LSZ ethanol extract enhanced neuronal viability by reducing L-glutamic acid-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in HT-22 cells. LSZ exerted antioxidative effects by enhancing superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase expression, reduced Aβ accumulation by inhibiting β-secretase and γ-secretase mRNA expression, and decreased p-Tau level by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated inflammation. It also demonstrated neuroprotective effects by regulating the Fas cell surface death receptor/B-cell lymphoma 2/p53 pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrates the antioxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects of LSZ in the AD-like pathological process and suggests it could be a potential medicine for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is widely distributed and involved in the regulation of the nervous system. The phosphorylation of α-Syn at serine 129 (p&lt;sup&gt;Ser129&lt;/sup&gt;α-Syn) is known to be closely associated with α-Synucleinopathies, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to explore the α-Syn accumulation and its phosphorylation in the enteric nervous system (ENS) in patients without neurodegeneration. Patients who underwent colorectal surgery for either malignant or benign tumors that were not suitable for endoscopic resection (n = 19) were recruited to obtain normal intestinal specimens, which were used to assess α-Syn immunoreactivity patterns using α-Syn and p&lt;sup&gt;Ser129&lt;/sup&gt;α-Syn antibodies. Furthermore, the sub-location of α-Syn in neurons was identified by α-Syn/neurofilament double staining. Semi-quantitative counting was used to evaluate the expression of α-Syn and p&lt;sup&gt;Ser129&lt;/sup&gt;α-Syn in the ENS. Positive staining of α-Syn was detected in all intestinal layers in patients with non-neurodegenerative diseases. There was no significant correlation between the distribution of α-Syn and age (p = 0.554) or tumor stage (p = 0.751). Positive staining for p&lt;sup&gt;Ser129&lt;/sup&gt;α-Syn was only observed in the submucosa and myenteric plexus layers. The accumulation of p&lt;sup&gt;Ser129&lt;/sup&gt;α-Syn increased with age. In addition, we found that the degenerative changes of the ENS were related to the degree of tumor malignancy (p = 0.022). The deposits of α-Syn were present in the ENS of patients with non-neurodegenerative disorders; particularly the age-dependent expression of p&lt;sup&gt;Ser129&lt;/sup&gt;α-Syn in the submucosa and myenteric plexus. The current findings of α-Syn immunostaining in the ENS under near non-pathological conditions weaken the basis of using α-Syn pathology as a suitable hallmark to diagnose α-Synucleinopathies including PD. However, our data provided unique perspectives to study gastrointestinal dysfunction in non-neurodegenerative disorders. These findings provide new evidence to elucidate the neuropathological characteristics and α-Syn pathology pattern of the ENS in non-neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathophysiology (SNAP) refers to the subjects who feature negative β-amyloid (Aβ) but positive tau or neurodegeneration biomarkers. It accounts for a quarter of the elderly population and is associated with cognitive decline. However, the underlying pathophysiology is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We included 111 non-demented subjects, then classified them into three groups using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ 1–42 (A), phosphorylated tau 181 (T), and total tau (N). Specifically, we identified the normal control (NC; subjects with normal biomarkers, A-T-N-), SNAP (subjects with normal amyloid but abnormal tau, A−T+), and predementia Alzheimer’s disease (AD; subjects with abnormal amyloid and tau, A+T+). Then, we used the static amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (sALFF) and dynamic ALFF (dALFF) variance to reflect the intrinsic functional network strength and stability, respectively. Further, we performed a correlation analysis to explore the possible relationship between intrinsic brain activity changes and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: SNAP showed decreased sALFF in left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) while increased sALFF in left insula as compared to NC. Regarding the dynamic metric, SNAP showed a similarly decreased dALFF in the left SFG and left paracentral lobule as compared to NC. By contrast, when compared to NC, predementia AD showed decreased sALFF in left inferior parietal gyrus (IPG) and right precuneus, while increased sALFF in the left insula, with more widely distributed decreased dALFF variance across the frontal, parietal and occipital lobe. When directly compared to SNAP, predementia AD showed decreased sALFF in left middle occipital gyrus and IPG, while showing decreased dALFF variance in the left temporal pole. Further correlation analysis showed that increased sALFF in the insula had a negative correlation with the general cognition in the SNAP group. Besides, sALFF and dALFF variance in the right precuneus negatively correlated with attention in the predementia AD group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: SNAP and predementia AD show distinct functional impairment patterns. Specifically, SNAP has functional impairments that are confined to the frontal region, which is usually spared in early-stage AD, while predementia AD exhibits widely distributed functional damage involving the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 The ability of epithelial tissues to heal after injury is essential for animal life, yet the mechanisms by which epithelial cells sense tissue damage are incompletely understood. In aquatic organisms such as zebrafish, osmotic shock following injury is believed to be an early and potent activator of a wound response. We find that, in addition to sensing osmolarity, basal skin cells in zebrafish larvae are also sensitive to changes in the particular ionic composition of their surroundings after wounding, specifically the concentration of sodium chloride in the immediate vicinity of the wound. This sodium chloride-specific wound detection mechanism is independent of cell swelling, and instead is suggestive of a mechanism by which cells sense changes in the transepithelial electrical potential generated by the transport of sodium and chloride ions across the skin. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that electric fields directly applied within the skin are sufficient to initiate actin polarization and migration of basal cells in their native epithelial context &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, even overriding endogenous wound signaling. This suggests that, in order to mount a robust wound response, skin cells respond to both osmotic and electrical perturbations arising from tissue injury.</content>

 From cellular activation to drug combinations, immunological responses are shaped by the action of multiple stimuli. Synergistic and antagonistic interactions between stimuli play major roles in shaping immune processes. To understand combinatorial regulation, we present the immune Synergistic/Antagonistic Interaction Learner (iSAIL). iSAIL includes a machine learning classifier to map and interpret interactions, a curated compendium of immunological combination treatment datasets, and their global integration into a landscape of ~30,000 interactions. The landscape is mined to reveal combinatorial control of interleukins, checkpoints, and other immune modulators. The resource helps elucidate the modulation of a stimulus by interactions with other cofactors, showing that TNF has strikingly different effects depending on co-stimulators. We discover new functional synergies between TNF and IFNβ controlling dendritic cell-T cell crosstalk. Analysis of laboratory or public combination treatment studies with this user-friendly web-based resource will help resolve the complex role of interaction effects on immune processes.</content>

 Sense of coherence (SoC) is the origin of health according to Antonovsky. The link between SoC and risk of cancer has however rarely been assessed. We performed a cohort study of 46,436 women from the Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (Karma). Participants answered a SoC-13 questionnaire at recruitment to Karma and were subsequently followed up for incident breast cancer. Multivariate Cox models were used to assess the hazard ratios (HRs) of breast cancer in relation to SoC. We identified 771 incident cases of breast cancer during follow-up (median time: 5.2 years). No association was found between SoC, either as a categorical (strong vs. weak SoC, HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.90-1.29) or continuous (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00-1.17 per standard deviation increase of SoC) variable, and risk of breast cancer. In summary, we found little evidence to support an association between SoC and risk of breast cancer.</content>

 Complex cognitive functions such as working memory and decision-making require information maintenance over seconds to years, from transient sensory stimuli to long-term contextual cues. While theoretical accounts predict the emergence of a corresponding hierarchy of neuronal timescales, direct electrophysiological evidence across the human cortex is lacking. Here, we infer neuronal timescales from invasive intracranial recordings. Timescales increase along the principal sensorimotor-to-association axis across the entire human cortex, and scale with single-unit timescales within macaques. Cortex-wide transcriptomic analysis shows direct alignment between timescales and expression of excitation- and inhibition-related genes, as well as genes specific to voltage-gated transmembrane ion transporters. Finally, neuronal timescales are functionally dynamic: prefrontal cortex timescales expand during working memory maintenance and predict individual performance, while cortex-wide timescales compress with aging. Thus, neuronal timescales follow cytoarchitectonic gradients across the human cortex, and are relevant for cognition in both short- and long-terms, bridging microcircuit physiology with macroscale dynamics and behavior.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Several virulence lipids populate the outer cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria (Jackson, 2014). Phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), one of the most abundant outer membrane lipids (Anderson, 1929), plays important roles in both defending against host antimicrobial programs (Camacho et al., 2001; Cox et al., 1999; Murry et al., 2009) and in evading these programs altogether (Cambier et al., 2014a; Rousseau et al., 2004). Immediately following infection, mycobacteria rely on PDIM to evade Myd88-dependent recruitment of microbicidal monocytes which can clear infection (Cambier et al., 2014b). To circumvent the limitations in using genetics to understand virulence lipids, we developed a chemical approach to track PDIM during &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; infection of zebrafish. We found that PDIM's methyl-branched lipid tails enabled it to spread into host epithelial membranes to prevent immune activation. Additionally, PDIM's affinity for cholesterol promoted this phenotype; treatment of zebrafish with statins, cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, decreased spreading and provided protection from infection. This work establishes that interactions between host and pathogen lipids influence mycobacterial infectivity and suggests the use of statins as tuberculosis preventive therapy by inhibiting PDIM spread.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is targeted in the treatment of B-cell disorders including leukemias and lymphomas. Currently approved BTK inhibitors, including Ibrutinib, a first-in-class covalent inhibitor of BTK, bind directly to the kinase active site. While effective at blocking the catalytic activity of BTK, consequences of drug binding on the global conformation of full-length BTK are unknown. Here we uncover a range of conformational effects in full-length BTK induced by a panel of active site inhibitors, including large-scale shifts in the conformational equilibria of the regulatory domains. Additionally, we find that a remote Ibrutinib resistance mutation, T316A in the BTK SH2 domain, drives spurious BTK activity by destabilizing the compact autoinhibitory conformation of full-length BTK, shifting the conformational ensemble away from the autoinhibited form. Future development of BTK inhibitors will need to consider long-range allosteric consequences of inhibitor binding, including the emerging application of these BTK inhibitors in treating COVID-19.</content>

 Chimpanzees are among the closest living relatives to humans and, as such, provide a crucial comparative model for investigating primate brain evolution. In recent years, human brain mapping has strongly benefited from enhanced computational models and image processing pipelines that could also improve data analyses in animals by using species-specific templates. In this study, we use structural MRI data from the National Chimpanzee Brain Resource (NCBR) to develop the chimpanzee brain reference template Juna.Chimp for spatial registration and the macro-anatomical brain parcellation Davi130 for standardized whole-brain analysis. Additionally, we introduce a ready-to-use image processing pipeline built upon the CAT12 toolbox in SPM12, implementing a standard human image preprocessing framework in chimpanzees. Applying this approach to data from 194 subjects, we find strong evidence for human-like age-related gray matter atrophy in multiple regions of the chimpanzee brain, as well as, a general rightward asymmetry in brain regions.</content>

 Sustained changes in mood or action require persistent changes in neural activity, but it has been difficult to identify the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie persistent activity and contribute to long-lasting changes in behavior. Here, we show that a subset of Doublesex+ pC1 neurons in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; female brain, called pC1d/e, can drive minutes-long changes in female behavior in the presence of males. Using automated reconstruction of a volume electron microscopic (EM) image of the female brain, we map all inputs and outputs to both pC1d and pC1e. This reveals strong recurrent connectivity between, in particular, pC1d/e neurons and a specific subset of Fruitless+ neurons called aIPg. We additionally find that pC1d/e activation drives long-lasting persistent neural activity in brain areas and cells overlapping with the pC1d/e neural network, including both Doublesex+ and Fruitless+ neurons. Our work thus links minutes-long persistent changes in behavior with persistent neural activity and recurrent circuit architecture in the female brain.</content>

 Systemic oxygen restriction (SOR) is prevalent in numerous clinical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),and is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections. However, the influence of SOR on T cell immunity remains uncharacterized. Here we show the detrimental effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial-biogenesis in activated mouse CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. We find that low oxygen level diminishes CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell viral response in vivo. We reveal that respiratory restriction inhibits ATP-dependent matrix processes that are critical for mitochondrial biogenesis. This respiratory restriction-mediated effect could be rescued by TCA cycle re-stimulation, which yielded increased mitochondrial matrix-localized ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrate that the hypoxia-arrested CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; viral response could be rescued in vivo through brief exposure to atmospheric oxygen pressure. Overall, these findings elucidate the detrimental effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial-biogenesis in activated CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, and suggest a new approach for reducing viral infections in COPD.</content>

&lt;p&gt;Body‐brain isomorphism of pig rostrum and cortical rostrum gyrus

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physiological studies of the last century mapped a somatosensory cortical gyrus representing the pig’s rostrum. Here we describe the extraordinary correspondence of this gyrus to the rostrum. The pig rostrum is packed with microvibrissae (~470 per hemi‐rostrum) and innervated by a prominent infra‐orbital nerve, containing about 80000 axons. The pig’s rostrum has three major skin‐folds. The nostrils have a rectangular medial wall and a funnel‐like lateral opening, nasal channels run obliquely from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). The rostrum gyrus mimics rostrum geometry in great detail. The putative representation of skin folds coincides with blood sinus and folds of the rostrum gyrus. The putative nostril representation is an oblique sulcus running from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). As observed in rodents, layer 4 is thin in the nostril sulcus. The side of the nostril sulcus representing the medial wall of the nostril is rectangular, whereas the side of the nostril sulcus representing the lateral wall is funnel‐like. Proportions and geometry of the rostrum and the rostrum gyrus are similar, albeit with a collapsed nostril and a larger inter‐individual variability in the gyrus. The pig’s cortical rostrum gyrus receives dense thalamic innervation, has a thin layer 1 and contains roughly 8 million neurons. With all that, the rostrum gyrus looks like a model of the pig rostrum at a scale of ~1:2. Our findings are reminiscent of the raccoon cortex with its forepaw‐like somatosensory forepaw‐representation. Representing highly relevant afferents in three‐dimensional body‐part‐models might facilitate isomorphic cortical computations in large‐brained tactile specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT) reduces health‐related quality of life (QOL), especially in children. Defining QOL in pediatric CMT can help physicians monitor disease burden clinically and in trials. We identified items pertaining to QOL in children with CMT and conducted validation studies to develop a pediatric CMT‐specific QOL outcome measure (pCMT‐QOL).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development and validation of the pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure was iterative, involving identifying relevant domains, item pool generation, prospective pilot testing and clinical assessments, structured focus‐group interviews, and psychometric testing. Testing was conducted in children with CMT seen at participating sites from the USA, United Kingdom, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted systematic literature reviews and analysis of generic QOL measures to identify six domains relevant to QOL in children with CMT. 60 items corresponding to those domains were developed de novo, or identified from literature review and CMT‐specific modification of items from the pediatric Neuro‐QOL measures. The draft version underwent prospective feasibility and face content validity assessments to develop a working version of the pCMT‐QOL measure. From 2010‐2016, the pCMT‐QOL working version was administered to 398 children ages 8‐18 seen at the participating study sites of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium. The resulting data underwent rigorous psychometric analysis, including factor analysis, test‐retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, IRT analysis, and longitudinal analysis, to develop the final pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure is a reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of health‐related QOL for children with CMT.&lt;/p&gt;

 In human occipitotemporal cortex, brain responses to depicted inanimate objects have a large-scale organization by real-world object size. Critically, the size of objects in the world is systematically related to behaviorally-relevant properties: small objects are often grasped and manipulated (e.g., forks), while large objects tend to be less motor-relevant (e.g., tables), though this relationship does not always have to be true (e.g., picture frames and wheelbarrows). To determine how these two dimensions interact, we measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants viewed a stimulus set of small and large objects with either low or high motor-relevance. The results revealed that the size organization was evident for objects with both low and high motor-relevance; further, a motor-relevance map was also evident across both large and small objects. Targeted contrasts revealed that typical combinations (small motor-relevant vs. large non-motor-relevant) yielded more robust topographies than the atypical covariance contrast (small non-motor-relevant vs. large motor-relevant). In subsequent exploratory analyses, a factor analysis revealed that the construct of motor-relevance was better explained by two underlying factors: one more related to manipulability, and the other to whether an object moves or is stable. The factor related to manipulability better explained responses in lateral small-object preferring regions, while the factor related to object stability (lack of movement) better explained responses in ventromedial large-object preferring regions. Taken together, these results reveal that the structure of neural responses to objects of different sizes further reflect behavior-relevant properties of manipulability and stability, and contribute to a deeper understanding of some of the factors that help the large-scale organization of object representation in high-level visual cortex.</content>

 There has been considerable focus on investigating age-related memory changes in cognitively healthy older adults, in the absence of neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have reported age-related domain-specific changes in older adults, showing increased difficulty encoding and processing object information but minimal to no impairment in processing spatial information compared to younger adults. However, few of these studies have examined age-related changes in the encoding of concurrently presented object and spatial stimuli, specifically the integration of both spatial and non-spatial (object) information. To more closely resemble real-life memory encoding and the integration of both spatial and non-spatial information, the current study developed a new experimental paradigm with novel environments that allowed for the placement of different objects in different positions within the environment. The current findings show that older adults have decreased performance in recognizing changes of the object position within the spatial context but no significant differences in recognizing changes in the identity of the object within the spatial context compared to younger adults. These findings suggest there may be potential age-related differences in the mechanisms underlying the representations of complex environments and furthermore, the integration of spatial and non-spatial information may be differentially processed relative to independent and isolated representations of object and spatial information.</content>

 Language production deficits occur early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, only few studies have focused on language functional networks in prodromal AD. The current study aims to uncover the extent of language alteration at a prodromal stage, on a behavioral, structural and functional level, using univariate and multivariate analyses. Twenty-four AD participants and 24 matched healthy controls underwent a comprehensive language evaluation, a structural T1-3D MRI and resting-state fMRI. We performed seed-based analyses, using the left inferior frontal gyrus and left posterior temporal gyrus as seeds. Then, we analyzed connectivity between executive control networks and language network in each group. Finally, we used multivariate pattern analyses to test whether the two groups could be distinguished based on the pattern of atrophy within the language network; atrophy within the executive control networks, as well as the pattern of functional connectivity within the language network; and functional connectivity within executive control networks. AD participants had language impairment during standardized language tasks and connected-speech production. Univariate analyses were not able to discriminate participants at this stage, while multivariate pattern analyses could significantly predict the group membership of prodromal patients and healthy controls, both when classifying atrophy patterns or connectivity patterns of the language network. Language functional networks could discriminate AD participants better than executive control networks. Most notably, they revealed an increased connectivity at a prodromal stage. Multivariate analyses represent a useful tool for investigating the functional and structural (re-)organization of the neural bases of language.</content>

 The last common ancestor of Bilateria and Cnidaria is believed to be one of the first animals to develop a nervous system over 500 million years ago. Many of the genes involved in the neural function of the advanced nervous system in Bilateria are well conserved in Cnidaria. Thus, Cnidarian representative species, Hydra, is considered to be a living fossil and a good model organism for the study of the putative primitive nervous system in its last common ancestor. The diffuse nervous system of Hydra consists of several peptidergic neuron subsets. However, the specific functions of these subsets remain unclear. Using calcium imaging, here we show that the neuron subsets that express neuropeptide, Hym-176 function as motor neurons to evoke longitudinal contraction. We found that all neurons in a subset defined by the Hym-176 gene (Hym-176A) or its paralogs (Hym-176B) expression are excited simultaneously, which is then followed by longitudinal contraction. This indicates not only that these neuron subsets are motor neurons but also that a single molecularly defined neuron subset forms a single coactive motor circuit. This is in contrast with the Bilaterian nervous system, where a single molecularly defined neuron subset harbors multiple coactive circuits, showing a mixture of neurons firing with different timings. Furthermore, we found that the two motor circuits, one expressing Hym-176B in the body column and the other expressing Hym-176A in the foot, are coordinately regulated to exert region-specific contraction. Our results demonstrate that one neuron subset is likely to form a monofunctional circuit as a minimum functional unit to build a more complex behavior in Hydra. We propose that this simple feature (one subset, one circuit, one function) found in Hydra is a fundamental trait of the primitive nervous system.</content>

 The dynamical organization of brain networks is essential to support human cognition and emotion for rapid adaption to ever-changing environment. As the core nodes of emotion-related brain circuitry, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and centromedial amygdala (CMA) are recognized as two major amygdalar nuclei that regulate distinct affective functions and internal autonomic responses via their unique connections with cortical and subcortical structures in rodents. However, little is known how the dynamical organization of emotion-related brain circuitry reflects internal autonomic responses in humans. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with concurrent recording of skin conductance, we show robust dynamic integration and segregation states of amygdala subregion-related intrinsic functional networks linked to spontaneous autonomic arousal. To be specific, time-varying connectivity analysis of resting-state fMRI data with K-means clustering approach revealed two distinct states of BLA- and CMA-based connectivity patterns, with a segregation state showing generally stronger BLA- than CMA-based connectivity with cortical regions, and an integration state showing substantial overlapping, in a spatio-temporal manner, between BLA- and CMA-based connectivity networks. Further analysis of skin conductance revealed significantly higher physiological arousal during the integration state than the segregation state, and state-specific BLA- and CMA-based connectivity with distinct subcortical and neocortical targets were predictive of spontaneous fluctuations of skin conductance. Our findings characterize dynamic functional organization of emotion-related amygdala nuclei circuits and networks and its links to spontaneous autonomic arousal in humans.</content>

 Classical accounts of spatial perception are based either on the topological layout of sensory receptors, or on implicit spatial information provided by motor commands. In everyday self-touch, as when stroking the left arm with the right hand, these elements are inextricably linked, meaning that tactile and motor contributions to spatial perception cannot readily be disentangled. Here, we developed a robot-mediated form of self-touch in order to decouple the spatial extent of active or passive movements from their tactile consequences. Participants judged the spatial extent of either the movement of the right hand, or of the resulting tactile stimulation to their left forearm. Across five experiments, we found bidirectional interference between motor and tactile information. Crucially, both directions of interference were stronger during active than passive movements. Thus, voluntary motor commands produced stronger integration of multiple signals relevant to spatial perception.</content>

 Vascular dementia (VaD) is a progressive cognitive impairment of vascular etiology. VaD is characterized by cerebral hypoperfusion, increased blood-brain barrier permeability and white matter lesions. An increased burden of VaD is expected due to rapidly aging populations. The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to hypoperfusion, and the resulting memory impairment may play a crucial role in VaD. Here we have investigated the hippocampal gene expression profile of young and old mice subjected to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). Our data in sham-operated young and aged mice show the normal age-associated decline in cerebral blood flow and differential gene expression. BCAS and ageing caused broadly similar effects, however, BCAS-induced changes in hippocampal gene expression differed between young and aged mice. Specifically, transcriptomic analysis indicated that in comparison to young sham mice, many pathways altered by BCAS in young mice resembled those present in sham aged mice. Immunoblot analyses confirmed these findings. Finally, relative to young sham mice the cell type-specific profile of genes in both young BCAS and old sham animals further revealed common cell-specific genes. Our data provide a genetic-based molecular framework for chronic hypoperfusion-induced hippocampal damage and reveal common cellular signaling pathways likely to be important in the pathophysiology of VaD.</content>

 Human perception of touch is mediated by inputs from multiple channels. Classical theories postulate independent contributions of each channel to each tactile feature, with little or no interaction between channels. In contrast to this view, we show that inputs from two sub-modalities of mechanical input channels interact to determine tactile perception. The flutter-range vibration channel was activated anomalously using hydroxy--sanshool, a bioactive compound of Szechuan pepper, which chemically induces tingling sensations. We tested whether this tingling sensation on the lips was modulated by sustained mechanical pressure. Across four experiments, we show that sustained touch inhibits sanshool tingling sensations in a location-specific, pressure-level and time-dependent manner. Additional experiments ruled out mediation of nociceptive or affective (C-tactile) channels underlying this interaction. These results reveal novel inhibitory influence from steady-pressure onto flutter-range tactile perceptual channels, consistent with early-stage interactions between mechanoreceptor inputs within the somatosensory pathway.</content>

 The Russian fox-farm experiment is an unusually long-running and well-controlled study designed to replicate wolf-to-dog domestication. As such, it offers an unprecedented window onto the neural mechanisms governing the evolution of behavior. Here we report adaptations to gray matter morphology resulting from selection for tameness vs. aggressive response toward humans. Contrasting with prior work in other domesticated species, tame foxes did not show reduced brain volume. Rather, gray matter volume in both the tame and aggressive strains was increased relative to foxes bred without selection on behavior. Furthermore, tame- and aggressive-enlarged regions overlapped substantially, including portions of motor, somatosensory, and prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum. We also observed differential morphological covariation across distributed gray matter networks. In one prefrontal-hypothalamic network, this covariation differentiated the tame and aggressive foxes together from the conventional strain. These findings indicate that selection for opposite behaviors can influence brain morphology in a similar way.</content>

 The subjective experience of causing an action is known as the sense of agency. Dysfunction in the sense of agency has been suggested as a cause of auditory hallucinations (AHs), an important diagnostic criterion for schizophrenia. However, agency over speech has not been extensively characterized in previous empirical studies. Here, we examine both implicit and explicit measures of the sense of agency and reveal bottom-up and top-down components that constitute self-agency during speech. The first is action-outcome causality, which is perceived based on a low-level sensorimotor process when hearing their own voice following their speech. The second component is self-voice identity, which is embedded in the acoustic quality of voice and dominantly influences agency over speech at the cognitive judgment level. Our findings provide profound insight into the sense of agency over speech and present an informative perspective for understanding aberrant experience in AHs.</content>

 In cognitive neuroscience, computational modeling can formally adjudicate between theories and affords quantitative fits to behavioral/brain data. Pragmatically, however, the space of plausible generative models considered is dramatically limited by the set of models with known likelihood functions. For many models, the lack of a closed-form likelihood typically impedes Bayesian inference methods. As a result, standard models are evaluated for convenience, even when other models might be superior. Likelihood-free methods exist but are limited by their computational cost or their restriction to particular inference scenarios. Here, we propose neural networks that learn approximate likelihoods for arbitrary generative models, allowing fast posterior sampling with only a one-off cost for model simulations that is amortized for future inference. We show that these methods can accurately recover posterior parameter distributions for a variety of neurocognitive process models. We provide code allowing users to deploy these methods for arbitrary hierarchical model instantiations without further training.</content>

 The arrival of submillimetre ultra high-field fMRI makes it possible to compare activation profiles across cortical layers. However, the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal measured by Gradient-Echo fMRI is biased towards superficial layers of the cortex, which is a serious confound for laminar analysis. Several univariate and multivariate analysis methods have been proposed to correct this bias. We compare these methods using computational simulations and example human 7T fMRI data from Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) during a visual attention paradigm. The simulations show that two methods - the ratio of ROI means across conditions and a novel application of Deming regression - offer the most robust correction for superficial bias. Deming regression has the additional advantage that it does not require that the conditions differ in their mean activation over voxels within an ROI. When applied to the example dataset, these methods suggest that attentional modulation of activation is similar across cortical layers within the ventral visual stream, despite a naive activation-based analysis producing stronger modulation in superficial layers. Our study demonstrates that accurate correction of superficial bias is crucial to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions from laminar analyses of Gradient-Echo fMRI data.</content>

Utilising global and regional brain-age prediction based on multi-shell diffusion MRI data, we investigated the association between previous childbirths and WM brain age in 8,895 women in the UK Biobank cohort (age range = 54 - 81 years). The results showed that a higher number of previous childbirths was associated with lower WM brain age, in line with previous studies showing less evident grey matter (GM) brain ageing in parous relative to nulliparous women. Both global WM and GM brain age estimates showed unique contributions to the association with previous childbirths, suggesting partly independent processes. Corpus callosum contributed uniquely to the global WM association with previous childbirths, and showed a stronger relationship relative to several other tracts. While our findings demonstrate a link between reproductive history and brain WM characteristics later in life, longitudinal studies are required to understand how parity influences women's WM trajectories across the lifespan.</content>

 Low-level states of consciousness are characterised by disruptions of brain dynamics that sustain arousal and awareness. Yet, how structural, dynamical, local and network brain properties interplay in the different levels of consciousness is unknown. Here, we studied the fMRI brain dynamics from patients that suffered brain injuries leading to a disorder of consciousness and from subjects undergoing propofol-induced anaesthesia. We showed that pathological and pharmacological low-level states of consciousness displayed less recurrent, less diverse, less connected, and more segregated synchronization patterns than conscious states. We interpreted these effects using whole-brain models built on healthy and injured connectomes. We showed that altered dynamics arise from a global reduction of network interactions, together with more homogeneous and more structurally constrained local dynamics. These effects were accentuated using injured connectomes. Notably, these changes lead the hub regions to lose their stability during low-level states of consciousness, thus attenuating the core-periphery structure of brain dynamics.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcome prognostication unbiased by early care limitations(ECL) is essential for guiding treatment in patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH). This study aims to determine whether the max‐ICH Score provides improved and clinically useful prognostic estimation of functional long‐term outcomes after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multicenter validation study compared the max‐ICH Score’s vs the ICH Score’s prognostication regarding diagnostic accuracy (discrimination, calibration) and clinical utility using decision curve analysis. We performed a joint investigation of individual participant data of consecutive spontaneous ICH patients(n=4,677) from two retrospective German‐wide studies(RETRACE I+II; anticoagulation‐associated ICH only) conducted at 22 participating centers, one German prospective single‐center study(UKER‐ICH; non‐anticoagulation‐associated ICH only), and one U.S.‐based prospective longitudinal single‐center study(MGH; both anticoagulation‐ and non‐anticoagulation‐associated ICH), treated between January 2006 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 4,677 included ICH patients, 1,017(21.7%) were affected by ECL[German‐cohort:15.6%(440/2377); MGH:31.0%(577/1283)]. Validation of long‐term functional outcome prognostication by the max‐ICH Score provided good and superior discrimination in patients without ECL compared to the ICH Score[Area under the receiver operating curve(AUROC),German‐cohort:0.81(0.78‐0.83) vs 0.74(0.72‐0.77),p&amp;lt;0.01; MGH:0.85(0.81‐0.89) vs 0.78(0.74‐0.82),p&amp;lt;0.01], and for the entire cohort[AUROC,German‐cohort:0.84(0.82‐0.86) vs 0.80(0.77‐0.82),p&amp;lt;0.01; MGH:0.83(0.81‐0.85) vs 0.77(0.75‐0.79),p&amp;lt;0.01]. Both scores showed no evidence of poor calibration. The clinical utility investigated by decision curve analysis showed at high threshold probabilities(0.8, aiming to avoid false‐positive poor outcome attribution), that the max‐ICH Score provided a clinical net‐benefit compared to the ICH Score(14.1 vs 2.1 net‐predicted poor outcomes per 100 patients).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The max‐ICH score provides valid and improved prognostication of functional outcome after ICH. The associated clinical net‐benefit in minimizing false poor outcome attribution may potentially prevent unwarranted care limitations in patients with ICH.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Morphological identification of thoracolumbar spinal afferent nerve endings in mouse uterus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1996b598-9cdb-4d13-bf08-7919911221ba/cne25070-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we provide the first detailed description of spinal afferent nerve endings in the uterus of a vertebrate. This was achieved using an in vivo anterograde tracing technique from thoracolumbar (T13‐L3) dorsal root ganglia in female mice. Our key findings revealed that at least three distinct morphological types of spinal afferent nerve ending can be readily identified throughout multiple layers of the uterine wall; the vast majority of which are peptidergic (immunoreactive to calcitonin gene‐related peptide).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major sensory innervation to the uterus is provided by spinal afferent nerves, whose cell bodies lie predominantly in thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG). While the origin of the cell bodies of uterine spinal afferents is clear, the identity of their sensory endings has remained unknown. Hence, our major aim was to identify the location, morphology, and calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP)‐immunoreactivity of uterine spinal afferent endings supplied by thoracolumbar DRG. We also sought to determine the degree of uterine afferent innervation provided by the vagus nerve. Using an anterograde tracing technique, nulliparous female C57BL/6 mice were injected unilaterally with biotinylated dextran into thoracolumbar DRG (T13‐L3). After 7–9 days, uterine horns were stained to visualize traced nerve axons and endings immunoreactive to CGRP. Whole uteri from a separate cohort of animals were injected with retrograde neuronal tracer (DiI) and dye uptake in nodose ganglia was examined. Anterogradely labeled axons innervated each uterine horn, these projected rostrally or caudally from their site of entry, branching to form varicose endings in the myometrium and/or vascular plexus. Most spinal afferent endings were CGRP‐immunoreactive and morphologically classified as “simple‐type.” Rarely, uterine nerve cell bodies were labeled in nodose ganglia. Here, we provide the first detailed description of spinal afferent nerve endings in the uterus of a vertebrate. Distinct morphological types of spinal afferent nerve endings were identified throughout multiple anatomical layers of the uterine wall. Compared to other visceral organs, uterine spinal afferent endings displayed noticeably less morphological diversity. Few neurons in nodose ganglia innervate the uterus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging data indicates an increased risk for cerebrovascular events with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and highlights the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) on the management and outcomes of acute stroke. We conducteda systematic review and meta‐analysis to evaluate the aforementioned considerations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a meta‐analysis of observational cohort studies reporting on the occurrence and/or outcomes of patients with cerebrovascular events in association with their SARS‐CoV‐2 infection status. We used a random‐effects model. Summary estimates were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 18 cohort studies including 67,845 patients. Among patients with SARS‐CoV‐2, 1.3% (95%CI:0.9‐1.6%;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=87%) were hospitalized for cerebrovascular events, 1.1% (95%CI:0.8‐1.3%;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=85%) for ischemic stroke, and 0.2% (95%CI:0.1‐0.3%; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=64%) for hemorrhagic stroke. Compared to non‐infected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection had increased odds of ischemic stroke (OR=3.58,95%CI:1.43‐8.92; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=43%) and cryptogenic stroke (OR=3.98,95%CI:1.62‐9.77;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0%). Diabetes mellitus was found to be more prevalent among SARS‐CoV‐2 stroke patients compared to non‐infected contemporary or historical controls (OR=1.39, 95%CI:1.04‐1.86; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0%). SARS‐CoV‐2 infection status was not associated with the likelihood of receiving intravenous thrombolysis (OR=1.42,95%CI:0.65‐3.10; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0%) or endovascular thrombectomy (OR=0.78,95%CI:0.35‐1.74; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0%) among hospitalized ischemic stroke patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Odds for in‐hospital mortality were higher among SARS‐CoV‐2stroke patients compared to non‐infected contemporary or historical stroke patients (OR=5.60,95%CI:3.19‐9.80;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=45%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARS‐CoV‐2 appears to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, and potentially cryptogenic stroke in particular. It may also be related to an increased mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 The mechanisms by which parkin protects the adult human brain from Parkinson disease remain incompletely understood. We hypothesized that parkin cysteines participate in redox reactions, which are reflected in its posttranslational modifications. We found that in human control brain, including the S. nigra, parkin is largely insoluble after age 40 years, which is linked to its oxidation, e.g., at Cys95 and Cys253. In mice, oxidative stress increases posttranslational modifications at parkin cysteines and reduces its solubility. Oxidation of recombinant parkin also promotes insolubility and aggregate formation, but in parallel, lowers hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This thiol-based redox activity is diminished by parkin point mutants, e.g., p.C431F and p.G328E. Intriguingly, in parkin-deficient human brain H2O2 concentrations are elevated. In prkn-null mice, H2O2 levels are dysregulated under oxidative stress conditions, such as acutely by MPTP-toxin exposure or chronically due to a second genetic hit. In dopamine toxicity studies, wild-type parkin, but not disease-linked mutants, protects human dopaminergic M17 cells, in part through lowering H2O2. Parkin also neutralizes reactive, electrophilic dopamine metabolites via adduct formation, which occurs foremost at primate-specific Cys95. Further, wild-type but not p.C95A-mutant parkin augments melanin formation. In sections of normal, adult human midbrain, parkin specifically co-localizes with neuromelanin pigment, frequently within LAMP-3/CD63+ lysosomes. We conclude that oxidative modifications of parkin cysteines are associated with protective outcomes, which include the reduction of H2O2, conjugation of reactive dopamine metabolites, sequestration of radicals within insoluble aggregates, and increased melanin formation. The loss of these redox effects may augment oxidative stress in dopamine producing neurons of mutant PRKN allele carriers, thereby contributing to neurodegeneration.</content>

 ATP and its ionotropic P2X receptors are components of the most ancient signaling systems. However, little is known about the distribution and function of purinergic transmission in invertebrates. Here, we cloned, expressed, and pharmacologically characterized P2X receptors in the sea slug Aplysia californica - the prominent model in cellular and system neuroscience. These P2X receptors were successfully expressed in Xenopus oocytes and displayed activation by ATP (EC50=306 M) with two-phased kinetics as well as Na+-dependence. The ATP analog, Bz-ATP, was a less effective agonist (~20%) than ATP, and PPADS was a more potent inhibitor of the P2X receptors than the suramin. We showed that P2X receptors are uniquely expressed within Aplysia's cerebral bioenergetic center (F-cluster). Using RNA-seq, we found that the F-cluster contains more than a dozen unique secretory peptides, including three insulins, interleukins, and potential toxins, as well as ecdysone-type receptors and a district subset of ion channels. This structure is one of the most prominent integrative centers in the entire CNS and remarkably different from the morphologically similar neurosecretory center (bag-cluster) involved in egg-laying behavior. Using RNA-seq, we also characterized the expression of P2X receptors across more than a dozen Aplysia peripheral tissues and developmental stages. We showed that P2X receptors are predominantly expressed in chemosensory structures and during early cleavage stages. The localization and pharmacology of P2X receptors in Aplysia highlight the evolutionary conservation of bioenergetic sensors and chemosensory purinergic transmission across animals. This study also provides a foundation to decipher homeostatic mechanisms in development and neuroendocrine systems.</content>

 Cannabidiol (CBD) and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are two major constituents of cannabis with contrasting mechanisms of action. THC is the major psychoactive, addiction-promoting, and psychotomimetic compound, while CBD may have somewhat opposite effects. The brain effects of these drugs alone and in combination are poorly understood. In particular the striatum is implicated in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, but it is unclear how THC and CBD influence striato-cortical connectivity. Across two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, we examine the effects of THC, CBD, and THC+CBD on the functional connectivity of striatal sub-divisions (associative, limbic, and sensorimotor) using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and seed-based functional connectivity analyses. Study 1 (N=17; inhaled 8mg THC, 8mg THC+10mg CBD, placebo) showed strong disruptive effects of both THC and THC+CBD conditions on connectivity in the associative and sensorimotor networks, but a specific effect of THC in the limbic striatum, which was alleviated in the THC+CBD condition such that it did not differ from placebo. In Study 2 (N=23, oral 600mg CBD, placebo) CBD increased connectivity in the associative network, but relatively minor decreases/disruptions were found in the limbic and sensorimotor. In conclusion, THC strongly disrupts striato-cortical networks, and this effect is selectively mitigated in the limbic striatum when co-administered with CBD. When administered alone, 600mg oral CBD has a more complex effect profile of relative increases and decreases in connectivity. The insula emerges as a key region affected by cannabinoid-induced changes in functional connectivity, with potential implications for understanding cannabis related disorders, and the development of cannabinoid therapeutics.</content>

 The use of rhythmic acoustic stimulation (RAS) in improving gait and balance in healthy elderly subjects has been widely investigated. However, methodologies and results are often controversial. In this study, we hypothesize that both the kinematic features of gait and stability, depend on the frequency at which RAS is administered. Our aim was to observe, through 3D Gait Analysis, the effect of different types of RAS (at a fixed frequency or based on the average cadence of each subject) on both gait spatio-temporal parameters and stability. The latter was estimated through an innovative measure, the trunk displacement index (TDI) that we have recently implemented. We observed that the low frequencies RAS led to a general slowdown of gait, which did not provide any clear benefit and produced harmful effects on stability when the frequency became too low compared to the individual natural frequency. On the contrary, the high frequencies of RAS showed a slight acceleration of gait, accompanied by better stability (as documented by a lower TDI value), regardless of the type of RAS. Finally, the RAS equal to the individual natural cadence also produced an increase in stability.</content>

 The findings from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) studies often show inconsistent and sometimes contradictory results due to small sample sizes as well as differences in acquisition parameters and pre-/post-processing methods. To address these challenges, collaborative multi-site initiatives have provided an opportunity to collect larger and more diverse groups of subjects, including those with neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to increased power and findings that may be more representative at the group and individual level. With the availability of these datasets openly, the ability of joint analysis of multi-site dMRI data has become more important than ever. However, intrinsic- or acquisition-related variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols, and reconstruction settings hinder pooling multi-site dMRI directly. One powerful and fast statistical harmonization method called ComBat (https://github.com/Jfortin1/ComBatHarmonization) was developed to mitigate the &quot;batch effect&quot; in gene expression microarray data and was adapted for multi-site dMRI harmonization to reduce scanner/site effect. Our goal is to evaluate this commonly used harmonization approach using a large diffusion MRI dataset involving 542 individuals from 5 sites. We investigated two important aspects of using ComBat for harmonization of fractional anisotropy (FA) across sites: First, we assessed how well ComBat preserves the inter-subject biological variability (measured by the effect sizes of between-group FA differences) after harmonization. Second, we evaluated the effect of minor differences in pre-processing on ComBat's performance. While the majority of effect sizes are mostly preserved in some sites after harmonization, they are not well-preserved at other sites where non-linear scanner contributions exist. Further, even minor differences in pre-processing can yield unwanted effects during ComBat harmonization. Thus, our findings suggest paying careful attention to the data being harmonized as well as using the same processing pipeline while using ComBat for data harmonization.</content>

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 60% of all outbreaks are detected using informal sources. In many public health institutes, including the WHO and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), dedicated groups of public health agents sift through numerous articles and newsletters to detect relevant events. This media screening is one important part of event-based surveillance (EBS). Reading the articles, discussing their relevance, and putting key information into a database is a time-consuming process. To support EBS, but also to gain insights into what makes an article and the event it describes relevant, we developed a natural language processing framework for automated information extraction and relevance scoring. First, we scraped relevant sources for EBS as done at the RKI (WHO Disease Outbreak News and ProMED) and automatically extracted the articles’ key data: &lt;i&gt;disease&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;country&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;date&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;confirmed-case count&lt;/i&gt;. For this, we performed named entity recognition in two steps: EpiTator, an open-source epidemiological annotation tool, suggested many different possibilities for each. We extracted the key country and disease using a heuristic with good results. We trained a naive Bayes classifier to find the key date and confirmed-case count, using the RKI’s EBS database as labels which performed modestly. Then, for relevance scoring, we defined two classes to which any article might belong: The article is &lt;i&gt;relevant&lt;/i&gt; if it is in the EBS database and &lt;i&gt;irrelevant&lt;/i&gt; otherwise. We compared the performance of different classifiers, using bag-of-words, document and word embeddings. The best classifier, a logistic regression, achieved a sensitivity of 0.82 and an index balanced accuracy of 0.61. Finally, we integrated these functionalities into a web application called &lt;i&gt;EventEpi&lt;/i&gt; where relevant sources are automatically analyzed and put into a database. The user can also provide any URL or text, that will be analyzed in the same way and added to the database. Each of these steps could be improved, in particular with larger labeled datasets and fine-tuning of the learning algorithms. The overall framework, however, works already well and can be used in production, promising improvements in EBS. The source code and data are publicly available under open licenses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gkM-iQk3sss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

An important problem in computational neuroscience is to understand how networks of spiking neurons can carry out various computations underlying behavior. Balanced spiking networks (BSNs) provide a powerful framework for implementing arbitrary linear dynamical systems in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. However, the classic BSN model requires near-instantaneous transmission of spikes between neurons, which is biologically implausible. Introducing realistic synaptic delays leads to an pathological regime known as “ping-ponging”, in which different populations spike maximally in alternating time bins, causing network output to overshoot the target solution. Here we document this phenomenon and provide a novel solution: we show that a network can have realistic synaptic delays while maintaining accuracy and stability if neurons are endowed with conditionally Poisson firing. Formally, we propose two alternate formulations of Poisson balanced spiking networks: (1) a “local” framework, which replaces the hard integrate-and-fire spiking rule within each neuron by a “soft” threshold function, such that firing probability grows as a smooth nonlinear function of membrane potential; and (2) a “population” framework, which reformulates the BSN objective function in terms of expected spike counts over the entire population. We show that both approaches offer improved robustness, allowing for accurate implementation of network dynamics with realistic synaptic delays between neurons. Both Poisson frameworks preserve the coding accuracy and robustness to neuron loss of the original model and, moreover, produce positive correlations between similarly tuned neurons, a feature of real neural populations that is not found in the deterministic BSN. This work unifies balanced spiking networks with Poisson generalized linear models and suggests several promising avenues for future research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xm7SfBXbuAo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Lifeact is a short actin-binding peptide that is used to visualize filamentous actin (F-actin) structures in live eukaryotic cells using fluorescence microscopy. However, this popular probe has been shown to alter cellular morphology by affecting the structure of the cytoskeleton. The molecular basis for such artefacts is poorly understood. Here, we determined the high-resolution structure of the Lifeact–F-actin complex using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure reveals that Lifeact interacts with a hydrophobic binding pocket on F-actin and stretches over 2 adjacent actin subunits, stabilizing the DNase I-binding loop (D-loop) of actin in the closed conformation. Interestingly, the hydrophobic binding site is also used by actin-binding proteins, such as cofilin and myosin and actin-binding toxins, such as a hypervariable region of TccC3 (TccC3HVR) from &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus luminescens&lt;/i&gt; and ExoY from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. In vitro binding assays and activity measurements demonstrate that Lifeact indeed competes with these proteins, providing an explanation for the altering effects of Lifeact on cell morphology in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the affinity of Lifeact to F-actin can be increased by introducing mutations into the peptide, laying the foundation for designing improved actin probes for live cell imaging.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/92nz7fi7r54&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Changes in cell identities and positions underlie tissue development and disease progression. Although single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) methods rapidly generate extensive lists of cell states, spatially resolved single-cell mapping presents a challenging task. We developed SCRINSHOT (Single-Cell Resolution IN Situ Hybridization On Tissues), a sensitive, multiplex RNA mapping approach. Direct hybridization of padlock probes on mRNA is followed by circularization with SplintR ligase and rolling circle amplification (RCA) of the hybridized padlock probes. Sequential detection of RCA-products using fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides profiles thousands of cells in tissue sections. We evaluated SCRINSHOT specificity and sensitivity on murine and human organs. SCRINSHOT quantification of marker gene expression shows high correlation with published scRNA-Seq data over a broad range of gene expression levels. We demonstrate the utility of SCRINSHOT by mapping the locations of abundant and rare cell types along the murine airways. The amenability, multiplexity, and quantitative qualities of SCRINSHOT facilitate single-cell mRNA profiling of cell-state alterations in tissues under a variety of native and experimental conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wAP-MQm-8aA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Serotonin neurons (dots) depicted in sagittal section (left) and coronal section (right), color‐coded by &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;‐lineage captured at different time‐points in development. The arrows indicate the approximate level of the coronal section. Serotonin neurons arising from progenitors expressing &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; at later ages in development progressively populate more rostral and dorsal locations in the dorsal raphe, with serotonin neurons arising from the latest &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; expressers also located in the lateral wings.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; is expressed transiently during embryogenesis at the midbrain‐hindbrain border, an area that gives rise to a variety of neuronal populations including the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). Using an inducible &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;‐cre allele we identified the populations of neurons defined by &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage at different stages of development. When &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;‐cre expression is induced at embryonic day 7.5 (T‐E7.5), in the adult the entire DR and part of the median raphe (MnR) has &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage. When induced at later timepoints, &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage progressively ebbs from the caudal and ventral aspect of this domain, particularly on the midline. Successively excluded from &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;‐ lineage at T‐E9.5 are serotonin neurons in the MnR and caudal‐intrafascicular DR, followed at T‐E11.5 by ventral‐middle and caudal‐dorsal DR. The last to show &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage are those serotonin neurons in the lateral wings and those at the rostral‐dorsal pole of dorsal raphe nucleus. Thus the temporal succession of &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage correlates with organizational features of serotonin neurons in these nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolated (or idiopathic) rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is associated with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Biomarkers are lacking to predict conversion to a dementia‐ or a motor‐first phenotype. Here, we aimed at identifying a brain‐clinical signature that predicts dementia in iRBD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brain‐clinical signature was identified in 48 polysomnography‐confirmed iRBD using partial least squares between brain deformation and 27 clinical variables. The resulting variable was applied to 78 iRBD patients followed longitudinally to predict conversion to a synucleinopathy, specifically DLB. The deformation scores from iRBD patients were compared to 207 patients with PD, DLB or prodromal DLB to assess if scores were higher in DLB compared to PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One latent variable explained 31% of the brain‐clinical covariance in iRBD, combining cortical and subcortical deformation and subarachnoid/ventricular expansion to cognitive and motor variables. The deformation score of this signature predicted conversion to a synucleinopathy in iRBD (p=0.036, odds ratio: 2.249; 95% CI: 1.053‐4.803), specifically to DLB (odds ratio: 4.754; 95% CI: 1.283‐17.618, p=0.020) and not PD (p=0.286). iRBD patients who developed dementia had scores similar to clinical and prodromal DLB patients but higher scores compared to PD patients. The deformation score also predicted cognitive performance over one, two, and four years in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a brain‐clinical signature that predicts conversion in iRBD to more severe/dementing forms of synucleinopathy. This pattern may serve as a new biomarker to optimize patient care, target risk reduction strategies, and administer neuroprotective trials.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study was undertaken to assess whether cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) computed tomographic (CT) biomarkers are associated with long‐term outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prospective, community‐based cohort study of adults diagnosed with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage between June 1, 2010 and May 31, 2013. A neuroradiologist rated the diagnostic brain CT for acute intracerebral hemorrhage features and SVD biomarkers. We used severity of white matter lucencies and cerebral atrophy, and the number of lacunes to calculate the CT SVD score. We assessed the association between CT SVD biomarkers and either death, or death or dependence (modified Rankin Scale scores = 4–6) 1 year after first‐ever intracerebral hemorrhage using logistic regression, adjusting for known predictors of outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 1 year of intracerebral hemorrhage, 224 (56%) of 402 patients died. In separate models, 1‐year death was associated with severe atrophy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44–4.49, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) but not lacunes or severe white matter lucencies, and CT SVD sum score ≥ 1 (aOR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.40–4.45, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). Two hundred seventy‐seven (73%) of 378 patients with modified Rankin Scale data were dead or dependent at 1 year. In separate models, 1‐year death or dependence was associated with severe atrophy (aOR = 3.67, 95% CI = 1.71–7.89, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) and severe white matter lucencies (aOR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.06–4.51, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.035) but not lacunes, and CT SVD sum score ≥ 1 (aOR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.45–5.46, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVD biomarkers on the diagnostic brain CT are associated with 1‐year death and dependence after intracerebral hemorrhage, independent of known predictors of outcome. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25952?af=R"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to analyze the timeline, prevalence, and survival of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in patients who developed alpha‐synucleinopathies (Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease dementia) compared with age‐ and sex‐matched controls in a population‐based incident‐cohort study.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a population‐based, 1991 to 2010 incident‐cohort study of alpha‐synucleinopathies. A movement‐disorder specialist reviewed medical records to confirm diagnoses. RBD was diagnosed by reported dream‐enactment symptoms or polysomnography. Probable RBD and polysomnographically confirmed RBD were analyzed separately and combined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 444 incident cases of alpha‐synucleinopathy, 86 were clinically diagnosed with RBD (19.8%), including 30 (35%) by polysomnography and 56 (65%) as probable. The prevalence of idiopathic RBD at alpha‐synucleinopathy diagnosis was 3.4%, increasing to 23.8% after 15 years. Cumulative lifetime incidence was 53 times greater in alpha‐synucleinopathy patients than in controls (odds ratio [OR] = 53.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.0–217.2, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), higher in dementia with Lewy bodies than in Parkinson disease (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.50–4.40, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0004), and higher in men than in women with Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or Parkinson disease dementia (OR = 3.70, 95% CI: 2.07–6.62, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), but did not increase mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cohort had RBD incidence of 3.4%. Overall RBD increased to 23.8% after 15 years, with an overall incidence of 2.5 cases per 100 person‐years. With 53 times greater lifetime incidence in alpha‐synucleinopathy patients than in controls, RBD was more likely to develop in dementia with Lewy bodies than in Parkinson disease or Parkinson disease dementia, and in men than in women, but did not increase mortality risk within our cohort.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare the diagnostic accuracy of antemortem [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) versus autopsy diagnosis in a heterogenous sample of patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;101 participants underwent PIB and FDG PET during life and neuropathological assessment. PET scans were visually interpreted by three raters blinded to clinical information. PIB PET was rated as positive or negative for cortical retention while FDG scans were read as showing an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or non‐AD pattern. Neuropathological diagnoses were assigned using research criteria. Majority visual reads were compared to intermediate‐high AD Neuropathological Changes (ADNC).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;101 participants were included (mean age 67.2; 41 females; MMSE 21.9; PET‐to‐autopsy 4.4 years). At autopsy, 32 patients showed primary AD, 56 non‐AD neuropathology (primarily frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)) and 13 mixed AD/FTLD pathology. PIB showed higher sensitivity than FDG for detecting intermediate‐high ADNC (96% [95% confidence interval: 89‐100%] vs 80% [68‐92%], p=0.02), but equivalent specificity (86% [76‐95%] vs. 84% [74‐93%], p=0.80). In patients with congruent PIB and FDG reads (77/101), combined sensitivity was 97% [92‐100%] and specificity 98% [93‐100%]. Nine of 24 patients with incongruent reads were found to have co‐occurrence of AD and non‐AD pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our sample enriched for younger‐onset cognitive impairment, PIB‐PET had higher sensitivity than FDG‐PET for intermediate‐high ADNC with similar specificity. When both modalities are congruent, sensitivity and specificity approach 100%, while mixed pathology should be considered when PIB and FDG are incongruent.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25964?af=R"/>
		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25964?af=R</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if stopping treatment with dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant (NOAC), induces a paradoxical rebound prothrombotic state. We investigated if short‐term (1‐3 days) dabigatran cessation is associated with a higher thrombus volume than expected from a simple reversal of the anticoagulant effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten‐week‐old C57Bl/6 mice (n=338) received one of the following oral treatments: phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), dabigatran for 7 days with or without 1‐4 day cessation, and aspirin in either a single dose or daily for 7 days. Some of the animals that ceased dabigatran for 1‐3 days received single‐dose aspirin. Thereafter, we induced FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐mediated carotid thrombosis in 130 mice, after which we performed microCT thrombus imaging. The other 208 mice underwent coagulation assays or platelet function tests. As an explorative pilot study, we reviewed the medical records of 18 consecutive patients with NOAC cessation‐related cerebral infarction in a large acute stroke cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a higher volume of carotid thrombus after dabigatran cessation at 1‐3 days than after vehicle treatment and showed that this effect could be prevented by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. Dabigatran cessation unduly increased platelet aggregability for 2 days after drug cessation, an effect mediated through arachidonic acid or thrombin, which effect was significantly attenuated by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. In patients, short‐term (&lt;span&gt;≤&lt;/span&gt;3 day) cessation of NOAC therapy, compared with longer‐term (&lt;span&gt;≥5&lt;/span&gt; days) cessation, tended to be associated with relatively high stroke severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide the first preclinical evidence that a rebound prothrombotic state follows short‐term cessation of dabigatran therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of cerebral autoregulation (CA) plays a key role in secondary neurologic injury. However, the regional distribution of CA impairment after acute cerebral injury remains unclear because in clinical practice, CA is only assessed within a limited compartment. Here, we performed large‐scale regional mapping of cortical perfusion and CA in patients undergoing decompressive surgery for malignant hemispheric stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 24 patients, autoregulation over the affected hemisphere was calculated based on direct, 15‐20‐minute cortical perfusion measurement with intraoperative Laser Speckle Imaging and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) recording. Cortical perfusion was normalized against non‐infarcted tissue and 6 perfusion categories from 0% to &amp;gt;100% were defined. The interaction between cortical perfusion and MAP was estimated using a linear random slope model and Pearson correlation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical perfusion and CA impairment were heterogeneously distributed across the entire hemisphere. The degree of CA impairment was significantly greater in areas with critical hypoperfusion (40‐60%: 0.42% per mmHg and 60‐80%: 0.46% per mmHg) than in non‐infarcted (&amp;gt;100%: 0.22% per mmHg) or infarcted (0‐20%: 0.29% per mmHg) areas (*p&amp;lt;0.001). Pearson correlation confirmed greater CA impairment at critically reduced perfusion (20‐40%: r=0.67; 40‐60%: r=0.68; 60‐80%: r=0.68) compared to perfusion &amp;gt;100% (r=0.36; *p&amp;lt;0.05). Tissue integrity had no impact on the degree of CA impairment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hemispheric stroke, CA is impaired across the entire hemisphere to a variable extent. Autoregulation impairment was greatest in hypoperfused and potentially viable tissue, suggesting that precise localization of such regions is essential for effective tailoring of perfusion pressure‐based treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Effects of adolescent intermittent ethanol on hippocampal expression of glutamate homeostasis and astrocyte‐neuronal tethering proteins in male and female rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c8eab602-848d-4847-b27e-d5f56bc94cf6/jnr24758-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male and female rats were exposed to adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE; PND 30–45) and aged into adulthood (PND 70). Dorsal and ventral hippocampi were harvested for analysis of synaptic membrane protein expression. AIE caused adult hippocampal glial and synaptic protein expression alterations in a sex‐ and region‐dependent manner. EphA4, ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase A4; GLAST, glutamate aspartate transporter 1; GLT‐1, glutamate transporter 1; GluN2A, NMDA receptor subunit 2A; PSD‐95, postsynaptic density 95; xCT, cystine‐glutamate antiporter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolescent alcohol drinking is widely recognized as a significant public health problem, and evidence is accumulating that sufficient levels of consumption during this critical period of brain development have an enduring impact on neural and behavioral function. Recent studies have indicated that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure alters astrocyte function, astrocyte–neuronal interactions, and related synaptic regulation and activity. However, few of those studies have included female animals, and a broader assessment of AIE effects on the proteins mediating astrocyte‐mediated glutamate dynamics and synaptic function is needed. We measured synaptic membrane expression of several such proteins in the dorsal and ventral regions of the hippocampal formation (DH, VH) from male and female rats exposed to AIE or adolescent intermittent water. In the DH, AIE caused elevated expression of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT‐1) in both males and females, elevated postsynaptic density 95 expression in females only, and diminished NMDA receptor subunit 2A expression in males only. AIE and sex interactively altered ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) expression in the DH. In the VH, AIE elevated expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter and the glutamate aspartate transporter 1 (GLAST) in males only. Compared to males, female animals expressed lower levels of GLT‐1 in the DH and greater levels of ephrin receptor B6 (EphB6) in the VH, in the absence of AIE effects. These results support the growing literature indicating that adolescent alcohol exposure produces long‐lasting effects on astrocyte function and astrocyte‐neuronal interactions. The sex and subregion specificity of these effects have mechanistic implications for our understanding of AIE effects generally.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without protective and/or therapeutic agents the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 is quickly spreading worldwide. It has surprising transmissibility potential, since it could infect all ages, gender, and human sectors. It attacks respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, hepatic, and endovascular systems and can reach the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) through known and unknown mechanisms. The reports on the neurological manifestations and complications of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are increasing exponentially. Herein, we enumerate seven candidate routes, which the mature or immature SARS‐CoV‐2 components could use to reach the CNS and PNS, utilizing the within‐body cross talk between organs. The majority of SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients suffer from some neurological manifestations (e.g., confusion, anosmia, and ageusia). It seems that although the mature virus did not reach the CNS or PNS of the majority of patients, its unassembled components and/or the accompanying immune‐mediated responses may be responsible for the observed neurological symptoms. The viral particles and/or its components have been specifically documented in endothelial cells of lung, kidney, skin, and CNS. This means that the blood–endothelial barrier may be considered as the main route for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the nervous system, with the barrier disruption being more logical than barrier permeability, as evidenced by postmortem analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;This study provides an anatomical characterization of motor and premotor neurons associated with the muscle producing swim bladder sounds and/or electric discharges in five mochokid catfish. Even though the same muscle and neuronal populations are associated with these behaviors across all species, our results suggest that behavioral differences are associated with quantitative differences, mainly in the size of the protractor muscle and associated skeletal elements, and the number, size and location of motoneurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mochokid catfish offer a distinct opportunity to study a communication system transitioning to a new signaling channel because some produce sounds and others electric discharges. Both signals are generated using an elastic spring system (ESS), which includes a protractor muscle innervated by motoneurons within the protractor nucleus that also has a motoneuron afferent population. &lt;i&gt;Synodontis grandiops&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigriventris&lt;/i&gt; produce sounds and electric discharges, respectively, and their ESSs show several morphological and physiological differences. The extent to which these differences explain different signal types remains unclear. Here, we compare ESS morphologies and behavioral phenotypes among five mochokids. &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;grandiops&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigriventris&lt;/i&gt; were compared with &lt;i&gt;Synodontis eupterus&lt;/i&gt; that is known to produce both signal types, and representative members of two sister genera, &lt;i&gt;Microsynodontis&lt;/i&gt; cf. &lt;i&gt;batesii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mochokiella paynei&lt;/i&gt;, for which no data were available. We provide support for the hypothesis that peripheral and central components of the ESS are conserved among mochokids. We also show that the two nonsynodontids are only sonic, consistent with sound production being an ancestral character for mochokids. Even though the three sound producing‐only species differ in some ESS characters, several are similar and likely associated with only sound production. We propose that the ability of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;eupterus&lt;/i&gt; to generate both electric discharges and sounds may depend on a protractor muscle intermediate in morphology between sound producing‐only and electric discharge‐only species, and two separate populations of protractor motoneurons. Our results further suggest that an electrogenic ESS in synodontids is an exaptation of a sound producing ESS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The attention mechanism has been widely used in deep neural networks as a
model component. By now, it has become a critical building block in many
state-of-the-art natural language models. Despite its great success established
empirically, the working mechanism of attention has not been investigated at a
sufficient theoretical depth to date. In this paper, we set up a simple text
classification task and study the dynamics of training a simple attention-based
classification model using gradient descent. In this setting, we show that, for
the discriminative words that the model should attend to, a persisting identity
exists relating its embedding and the inner product of its key and the query.
This allows us to prove that training must converge to attending to the
discriminative words when the attention output is classified by a linear
classifier. Experiments are performed, which validates our theoretical analysis
and provides further insights.

 &lt;p&gt;Can a neural network trained by the time series of system A be used to
predict the evolution of system B? This problem, knowing as transfer learning
in a broad sense, is of great importance in machine learning and data mining,
yet has not been addressed for chaotic systems. Here we investigate transfer
learning of chaotic systems from the perspective of synchronization-based state
inference, in which a reservoir computer trained by chaotic system A is used to
infer the unmeasured variables of chaotic system B, while A is different from B
in either parameter or dynamics. It is found that if systems A and B are
different in parameter, the reservoir computer can be well synchronized to
system B. However, if systems A and B are different in dynamics, the reservoir
computer fails to synchronize with system B in general. Knowledge transfer
along a chain of coupled reservoir computers is also studied, and it is found
that, although the reservoir computers are trained by different systems, the
unmeasured variables of the driving system can be successfully inferred by the
remote reservoir computer. Finally, by an experiment of chaotic pendulum, we
show that the knowledge learned from the modeling system can be used to predict
the evolution of the experimental system.

 &lt;p&gt;Reactive distillation is a special distillation technology based on the
coupling of chemical reaction and distillation. It has the characteristics of
low energy consumption and high separation efficiency. However, because the
combination of reaction and separation produces highly nonlinear robust
behavior, the control and optimization of the reactive distillation process
cannot use conventional methods, but must rely on neural network algorithms.
This paper briefly describes the characteristics and research progress of
reactive distillation technology and neural network algorithms, and summarizes
the application of neural network algorithms in reactive distillation, aiming
to provide reference for the development and innovation of industry technology.

 &lt;p&gt;The optimal charging infrastructure planning problem over a large geospatial
area is challenging due to the increasing network sizes of the transportation
system and the electric grid. The coupling between the electric vehicle travel
behaviors and charging events is therefore complex. This paper focuses on the
demonstration of a scalable computational framework for the electric vehicle
charging infrastructure planning over the tightly integrated transportation and
electric grid networks. On the transportation side, a charging profile
generation strategy is proposed leveraging the EV energy consumption model,
trip routing, and charger selection methods. On the grid side, a genetic
algorithm is utilized within the optimal power flow program to solve the
optimal charger placement problem with integer variables by adaptively
evaluating candidate solutions in the current iteration and generating new
solutions for the next iterations.

 &lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNN) are usually more energy-efficient as compared
to Artificial neural networks (ANN), and the way they work has a great
similarity with our brain. Back-propagation (BP) has shown its strong power in
training ANN in recent years. However, since spike behavior is
non-differentiable, BP cannot be applied to SNN directly. Although prior works
demonstrated several ways to approximate the BP-gradient in both spatial and
temporal directions either through surrogate gradient or randomness, they
omitted the temporal dependency introduced by the reset mechanism between each
step. In this article, we target on theoretical completion and investigate the
effect of the missing term thoroughly. By adding the temporal dependency of the
reset mechanism, the new algorithm is more robust to learning-rate adjustments
on a toy dataset but does not show much improvement on larger learning tasks
like CIFAR-10. Empirically speaking, the benefits of the missing term are not
worth the additional computational overhead. In many cases, the missing term
can be ignored.

 &lt;p&gt;Today, gastric cancer is one of the diseases which affected many people's
life. Early detection and accuracy are the main and crucial challenges in
finding this kind of cancer. In this paper, a method to increase the accuracy
of the diagnosis of detecting cancer using lint and colour features of tongue
based on deep convolutional neural networks and support vector machine is
proposed. In the proposed method, the region of tongue is first separated from
the face image by {deep RCNN} \color{black} Recursive Convolutional Neural
Network (R-CNN) \color{black}. After the necessary preprocessing, the images to
the convolutional neural network are provided and the training and test
operations are triggered. The results show that the proposed method is
correctly able to identify the area of the tongue as well as the patient's
person from the non-patient. Based on experiments, the DenseNet network has the
highest accuracy compared to other deep architectures. The experimental results
show that the accuracy of this network for gastric cancer detection reaches 91%
which shows the superiority of method in comparison to the state-of-the-art
methods.

 &lt;p&gt;Adaptation is used by biological sensory systems to respond to a wide range
of environmental signals, by adapting their response properties to the
statistics of the stimulus in order to maximize information transmission. We
derive rules of optimal adaptation to changes in the mean and variance of a
continuous stimulus in terms of Bayesian filters, and map them onto stochastic
equations that couple the state of the environment to an internal variable
controling the response function. We calculate numerical and exact results for
the speed and accuracy of adaptation, and its impact on information
transmission. We find that, in the regime of efficient adaptation, the speed of
adaptation scales sublinearly with the rate of change of the environment.
Finally, we exploit the mathematical equivalence between adaptation and
stochastic thermodynamics to quantitatively relate adaptation to the
irreversibility of the adaptation time course, defined by the rate of entropy
production. Our results suggest a means to empirically quantify adaptation in a
model-free and non-parametric way.

 &lt;p&gt;The process of association and tracking of sensor detections is a key element
in providing situational awareness. When the targets in the scenario are dense
and exhibit high maneuverability, Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) becomes a
challenging task. The conventional techniques to solve such NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problem involves multiple complex models and
requires tedious tuning of parameters, failing to provide an acceptable
performance within the computational constraints. This paper proposes a model
free end-to-end approach for airborne target tracking system using sensor
measurements, integrating all the key elements of multi target tracking --
association, prediction and filtering using deep learning with memory. The
challenging task of association is performed using the Bi-Directional Long
short-term memory (LSTM) whereas filtering and prediction are done using LSTM
models. The proposed modular blocks can be independently trained and used in
multitude of tracking applications including non co-operative (e.g., radar) and
co-operative sensors (e.g., AIS, IFF, ADS-B). Such modular blocks also enhances
the interpretability of the deep learning application. It is shown that
performance of the proposed technique outperforms conventional state of the art
technique Joint Probabilistic Data Association with Interacting Multiple Model
(JPDA-IMM) filter.

 &lt;p&gt;Following decades of sustained improvement, metaheuristics are one of the
great success stories of optimization research. However, in order for research
in metaheuristics to avoid fragmentation and a lack of reproducibility, there
is a pressing need for stronger scientific and computational infrastructure to
support the development, analysis and comparison of new approaches. We argue
that, via principled choice of infrastructure support, the field can pursue a
higher level of scientific enquiry. We describe our vision and report on
progress, showing how the adoption of common protocols for all metaheuristics
can help liberate the potential of the field, easing the exploration of the

 &lt;p&gt;Recent advances in adversarial attacks show the vulnerability of deep neural
networks searched by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Although NAS methods can
find network architectures with the state-of-the-art performance, the
adversarial robustness and resource constraint are often ignored in NAS. To
solve this problem, we propose an Effective, Efficient, and Robust Neural
Architecture Search (E2RNAS) method to search a neural network architecture by
taking the performance, robustness, and resource constraint into consideration.
The objective function of the proposed E2RNAS method is formulated as a
bi-level multi-objective optimization problem with the upper-level problem as a
multi-objective optimization problem, which is different from existing NAS
methods. To solve the proposed objective function, we integrate the
multiple-gradient descent algorithm, a widely studied gradient-based
multi-objective optimization algorithm, with the bi-level optimization.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed E2RNAS method can find
adversarially robust architectures with optimized model size and comparable
classification accuracy.

 &lt;p&gt;We propose a variation of the self organizing map algorithm by considering
the random placement of neurons on a two-dimensional manifold, following a blue
noise distribution from which various topologies can be derived. These
topologies possess random (but controllable) discontinuities that allow for a
more flexible self-organization, especially with high-dimensional data. The
proposed algorithm is tested on one-, two- and three-dimensions tasks as well
as on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and validated using spectral
analysis and topological data analysis tools. We also demonstrate the ability
of the randomized self-organizing map to gracefully reorganize itself in case
of neural lesion and/or neurogenesis.

 &lt;p&gt;The Thermodynamic Formalism provides a rigorous mathematical framework to
study quantitative and qualitative aspects of dynamical systems. At its core
there is a variational principle corresponding, in its simplest form, to the
Maximum Entropy principle. It is used as a statistical inference procedure to
represent, by specific probability measures (Gibbs measures), the collective
behaviour of complex systems. This framework has found applications in
different domains of science. In particular, it has been fruitful and
influential in neurosciences. In this article, we review how the Thermodynamic
Formalism can be exploited in the field of theoretical neuroscience, as a
conceptual and operational tool, to link the dynamics of interacting neurons
and the statistics of action potentials from either experimental data or
mathematical models. We comment on perspectives and open problems in
theoretical neuroscience that could be addressed within this formalism.

 &lt;p&gt;Numerous multi-objective optimization problems encounter with a number of
fitness functions to be simultaneously optimized of which their mutual
preferences are not inherently known. Suffering from the lack of underlying
generative models, the existing convex optimization approaches may fail to
derive the Pareto optimal solution for those problems in complicated domains
such as image enhancement. In order to obviate such shortcomings, the
Compromising Evolution Method is proposed in this report to modify the Simple
Genetic Algorithm by utilizing the notion of compromise. The simulation results
show the power of the proposed method solving multi-objective optimizations in
a case study of image error concealment.

 &lt;p&gt;We establish global convergence of the (1+1) evolution strategy, i.e.,
convergence to a critical point independent of the initial state. More
precisely, we show the existence of a critical limit point, using a suitable
extension of the notion of a critical point to measurable functions. At its
core, the analysis is based on a novel progress guarantee for elitist,
rank-based evolutionary algorithms. By applying it to the (1+1) evolution
strategy we are able to provide an accurate characterization of whether global
convergence is guaranteed with full probability, or whether premature
convergence is possible. We illustrate our results on a number of example
applications ranging from smooth (non-convex) cases over different types of
saddle points and ridge functions to discontinuous and extremely rugged
problems.

Now, an experiment shows that when light propagates through a waveguide it only takes a weakly coupled line of atoms to single out its photons, or bunch them together, unveiling and controlling its quantum nature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nphoton/rss/current/~4/AIfm1lxeahc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Missense mutations T166M, Q242L, T336M, and Y474C in the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R) α3 subunit gene are associated with epileptic seizures, dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. When incorporated into GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs expressed in oocytes, all mutations are known to reduce GABA-evoked whole-cell currents. However, their impact on the properties of inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) is unknown, largely because it is difficult to establish, much less control, the stoichiometry of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R expressed in native neuronal synapses. To circumvent this problem, we employed a HEK293 cell-neuron co-culture expression system that permits the recording of IPSCs mediated by a pure population of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs with a defined stoichiometry. We first demonstrated that IPSCs mediated by α3-containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs (α3β3γ2) decay significantly slower than those mediated by α1-containing isoforms (α1β2γ2 or α1β3γ2). GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α3 mutations did not affect IPSC peak amplitudes or 10–90% rise times, but three of the mutations affected IPSC decay. T336M significantly accelerated the IPSC decay rate whereas T166M and Y474C had the opposite effect. The acceleration of IPSC decay kinetics caused by the T366M mutation was returned to wild-type-like values by the anti-epileptic medication, midazolam. Quantification experiments in HEK293 cells revealed a significant reduction in cell-surface expression for all mutants, in agreement with previous oocyte data. Taken together, our results show that impaired surface expression and altered IPSC decay rates could both be significant factors underlying the pathologies associated with these mutations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is an important factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia-derived lysosomal cathepsins have been increasingly recognized as important inflammatory mediators that trigger signaling pathways that aggravate neuroinflammation. In vitro, a contribution to neuroinflammation processes has been shown for cathepsin X: however, the expression patterns and functional role of cathepsin X in neuroinflammatory brain pathology remain elusive. In this study we analyzed the expression, activity, regional distribution and cellular localization of cathepsin X in the rat brain with neuroinflammation-induced neurodegeneration. The unilateral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced a strong upregulation of cathepsin X expression and its activity in the ipsilateral striatum. In addition to the striatum, cathepsin X overexpression was detected in other brain areas such as the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, subventricular zone and external globus pallidus, whereas the upregulation was mainly restricted to activated microglia and reactive astrocytes. Continuous administration of the cathepsin X inhibitor AMS36 indicated protective effects against LPS-induced striatal degeneration, as seen by the attenuated LPS-mediated dilation of the lateral ventricles and partial decreased extent of striatal lesion. Taken together, our results indicate that cathepsin X plays a role as a pathogenic factor in neuroinflammation-induced neurodegeneration and represents a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases associated with neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established technique for mapping brain microstructure and white matter tracts in vivo. High resolution DTI, however, is usually associated with low intrinsic sensitivity and therefore long acquisition times. By increasing sensitivity, high magnetic fields can alleviate these demands, yet high fields are also typically associated with significant susceptibility-induced image distortions. This study explores the potential arising from employing new pulse sequences and emerging hardware at ultrahigh fields, to overcome these limitations. To this end, a 15.2 T MRI instrument equipped with a cryocooled surface transceiver coil was employed, and DTI experiments were compared between SPatiotemporal ENcoding (SPEN), a technique that tolerates well susceptibility-induced image distortions, and double-sampled Spin-Echo Echo-Planar Imaging (SE-EPI) methods. Following optimization, SE-EPI afforded whole brain DTI maps at 135 μm isotropic resolution that possessed higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) than SPEN counterparts. SPEN, however, was a better alternative to SE-EPI when focusing on challenging regions of the mouse brain –including the olfactory bulb and the cerebellum. In these instances, the higher robustness of fully refocused SPEN acquisitions coupled to its built-in zooming abilities, provided in vivo DTI maps with 75 μm nominal isotropic spatial resolution. These DTI maps, and in particular the mean diffusion direction (MDD) details, exhibited variations that matched very well the anatomical features known from histological brain Atlases. Using these capabilities, the development of the olfactory bulb (OB) in live mice was followed from week 1 post-partum, until adulthood. The diffusivity of this organ showed a systematic decrease in its overall isotropic value and increase in its fractional anisotropy with age; this maturation was observed for all regions used in the OB's segmentation but was most evident for the lobules' centers, in particular for the granular cell layer. The complexity of the OB neuronal connections also increased during maturation, as evidenced by the growth in directionalities arising in the mean diffusivity direction maps.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is mainly manifested as a continuous and progressive decline in cognitive ability. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are pathological hallmarks of AD and due to accumulated phosphorylated Tau. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), as a major Tau kinase and a downstream target of the serine protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, can regulate Tau phosphorylation in AD. Importantly, the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway is involved in glucose metabolism, and abnormal glucose metabolism is found in the AD brain. Numerous studies have shown that electroacupuncture (EA), which is thought to be a potential complementary therapeutic approach for AD, can protect cognitive ability to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether the protective and beneficial mechanism of EA on cognition was mediated by the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway, thereby improving glucose metabolism and Tau phosphorylation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;EA was applied to the Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) acupoints of 6-month-old amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) mice for 20 min, and then quickly prick Shuigou (GV26) acupoint. The intervention was performed once every other day for 28 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed on C57BL/6N (Non-Tg) mice, APP/PS1 (Tg) mice and EA-treated Tg (Tg + EA) mice to evaluate the effect of EA therapy on cognitive function. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET), immunohistochemistry, and western blotting (WB) were used to investigate the possible mechanism underlying the effect of EA on AD.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;EA treatment significantly improved the cognition of APP/PS1 mice and the glucose uptake rate in the hippocampus. Furthermore, EA inhibited the phosphorylation of Tau (Ser199 and Ser202) proteins by inducing AKT (Ser473) and GSK3β (Ser9) phosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that EA intervention protects cognition by enhancing glucose metabolism and inhibiting abnormal phosphorylation of Tau protein in the AD model mice, and the AKT/GSK3β pathway might play an irreplaceable role in the regulation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a complex disorder about which much is still unknown. Potential treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have not been exploited, in part because of the variability in behavioral response. This can be overcome with the use of response biomarkers. It has been however shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can the relieve positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). This exploratory work aims to establish a quantitative methodological tool, based on high-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG) data analysis, to assess the effect of rTMS on patients with schizophrenia and AVH. Ten schizophrenia patients with drug-resistant AVH were divided into two groups: the treatment group (TG) received 1 Hz rTMS treatment during 10 daily sessions (900 pulses/session) over the left T3-P3 International 10-20 location. The control group (CG) received rTMS treatment over the Cz (vertex) EEG location. We used the P300 oddball auditory paradigm, known for its reduced amplitude in schizophrenia with AVH, and recorded high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG, 256 channels), twice for each patient: pre-rTMS and 1 week post-rTMS treatment. The use of HD-EEG enabled the analysis of the data in the time domain, but also in the frequency and source-space connectivity domains. The HD-EEG data were linked with the clinical outcome derived from the auditory hallucinations subscale (AHS) of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS), the Quality of Life Scale (QoLS), and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). The general results show a variability between subjects, independent of the group they belong to. The time domain showed a higher N1-P3 amplitude post-rTMS, the frequency domain a higher power spectral density (PSD) in the alpha and beta bands, and the connectivity analysis revealed a higher brain network integration (quantified using the participation coefficient) in the beta band. Despite the small number of subjects and the high variability of the results, this work shows a robust data analysis and an interplay between morphology, spectral, and connectivity data. The identification of a trend post-rTMS for each domain in our results is a first step toward the definition of quantitative neurophysiological parameters to assess rTMS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In recent years, there have been multiple works of literature reviewing methods for automatically segmenting multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. However, there is no literature systematically and individually review deep learning-based MS lesion segmentation methods. Although the previous review also included methods based on deep learning, there are some methods based on deep learning that they did not review. In addition, their review of deep learning methods did not go deep into the specific categories of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). They only reviewed these methods in a generalized form, such as supervision strategy, input data handling strategy, etc. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature in automated multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation based on deep learning. Algorithms based on deep learning reviewed are classified into two categories through their CNN style, and their strengths and weaknesses will also be given through our investigation and analysis. We give a quantitative comparison of the methods reviewed through two metrics: Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Positive Predictive Value (PPV). Finally, the future direction of the application of deep learning in MS lesion segmentation will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Access to communication is critical for individuals with late-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and minimal volitional movement, but they sometimes present with concomitant visual or ocular motility impairments that affect their performance with eye tracking or visual brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. In this study, we explored the use of modified eye tracking and steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) BCI, in combination with the Shuffle Speller typing interface, for this population. Two participants with late-stage ALS, visual impairments, and minimal volitional movement completed a single-case experimental research design comparing copy-spelling performance with three different typing systems: (1) commercially available eye tracking communication software, (2) Shuffle Speller with modified eye tracking, and (3) Shuffle Speller with SSVEP BCI. Participant 1 was unable to type any correct characters with the commercial system, but achieved accuracies of up to 50% with Shuffle Speller eye tracking and 89% with Shuffle Speller BCI. Participant 2 also had higher maximum accuracies with Shuffle Speller, typing with up to 63% accuracy with eye tracking and 100% accuracy with BCI. However, participants’ typing accuracy for both Shuffle Speller conditions was highly variable, particularly in the BCI condition. Both the Shuffle Speller interface and SSVEP BCI input show promise for improving typing performance for people with late-stage ALS. Further development of innovative BCI systems for this population is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Walking while performing a secondary task (dual-task (DT) walking) increases cognitive workload in young adults. To date, few studies have used neurophysiological measures in combination to subjective measures to assess cognitive workload during a walking task. This combined approach can provide more insights into the amount of cognitive resources in relation with the perceived mental effort involving in a walking task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Question: The objective was to examine cognitive workload in young adults during walking conditions varying in complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-five young adults (mean = 24.4 ± 5.4) performed four conditions: (1) usual walking, (2) simple DT walking, (3) complex DT walking and (4) standing while subtracting. During the walking task, mean speed, cadence, stride time, stride length, and their respective coefficient of variation (CV) were recorded. Cognitive workload will be measured through changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (ΔHbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ΔHbR) during walking in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and perceived mental demand score from NASA-TLX questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In young adults, ΔHbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the DLPFC increased from usual walking to both DT walking conditions and standing while subtracting condition. ΔHbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; did not differ between the simple and complex DT and between the complex DT and standing while subtracting condition. Perceived mental demand gradually increased with walking task complexity. As expected, all mean values of gait parameters were altered according to task complexity. CV of speed, cadence and stride time were significantly higher during DT walking conditions than during usual walking whereas CV of stride length was only higher during complex DT walking than during usual walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: Young adults had greater cognitive workload in the two DT walking conditions compared to usual walking. However, only the mental demand score from NASA-TLX questionnaire discriminated simple from complex DT walking. Subjective measure provides complementary information to objective one on changes in cognitive workload during challenging walking tasks in young adults. These results may be useful to improve our understanding of cognitive workload during walking.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) plays an important role in controlling the gaze at a visual target. Although patients with vestibular hypofunction aim to improve their VOR function, some retain dysfunction for a long time. Previous studies have explored the effects of direct current stimulation on vestibular function; however, the effects of random noise stimulation on eye–head coordination have not previously been tested. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the effects of high frequency noisy vestibular stimulation (HF-nVS) on eye–head coordination related to VOR function. Thirteen healthy young adult participants with no serious disease took part in our study. The current amplitude and density used were 0.4 mA and 0.2 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, with a random noise frequency of 100–640 Hz. The electrodes were located on both mastoid processes. The stimulus duration and fade in/out duration were 600 and 10 s, respectively. Subjects oscillated their head horizontally, gazing at the fixation point, at 1 Hz (0.5 cycles/s) for 30 repetitions. The coordination of eye–head movements was measured by eye-tracking and a motion capture system. Peak-to-peak angles for eye and head movement and deviation of the visual line from the fixation target revealed no significant differences between HF-nVS and sham. The lag time between the eye and head movement with HF-nVS post-stimulation was significantly shorter than that of the sham. We found that HF-nVS can reduce the lag time between eye and head movement and improve coordination, contributing to a clear retinal image. This technique could be applied as a form of VOR training for patients with vestibular hypofunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for the motor symptoms of movement disorders including Parkinson's Disease (PD). Despite its therapeutic benefits, STN-DBS has been associated with adverse effects on mood and cognition. Specifically, apathy, which is defined as a loss of motivation, has been reported to emerge or to worsen following STN-DBS. However, it is often challenging to disentangle the effects of STN-DBS per se from concurrent reduction of dopamine replacement therapy, from underlying PD pathology or from disease progression. To this end, pre-clinical models allow for the dissociation of each of these factors, and to establish neural substrates underlying the emergence of motivational symptoms following STN-DBS. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of rodent studies assessing the effects of STN-DBS on reward seeking, reward motivation and reward consumption across a variety of behavioral paradigms. We find that STN-DBS decreases reward seeking in the majority of experiments, and we outline how design of the behavioral task and DBS parameters can influence experimental outcomes. While an early hypothesis posited that DBS acts as a “functional lesion,” an analysis of lesions and inhibition of the STN revealed no consistent pattern on reward-related behavior. Thus, we discuss alternative mechanisms that could contribute to the amotivational effects of STN-DBS. We also argue that optogenetic-assisted circuit dissection could yield important insight into the effects of the STN on motivated behavior in health and disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of STN-DBS on motivated behavior-will be critical for optimizing the clinical application of STN-DBS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests divergent thinking is the cognitive basis of creative thoughts. Neuroimaging literature using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has revealed network reorganizations during divergent thinking. Recent studies have revealed the changes of network organizations when performing creativity tasks, but such brain reconfigurations may be prolonged after task and be modulated by the trait of creativity. To investigate the dynamic reconfiguration, 40 young participants were recruited to perform consecutive Alternative Uses Tasks (AUTs) for divergent thinking and two resting-state scans (before and after AUT) were used for mapping the brain reorganizations after AUT. We split participants into high- and low-creative groups based on creative achievement questionnaire (CAQ) and targeted on reconfigurations of the two brain networks: (1) default-mode network (DMN) and (2) the network seeded at the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) because the between-group difference of AUT-induced brain activation located at the left IFG. The changes of post-AUT RSFCs (DMN and IFGN) indicated the prolonged effect of divergent thinking. More specifically, the alterations of RSFC&lt;sub&gt;IFG−AG&lt;/sub&gt; and RSFC&lt;sub&gt;IFG−IPL&lt;/sub&gt; (AG: angular gyrus, IPG: inferior parietal lobule) in the high-creative group had positive relationship with their AUT performances (originality and fluency), but not found in the low-creative group. Furthermore, the RSFC changes of DMN did not present significant relationships with AUT performances. The findings not only confirmed the possibility of brain dynamic reconfiguration following divergent thinking, but also suggested the distinct IFGN reconfiguration between individuals with different creativity levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The topographic organization of afferents to the hippocampal CA3 subfield are well-studied, but their role in influencing the spatiotemporal dynamics of population activity is not understood. Using a large-scale, computational neuronal network model of the entorhinal-dentate-CA3 system, the effects of the perforant path, mossy fibers, and associational system on the propagation and transformation of network spiking patterns were investigated. A correlation map was constructed to characterize the spatial structure and temporal evolution of pairwise correlations which underlie the emergent patterns found in the population activity. The topographic organization of the associational system gave rise to changes in the spatial correlation structure along the longitudinal and transverse axes of the CA3. The resulting gradients may provide a basis for the known functional organization observed in hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The Fano factor, defined as the variance-to-mean ratio of spike counts in a time window, is often used to measure the variability of neuronal spike trains. However, despite its transparent definition, careless use of the Fano factor can easily lead to distorted or even wrong results. One of the problems is the unclear dependence of the Fano factor on the spiking rate, which is often neglected or handled insufficiently. In this paper we aim to explore this problem in more detail and to study the possible solution, which is to evaluate the Fano factor in the operational time. We use equilibrium renewal and Markov renewal processes as spike train models to describe the method in detail, and we provide an illustration on experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex auto-immune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that involves a range of CNS and immune cells. MS is characterized by chronic neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neuronal loss, but the molecular causes of this disease remain poorly understood. One cellular process that could provide insight into MS pathophysiology and also be a possible therapeutic avenue, is autophagy. Autophagy is an intracellular degradative pathway essential to maintain cellular homeostasis, particularly in neurons as defects in autophagy lead to neurodegeneration. One of the functions of autophagy is to maintain cellular homeostasis by eliminating defective or superfluous proteins, complexes, and organelles, preventing the accumulation of potentially cytotoxic damage. Importantly, there is also an intimate and intricate interplay between autophagy and multiple aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity. Thus, autophagy is implicated in two of the main hallmarks of MS, neurodegeneration, and inflammation, making it especially important to understand how this pathway contributes to MS manifestation and progression. This review summarizes the current knowledge about autophagy in MS, in particular how it contributes to our understanding of MS pathology and its potential as a novel therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Microglia are the main immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and they are devoted to the active surveillance of the CNS during homeostasis and disease. In the last years, the microglial receptor Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) has been defined to mediate several microglial functions, including phagocytosis, survival, proliferation, and migration, and to be a key regulator of a new common microglial signature induced under neurodegenerative conditions and aging, also known as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Although microglial TREM2 has been mainly studied in chronic neurodegenerative diseases, few studies address its regulation and functions in acute inflammatory injuries. In this context, the present work aims to study the regulation of TREM2 and its functions after reparative axonal injuries, using two-well established animal models of anterograde and retrograde neuronal degeneration: the perforant pathway transection (PPT) and the facial nerve axotomy (FNA). Our results indicate the appearance of a subpopulation of microglia expressing TREM2 after both anterograde and retrograde axonal injury. TREM2+ microglia were not directly related to proliferation, instead, they were associated with specific recognition and/or phagocytosis of myelin and degenerating neurons, as assessed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Characterization of TREM2+ microglia showed expression of CD16/32, CD68, and occasional Galectin-3. However, specific singularities within each model were observed in P2RY12 expression, which was only downregulated after PPT, and in ApoE, where de novo expression was detected only in TREM2+ microglia after FNA. Finally, we report that the pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokine microenvironment, which may affect phagocytosis, did not directly modify the induction of TREM2+ subpopulation in any injury model, although it changed TREM2 levels due to modification of the microglial activation pattern. In conclusion, we describe a unique TREM2+ microglial subpopulation induced after axonal injury, which is directly associated with phagocytosis of specific cell remnants and show different phenotypes, depending on the microglial activation status and the degree of tissue injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the direct monosynaptic projections from cortical functional regions to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus for understanding the functions of the CSF-contacting nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The Sprague–Dawley rats received cholera toxin B subunit (CB) injections into the CSF-contacting nucleus. After 7–10 days of survival time, the rats were perfused, and the whole brain and spinal cord were sliced under a freezing microtome at 40 μm. All sections were treated with the CB immunofluorescence reaction. The retrogradely labeled neurons in different cortical areas were revealed under a confocal microscope. The distribution features were further illustrated under 3D reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The retrogradely labeled neurons were identified in the olfactory, orbital, cingulate, insula, retrosplenial, somatosensory, motor, visual, auditory, association, rhinal, and parietal cortical areas. A total of 12 functional areas and 34 functional subregions showed projections to the CSF-contacting nucleus in different cell intensities.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;According to the connectivity patterns, we conclude that the CSF-contacting nucleus participates in cognition, emotion, pain, visceral activity, etc. The present study firstly reveals the cerebral cortex→CSF-contacting nucleus connections, which implies the multiple functions of this special nucleus in neural and body fluid regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Improvement of imaging quality has the potential to visualize previously unseen building blocks of the brain and is therefore one of the great challenges in neuroscience. Rapid development of new tissue clearing techniques in recent years have attempted to solve imaging compromises in thick brain samples, particularly for high resolution optical microscopy, where the clearing medium needs to match the high refractive index of the objective immersion medium. These problems are exacerbated in insect tissue, where numerous (initially air-filled) tracheal tubes branching throughout the brain increase the scattering of light. To date, surprisingly few studies have systematically quantified the benefits of such clearing methods using objective transparency and tissue shrinkage measurements. In this study we compare a traditional and widely used insect clearing medium, methyl salicylate combined with permanent mounting in Permount (“MS/P”) with several more recently applied clearing media that offer tunable refractive index (n): 2,2′-thiodiethanol (TDE), “SeeDB2” (in variants SeeDB2S and SeeDB2G matched to oil and glycerol immersion, n = 1.52 and 1.47, respectively) and Rapiclear (also with n = 1.52 and 1.47). We measured transparency and tissue shrinkage by comparing freshly dissected brains with cleared brains from dipteran flies, with or without addition of vacuum or ethanol pre-treatments (dehydration and rehydration) to evacuate air from the tracheal system. The results show that ethanol pre-treatment is very effective for improving transparency, regardless of the subsequent clearing medium, while vacuum treatment offers little measurable benefit. Ethanol pre-treated SeeDB2G and Rapiclear brains show much less shrinkage than using the traditional MS/P method. Furthermore, at lower refractive index, closer to that of glycerol immersion, these recently developed media offer outstanding transparency compared to TDE and MS/P. Rapiclear protocols were less laborious compared to SeeDB2, but both offer sufficient transparency and refractive index tunability to permit super-resolution imaging of local volumes in whole mount brains from large insects, and even light-sheet microscopy. Although long-term permanency of Rapiclear stored samples remains to be established, our samples still showed good preservation of fluorescence after storage for more than a year at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: The endocannabinoid system is involved in several diseases such as addictive disorders, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and eating disorders. As often mice are used as the preferred animal model in translational research, in particular when using genetically modified mice, this study aimed to provide a systematic analysis of in vivo cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor ligand-binding capacity using positron emission tomography (PET) using the ligand [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]MK-9470. We then compared the PET results with literature data from immunohistochemistry (IHC) to review the consistency between ex vivo protein expression and in vivo ligand binding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Six male C57BL/6J (6–9 weeks) mice were examined with the CB1 receptor ligand [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]MK-9470 and small animal PET. Different brain regions were evaluated using the parameter %ID/ml. The PET results of the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]MK-9470 accumulation in the mouse brain were compared with immunohistochemical literature data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The ligand [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]MK-9470 was taken up into the mouse brain within 5 min after injection and exhibited slow kinetics. It accumulated highly in most parts of the brain. PET and IHC classifications were consistent for most parts of the telencephalon, while brain regions of the diencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon were rated higher with PET than IHC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This preclinical [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]MK-9470 study demonstrated the radioligand’s applicability for imaging the region-specific CB1 receptor availability in the healthy adult mouse brain and thus offers the potential to study CB1 receptor availability in pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;cAMP signaling has powerful, negative effects on cognitive functions of the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), opening potassium channels to reduce firing and impair working memory, and increasing tau phosphorylation in aging neurons. This contrasts with cAMP actions in classic circuits, where it enhances plasticity and transmitter release. PDE4 isozymes regulate cAMP actions, and thus have been a focus of research and drug discovery. Previous work has focused on the localization of PDE4A and PDE4B in dlPFC, but PDE4D is also of great interest, as it is the predominant PDE4 isoform in primate association cortex, and PDE4D expression decreases with aging in human dlPFC. Here we used laser-capture microdissection transcriptomics and found that PDE4D message is enriched in pyramidal cells compared to GABAergic PV-interneurons in layer III of the human dlPFC. A parallel study in rhesus macaques using high-spatial resolution immunoelectron microscopy revealed the ultrastructural locations of PDE4D in primate dlPFC with clarity not possible in human post-mortem tissue. PDE4D was especially prominent in dendrites associated with microtubules, mitochondria, and likely smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). There was substantial postsynaptic labeling in dendritic spines, associated with the SER spine-apparatus near glutamatergic-like axospinous synapses, but sparse labeling in axon terminals. We also observed dense PDE4D labeling perisynaptically in astroglial leaflets ensheathing glutamatergic connections. These data suggest that PDE4D is strategically positioned to regulate cAMP signaling in dlPFC glutamatergic synapses and circuits, especially in postsynaptic compartments where it is localized to influence cAMP actions on intracellular trafficking, mitochondrial physiology, and internal calcium release.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To characterize the clinical phenotypes associated with the “hot cross bun” sign (HCBs) on MRI and identify correlations between neuroimaging and clinical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Firstly, we screened a cohort of patients with HCBs from our radiologic information system (RIS) in our center. Secondly, we systematically reviewed published cases on HCBs and classified all these cases according to their etiologies. Finally, we characterized all HCBs cases in detail and classified the disease spectra and their clinical heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Out of a total of 3,546 patients who were screened, we identified 40 patients with HCBs imaging sign in our cohort; systemic literature review identified 39 cases, which were associated with 14 diseases. In our cohort, inflammation [neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)] and toxicants [toxic encephalopathy caused by phenytoin sodium (TEPS)] were some of the underlying etiologies. Published cases by systemic literature review were linked to metabolic abnormality, degeneration, neoplasm, infection, and stroke. We demonstrated that the clinical phenotype, neuroimaging characteristics, and HCBs response to therapy varied greatly depending on underlying etiologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This is the first to report HCBs spectra in inflammatory and toxication diseases. Our study and systemic literature review demonstrated that the underpinning disease spectrum may be broader than previously recognized.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;To identify clinical, laboratory, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in predicting incident stroke and dementia in Korean patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 87 Korean CADASIL patients who had undergone baseline clinical, laboratory, and MRI examinations between March 2012 and February 2015. The primary outcome of this study is the occurrence of stroke and dementia during the study period. The occurrence of incident stroke was confirmed by neuroimaging study, and dementia was defined by the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, criteria.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Of the 87 patients, 57.5% were men, and the mean age was 63 ± 13 years (range 34–90 years), and 82 patients (94.3%) had p.Arg544Cys mutation. During an average follow-up of 67 months (interquartile range: 53–69 months), incident stroke occurred in 14 of 87 patients (16.1%) and incident dementia in 7 of 70 non-demented patients (10.0%). In adjusted analysis, increased systolic blood pressure was associated with increased risk of incident stroke [for every 10-mmHg increase; hazard ratio, 1.44 (1.02–2.03)]. Apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia [hazard ratio, 10.70 (1.27–89.88)].&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In this study, apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype was associated with the development of incident dementia, and higher blood pressure was associated with increased risk of incident stroke in CADASIL patients with predominant p.Arg544Cys mutation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X chromosome-linked disease associated with severe intellectual disabilities. Previous studies using the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout (KO) mouse, an FXS mouse model, have attributed behavioral deficits to synaptic dysfunctions. However, how functional deficits at neural network level lead to abnormal behavioral learning remains unexplored. Here, we show that the efficacy of hippocampal engram reactivation is reduced in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice performing contextual fear memory recall. Experiencing an enriched environment (EE) prior to learning improved the engram reactivation efficacy and rescued memory recall in the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. In addition, chemogenetically inhibiting EE-engaged neurons in CA1 reverses the rescue effect of EE on memory recall. Thus, our results suggest that inappropriate engram reactivation underlies cognitive deficits in FXS, and enriched environment may rescue cognitive deficits by improving network activation accuracy.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Affective responses depend on assigning value to environmental predictors of threat or reward. Neuroanatomically, this affective value is encoded at both cortical and subcortical levels. However, the purpose of this distributed representation across functional hierarchies remains unclear. Using fMRI in mice, we mapped a discrete cortico-limbic loop between insular cortex (IC), central amygdala (CE), and nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), which decomposes the affective value of a conditioned stimulus (CS) into its salience and valence components. In IC, learning integrated unconditioned stimulus (US)-evoked bodily states into CS valence. In turn, CS salience in the CE recruited these CS representations bottom-up via the cholinergic NBM. This way, the CE incorporated interoceptive feedback from IC to improve discrimination of CS valence. Consequently, opto-/chemogenetic uncoupling of hierarchical information flow disrupted affective learning and conditioned responding. Dysfunctional interactions in the IC↔CE/NBM network may underlie intolerance to uncertainty, observed in autism and related psychiatric conditions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-molecular protein complex that converts inactive cytokine precursors into active forms of IL-1β and IL-18. The NLRP3 inflammasome is frequently associated with the damaging inflammation of non-communicable disease states and is considered an attractive therapeutic target. However, there is much regarding the mechanism of NLRP3 activation that remains unknown. Chloride efflux is suggested as an important step in NLRP3 activation, but which chloride channels are involved is still unknown. We used chemical, biochemical, and genetic approaches to establish the importance of chloride channels in the regulation of NLRP3 in murine macrophages. Specifically, we identify LRRC8A, an essential component of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), as a vital regulator of hypotonicity-induced, but not DAMP-induced, NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Although LRRC8A was dispensable for canonical DAMP-dependent NLRP3 activation, this was still sensitive to chloride channel inhibitors, suggesting there are additional and specific chloride sensing and regulating mechanisms controlling NLRP3.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Microbes are embedded in complex communities where they engage in a wide array of intra- and inter-specific interactions. The extent to which these interactions drive or impede microbiome diversity is not well understood. Historically, two contrasting hypotheses have been suggested to explain how species interactions could influence diversity. 'Ecological Controls' (EC) predicts a negative relationship, where the evolution or migration of novel types is constrained as niches become filled. In contrast, 'Diversity Begets Diversity' (DBD) predicts a positive relationship, with existing diversity promoting the accumulation of further diversity via niche construction and other interactions. Using high-throughput amplicon sequencing data from the Earth Microbiome Project, we provide evidence that DBD is strongest in low-diversity biomes, but weaker in more diverse biomes, consistent with biotic interactions initially favoring the accumulation of diversity (as predicted by DBD). However, as niches become increasingly filled, diversity hits a plateau (as predicted by EC).</content>

 The posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) is necessary for goal-directed action, however the role of the direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) spiny projection neurons in the pDMS in such actions remains unclear. In this series of experiments, we examined the role of pDMS SPNs in goal-directed action in rats and found that, whereas dSPNs were critical for goal-directed learning and for energizing the learned response, iSPNs were involved in updating that learning to support response flexibility. Instrumental training elevated expression of the plasticity marker Zif268 in dSPNs only, and chemogenetic suppression of dSPN activity during training prevented goal-directed learning. Unilateral optogenetic inhibition of dSPNs induced an ipsilateral response bias in goal-directed action performance. In contrast, although initial goal-directed learning was unaffected by iSPN manipulations, optogenetic inhibition of iSPNs, but not dSPNs, impaired the updating of this learning and attenuated response flexibility after changes in the action-outcome contingency.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Oxytocin (Oxt) signaling via its receptor, the Oxt receptor (Oxtr), is important to the onset of mammalian maternal care. Specifically, evidence suggests that Oxt signaling around the time of parturition underlies the critical shift in how pups are perceived, i.e. from aversive stimuli to rewarding stimuli. Previous work from our lab has found that both Oxtr knockout (-/-) mice and forebrain-specific Oxtr knockout (FB/FB) are more likely than controls to abandon their first litters. Based on these data, we hypothesized that this observed pup abandonment phenotype was due to a failure of the brain to switch to a more maternal state. In order to identify where in the brain Oxt signaling contributes to the onset of maternal care we performed three experiments. In Experiment 1, virgin Oxtr FB/FB females were assessed for genotypic differences in maternal behavior and c-Fos expression following maternal sensitization was quantified. In Experiment 2, c-Fos expression was quantified in Oxtr -/- and Oxtr FB/FB females following parturition. In Experiment 3, based on our findings from Experiment 2, the Oxtr in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcc) was genetically deleted in female Oxtr floxed mice (Oxtr Flox/Flox) mice using a Cre recombinase expressing adeno-associated virus. In Experiment 1, sensitized virgin Oxtr FB/FB females had significantly lower retrieval latencies on the first day of testing and reduced c-Fos expression in the dorsal lateral septum compared to controls. In Experiment 2, increased c-Fos expression was observed in the NAcc shell of both Oxtr -/- and Oxtr FB/FB dams as compared to controls. In Experiment 3, virally mediated knockout of the Oxtr in the NAcc shell completely disrupted the onset of maternal care. Thus, by genetically deleting Oxtr expression in the NAcc the pup abandonment phenotype previously observed in Oxtr -/- mice and Oxtr FB/FB dams was recreated. Taken together, these data suggest that in post-parturient mice, Oxtr expression in the NAcc shell is critical to the onset of maternal behavior.</content>

 Site-specific genetic and epigenetic targeting of distinct cell populations is a central goal in molecular neuroscience and is crucial to understand the gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie complex phenotypes and behaviors. While recent technological advances have enabled unprecedented control over gene expression, many of these approaches are focused on selected model organisms and/or require labor-intensive customizations for different applications. The simplicity and modularity of CRISPR-based systems have transformed this aspect of genome editing, providing a variety of possible applications and targets. However, there are currently few available tools for cell-selective CRISPR regulation in neurons. Here, we optimized a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system for Cre recombinase-dependent, cell type-specific targeting. Unexpectedly, CRISPR systems based on a traditional double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) strategy exhibited leaky target gene induction in the absence of Cre. Therefore, we developed an intron-containing Cre-dependent CRISPRa system (SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR) that alleviated leaky gene induction and outperformed the traditional DIO system at endogenous genes in both HEK293T cells and rat primary neuron cultures. Using gene-specific CRISPR sgRNAs, we demonstrate that SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR can activate highly inducible genes (GRM2 and Tent5b) as well as moderately inducible genes (Sstr2 and Gadd45b) in a Cre-specific manner. These results provide a robust framework for Cre-dependent CRISPR-dCas9 approaches across different model systems, and will enable cell-specific targeting when combined with common Cre driver lines or Cre delivery via viral vectors.</content>

 The inherited muscle-wasting disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), renders skeletal muscle fibers (SMFs) Na+-overloaded, ischemic, membrane-damaged, cation-leaky, depolarized, and prone to myogenic firing. DMD fibers nevertheless survive up to 3 decades before succumbing to Ca2+-necrosis. The Ca2+-necrosis is explicable, the longevity is not. Modeling here shows that SMFs' ion homeostasis strategy, a low-cost resilient Pump-Leak/Donnan feedback process we term &quot;Donnan dominated&quot;, underpins that longevity. Together, SMFs' huge chloride-permeability and tiny sodium-permeability minimize excitability and pump costs, facilitating the outsized SMF pump-reserve that lets DMD fibers withstand deep ischemia and leaky channels. We illustrate how, as these impairments intensify, patients' chronic Na+-overload (now non-invasively evident via Na23-MRI) would change. In simulations, prolonged excitation ([-&amp;gt;] physiological Na+-overloading) and/or intense ischemia ([-&amp;gt;] too little Na+-pumping) and accumulated bleb-damage ([-&amp;gt;] too much Na+-leaking) eventually trigger Ca2+-overloading conditions. Our analysis implies an urgent need to identify SMFs' pivotal small PNa, thereby opening new therapeutic remediation routes.</content>

 Skeletal muscle fibers (SMFs) and neurons are low and high duty-cycle excitable cells constituting exceptionally large and extraordinarily small fractions of vertebrate bodies. The immense ClC-1-based chloride-permeability (PCl) of SMFs has thwarted understanding of their Pump-Leak/Donnan (P-L/D) ion homeostasis. After formally defining P-L/D set-points and feedbacks, we therefore devise a simple yet demonstrably realistic model for SMFs. Hyper-stimulated, it approximates rodent fibers' ouabain-sensitive ATP-consumption. Size-matched neuron-model/SMF-model comparisons reveal steady-states occupying two ends of an energetics/resilience P-L/D continuum. Excitable neurons' costly vulnerable process is Pump-Leak dominated. Electrically-reluctant SMFs' robust low-cost process is Donnan dominated: collaboratively, Donnan effectors and [big PCl] stabilize Vrest, while SMFs' exquisitely small PNa minimizes ATP-consumption, thus maximizing resilience. &quot;Classic&quot; excitable cell homeostasis ([small PCl][big INaleak]), de rigueur for electrically-agile neurons, is untenable for vertebrates' (including humans') major tissue. Vertebrate bodies evolved thanks to syncytially-efficient SMFs using a Donnan dominated ([big PCl][small INaleak]) ion homeostatic strategy.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The goal of this work is to study how brain volume loss at old age is affected by factors such as age, APOE gene, sex, and school level. The study of brain volume loss at old age relative to young age requires at least in principle two MRI scans performed at both young and old age. There is, however, a way to address the problem by having only one MRI scan at old age. We compute the total brain loss of elderly subjects as the ratio between the estimated brain volume and the estimated total intracranial volume. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 890 healthy subjects aged 69 to 85 were assessed. The causal analysis of factors affecting brain atrophy was performed using Probabilistic Bayesian Modeling and the mathematics of Causal Inference. We find that healthy subjects get into their seventies with an average brain volume loss of 30% from their maximum brain volume at a young age. Both age and sex are causally related to brain atrophy, with women getting to elderly age with 1% larger brain volume relative to intracranial volume than men. How the brain ages and what are the reasons for sex differences in adult lifespan are causal questions that need to be addressed with causal inference and empirical data. The graphical causal modeling presented here can be instrumental in understanding a puzzling scientific inquiry -the biological age of the brain.</content>

 The endogenous opioid system of the cerebral cortex is an important feature of antinociception and reward valuation through its modulation of inhibitory neocortical interneurons. Dysregulation of this system, through disease or drugs, disrupts the reward system and contributes to eating and mood disorders, impulsive actions, and addiction. Impulsive behaviors can be induced experimentally through infusion of the  opioid receptor specific agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin (DAMGO) into the frontal cortex in animal models. The mechanism involves increased potassium channel function, which suppresses neocortical interneuron activity. However, much of the data on the effect of this receptor on ion channels have been derived from noncortical ORs, and the identity and effects of the ion channels that the OR targets in neocortical neurons have not been thoroughly investigated. Based on previous experiments by other labs, we hypothesized that the OR could activate -dendrotoxin (DTX) sensitive channels (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.6 subunits) to exert its inhibitory effects in cortical interneurons. This, in turn, is expected to confer a variety of effects on passive and active electrical properties of the cell. We performed patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine the electrophysiological effects of ORs in cultured neocortical interneurons. We found that a range of features among the 54 membrane and action potential properties we analyzed were modulated by ORs, including action potential kinetics and frequency. The Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.6 inhibitor -DTX reversed some effects on action potential frequency, but not effects on their kinetics. Therefore, ORs in neocortical interneurons influence -DTX-sensitive channels, as well as other channels, to modulate action potential kinetics and firing properties.</content>

 Hearing loss is often asymmetric, such that hearing thresholds differ substantially between the two ears. The extreme case of such asymmetric hearing is single-sided deafness. A unilateral cochlear implant (CI) on the more severely impaired ear is an effective treatment to restore hearing. The neuro-cognitive cost of listening with a unilateral CI in multi-talker situations is at present unclear. Here, we simulated listening with a unilateral CI in young, normal-hearing listeners (N = 22) who were presented with 8-band noise-vocoded speech to one ear and intact speech to the other ear. Neural responses were recorded in the electroencephalogram (EEG) to obtain the spectro-temporal response function (sTRF) to speech. Listeners made more mistakes when answering questions about vocoded (versus intact) attended speech, indicating the behavioural cost of attending to spectrally degraded speech. At the neural level, we asked how unilateral acoustic degradation would impact the attention-induced amplification of tracking target versus distracting speech. Interestingly, unilateral degradation did not per se reduce the attention-induced amplification but instead delayed in time: Speech encoding accuracy, modelled on the basis of the sTRF, was significantly enhanced for attended versus ignored intact speech at earlier neural response latencies (&amp;lt;~250 ms). Notably, this attentional enhancement was not absent but delayed for vocoded speech. These findings suggest that attentional selection of unilateral, degraded speech is feasible but comes at the cost of delayed neural separation of competing speech, which might explain listening challenges experienced by unilateral CI users.</content>

 Humans can internally represent auditory information without an external stimulus. When imagining music, how similar are unfolding neural representations to those during the original perceived experience? Participants memorized six one-minute-long musical pieces with high accuracy. Functional MRI data were collected during: 1) silent imagery of melodies to the beat of a visual metronome; 2) same but while tapping to the beat; and 3) passive listening. During imagery, inter-subject comparison showed that melody-specific temporal response patterns were reinstated in right associative auditory cortices. When tapping accompanied imagery, the melody-specific neural patterns were extended to associative cortices bilaterally. These results indicate that the specific contents of conscious experience are encoded similarly during imagery and perception in the dynamic activity of auditory cortices. Furthermore, rhythmic motion can enhance the reinstatement of neural patterns associated with the experience of complex sounds, in keeping with models of motor to sensory influences in auditory processing.</content>

 Prior knowledge facilitates perception and allows us to interpret our sensory environment. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Theories of predictive coding propose that feedback connections between cortical levels carry predictions about upcoming sensory events whereas feedforward connections carry the error between the prediction and the sensory input. Although predictive coding has gained much ground as a viable mechanism for perception, in the context spoken language comprehension it lacks empirical support using more naturalistic stimuli. In this study, we investigated theories of predictive coding using continuous, everyday speech. EEG recordings from human participants listening to an audiobook were analysed using a 2-stage regression framework. This tested the effect of top-down linguistic information, estimated using computational language models, on the bottom-up encoding of acoustic and phonetic speech features. Our results show enhanced encoding of both semantic predictions and surprising words, based on preceding context. This suggests that signals pertaining to prediction and error units can be observed in the same electrophysiological responses to natural speech. In addition, temporal analysis of these signals reveals support for theories of predictive coding that propose that perception is first biased towards what is expected followed by what is informative.</content>

 Electroencephalography (EEG) has been commonly used to measure brain alterations in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, reported changes are limited to those obtained from using univariate measures, including activation level and frequency bands. To look beyond the activation level, we used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to elicit the pattern of information processing from EEG responses to an animacy categorization task. Comparing healthy controls (HC) with patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we found that the neural speed of animacy information processing is decreased in MCI patients. Moreover, we found critical time-points during which the representational pattern of animacy for MCI patients was significantly discriminable from that of HC, while the activation level remained unchanged. Together, these results suggest that the speed and pattern of animacy information processing provide clinically useful information as a potential biomarker for detecting early changes in MCI and AD patients.</content>

 The ability to flexibly adapt thoughts and actions in a goal-directed manner appears to rely on cognitive control mechanisms that are strongly impacted by individual differences. A powerful research strategy for investigating the nature of individual variation is to study monozygotic (identical) twins. Clear evidence of twin similarity effects have been observed in prior behavioral and neuroimaging studies, yet within the domain of cognitive control, the specificity and neural underpinnings of this similarity remains elusive. Here, we utilize a multi-task, within-subjects event-related neuroimaging design (with fMRI) to investigate twin effects through multivariate pattern similarity analyses. We focus on a set of fronto-parietal brain parcels exhibiting consistently increased activation associated with cognitive control demands across four task domains: selective attention, context processing, multi-tasking, and working memory. In these parcels, healthy young adult male and female monozygotic twin pairs had similar activation patterns, reliably in all tasks, a finding not observed in unrelated pairs. Twin activation pattern similarity effects were clearest under high control demands, were not present in a set of task-unrelated parcels, and were primarily observed during the within-trial timepoints in which the control demands peaked. Together, these results indicate that twin similarity in the neural representation of cognitive control may be domain-general but also functionally and temporally specific in relation to the level of control demand. The findings suggest a genetic and/or environmental basis for individual variation in cognitive control function, and highlight the potential of twin-based neuroimaging designs for exploring heritability questions within this domain.</content>

A fascinating wealth of life cycles is observed in biology, from unicellularity to the concerted fragmentation of multicellular units. However, the understanding of factors driving their evolution is still limited. We show that costs of fragmentation have a major impact on the evolution of life cycles due to their influence on the growth rates of the associated populations. We model a group structured population of undifferentiated cells, where cell clusters reproduce by fragmentation. Fragmentation events are associated with a cost expressed by either a fragmentation delay, an additional risk, or a cell loss. The introduction of such fragmentation costs vastly increases the set of possible life cycles. Based on these findings, we suggest that the evolution of life cycles involving splitting into multiple offspring can be directly associated with the fragmentation cost. Moreover, the impact of this cost alone is strong enough to drive the emergence of multicellular units that eventually split into many single cells, even under scenarios that strongly disfavour collectives compared to solitary individuals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gJYA77c-lOk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

When running a lab we do not think about calamities, since they are rare events for which we cannot plan while we are busy with the day-to-day management and intellectual challenges of a research lab. No lab team can be prepared for something like a pandemic such as COVID-19, which has led to shuttered labs around the globe. But many other types of crises can also arise that labs may have to weather during their lifetime. What can researchers do to make a lab more resilient in the face of such exterior forces? What systems or behaviors could we adjust in ‘normal’ times that promote lab success, and increase the chances that the lab will stay on its trajectory? We offer 10 rules, based on our current experiences as a lab group adapting to crisis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rbi8QeoDoIA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

While highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is successful in controlling the replication of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) in many patients, currently there is no cure for HIV-1, presumably due to the presence of reservoirs of the virus. One of the least studied viral reservoirs is the brain, which the virus enters by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via macrophages, which are considered as conduits between the blood and the brain. The presence of HIV-1 in the brain often leads to HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), such as encephalitis and early-onset dementia. In this study we develop a novel mathematical model that describes HIV-1 infection in the brain and in the plasma coupled via the BBB. The model predictions are consistent with data from macaques infected with a mixture of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). Using our model, we estimate the rate of virus transport across the BBB as well as viral replication inside the brain, and we compute the basic reproduction number. We also carry out thorough sensitivity analysis to define the robustness of the model predictions on virus dynamics inside the brain. Our model provides useful insight into virus replication within the brain and suggests that the brain can be an important reservoir causing long-term viral persistence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EljQ8KzoTHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The predominance of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes remains paradoxical in evolutionary theory. Of the hypotheses proposed to resolve this paradox, the ‘Red Queen hypothesis’ emphasises the potential of antagonistic interactions to cause fluctuating selection, which favours the evolution and maintenance of sex. Whereas empirical and theoretical developments have focused on host-parasite interactions, the premises of the Red Queen theory apply equally well to any type of antagonistic interactions. Recently, it has been suggested that early multicellular organisms with basic anticancer defences were presumably plagued by antagonistic interactions with transmissible cancers and that this could have played a pivotal role in the evolution of sex. Here, we dissect this argument using a population genetic model. One fundamental aspect distinguishing transmissible cancers from other parasites is the continual production of cancerous cell lines from hosts’ own tissues. We show that this influx dampens fluctuating selection and therefore makes the evolution of sex more difficult than in standard Red Queen models. Although coevolutionary cycling can remain sufficient to select for sex under some parameter regions of our model, we show that the size of those regions shrinks once we account for epidemiological constraints. Altogether, our results suggest that horizontal transmission of cancerous cells is unlikely to cause fluctuating selection favouring sexual reproduction. Nonetheless, we confirm that vertical transmission of cancerous cells can promote the evolution of sex through a separate mechanism, known as similarity selection, that does not depend on coevolutionary fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/itqpsEhdb30&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epileptic spasms are a hallmark of severe seizure disorders. The neurophysiological mechanisms and the neuronal circuit(s) that generate these seizures are unresolved and are the focus of studies reported here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tetrodotoxin model, we used 16‐channel microarrays and microwires to record electrophysiological activity in neocortex and thalamus during spasms. Chemogenetic activation was used to examine the role of neocortical pyramidal cells in generating spasms. Comparisons were made to recordings from infantile spasm patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current source density and simultaneous multiunit activity analyses indicate that the ictal events of spasms are initiated in infragranular cortical layers. A dramatic pause of neuronal activity was recorded immediately prior to the onset of spasms. This preictal pause is shown to share many features with the down states of slow wave sleep. In addition, the ensuing interictal up states of slow wave rhythms are more intense in epileptic than control animals and occasionally appear sufficient to initiate spasms. Chemogenetic activation of neocortical pyramidal cells supported these observations, as it increased slow oscillations and spasm numbers and clustering. Recordings also revealed a ramp‐up in the number of neocortical slow oscillations preceding spasms, which was also observed in infantile spasm patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide evidence that epileptic spasms can arise from the neocortex and reveal a previously unappreciated interplay between brain state physiology and spasm generation. The identification of neocortical up states as a mechanism capable of initiating epileptic spasms will likely provide new targets for interventional therapies. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Anti‐myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG‐IgG) are associated clinically with either a monophasic or relapsing disease course. We investigated the frequency and clinical importance of acquired asymptomatic brain MRI lesions in a prospective incident cohort of 74 MOG‐IgG positive children with serial MRI scans over a median of 5 years from presentation. Silent new lesions were detected in 14% of MOG‐IgG positive participants, most commonly within the first months post‐onset, with a positive predictive value for clinically relapsing disease of only 20%. Detection of asymptomatic lesions alone need not prompt initiation of chronic immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art deep classifiers are intriguingly vulnerable to universal
adversarial perturbations: single disturbances of small magnitude that lead to
misclassification of most inputs. This phenomena may potentially result in a
serious security problem. Despite the extensive research in this area, there is
a lack of theoretical understanding of the structure of these perturbations. In
image domain, there is a certain visual similarity between patterns, that
represent these perturbations, and classical Turing patterns, which appear as a
solution of non-linear partial differential equations and are underlying
concept of many processes in nature. In this paper, we provide a theoretical
bridge between these two different theories, by mapping a simplified algorithm
for crafting universal perturbations to (inhomogeneous) cellular automata, the
latter is known to generate Turing patterns. Furthermore, we propose to use
Turing patterns, generated by cellular automata, as universal perturbations,
and experimentally show that they significantly degrade the performance of deep
learning models. We found this method to be a fast and efficient way to create
a data-agnostic quasi-imperceptible perturbation in the black-box scenario.

 &lt;p&gt;The plasticity of the conduction delay between neurons plays a fundamental
role in learning. However, the exact underlying mechanisms in the brain for
this modulation is still an open problem. Understanding the precise adjustment
of synaptic delays could help us in developing effective brain-inspired
computational models in providing aligned insights with the experimental
evidence. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised biologically plausible
learning rule for adjusting the synaptic delays in spiking neural networks.
Then, we provided some mathematical proofs to show that our learning rule gives
a neuron the ability to learn repeating spatio-temporal patterns. Furthermore,
the experimental results of applying an STDP-based spiking neural network
equipped with our proposed delay learning rule on Random Dot Kinematogram
indicate the efficacy of the proposed delay learning rule in extracting
temporal features.

 &lt;p&gt;Individuals vary in the time needed to produce a spoken word, for example
when naming a picture. Similarly, they vary in how much their responses are
delayed by interfering stimuli. Several studies have linked this variability to
individual differences in inhibition abilities. The present study focuses on
the relationship between the semantic interference effect in a picture-word
naming task (longer picture-naming latencies in trials with semantically
related than unrelated distractor words) and the change in the magnitude of
this effect in the tail of the response time distribution. The positive
correlation between these two measures, when computed separately for each
participant, has been argued to reflect the involvement of selective inhibition
in the naming task. We report a series of Bayesian meta-analyses to investigate
the reliability of this relationship and to rule out possible alternative
explanations. We find that while the relationship is robust, the same
relationship is found when we calculate the index of inhibition for individual
items, rather than participants. This latter finding challenges the assumption
that this measurement reflects individual differences in inhibition ability.

 &lt;p&gt;Prehistoric rock art is often analyzed predominantly as the product of
artists intentions to create public representations of their perceptual
experiences and mental imagery. However, this representation-centered approach
tends to overlook the performative role of much material engagement. Many forms
of rock art are better conceived of as traces from artists repeated engagement
with a surface, including with previous traces. For these artists, a
potentially more relevant intention was ritualized interaction, such as
communion and petition, which were realized as materially mediated transactions
with the agencies that were believed to animate specific areas of the
environment. If so, we can expect the motifs to be strongly clustered on
ritually attractive areas, rather than to be evenly distributed on canvas-like
surfaces that would maximize their visibility as public representations. Here
we propose a novel way of testing the interaction-centered approach in terms of
preferential attachment, which is a concept from network science that describe
the well-known social phenomenon that popular agents tend to attract more
followers. We applied this approach to a case study of an archaic site in
Chihuahua, Mexico, and found that its petroglyph distribution has the form of a
power law, which is consistent with preferential attachment. We conclude that
this approach could be developed into a measure of the entanglement between
ritual processes and products in prehistoric material engagement.

 &lt;p&gt;Machine Learning (ML) techniques for image classification routinely require
many labelled images for training the model and while testing, we ought to use
images belonging to the same domain as those used for training. In this paper,
we overcome the two main hurdles of ML, i.e. scarcity of data and constrained
prediction of the classification model. We do this by introducing a visual
classifier which uses a concept of transfer learning, namely Zero-Shot Learning
(ZSL), and standard Natural Language Processing techniques. We train a
classifier by mapping labelled images to their textual description instead of
training it for specific classes. Transfer learning involves transferring
knowledge across domains that are similar. ZSL intelligently applies the
knowledge learned while training for future recognition tasks. ZSL
differentiates classes as two types: seen and unseen classes. Seen classes are
the classes upon which we have trained our model and unseen classes are the
classes upon which we test our model. The examples from unseen classes have not
been encountered in the training phase. Earlier research in this domain focused
on developing a binary classifier but, in this paper, we present a multi-class
classifier with a Zero-Shot Learning approach.

 &lt;p&gt;Individuals differ in the time it takes to produce words when naming a
picture. However, it is unknown whether this inter-individual variability
emerges in earlier stages of word production (e.g., lexical selection) or later
stages (e.g., articulation). The current study measured participants' (N = 45)
naming latencies and continuous EEG in a picture-word-interference task, as
well as naming latencies in a delayed naming task. The inter-individual
variability in naming latencies in immediate naming was not larger than the
variability in the delayed task. Thus, a large part of the variability in
immediate naming seems to originate in relatively late stages of word
production. This interpretation was complemented by the EEG data: Differences
between relatively fast vs. slow speakers were seen in response-aligned
analyses in a time window close to the vocal response. Finally, we show that
inter-individual variability can influence EEG results at the group level.

 &lt;p&gt;We present a multigrid-in-channels (MGIC) approach that tackles the quadratic
growth of the number of parameters with respect to the number of channels in
standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It has been shown that there is
a redundancy in standard CNNs, as networks with light or sparse convolution
operators yield similar performance to full networks. However, the number of
parameters in the former networks also scales quadratically in width, while in
the latter case, the parameters typically have random sparsity patterns,
hampering hardware efficiency. Our approach for building CNN architectures
scales linearly with respect to the network's width while retaining full
coupling of the channels as in standard CNNs. To this end, we replace each
convolution block with its MGIC block utilizing a hierarchy of lightweight
convolutions. Our extensive experiments on image classification, segmentation,
and point cloud classification show that applying this strategy to different
architectures like ResNet and MobileNetV3 considerably reduces the number of
parameters while obtaining similar or better accuracy. For example, we obtain
76.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a lightweight network with similar
parameters and FLOPs to MobileNetV3.

 &lt;p&gt;Coding of odorous stimuli has been mostly studied using single isolated stimuli. However, a single sniff of air in a natural environment is likely to introduce airborne chemicals emitted by multiple objects into the nose. The olfactory system is therefore faced with the task of segmenting odor mixtures to identify objects in the presence of rich and often unpredictable backgrounds. The piriform cortex is thought to be the site of object recognition and scene segmentation, yet the nature of its responses to odorant mixtures is largely unknown. In this study, we asked two related questions. (1) How are mixtures represented in the piriform cortex? And (2) Can the identity of individual mixture components be read out from mixture representations in the piriform cortex? To answer these questions, we recorded single unit activity in the piriform cortex of naïve mice while sequentially presenting single odorants and their mixtures. We find that a normalization model explains mixture responses well, both at the single neuron, and at the population level. Additionally, we show that mixture components can be identified from piriform cortical activity by pooling responses of a small population of neurons—in many cases a single neuron is sufficient. These results indicate that piriform cortical representations are well suited to perform figure-background segmentation without the need for learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The successful memory process produces specific activity in the brain network. As the brain activity of the prestimulus and encoding phases has a crucial effect on subsequent memory outcomes (e.g., remembered or forgotten), previous studies have tried to predict the memory performance in this period. Conventional studies have used the spectral power or event-related potential of specific regions as the classification feature. However, as multiple brain regions work collaboratively to process memory, it could be a better option to use functional connectivity within the memory-related brain network to predict subsequent memory performance. In this study, we acquired the EEG signals while performing an associative memory task that remembers scene–word pairs. For the connectivity analysis, we estimated the cross–mutual information within the default mode network with the time–frequency spectra at the prestimulus and encoding phases. Then, we predicted the success or failure of subsequent memory outcome with the connectivity features. We found that the classifier with support vector machine achieved the highest classification accuracy of 80.83% ± 12.65% (mean ± standard deviation) using the beta (13–30 Hz) connectivity at encoding phase among the multiple frequency bands and task phases. Using the prestimulus beta connectivity, the classification accuracy of 72.45% ± 12.52% is also achieved. Among the features, the connectivity related to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was found to contribute to successful memory encoding. The connectivity related to the posterior cingulate cortex was found to contribute to the failure of memory encoding. The present study showed for the first time the successful prediction with high accuracy of subsequent memory outcome using single-trial functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Quality of life measurements indicate that independent performance of activities of daily living, such as reaching to manipulate objects, is a high priority of individuals living with motor impairments due to spinal cord injury (SCI). In a small number of research participants with SCI, electrical stimulation applied to the dorsal epidural surface of the spinal cord, termed epidural spinal electrical stimulation (ES), has been shown to improve motor functions, such as standing and stepping. However, the impact of ES on seated reaching performance, as well as the approach to identifying stimulation parameters that improve reaching ability, have yet to be described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Herein, we characterize the effects of ES on seated reaching performance in two participants with chronic, complete loss of motor and sensory functions below thoracic-level SCI. Additionally, we report the effects of delivering stimulation to discrete cathode/anode locations on a 16-contact electrode array spanning the lumbosacral spinal segments on reach distance while participants were seated on a mat and/or in their wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Two males with mid-thoracic SCI due to trauma, each of which occurred more than 3 years prior to study participation, were enrolled in a clinical trial at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. Reaching performance was assessed, with and without ES, at several time points throughout the study using the modified functional reach test (mFRT). Altogether, participant 1 performed 1,164 reach tests over 26-time points. Participant 2 performed 480 reach tests over 17-time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Median reach distances during ES were higher for both participants compared to without ES. Forward reach distances were greater than lateral reach distances in all environments, mat or wheelchair, for both participants. Stimulation delivered in the caudal region of the array resulted in improved forward reach distance compared to stimulation in the rostral region. For both participants, when stimulation was turned off, no significant changes in reach distance were observed throughout the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: ES enhanced seated reaching-performance of individuals with chronic SCI. Additionally, electrode configurations delivering stimulation in caudal regions of the lumbosacral spinal segments may improve reaching ability compared to rostral regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dopaminergic neuronal loss is the main pathological character of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation will lead to dopaminergic neuronal loss. An indazole derivative 6-amino-1-methyl-indazole (AMI) successfully synthesized to inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation may exert a neuroprotective effect. The in vitro study showed that AMI effectively increased cell viability and alleviated the apoptosis induced by MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, AMI treatment significantly decreased the expression of p-tau and upstream kinases GSK-3β. In the MPTP-induced PD mice models, we found AMI apparently preserved dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and improved the PD behavioral symptoms. Our results demonstrate that AMI exerts a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation, representing a promising new candidate for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) helps to reduce chronic low back pain (cLBP). However, the underlying mechanism of pain relief and the neurological response to SMT remains unclear. We utilized brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) upon the application of a real-time spot pressure mechanical stimulus to assess the effects of SMT on patients with cLBP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients with cLBP (Group 1, n = 14) and age-matched healthy controls without cLBP (Group 2, n = 20) were prospectively enrolled. Brain fMRI was performed for Group 1 at three time points: before SMT (TP1), after the first SMT session (TP2), and after the sixth SMT session (TP3). The healthy controls (Group 2) did not receive SMT and underwent only one fMRI scan. During fMRI scanning, a real-time spot pressure mechanical stimulus was applied to the low back area of all participants. Participants in Group 1 completed clinical questionnaires assessing pain and quality of life using a visual analog scale (VAS) and the Chinese Short Form Oswestry Disability Index (C-SFODI), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Before SMT (TP1), there were no significant differences in brain activity between Group 1 and Group 2. After the first SMT session (TP2), Group 1 showed significantly greater brain activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left precuneus compared to Group 2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05). After the sixth SMT session (TP3), Group 1 showed significantly greater brain activity in the posterior cingulate gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus compared to Group 2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05). After both the first and sixth SMT sessions (TP2 and TP3), Group 1 had significantly lower VAS pain scores and C-SFODI scores than at TP1 (P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We observed alterations in brain activity in regions of the default mode network in patients with cLBP after SMT. These findings suggest the potential utility of the default mode network as a neuroimaging biomarker for pain management in patients with cLBP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, identifier ChiCTR1800015620.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Due to limitations of human in vivo studies, detailed computational models enable understanding the neural signaling in the degenerated auditory system and cochlear implants (CIs). Four human cochleae were used to quantify hearing levels depending on dendritic changes in diameter and myelination thickness from type I of the auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Type I neurons transmit the auditory information as spiking pattern from the inner hair cells (IHCs) to the cochlear nucleus. The impact of dendrite diameter and degree of myelination on neural signal transmission was simulated for (1) synaptic excitation via IHCs and (2) stimulation from CI electrodes. An accurate three-dimensional human cochlear geometry, along with 30 auditory pathways, mimicked the CI environment. The excitation properties of electrical potential distribution induced by two CI were analyzed. Main findings: (1) The unimodal distribution of control dendrite diameters becomes multimodal for hearing loss cases; a group of thin dendrites with diameters between 0.3 and 1 μm with a peak at 0.5 μm appeared. (2) Postsynaptic currents from IHCs excite such thin dendrites easier and earlier than under control conditions. However, this advantage is lost as their conduction velocity decreases proportionally with the diameter and causes increased spike latency and jitter in soma and axon. Firing probability reduces through the soma passage due to the low intracellular current flow in thin dendrites during spiking. (3) Compared with dendrite diameter, variations in myelin thickness have a small impact on spiking performance. (4) Contrary to synaptic excitation, CIs cause several spike initiation sites in dendrite, soma region, and axon; moreover, fiber excitability reduces with fiber diameter. In a few cases, where weak stimuli elicit spikes of a target neuron (TN) in the axon, dendrite diameter reduction has no effect. However, in many cases, a spike in a TN is first initiated in the dendrite, and consequently, dendrite degeneration demands an increase in threshold currents. (5) Threshold currents of a TN and co-stimulation of degenerated ANFs in other frequency regions depend on the electrode position, including its distance to the outer wall, the cochlear turn, and the three-dimensional pathway of the TN.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate the relationship between hematoma ventricle distance (HVD) and clinical outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with ICH in a tertiary academic hospital between July 2011 and April 2018. We retrospectively reviewed images for all patients receiving a computed tomography (CT) within 6 h after onset of symptoms and at least one follow-up CT scan within 36 h. The minimum distance of hematoma border to nearest ventricle was measured as HVD. Youden index was used to evaluate the cutoff of HVD predicting functional outcome. Logistic regression model was used to assess the HVD data and clinical poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4–6) at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 325 patients were included in our final analysis. The median HVD was 2.4 mm (interquartile range, 0–5.7 mm), and 119 (36.6%) patients had poor functional outcome at 3 months. After adjusting for age, admission Glasgow coma scale, intraventricular hemorrhage, baseline ICH volume, admission systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, hematoma expansion, withdrawal of care, and hypertension, HVD ≤ 2.5 mm was associated with increased odds of clinical poor outcome [odd ratio, 3.59, (95%CI = 1.72–7.50); p = 0.001] in multivariable logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Hematoma ventricle distance allows physicians to quickly select and stratify patients in clinical trials and thereby serve as a novel and useful addition to predict ICH prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the process of constructing engineered neural tissues, we often use mixed primary neural cells, which contain microglia in the cell culture. However, the role that microglia play in the construction of engineered neural tissue has not been well studied. Here, we generated three-dimensional (3D) engineered neural tissues by silk fibroin/collagen composite scaffolds and primary mixed cortical cells. We depleted microglial cells by magnetic separation. Then, we analyzed the neural growth, development, mature and synapse-related gene, and protein expressions compared with the control engineered neural tissues with the microglia-depleted engineered neural tissues. We found that the engineered neural tissues constructed by magnetic separation to remove microglia showed a decrease in the number of synaptic proteins and mature neurons. These findings link microglia to neuron and synaptic maturation and suggest the importance of microglia in constructing engineered neural tissues in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The mammalian retina processes sensory signals through two major pathways: a vertical excitatory pathway, which involves photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells, and a horizontal inhibitory pathway, which involves horizontal cells, and amacrine cells. This concept explains the generation of an excitatory center—inhibitory surround sensory receptive fields—but fails to explain the modulation of the retinal output by stimuli outside the receptive field. Electrical imaging of light-induced signal propagation at high spatial and temporal resolution across and within different retinal layers might reveal mechanisms and circuits involved in the remote modulation of the retinal output. Here we took advantage of a high-density complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based microelectrode array and investigated the light-induced propagation of local field potentials (LFPs) in vertical mouse retina slices. Surprisingly, the LFP propagation within the different retinal layers depends on stimulus duration and stimulus background. Application of the same spatially restricted light stimuli to flat-mounted retina induced ganglion cell activity at remote distances from the stimulus center. This effect disappeared if a global background was provided or if gap junctions were blocked. We hereby present a neurotechnological approach and demonstrated its application, in which electrical imaging evaluates stimulus-dependent signal processing across different neural layers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Motor imagery (MI) allows the design of self-paced brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), which can potentially afford an intuitive and continuous interaction. However, the implementation of non-invasive MI-based BCIs with more than three commands is still a difficult task. First, the number of MIs for decoding different actions is limited by the constraint of maintaining an adequate spacing among the corresponding sources, since the electroencephalography (EEG) activity from near regions may add up. Second, EEG generates a rather noisy image of brain activity, which results in a poor classification performance. Here, we propose a solution to address the limitation of identifiable motor activities by using combined MIs (i.e., MIs involving 2 or more body parts at the same time). And we propose two new multilabel uses of the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, namely MC2CMI and MC2SMI approaches. We recorded EEG signals from seven healthy subjects during an 8-class EEG experiment including the rest condition and all possible combinations using the left hand, right hand, and feet. The proposed multilabel approaches convert the original 8-class problem into a set of three binary problems to facilitate the use of the CSP algorithm. In the case of the MC2CMI method, each binary problem groups together in one class all the MIs engaging one of the three selected body parts, while the rest of MIs that do not engage the same body part are grouped together in the second class. In this way, for each binary problem, the CSP algorithm produces features to determine if the specific body part is engaged in the task or not. Finally, three sets of features are merged together to predict the user intention by applying an 8-class linear discriminant analysis. The MC2SMI method is quite similar, the only difference is that any of the combined MIs is considered during the training phase, which drastically accelerates the calibration time. For all subjects, both the MC2CMI and the MC2SMI approaches reached a higher accuracy than the classic pair-wise (PW) and one-vs.-all (OVA) methods. Our results show that, when brain activity is properly modulated, multilabel approaches represent a very interesting solution to increase the number of commands, and thus to provide a better interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A reliable disease model is critical to the study of specific disease mechanisms as well as for the discovery and development of new drugs. Despite providing crucial insights into the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, translation of this information to develop therapeutics in clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Reprogramming technology to convert adult somatic cells to induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) or directly reprogramming adult somatic cells to induced Neurons (iN), has allowed for the creation of better models to understand the molecular mechanisms and design of new drugs. In recent times, iPSC technology has been commonly used for modeling neurodegenerative diseases and drug discovery. However, several technological challenges have limited the application of iN. As evidence suggests, iN for the modeling of neurodegenerative disorders is advantageous compared to those derived from iPSCs. In this review, we will compare iPSCs and iN models for neurodegenerative diseases and their potential applications in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Evaluation of brain dynamics elicited by motor imagery (MI) tasks can contribute to clinical and learning applications. The multi-subject analysis is to make inferences on the group/population level about the properties of MI brain activity. However, intrinsic neurophysiological variability of neural dynamics poses a challenge for devising efficient MI systems. Here, we develop a time-frequency model for estimating the spatial relevance of common neural activity across subjects employing an introduced statistical thresholding rule. In deriving multi-subject spatial maps, we present a comparative analysis of three feature extraction methods: Common Spatial Patterns, Functional Connectivity, and Event-Related De/Synchronization. In terms of interpretability, we evaluate the effectiveness in gathering MI data from collective populations by introducing two assumptions: (i) Non-linear assessment of the similarity between multi-subject data originating the subject-level dynamics; (ii) Assessment of time-varying brain network responses according to the ranking of individual accuracy performed in distinguishing distinct motor imagery tasks (left-hand vs. right-hand). The obtained validation results indicate that the estimated collective dynamics differently reflect the flow of sensorimotor cortex activation, providing new insights into the evolution of MI responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Visual snow (VS) is a distressing, life-impacting condition with persistent visual phenomena. VS patients show cerebral hypermetabolism within the visual cortex, resulting in altered neuronal excitability. We hypothesized to see disease-dependent alterations in functional connectivity and gray matter volume (GMV) in regions associated with visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Nineteen patients with VS and 16 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was applied to examine resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Volume changes were assessed by means of voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Finally, we assessed associations between MRI indices and clinical parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Patients with VS showed hyperconnectivity between extrastriate visual and inferior temporal brain regions and also between prefrontal and parietal (angular cortex) brain regions (p &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected for age and migraine occurrence). In addition, patients showed increased GMV in the right lingual gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.05 corrected). Symptom duration positively correlated with GMV in both lingual gyri (p &amp;lt; 0.01 corrected).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study found VS to be associated with both functional and structural changes in the early and higher visual cortex, as well as the temporal cortex. These brain regions are involved in visual processing, memory, spatial attention, and cognitive control. We conclude that VS is not just confined to the visual system and that both functional and structural changes arise in VS patients, be it as an epiphenomenon or a direct contributor to the pathomechanism of VS. These in vivo neuroimaging biomarkers may hold potential as objective outcome measures of this so far purely subjective condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: In this pilot study, we examined the effects of ipsilesional high-frequency rTMS (iHF-rTMS) and contralesional low-frequency rTMS (cLF-rTMS) applied via a double-cone coil on neurophysiological and gait variables in patients with chronic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective/Hypothesis: To determine the group and individual level effects of two types of stimulation to better individualize neuromodulation for rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Using a randomized, within-subject, double-blind, sham-controlled trial with 14 chronic stroke participants iHF-rTMS and cLF-rTMS were applied via a double-cone coil to the tibialis anterior cortical representation. Neurophysiological and gait variables were compared pre-post rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A small effect of cLF-rTMS indicated increased MEP amplitudes (Cohen’s D; cLF-rTMS, d = −0.30). Group-level analysis via RMANOVA showed no significant group effects of stimulation (P &amp;gt; 0.099). However, secondary analyses of individual data showed a high degree of response variability to rTMS. Individual percent changes in resting motor threshold and normalized MEP latency correlated with changes in gait propulsive forces and walking speed (iHF-rTMS, nLAT:Pp, R = 0.632 P = 0.015; cLF-rTMS, rMT:SSWS, R = −0.557, P = 0.039; rMT:Pp, R = 0.718, P = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Changes in propulsive forces and walking speed were seen in some individuals that showed neurophysiological changes in response to rTMS. The neurological consequences of stroke are heterogeneous making a “one type fits all” approach to neuromodulation for rehabilitation unlikely. This pilot study suggests that an individual’s unique response to rTMS should be considered before the application/selection of neuromodulatory therapies. Before neuromodulatory therapies can be incorporated into standard clinical practice, additional work is needed to identify biomarkers of response and how best to prescribe neuromodulation for rehabilitation for post-stroke gait.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A projection neuron targets multiple regions beyond the functional brain area. In order to map neuronal connectivity in a massive neural network, a means for visualizing the entire morphology of a single neuron is needed. Progress has facilitated single-neuron analysis in the cerebral cortex, but individual neurons in deep brain structures remain difficult to visualize. To this end, we developed an in vivo single-cell electroporation method for juvenile and adult brains that can be performed under a standard stereomicroscope. This technique involves rapid gene transfection and allows the visualization of dendritic and axonal morphologies of individual neurons located deep in brain structures. The transfection efficiency was enhanced by directly injecting the expression vector encoding green fluorescent protein instead of monitoring cell attachment to the electrode tip. We obtained similar transfection efficiencies in both young adult (≥P40) and juvenile mice (P21–30). By tracing the axons of thalamocortical neurons, we identified a specific subtype of neuron distinguished by its projection pattern. Additionally, transfected mOrange-tagged vesicle-associated membrane protein 2–a presynaptic protein—was strongly localized in terminal boutons of thalamocortical neurons. Thus, our in vivo single-cell gene transfer system offers rapid single-neuron analysis deep in brain. Our approach combines observation of neuronal morphology with functional analysis of genes of interest, which can be useful for monitoring changes in neuronal activity corresponding to specific behaviors in living animals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Defective astrocyte function due to a genetic mutation can have major consequences for microglia and oligodendrocyte physiology, which in turn affects the white matter integrity of the brain. This review addresses the current knowledge on shared and unique pathophysiological mechanisms of astrocytopathies, including vanishing white matter, Alexander disease, megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts, Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, and oculodentodigital dysplasia. The mechanisms of disease include protein accumulation, unbalanced secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules, cytokines and chemokines by astrocytes, as well as an altered gap junctional network and a changed ionic and nutrient homeostasis. Interestingly, the extent to which astrogliosis and microgliosis are present in these astrocytopathies is highly variable. An improved understanding of astrocyte–microglia–oligodendrocyte crosstalk might ultimately lead to the identification of druggable targets for these, currently untreatable, severe conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by gradual degeneration and elimination of motor neurons (MNs) in the motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Some familial forms of ALS are caused by genetic mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) but the mechanisms driving MN disease are unclear. Identifying the naturally occurring pathology and understanding how this mutant SOD1 can affect MNs in translationally meaningful ways in a valid and reliable human cell model remains to be established. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we generated highly pure, iPSC-derived MNs with a SOD1-G93A missense mutation. With the wild-type cell line serving as an isogenic control and MNs from a patient-derived iPSC line with an SOD1-A4V mutation as a comparator, we identified pathological phenotypes relevant to ALS. The mutant MNs accumulated misfolded and aggregated forms of SOD1 in cell bodies and processes, including axons. They also developed distinctive axonal pathologies. Mutants had axonal swellings with shorter axon length and less numbers of branch points. Moreover, structural and molecular abnormalities in presynaptic and postsynaptic size and density were found in the mutants. Finally, functional studies with microelectrode array demonstrated that the individual mutant MNs exhibited decreased number of spikes and diminished network bursting, but increased burst duration. Taken together, we identified spontaneous disease phenotypes relevant to ALS in mutant SOD1 MNs from genome-edited and patient-derived iPSCs. Our findings demonstrate that SOD1 mutations in human MNs cause cell-autonomous proteinopathy, axonopathy, synaptic pathology, and aberrant neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dendrite and axon arbor wiring patterns determine the connectivity and computational characteristics of a neuron. The identities of these dendrite and axon arbors are created by differential polarization of their microtubule arrays, and their complexity and pattern are generated by the extension and organization of these arrays. We describe how several molecularly distinct microtubule organizing center (MTOC) mechanisms function during neuron differentiation to generate and arrange dendrite and axon microtubules. The temporal and spatial organization of these MTOCs generates, patterns, and diversifies arbor wiring.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), also known as retinol binding protein 3 (RBP3), is a lipophilic glycoprotein specifically secreted by photoreceptors. Enriched in the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) and recycled by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), IRBP is essential for the vision of all vertebrates as it facilitates the transfer of retinoids in the visual cycle. It also helps to transport lipids between the RPE and photoreceptors. The thiol-dependent antioxidant activity of IRBP maintains the delicate redox balance in the normal retina. Thus, its dysfunction is suspected to play a role in many retinal diseases. We have reviewed here the latest research on IRBP in both retinal health and disease, including the function and regulation of IRBP under retinal stress in both animal models and the human retina. We have also explored the therapeutic potential of targeting IRBP in retinal diseases. Although some technical barriers remain, it is possible that manipulating the expression of IRBP in the retina will rescue or prevent photoreceptor degeneration in many retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the human HERC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase protein develop intellectual disability. The tambaleante (tbl) mouse carries a HERC1 mutation characterized by cerebellar ataxia due of adult cerebellar Purkinje cells death by extensive autophagy. Our previous studies demonstrated that both the neuromuscular junction and the peripheral nerve myelin sheaths are also affected in this mutant. Moreover, there are signs of dysregulated autophagy in the central nervous system in the tbl mouse, affecting spinal cord motor neurons, and pyramidal neurons of the neocortex and the hippocampal CA3 region. The tbl mutation affects associative learning, with absence of short- and long-term potentiation in the lateral amygdala, altered spinogenesis in their neurons, and a dramatic decrease in their glutamatergic input. To assess whether other brain areas engaged in learning processes might be affected by the tbl mutation, we have studied the tbl hippocampus using behavioral tests, ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, immunohistochemistry, the Golgi-Cox method and transmission electron microscopy. The tbl mice performed poorly in the novel-object recognition, T-maze and Morris water maze tests. In addition, there was a decrease in glutamatergic input while the GABAergic one remains unaltered in the hippocampal CA1 region of tbl mice, accompanied by changes in the dendritic spines, and signs of cellular damage. Moreover, the proportions of immature and mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of the tbl hippocampus differ relative to the control mice. Together, these observations demonstrate the important role of HERC1 in regulating synaptic activity during learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objective: There is increasing evidence that high blood pressure (BP) levels and BP variability (BPV) over 24 h or longer are associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The objective of this study was to examine the association between different beat-to-beat BP parameters and in-hospital outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of acute spontaneous ICH were recruited consecutively and prospectively between September 2018 and January 2019. Beat-to-beat recordings were measured non-invasively for 5 min within the first 72 h after the onset of symptoms. BPV was analyzed by standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), average real variability (ARV), and variation independent of mean (VIM). Outcome was assessed at discharge using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between BP levels, BPV, and clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 66 patients were included, of whom 34 had poor outcomes (mRS score, 3–6). Patients with poor outcomes had significantly higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores (4.5 vs. 9, p &amp;lt; 0.001), a larger ICH volume (8 vs. 14.5 mL, p = 0.004), and an increased systolic BP (SBP) -CV (3.2 vs. 4.8, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and diastolic BP (DBP) -CV (3.7 vs. 4.9, p = 0.015). After adjustment for major covariates, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that SBP-CV was independently associated with an increased risk of poor in-hospital outcomes [odds ratio (OR) 2.535; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.211–5.305; p = 0.014]. The receiver operating characteristic area for SBP-CV in predicting poor in-hospital outcome was 0.827 (95% CI, 0.730–0.925; p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the best cutoff point was 3.551 (sensitivity, 82.35%; specificity, 68.75%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A higher beat-to-beat BPV in the first 72 h of admission was associated with unfavorable in-hospital outcomes in patients with ICH. The stabilization of BPV during the acute phase may be a therapeutic target; this could be tested in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Recent evidence shows that the fractional motion (FM) model may be a more appropriate model for describing the complex diffusion process of water in brain tissue and has shown to be beneficial in clinical applications of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the FM model averaged the anomalous diffusion parameter values, which omitted the impacts of anisotropy. This study aimed to investigate the potential feasibility of anisotropy of anomalous diffusion using the FM model for distinguishing and grading AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-four patients with AD and 11 matched healthy controls were recruited, diffusion MRI was obtained from all participants and analyzed using the FM model. Generalized fractional anisotropy (gFA), an anisotropy metric, was introduced and the gFA values of FM-related parameters, Noah exponent (α) and the Hurst exponent (H), were calculated and compared between the healthy group and AD group and between the mild AD group and moderate AD group. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to assess the diagnostic performances of the anisotropy values and the directionally averaged values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The gFA(α) and gFA(H) values of the moderate AD group were higher than those of the mild AD group in left hippocampus. The gFA(α) value of the moderate AD group was significantly higher than that of the healthy control group in both the left and right hippocampus. The gFA(ADC) values of the moderate AD group were significantly lower than those of the mild AD group and healthy control group in the right hippocampus. Compared with the gFA(α), gFA(H), α, and H, the ROC analysis showed larger areas under the curves for combination of α + gFA(α) and the combination of H + gFA(H) in differentiating the mild AD and moderate AD groups, and larger area under the curves for combination of α + gFA(α) in differentiating the healthy controls and AD groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The anisotropy of anomalous diffusion could significantly differentiate and grade patients with AD, and the diagnostic performance was improved when the anisotropy metric was combined with commonly used directionally averaged values. The utility of anisotropic anomalous diffusion may provide novel insights to profoundly understand the neuropathology of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is a conscious auditory perception in the absence of an external stimulus. Despite previous reports of a recognized association between tinnitus and cognitive deficits, the effects of tinnitus on functional and structural brain changes associated with cognitive deficits remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the changes in glucose metabolism and gray matter (GM) volume in subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) depending on tinnitus. Twenty-three subjects were subclassified into MCI with the chronic tinnitus (MCI_T) and MCI without tinnitus (MCI_NT) groups. Encouraged by the identification of neural substrates associated with tinnitus and cognitive deficits, we correlated the extent of tinnitus severity with the changes in glucose metabolism and GM volume and conducted a glucose metabolic connectivity study. Compared to the MCI_NT group, the MCI_T group showed significantly lower metabolism in the right superior temporal pole and left fusiform gyrus. Additionally, the GM volume in the right insula was markedly lower in the MCI_T group compared to the MCI_NT group. Moreover, correlation analyses in metabolism or GM volumes revealed specific brain regions associated with the cognitive decline with increasing tinnitus severity. Metabolic connectivity analysis revealed that MCI_NT had markedly strengthened intra-hemispheric connectivity in the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions than did MCI_T. Furthermore, MCI_NT showed a strong negative association between the parietal and temporal and parietal and limbic regions, but the association was not observed in MCI_T. These findings indicate that tinnitus may cause metabolic and structural changes in the brain and alters complex inter- or intra-hemispheric networks in MCI. Considering the impact of MCI on accelerating dementia, these results provide a valuable basis on which yet-to-be-identified neurodegenerative markers of tinnitus can be refined.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the naïve mouse brain, microglia and astrocytes are the most abundant immune cells; however, there is a complexity of other immune cells present including monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytic cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and B cells. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there is high inflammation, reactive microglia, and astrocytes, leaky blood–brain barrier, the buildup of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles which attract infiltrating peripheral immune cells that are interacting with the resident microglia. Limited studies have analyzed how these infiltrating immune cells contribute to the neuropathology of AD and even fewer have analyzed their interactions with the resident microglia. Understanding the complexity and dynamics of how these immune cells interact in AD will be important for identifying new and novel therapeutic targets. Thus, this review will focus on discussing our current understanding of how macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, T cells, and B cells, alongside astrocytes, are altered in AD and what this means for the disorder, as well as how these cells are affected relative to the resident microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Abnormal cerebral blood flow (CBF) and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) are sensitive biomarkers of disease progression and prognosis. This study investigated neural underpinnings of motor and cognitive recovery by longitudinally studying the changes of CBF and FC in pontine infarction (PI). Twenty patients underwent three-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D-pcASL), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans, and behavioral assessments at 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months after stroke. Twenty normal control (NC) subjects underwent the same examination once. First, we investigated CBF changes in the acute stage, and longitudinal changes from 1 week to 6 months after PI. Brain regions with longitudinal CBF changes were then used as seeds to investigate longitudinal FC alterations during the follow-up period. Compared with NC, patients in the left PI (LPI) and right PI (RPI) groups showed significant CBF alterations in the bilateral cerebellum and some supratentorial brain regions at the baseline stage. Longitudinal analysis revealed that altered CBF values in the right supramarginal (SMG_R) for the LPI group, while the RPI group showed significantly dynamic changes of CBF in the left calcarine sulcus (CAL_L), middle occipital gyrus (MOG_L), and right supplementary motor area (SMA_R). Using the SMG_R as the seed in the LPI group, FC changes were found in the MOG_L, middle temporal gyrus (MTG_L), and prefrontal lobe (IFG_L). Correlation analysis showed that longitudinal CBF changes in the SMG_R and FC values between the SMG_R and MOG_L were associated with motor and memory scores in the LPI group, and longitudinal CBF changes in the CAL_L and SMA_R were related to memory and motor recovery in the RPI group. These longitudinal CBF and accompany FC alterations may provide insights into the neural mechanism underlying functional recovery after PI, including that of motor and cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A decline in declarative or explicit memory has been extensively characterized in cognitive aging and is a hallmark of cognitive impairments. However, whether and how implicit perceptual memory varies with aging or cognitive impairment is unclear. Here, we compared implicit perceptual memory and explicit memory measures in three groups of participants: (1) 59 healthy young volunteers (20–30 years); (2) 269 healthy old volunteers (50–90 years) and (3) 21 patients with mild cognitive impairment, i.e., MCI (50–90 years). To measure explicit memory, participants were tested on standard recognition and recall tasks. To measure implicit perceptual memory, we used a classic perceptual priming paradigm. Participants had to report the shape of a visual search pop-out target whose color or position was varied randomly across trials. Perceptual priming was measured as the speedup in response time for targets that repeated in color or position. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Explicit memory was weaker in old compared to young participants, and in MCI patients compared to age- and education-matched controls; (2) Surprisingly, perceptual priming did not always decline with age: color priming was smaller in older participants but position priming was larger; (3) Position priming was less frequent in the MCI group compared to matched controls; (4) Perceptual priming and explicit memory were uncorrelated across participants. Thus, perceptual priming can increase or decrease with age or cognitive impairment, but these changes do not covary with explicit memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives&lt;p&gt;Prior work has demonstrated that executive function training or physical exercise can improve older adults’ cognition. The current study takes an exploratory approach to compare the feasibility and efficacy of online executive function training and low-intensity aerobic exercise for improving cognitive and psychosocial functioning in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Following a standard pretest-training-posttest protocol, 40 older adults (aged 65 and above) were randomly assigned to an executive function or a physical training group. A battery of cognitive and psychosocial outcome measures were administered before and after training. During the 10 weeks of self-guided training at home (25–30 min/day, 4 days/week), the executive function training group practiced a set of adaptive online executive function tasks designed by Lumos Labs, whereas the physical training group completed an adaptive Digital Video Disc (DVD)-based low-intensity aerobic exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Training transfer effects were limited. Relative to low-intensity aerobic exercise, executive function training yielded cognitive improvement on the 64-card Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST-64), a general executive function measure. Depression and stress levels dropped following both training programs, but this could be driven by decreased stress or excitement in performing the tasks over time.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The results revealed limited cognitive benefits of the online executive function training program, specifically to a near transfer test of general executive control. Importantly, the current study supports the feasibility of home-based self-guided executive function and low-intensity physical training with healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Smoking is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, smoking-related effects on intrinsic brain activity in high-risk AD population are still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;We aimed to explore differences in smoking effects on brain function between healthy elderly and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients using ReHo mapping.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We identified 64 healthy elderly controls and 116 aMCI patients, including 98 non-smoking and 18 smoking aMCI. Each subject underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scanning and neuropsychological evaluations. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) mapping was used to assess regional brain synchronization. After correction for age, gender, education, and gray matter volume, we explored the difference of ReHo among groups in a voxel-wise way based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), followed by post hoc two-sample analyses (p &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected). Further, we correlated the mean ReHo with neuropsychological scales.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Three groups were well-matched in age, gender, and education. Significant ReHo differences were found among three groups, located in the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and left angular gyrus (AG). Specifically, non-smoking aMCI had lower ReHo in SMG and AG than smoking aMCI and controls. By contrast, smoking aMCI had greater AG ReHo than healthy controls (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Across groups, correlation analyses showed that left AG ReHo correlated with MMSE (r = 0.18, p = 0.015), clock drawing test (r = 0.20, p = 0.007), immediate recall (r = 0.36, p &amp;lt; 0.001), delayed recall (r = 0.34, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and auditory verbal learning test (r = 0.20, p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Smoking might pose compensatory or protective effects on intrinsic brain activity in aMCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: There is a significant gender difference in the incidence and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its mechanisms are not completely understood. Recent studies showed that NLRP1 inflammasome was overexpressed in females under some pathological conditions such as nodular melanoma. Whether NLRP1 signals have a gender difference in AD has not been elucidated. This study was designed to investigate gender difference on the expressions of NLRP1 signals including NLRP1, Capase-1 and IL-1β in the brains of APP/PS1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Female and male APP/PS1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice (30-weeks-old) were used in this study. Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques were stained with Congo red dye and cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. Expressions of NLRP1, Capase-1 and IL-1β were measured by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting assay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The numbers of Aβ plaques in cortex and hippocampus and neuronal apoptosis in cortex were 4 and 2-folds in females than males, respectively (P &amp;lt; 0.001). The average size of Aβ plaques in both cortex (females: 3527.11 ± 539.88 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vs. males: 1920.44 ± 638.49 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and hippocampus (females: 1931 ± 308.61 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vs. males: 1038.55 ± 220.40 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were also larger in females than males (P &amp;lt; 0.01). More interestingly, expressions of NLRP1, Caspase-1, and IL-1β were markedly increased in the cortex of females as compared with males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These findings show that NLRP1 signals are higher in brains of female APP/PS1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice than males, which may be related to the gender differences of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Peer review practices differ substantially between journals and disciplines. This study presents the results of a survey of 322 editors of journals in ecology, economics, medicine, physics and psychology. We found that 49% of the journals surveyed checked all manuscripts for plagiarism, that 61% allowed authors to recommend both for and against specific reviewers, and that less than 2% used a form of open peer review. Most journals did not have an official policy on altering reports from reviewers, but 91% of editors identified at least one situation in which it was appropriate for an editor to alter a report. Editors were also asked for their views on five issues related to publication ethics. A majority expressed support for co-reviewing, reviewers requesting access to data, reviewers recommending citations to their work, editors publishing in their own journals, and replication studies. Our results provide a window into what is largely an opaque aspect of the scientific process. We hope the findings will inform the debate about the role and transparency of peer review in scholarly publishing.</content>

 Repression of genes by Polycomb requires that PRC2 modifies their chromatin by trimethylating lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). At transcriptionally active genes, di- and trimethylated H3K36 inhibit PRC2. Here, the cryo-EM structure of PRC2 on dinucleosomes reveals how binding of its catalytic subunit EZH2 to nucleosomal DNA orients the H3 N-terminus via an extended network of interactions to place H3K27 into the active site. Unmodified H3K36 occupies a critical position in the EZH2-DNA interface. Mutation of H3K36 to arginine or alanine inhibits H3K27 methylation by PRC2 on nucleosomes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Accordingly, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; H3K36A and H3K36R mutants show reduced levels of H3K27me3 and defective Polycomb repression of HOX genes. The relay of interactions between EZH2, the nucleosomal DNA and the H3 N-terminus therefore creates the geometry that permits allosteric inhibition of PRC2 by methylated H3K36 in transcriptionally active chromatin.</content>

 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous in cultivated soils, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of major crop species. Studies in controlled conditions have demonstrated the potential of AMF to enhance the growth of host plants. However, it is difficult to estimate the actual benefit in the field, not least because of the lack of suitable AMF-free controls. Here we implement a novel strategy using the selective incorporation of AMF-resistance into a genetic mapping population to evaluate maize response to AMF. We found AMF to account for about one-third of the grain production in a medium input field, as well as to affect the relative performance of different plant genotypes. Characterization of the genetic architecture of the host response indicated a trade-off between mycorrhizal dependence and benefit. We identified several QTL linked to host benefit, supporting the feasibility of breeding crops to maximize profit from symbiosis with AMF.</content>

 Older age is a strong shared risk factor for many chronic diseases and there is increasing interest in identifying aging biomarkers. Here a proteomic analysis of 1301 plasma proteins was conducted in 997 individuals between 21 and 102 years of age. We identified 651 proteins associated with age (506 over-represented, 145 underrepresented with age) was identified. Mediation analysis suggested a role for partial cis-epigenetic control of protein expression with age. Of the age-associated proteins, 33.5% and 45.3%, were associated with mortality and multimorbidity, respectively. There was enrichment of proteins associated with inflammation and extracellular matrix as well as senescence-associated secretory proteins. A 76-protein proteomic age signature predicted accumulation of chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. These data support the premise of proteomic biomarkers to monitor aging trajectories and to identify individuals at higher risk for disease to be targeted for in depth diagnostic procedures and early interventions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The soluble isoform of leptin receptor (sOb-R), secreted by the liver, regulates leptin bioavailability and bioactivity. Its reduced levels in diet-induced obesity (DIO) contribute to hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance, effects that are regulated by the endocannabinoid (eCB)/CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R system. Here we show that pharmacological activation/blockade and genetic overexpression/deletion of hepatic CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R modulates sOb-R levels and hepatic leptin resistance. Interestingly, peripheral CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R blockade failed to reverse DIO-induced reduction of sOb-R levels, increased fat mass and dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis in mice lacking C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), whereas direct activation of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R in wild-type hepatocytes reduced sOb-R levels in a CHOP-dependent manner. Moreover, CHOP stimulation increased sOb-R expression and release via a direct regulation of its promoter, while CHOP deletion reduced leptin sensitivity. Our findings highlight a novel molecular aspect by which the hepatic eCB/CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R system is involved in the development of hepatic leptin resistance and in the regulation of sOb-R levels via CHOP.</content>

 Recent years have seen a surge in methods to track and analyze animal behavior. Nevertheless, tracking individuals in closely interacting, group-living organisms remains a challenge. Here, we present anTraX, an algorithm and software package for high-throughput video tracking of color-tagged insects. anTraX combines neural network classification of animals with a novel approach for representing tracking data as a graph, enabling individual tracking even in cases where it is difficult to segment animals from one another, or where tags are obscured. The use of color tags, a well-established and robust method for marking individual insects in groups, relaxes requirements for image size and quality, and makes the software broadly applicable. anTraX is readily integrated into existing tools and methods for automated image analysis of behavior to further augment its output. anTraX can handle large-scale experiments with minimal human involvement, allowing researchers to simultaneously monitor many social groups over long time periods.</content>

		<content type="html">
 As one of the most-studied receptors, Robo plays functions in many biological processes, and its functions highly depend on Slit, the ligand of Robo. Here we uncover a Slit-independent role of Robo in glial migration and show that neurons can release an extracellular fragment of Robo upon cleavage to attract glia during migration in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, we identified the conserved cell adhesion molecule SYG-1/Neph as a receptor for the cleaved extracellular Robo fragment to mediate glial migration and SYG-1/Neph functions through regulation of the WAVE complex. Our studies reveal a previously unknown Slit-independent function and regulatory mechanism of Robo and show that the cleaved extracellular fragment of Robo can function as a ligand for SYG-1/Neph to guide glial migration. As Robo, the cleaved region of Robo, and SYG-1/Neph are all highly conserved across the animal kingdom, our findings may present a conserved Slit-independent Robo mechanism during brain development.</content>

 Neurons in primate V4 exhibit various types of selectivity for contour shapes, including curves, angles, and simple shapes. How are these neurons organized in V4 remains unclear. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging and 2-photon calcium imaging, we observed submillimeter functional domains in V4 that contained neurons preferring curved contours over rectilinear ones. These curvature domains had similar sizes and response amplitudes as orientation domains but tended to separate from these regions. Within the curvature domains, neurons that preferred circles or curve orientations clustered further into finer-scale subdomains. Nevertheless, individual neurons also had a wide range of contour selectivity, and neighboring neurons exhibited a substantial diversity in shape tuning besides their common shape preferences. In strong contrast to V4, V1 and V2 didn't have such contour-shape-related domains. These findings highlight the importance and complexity of curvature processing in visual object recognition and the key functional role of V4 in this process.</content>

 An important aspect of visual object recognition is the ability to perceive object shape. Two basic components of complex shapes are straight and curved contours. A large body of evidence suggests a modular hierarchy for shape representation progressing from simple and complex orientation in early areas V1 and V2, to increasingly complex stages of curvature representation in V4, TEO, and TE. Here, we reinforce and extend the concept of modular representation. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging in Macaque area V4, we find sub-millimeter sized modules for curvature representation that are organized from low to high curvatures as well as domains with complex curvature preference. We propose a possible 'curvature hypercolumn' within V4. In combination with previous studies, we suggest that the key emergent functions at each stage of cortical processing are represented in systematic, modular maps.</content>

 During vertebrate development, the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) periodically segments into somites, which will form the segmented vertebral column and associated muscle, connective tissue, and dermis. The periodicity of somitogenesis is regulated by a segmentation clock of oscillating Notch activity. Here, we examined mouse mutants lacking only &lt;i&gt;Fgf4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;, which we previously demonstrated act redundantly to prevent PSM differentiation. &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; is not required for somitogenesis, but &lt;i&gt;Fgf4&lt;/i&gt; mutants display a range of vertebral defects. We analyzed &lt;i&gt;Fgf4&lt;/i&gt; mutants by quantifying mRNAs fluorescently labeled by hybridization chain reaction within Imaris-based volumetric tissue subsets. These data indicate that FGF4 maintains &lt;i&gt;Hes7&lt;/i&gt; levels and normal oscillatory patterns. To support our hypothesis that FGF4 regulates somitogenesis through &lt;i&gt;Hes7&lt;/i&gt;, we demonstrate genetic synergy between &lt;i&gt;Hes7&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fgf4&lt;/i&gt;, but not with &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;. Our data indicate that &lt;i&gt;Fgf4&lt;/i&gt; is potentially important in a spectrum of human Segmentation Defects of the Vertebrae caused by defective Notch oscillations.</content>

Predicting the phenotypes resulting from molecular perturbations is one of the key challenges in genetics. Both forward and reverse genetic screen are employed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypes and disease, and these resulted in a large number of genotype–phenotype association being available for humans and model organisms. Combined with recent advances in machine learning, it may now be possible to predict human phenotypes resulting from particular molecular aberrations. We developed DeepPheno, a neural network based hierarchical multi-class multi-label classification method for predicting the phenotypes resulting from loss-of-function in single genes. DeepPheno uses the functional annotations with gene products to predict the phenotypes resulting from a loss-of-function; additionally, we employ a two-step procedure in which we predict these functions first and then predict phenotypes. Prediction of phenotypes is ontology-based and we propose a novel ontology-based classifier suitable for very large hierarchical classification tasks. These methods allow us to predict phenotypes associated with any known protein-coding gene. We evaluate our approach using evaluation metrics established by the CAFA challenge and compare with top performing CAFA2 methods as well as several state of the art phenotype prediction approaches, demonstrating the improvement of DeepPheno over established methods. Furthermore, we show that predictions generated by DeepPheno are applicable to predicting gene–disease associations based on comparing phenotypes, and that a large number of new predictions made by DeepPheno have recently been added as phenotype databases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hvnlxjn_-hc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We provide a stand-alone software, the BioAFMviewer, which transforms biomolecular structures into the graphical representation corresponding to the outcome of atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments. The AFM graphics is obtained by performing simulated scanning over the molecular structure encoded in the corresponding PDB file. A versatile molecular viewer integrates the visualization of PDB structures and control over their orientation, while synchronized simulated scanning with variable spatial resolution and tip-shape geometry produces the corresponding AFM graphics. We demonstrate the applicability of the BioAFMviewer by comparing simulated AFM graphics to high-speed AFM observations of proteins. The software can furthermore process molecular movies of conformational motions, e.g. those obtained from servers which model functional transitions within a protein, and produce the corresponding simulated AFM movie. The BioAFMviewer software provides the platform to employ the plethora of structural and dynamical data of proteins in order to help in the interpretation of biomolecular AFM experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mgqID6s_35c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mathematical models of biological reactions at the system-level lead to a set of ordinary differential equations with many unknown parameters that need to be inferred using relatively few experimental measurements. Having a reliable and robust algorithm for parameter inference and prediction of the hidden dynamics has been one of the core subjects in systems biology, and is the focus of this study. We have developed a new systems-biology-informed deep learning algorithm that incorporates the system of ordinary differential equations into the neural networks. Enforcing these equations effectively adds constraints to the optimization procedure that manifests itself as an imposed structure on the observational data. Using few scattered and noisy measurements, we are able to infer the dynamics of unobserved species, external forcing, and the unknown model parameters. We have successfully tested the algorithm for three different benchmark problems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ck4PQiD8LUs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The ability to use stored information in a highly flexible manner is a defining feature of the declarative memory system. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this flexibility are poorly understood. To address this question, we recorded single-unit activity from the hippocampus of 2 nonhuman primates performing a newly devised task requiring the monkeys to retrieve long-term item-location association memory and then use it flexibly in different circumstances. We found that hippocampal neurons signaled both mnemonic information representing the retrieved location and perceptual information representing the external circumstance. The 2 signals were combined at a single-neuron level to construct goal-directed information by 3 sequentially occurring neuronal operations (e.g., convergence, transference, and targeting) in the hippocampus. Thus, flexible use of knowledge may be supported by the hippocampal constructive process linking memory and perception, which may fit the mnemonic information into the current situation to present manageable information for a subsequent action.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4M20uW-7aV4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Advances in genetic discoveries have created substantial opportunities for precision medicine in neurodevelopmental disorders. Many of the genes implicated in these diseases encode proteins that regulate gene expression, such as chromatin‐associated proteins, transcription factors, and RNA‐binding proteins. The identification of targeted therapeutics for individuals carrying mutations in these genes remains a challenge, as the encoded proteins can theoretically regulate thousands of downstream targets in a considerable number of cell types. Here, we propose the application of a drug discovery approach originally developed for cancer called “transcriptome reversal” for these neurodevelopmental disorders. This approach attempts to identify compounds that reverse gene‐expression signatures associated with disease states. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence of differential connectivity and activity patterns across the long‐axis of the hippocampus has led to many hypotheses about functional specialization of the anterior and posterior hippocampus, including a hypothesis linking the anterior hippocampus to memory encoding and the posterior hippocampus to memory retrieval. The hippocampal encoding/retrieval and network (HERNET) model of memory predicts that encoding should engage the anterior hippocampus and the attention network, whereas retrieval should engage the posterior hippocampus and the default network. In a previous fMRI study that employed multivoxel pattern analysis, we found that the patterns of activity in the anterior hippocampus predicted the quadrant of spatial memory encoding. In the current fMRI study, we investigated whether the spatial memory encoding activity in the anterior hippocampus and retrieval activity in the posterior hippocampus had a higher degree of connectivity to the attention network or the default network. During the study phase, abstract shapes were presented in each quadrant of the visual field and participants were instructed to remember each shape's location while maintaining central fixation. During the test phase, the same shapes were presented in the center of the screen and participants identified the previous location of each shape. Generalized psychophysiological interaction analyses were conducted between the anatomically defined anterior and posterior hippocampus and the rest of the brain. This revealed preferential connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and regions of the attention network during encoding and between the posterior hippocampus and regions of the default network during retrieval. In addition, there were location‐specific patterns of connectivity with the anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus during encoding and retrieval of right visual field items. These results suggest that the anterior and posterior hippocampus interact with regions of the attention network and default network during spatial memory encoding and retrieval, respectively, and support the HERNET model of memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution and morphology of P2X3‐immunoreactive subserosal afferent nerve endings in the rat gastric antrum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/97507108-e6b4-455a-9421-3329ef89f4a2/cne25069-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P2X3‐immunoreactive subserosal afferent nerve endings in the rat antral lesser curvature were revealed by immunohistochemistry of whole‐mount preparations with confocal scanning laser microscopy. The immunoreactive nerve endings consisted of web‐like complex terminal structures and peripheral variform axon terminals. The nerve endings may have morphological characteristics of mechanoreceptors for detecting a mechanical deformation of the antral wall associated with antral peristalsis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study investigated the morphological characteristics of subserosal afferent nerve endings with immunoreactivity for the P2X3 purinoceptor (P2X3) in the rat stomach by immunohistochemistry of whole‐mount preparations using confocal scanning laser microscopy. P2X3 immunoreactivity was observed in subserosal nerve endings proximal and lateral to the gastric sling muscles in the distal antrum of the lesser curvature. Parent axons ramified into several lamellar processes to form net‐like complex structures that extended two‐dimensionally in every direction on the surface of the longitudinal smooth muscle layer. The axon terminals in the periphery of P2X3‐immunoreactive net‐like structures were flat and looped or leaf‐like in shape. Some net‐like lamellar structures and their axon terminals with P2X3 immunoreactivity were also immunoreactive for P2X2. P2X3‐immunoreactive nerve fibers forming net‐like terminal structures were closely surrounded by S100B‐immunoreactive terminal Schwann cells, whereas axon terminals twined around these cells and extended club‐, knob‐, or thread‐like protrusions in the surrounding tissues. Furthermore, a retrograde tracing method using fast blue dye indicated that most of these nerve endings originated from the nodose ganglia of the vagus nerve. These results suggest that P2X3‐immunoreactive subserosal nerve endings have morphological characteristics of mechanoreceptors and contribute to sensation of a mechanical deformation of the distal antral wall associated with antral peristalsis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preterm birth is a global public health problem. A large number of preterm infants survive with preterm white matter injury (PWMI), which leads to neurological deficits, and has multifaceted etiology, clinical course, monitoring, and outcomes. The principal upstream insults leading to PWMI initiation are hypoxia‐ischemia and infection and/or inflammation and the key target cells are late oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Current PWMI treatments are mainly supportive, and thus have little effect in terms of protecting the immature brain or repairing injury to improve long‐term outcomes. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells comprise abundant immunomodulatory and stem cells, which have the potential to reduce brain injury, mainly due to anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms, and also through their release of neurotrophic or growth factors to promote endogenous neurogenesis. In this review, we briefly summarize PWMI pathogenesis and pathophysiology, and the specific properties of different cell types in UCB. We further explore the potential mechanism by which UCB can be used to treat PWMI, and discuss the advantages of and potential issues related to UCB cell therapy. Finally, we suggest potential future studies of UCB cell therapy in preterm infants.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Sex chromosomes are typically comprised of a non-recombining region and a recombining pseudoautosomal region. Accurately quantifying the relative size of these regions is critical for sex-chromosome biology both from a functional and evolutionary perspective. The evolution of the pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) is well documented in haplorrhines (apes and monkeys) but not in strepsirrhines (lemurs and lorises). Here we studied the PAB of seven species representing the main strepsirrhine lineages by sequencing a male and a female genome in each species and using sex differences in coverage to identify the PAB. We found that during primate evolution, the PAB has remained unchanged in strepsirrhines whereas several recombination suppression events moved the PAB and shortened the pseudoautosomal region in haplorrhines. Strepsirrhines are well known to have much lower sexual dimorphism than haplorrhines. We suggest that mutations with antagonistic effects between males and females have driven recombination suppression and PAB evolution in haplorrhines.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance pathway that degrades aberrant mRNAs and also regulates the expression of a wide range of physiological transcripts. RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases form an hetero-hexameric ring that is part of several macromolecular complexes such as INO80, SWR1 and R2TP. Interestingly, RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity is required for NMD activation by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that DHX34, an RNA helicase regulating NMD initiation, directly interacts with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in cells. Cryo-EM reveals that DHX34 induces extensive changes in the N-termini of every RUVBL2 subunit in the complex, stabilizing a conformation that does not bind nucleotide and thereby down-regulates ATP hydrolysis of the complex. Using ATPase-deficient mutants, we find that DHX34 acts exclusively on the RUVBL2 subunits. We propose a model, where DHX34 acts to couple RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity to the assembly of factors required to initiate the NMD response.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Casein kinases are a large family of intracellular serine/threonine kinases that control a variety of cellular signaling functions. Here we report that a member of casein kinase 1 family, casein kinase 1G2, CSNK1G2, binds and inhibits the activation of receptor-interacting kinase 3, RIPK3, thereby attenuating RIPK3-mediated necroptosis. The binding of CSNK1G2 to RIPK3 is triggered by auto-phosphorylation at serine 211/threonine 215 sites in its C-terminal domain. CSNK1G2-knockout mice showed significantly enhanced necroptosis response and premature aging of their testis, a phenotype that was rescued by either double knockout of the &lt;i&gt;Ripk3&lt;/i&gt; gene or feeding the animal with a RIPK1 kinase inhibitor-containing diet. Moreover, CSNK1G2 is also co-expressed with RIPK3 in human testis, and the necroptosis activation marker phospho-MLKL was observed in the testis of old (&amp;gt;80) but not young men, indicating that the testis-aging program carried out by the RIPK3-mediated and CSNK1G2-attenuated necroptosis is evolutionarily conserved between mice and men.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Sofija V. Canavan, Daniel Margoliash&lt;/p&gt;

Birds and mammals share specialized forms of sleep including slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM), raising the question of why and how specialized sleep evolved. Extensive prior studies concluded that avian sleep lacked many features characteristic of mammalian sleep, and therefore that specialized sleep must have evolved independently in birds and mammals. This has been challenged by evidence of more complex sleep in multiple songbird species. To extend this analysis beyond songbirds, we examined a species of parrot, the sister taxon to songbirds. We implanted adult budgerigars (&lt;i&gt;Melopsittacus undulatus)&lt;/i&gt; with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes to evaluate sleep architecture, and video monitored birds during sleep. Sleep was scored with manual and automated techniques, including automated detection of slow waves and eye movements. This can help define a new standard for how to score sleep in birds. Budgerigars exhibited consolidated sleep, a pattern also observed in songbirds, and many mammalian species, including humans. We found that REM constituted 26.5% of total sleep, comparable to humans and an order of magnitude greater than previously reported. Although we observed no spindles, we found a clear state of intermediate sleep (IS) similar to non-REM (NREM) stage 2. Across the night, SWS decreased and REM increased, as observed in mammals and songbirds. Slow wave activity (SWA) fluctuated with a 29-min ultradian rhythm, indicating a tendency to move systematically through sleep states as observed in other species with consolidated sleep. These results are at variance with numerous older sleep studies, including for budgerigars. Here, we demonstrated that lighting conditions used in the prior budgerigar study—and commonly used in older bird studies—dramatically disrupted budgerigar sleep structure, explaining the prior results. Thus, it is likely that more complex sleep has been overlooked in a broad range of bird species. The similarities in sleep architecture observed in mammals, songbirds, and now budgerigars, alongside recent work in reptiles and basal birds, provide support for the hypothesis that a common amniote ancestor possessed the precursors that gave rise to REM and SWS at one or more loci in the parallel evolution of sleep in higher vertebrates. We discuss this hypothesis in terms of the common plan of forebrain organization shared by reptiles, birds, and mammals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dCm13lPlwHI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Ghyselinck, Ronen Schweitzer, Shahragim Tajbakhsh&lt;/p&gt;

Coordinated development of muscles, tendons, and their attachment sites ensures emergence of functional musculoskeletal units that are adapted to diverse anatomical demands among different species. How these different tissues are patterned and functionally assembled during embryogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the morphogenesis of extraocular muscles (EOMs), an evolutionary conserved cranial muscle group that is crucial for the coordinated movement of the eyeballs and for visual acuity. By means of lineage analysis, we redefined the cellular origins of periocular connective tissues interacting with the EOMs, which do not arise exclusively from neural crest mesenchyme as previously thought. Using 3D imaging approaches, we established an integrative blueprint for the EOM functional unit. By doing so, we identified a developmental time window in which individual EOMs emerge from a unique muscle anlage and establish insertions in the sclera, which sets these muscles apart from classical muscle-to-bone type of insertions. Further, we demonstrate that the eyeballs are a source of diffusible all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) that allow their targeting by the EOMs in a temporal and dose-dependent manner. Using genetically modified mice and inhibitor treatments, we find that endogenous local variations in the concentration of retinoids contribute to the establishment of tendon condensations and attachment sites that precede the initiation of muscle patterning. Collectively, our results highlight how global and site-specific programs are deployed for the assembly of muscle functional units with precise definition of muscle shapes and topographical wiring of their tendon attachments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LuqOh5xOdjk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 TRPM3 channels play important roles in the detection of noxious heat and in inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia. The activity of these ion channels in somatosensory neurons is tightly regulated by µ-opioid receptors through the signaling of Gβγ proteins, thereby reducing TRPM3-mediated pain. We show here that Gβγ directly binds to a...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/qtF1PioORHI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Subjects with EEG‐confirmed seizures after ≥20 and &amp;lt;40mg/kg phenobarbital were randomized to receive additional phenobarbital with either placebo (control) or 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3mg/kg bumetanide (treatment). Continuous EEG monitoring data from ≥2 hours before to ≥48 hours after study drug administration (SDA) were analyzed for seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects were randomized to treatment (n=27) and control (n=16) groups. Pharmacokinetics were highly variable among subjects and altered by hypothermia. The only statistically significant adverse event was diuresis in treated subjects (48% vs. 13%, P=0.02). One treated (4%) and three control subjects died (19%, P=0.14). Among survivors, 2/26 treated subjects (8%) and 0/13 control subjects had hearing impairment, as did one non‐randomized subject. Total seizure burden varied widely, with much higher seizure burden in treatment vs. control groups (median 3.1 vs. 1.2 minutes/hour, P=0.006). There was significantly greater reduction in seizure burden 0‐4 hours and 2‐4 hours post‐SDA (both P&amp;lt;0.01) compared with 2‐hour baseline in treatment vs. control groups with adjustment for seizure burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While definitive proof of efficacy awaits an appropriately powered phase III trial, this randomized, controlled, multicenter trial demonstrated an additional reduction in seizure burden attributable to bumetanide over phenobarbital without increased serious adverse effects. Future trials of bumetanide and other drugs should include a control group and balance seizure severity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain insights into structural networks associated with stimulation‐induced dysarthria (SID) and to predict stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility in essential tremor patients with bilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monopolar reviews were conducted in 14 essential tremor patients. Testing included determination of SID thresholds, intelligibility ratings and a fast syllable repetition task. Volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) were calculated to identify discriminative fibers for stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility in a structural connectome. The resulting fiber‐based atlas structure was than validated in a leave‐one‐out design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibers determined as discriminative for stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility were mainly connected to the ipsilateral precentral gyrus as well as to both cerebellar hemispheres and the ipsilateral brainstem. In the thalamic area, they ran laterally to the thalamus and postero‐medially to the subthalamic nucleus, in close proximity, mainly antero‐laterally, to fibers beneficial for tremor control as published by Al‐Fatly et al. (2019). The overlap of the respective clinical stimulation setting's VTAs with these fibers explained 62.4% (p&amp;lt;0.001) of the variance of stimulation‐induced change in intelligibility in a leave‐one out analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that SID in essential tremor patients is associated with both, motor cortex and cerebellar connectivity. Furthermore, the identified fiber‐based atlas structure might contribute to future postoperative programming strategies to achieve optimal tremor control without speech impairment in ET patients with thalamic DBS.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Sport performances are often showcases of skilled motor control. Efforts to understand the neural processes subserving such movements may teach us about general principles of behavior, similarly to how studies on neurological patients have guided early work in cognitive neuroscience. While investigations on non-human animal models offer valuable information on the neural dynamics of skilled motor control that is still difficult to obtain from humans, sport sciences have paid relatively little attention to these mechanisms. Similarly, knowledge emerging from the study of sport performance could inspire innovative experiments in animal neurophysiology, but the latter has been only partially applied. Here, we advocate that fostering interactions between these two seemingly distant fields, i.e., animal neurophysiology and sport sciences, may lead to mutual benefits. For instance, recording and manipulating the activity from neurons of behaving animals offer a unique viewpoint on the computations for motor control, with potentially untapped relevance for motor skills development in athletes. To stimulate such transdisciplinary dialog, in the present article, we also discuss steps for the reverse translation of sport sciences findings to animal models and the evaluation of comparability between animal models of a given sport and athletes. In the final section of the article, we envision that some approaches developed for animal neurophysiology could translate to sport sciences anytime soon (e.g., advanced tracking methods) or in the future (e.g., novel brain stimulation techniques) and could be used to monitor and manipulate motor skills, with implications for human performance extending well beyond sport.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a blinding aberrancy of retinal vascular maturation in preterm infants. Despite delayed onset after preterm birth, representing a window for therapeutic intervention, we cannot prevent or cure ROP blindness. A natural form of ROP protection exists in the setting of early-onset maternal preeclampsia, though is not well characterized. As ischemia is a central feature in both ROP and preeclampsia, we hypothesized that angiogenesis mediators may underlie this protection. To test our hypothesis we analyzed peripheral blood expression of candidate proteins with suggested roles in preeclamptic and ROP pathophysiology and with a proposed angiogenesis function (HTRA-1, IGF-1, TGFβ-1, and VEGF-A). Analysis in a discovery cohort of 40 maternal-infant pairs found that elevated HTRA-1 (high-temperature requirement-A serine peptidase-1) was significantly associated with increased risk of ROP and the absence of preeclampsia, thus fitting a model of preeclampsia-mediated ROP protection. We validated these findings and further demonstrated a dose-response between systemic infant HTRA-1 expression and risk for ROP development in a larger and more diverse validation cohort consisting of preterm infants recruited from two institutions. Functional analysis in the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) murine model of ROP supported our systemic human findings at the local tissue level, demonstrating that HtrA-1 expression is elevated in both the neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium by RT-PCR in the ROP disease state. Finally, transgenic mice over-expressing HtrA-1 demonstrate greater ROP disease severity in this model. Thus, HTRA-1 may underlie ROP protection in preeclampsia and represent an avenue for disease prevention, which does not currently exist.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and a common form of dementia that affects cognition and memory mostly in aged people. AD pathology is characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) senile plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated tau, resulting in cell damage and neurodegeneration. The extracellular deposition of Aβ is regarded as an important pathological marker and a principal-agent of neurodegeneration. However, the exact mechanism of Aβ-mediated pathogenesis is not fully understood yet. Recently, a growing body of evidence provides novel insights on the major role of microglia and its non-cell-autonomous cycling of Aβ toxicity. Hence, this article provides a comprehensive overview of microglia as a significant player in uncovering the underlying disease mechanisms of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Negative attentional bias has been well established in depression. However, there is very limited knowledge about whether this depression-relevant negative bias exits during initial attentional allocation, as compared with the converging evidence for the negative bias during sustained attention engagement. This study used both behavioral and electrophysiological measures to examine the initial attention engagement in depressed patients influenced by mood-congruent and mood-incongruent emotions. The dot-probe task was performed with a 100-ms exposure time of the emotional cues (emotional and neutral face pairs). The behavioral results showed that the patients responded faster following valid compared with invalid sad facial cues. Electrophysiological indexes in the frame of the two-stage model of attentional modulation by emotions provided cognitive mechanisms in distinct attention engagement stages: (1) the patients exhibited reduced P1 amplitudes following validly than invalidly happy cues than did the healthy controls, indicating a positive attenuation at an early stage of automatic attention orientation; and (2) the patients exhibited enhanced whereas the controls showed reduced P3 amplitudes following validly than invalidly sad cues, suggesting a mood-congruent negative potentiation in depression at the later stage of top-down voluntary control of attention. Depressed patients show a negative bias in early attentional allocation, reflected by preferred engagement with mood-congruent and diminished engagement with positive emotional cues/stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: To investigate cerebral blood flow (CBF) differences in patients with left- and right-sided pulsatile tinnitus (LPT and RPT) and healthy controls (HCs) to further explore the lateralization effects of PT using arterial spin labeling (ASL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: ASL data from 21 RPT patients, 17 LPT patients and 21 HCs were reviewed. Voxel-wise analysis and region of interest analysis were performed to explore differences in CBF among the three groups. Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score and tinnitus duration were obtained from each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Voxel-wise analysis showed that the CBF of the left inferior parietal gyrus was increased in both RPT and LPT patients compared with HCs (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Region of interest analysis revealed that the CBF of the left primary auditory cortex (PAC) was higher than that of the right, while the CBF of the right secondary auditory cortex (SAC) and auditory association cortex was higher than that of the left. These lateralization effects were present in all three groups. Compared with HCs, RPT patients showed increased CBF in the left PAC and SAC (PAC: P = 0.036; SAC: P = 0.012). No significant correlations were found between PT duration or THI score and altered CBF in above regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Increased CBF in the left inferior parietal gyrus is a common feature in both RPT and LPT patients, regardless of the perceived side of PT. The lateralization effects of auditory cortices may be a physiological characteristic of the normal brain. These findings may provide a new perspective for understanding the neurological pathophysiology of PT.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stress-related psychosomatic responses are viewed as important risks to our physical health. Growing evidence from structural imaging studies has implicated that stress and trauma exposures have negative effects on brain structural alterations. However, whether stress-related emotional distress and somatic symptoms are related to the structure of brain systems remains unclear. Also, stress-related somatic symptoms have adverse effects on emotional distress. In turn, emotional distress may influence somatic symptom reports via negative cognitive bias. However, whether this relationship is mediated by specific brain morphology remains poorly understood. First, we used voxel-based morphometric approaches to investigate the neuroanatomical basis underlying somatic symptoms and emotional distress in a large sample of healthy subjects (ages 18–27 years). We found that relatively high stress-related somatic symptoms were associated with reduced gray matter volumes (GMVs) in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior insula, somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Furthermore, a moderator analysis was performed to investigate the impact of recent stressful life events (moderators) on the association between specific GMVs (independent variables) and emotional distress (dependent variables). Interestingly, high levels of emotional distress were associated with small volumes of the vmPFC, anterior insula, hippocampus, and amygdala in participants with experience with more recent stressful life events. Finally, we performed mediation analyses to investigate the specific brain areas that mediate the association between emotional distress and somatic symptoms. The results showed that the effect of emotional distress on somatic symptoms is mediated by reductions in the volume of the hippocampus, the impact of somatic symptoms on emotional distress is mediated by the volume of the vmPFC. These results provided evidence that higher stress-related somatic symptoms are associated with smaller volume in prefrontal, insula, and limbic regions involved in emotion, interoception, and memory processing. The vmPFC and hippocampus play different roles in the relationship between emotional distress and somatic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no current cure. ALS causes degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons leading to atrophy of the innervating muscles and progressive paralysis. The exact mechanism of the pathology of ALS is unknown. However, 147 genes have been identified that are causative, associated with, or modify disease progression. While the causative mechanism is unknown, a number of pathological processes have been associated with ALS. These include mitochondrial dysfunction, protein accumulation, and defects in RNA metabolism. RNA metabolism is a complicated process that is regulated by many different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). A small defect in RNA metabolism can produce results as dramatic as determining cell survival. Stress granules (SGs) control RNA translation during stressed conditions. This is a protective reaction, but in conditions of chronic stress can become pathogenic. SGs are even hypothesized to act as a seeding mechanism for the pathological aggregation of proteins seen in many neurodegenerative diseases, including TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in ALS. In this review, we will be summarizing the current findings of SG pathology in ALS. We also focus on the role of SG dysregulation in protein aggregate formation and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, we outline therapeutic strategies that target SG components in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Rodents engage in active touch using their facial whiskers: they explore their environment by making rapid back-and-forth movements. The fast nature of whisker movements, during which whiskers often cross each other, makes it notoriously difficult to track individual whiskers of the intact whisker field. We present here a novel algorithm, WhiskEras, for tracking of whisker movements in high-speed videos of untrimmed mice, without requiring labeled data. WhiskEras consists of a pipeline of image-processing steps: first, the points that form the whisker centerlines are detected with sub-pixel accuracy. Then, these points are clustered in order to distinguish individual whiskers. Subsequently, the whiskers are parameterized so that a single whisker can be described by four parameters. The last step consists of tracking individual whiskers over time. We describe that WhiskEras performs better than other whisker-tracking algorithms on several metrics. On our four video segments, WhiskEras detected more whiskers per frame than the Biotact Whisker Tracking Tool. The signal-to-noise ratio of the output of WhiskEras was higher than that of Janelia Whisk. As a result, the correlation between reflexive whisker movements and cerebellar Purkinje cell activity appeared to be stronger than previously found using other tracking algorithms. We conclude that WhiskEras facilitates the study of sensorimotor integration by markedly improving the accuracy of whisker tracking in untrimmed mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the past, most inner ear diseases were thought to start with the impairment of the sensory epithelium of the cochlea before subsequently progressing to secondary neural degeneration. However, recent studies show that loss of primary synapses accompanied by excitotoxic degeneration of peripheral axons is likely to be the underlying pathology in sensorineural hearing loss. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibition has been reported to have neuroprotective and regenerative effects on synaptic pathways. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of ROCK inhibition using Y-27632 in a model of peripheral axonal damage in the spiral ganglion neurons created using the glutamate agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid, to induce excitotoxic trauma in the explanted cochlea. The number of axons projecting to hair cells in the cochlea treated with Y-27632 was significantly greater than those in the cochlea treated only with NMDA + kainic acid. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in synapses between the spiral ganglion and the inner hair cells in the cochlea treated with Y-27632. The findings of this study suggest that ROCK inhibition could be a potential strategy for the regeneration of peripheral axons in the spiral ganglion and synapse formation in the inner hair cells of a cochlea that has sustained excitotoxic injury, which is one of the primary etiologies of inner ear disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;TLR3 provides immediate type I IFN response following entry of stimulatory PAMPs into the CNS, as it is in HSV infection. The receptor plays a vital role in astrocytes, contributing to rapid infection sensing and suppression of viral replication, precluding the spread of virus beyond neurons. The route of TLR3 mobilization culminating in the receptor activation remains unexplained. In this research, we investigated the involvement of various types of endosomes in the regulation of the TLR3 mobility in C8-D1A murine astrocyte cell line. TLR3 was transported rapidly to early EEA1-positive endosomes as well as LAMP1-lysosomes following stimulation with the poly(I:C). Later, TLR3 largely associated with late Rab7-positive endosomes. Twenty-four hours after stimulation, TLR3 co-localized with LAMP1 abundantly in lysosomes of astrocytes. TLR3 interacted with poly(I:C) intracellularly from 1 min to 8 h following cell stimulation. We detected TLR3 on the surface of astrocytes indicating constitutive expression, which increased after poly(I:C) stimulation. Our findings contribute to the understanding of cellular modulation of TLR3 trafficking. Detailed analysis of the TLR3 transportation pathway is an important component in disclosing the fate of the receptor in HSV-infected CNS and may help in the search for rationale therapeutics to control the replication of neuropathic viruses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Research is increasingly focusing on gut inflammation as a contributor to Parkinson's disease (PD). Such gut inflammation is proposed to arise from a complex interaction between various genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, however these factors are under-characterized. This study investigated the association between PD and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes responsible for binding of bacterial metabolites and intestinal homeostasis, which have been implicated in intestinal infections or inflammatory bowel disease. A case-control analysis was performed utilizing the following cohorts: (i) patients from the Australian Parkinson's Disease Registry (APDR) (n = 212); (ii) a Caucasian subset of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort (n = 376); (iii) a combined control group (n = 404). The following SNPs were analyzed: PGLYRP2 rs892145, PGLYRP4 rs10888557, TLR1 rs4833095, TLR2 rs3804099, TLR4 rs7873784, CD14 rs2569190, MUC1 rs4072037, MUC2 rs11825977, CLDN2 rs12008279 and rs12014762, and CLDN4 rs8629. PD risk was significantly associated with PGLYRP4 rs10888557 genotype in both cohorts. PGLYRP2 rs892145 and TLR1 rs4833095 were also associated with disease risk in the APDR cohort, and TLR2 rs3804099 and MUC2 rs11825977 genotypes in the PPMI cohort. Interactive risk effects between PGLYRP2/PGLYRP4 and PGLYRP4/TLR2 were evident in the APDR and PPMI cohorts, respectively. In the APDR cohort, the PGLYRP4 GC genotype was significantly associated with age of symptom onset, independently of gender, toxin exposure or smoking status. This study demonstrates that genetic variation in the bacterial receptor PGLYRP4 may modulate risk and age-of-onset in idiopathic PD, while variants in PGLYRP2, TLR1/2, and MUC2 may also influence PD risk. Overall, this study provides evidence to support the role of dysregulated host-microbiome signaling and gut inflammation in PD, and further investigation of these SNPs and proteins may help identify people at risk of developing PD or increase understanding of early disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: The demand for effective strategies for maintaining cognitive capableness and establishing early dementia diagnosis has been tremendous, especially in the context of population aging. However, studies on the elderly population and neurocognitive impairment had provided ambiguous results throughout, while potential blood biomarkers of cognitive decline are yet to be clearly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The present study is aimed at assessing the relationship between blood lipids—especially in the context of their usefulness as biomarkers of an early cognitive decline—and cognitive functioning of aging adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: The study sample consisted of 230 participants—(109 women, 121 men) aged 65+ years. Plasma 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol [24(S)-OHC], serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) were assessed. The analyses were conducted in three groups of cognitive performance: cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild dementia, of which the subjects were divided with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: No significant differences in 24(S)-OHC plasma concentrations for different levels of cognitive performance were found. Significant differences were found in serum TC (p = 0.026) and LDL (p = 0.007) concentrations for different levels of cognitive performance. Concentrations of both parameters were highest in the MCI group and lowest in mild dementia and cognitive norm, respectively. No significant differences between serum HDL concentrations and cognitive performance were found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: To fully assess the potential of research on blood lipids in regards to a cognitive decline, cross-sectional or epidemiological studies aimed at further exploring blood lipid roles in both the early and advanced MCI and dementia, are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Phototransduction reactions in the rhabdomeric photoreceptor are profoundly stochastic due to the small number of participating molecules and small reaction space. The resulting quantum bumps (QBs) vary in their timing (latency), amplitudes and durations, and these variabilities within each cell are not correlated. Using modeling and electrophysiological recordings, we investigated how the QB properties depend on the cascade speed and how they influence signal transfer. Parametric analysis in the model supported by experimental data revealed that faster cascades elicit larger and narrower QBs with faster onsets and smaller variabilities than slower cascades. Latency dispersion was stronger affected by modification of upstream than downstream activation parameters. The variability caused by downstream modifications closely matched the experimental variability. Frequency response modeling showed that corner frequency is a reciprocal function of the characteristic duration of the multiphoton response, which, in turn, is a non-linear function of QB duration and latency dispersion. All QB variabilities contributed noise but only latency dispersion slowed and spread multiphoton responses, lowering the corner frequency. Using the discovered QB correlations, we evaluated transduction noise for dissimilar species and two extreme adaptation states, and compared it to photon noise. The noise emitted by the cascade was non-additive and depended non-linearly on the interaction between the QB duration and the three QB variabilities. Increased QB duration strongly suppressed both noise and corner frequency. This trade-off might be acceptable for nocturnal but not diurnal species because corner frequency is the principal determinant of information capacity. To offset the increase in noise accompanying the QB narrowing during light adaptation and the response-expanding effect of latency dispersion, the cascade accelerates. This explains the widespread evolutionary tendency of diurnal fliers to have fast phototransduction, especially after light adaptation, which thus appears to be a common adaptation to contain stochasticity, improve SNR and expand the bandwidth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aOFGf29Abcw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

For a chemical signal to propagate across a cell, it must navigate a tortuous environment involving a variety of organelle barriers. In this work we study mathematical models for a basic chemical signal, the arrival times at the nuclear membrane of proteins that are activated at the cell membrane and diffuse throughout the cytosol. Organelle surfaces within human B cells are reconstructed from soft X-ray tomographic images, and modeled as reflecting barriers to the molecules’ diffusion. We show that signal inactivation sharpens signals, reducing variability in the arrival time at the nuclear membrane. Inactivation can also compensate for an observed slowdown in signal propagation induced by the presence of organelle barriers, leading to arrival times at the nuclear membrane that are comparable to models in which the cytosol is treated as an open, empty region. In the limit of strong signal inactivation this is achieved by filtering out molecules that traverse non-geodesic paths.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1Guj8VLZcf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Atomistic simulations can provide valuable, experimentally-verifiable insights into protein folding mechanisms, but existing &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; simulation methods are restricted to only the smallest proteins due to severe computational speed limits. The folding of larger proteins has been studied using native-centric potential functions, but such models omit the potentially crucial role of non-native interactions. Here, we present an algorithm, entitled DBFOLD, which can predict folding pathways for a wide range of proteins while accounting for the effects of non-native contacts. In addition, DBFOLD can predict the relative rates of different transitions within a protein’s folding pathway. To accomplish this, rather than directly simulating folding, our method combines equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulations, which deploy enhanced sampling, with &lt;i&gt;unfolding&lt;/i&gt; simulations at high temperatures. We show that under certain conditions, trajectories from these two types of simulations can be jointly analyzed to compute unknown folding rates from detailed balance. This requires inferring free energies from the equilibrium simulations, and extrapolating transition rates from the unfolding simulations to lower, physiologically-reasonable temperatures at which the native state is marginally stable. As a proof of principle, we show that our method can accurately predict folding pathways and Monte-Carlo rates for the well-characterized Streptococcal protein G. We then show that our method significantly reduces the amount of computation time required to compute the folding pathways of large, misfolding-prone proteins that lie beyond the reach of existing direct simulation. Our algorithm, which is available online, can generate detailed atomistic models of protein folding mechanisms while shedding light on the role of non-native intermediates which may crucially affect organismal fitness and are frequently implicated in disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vWOJSg59ZyA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In several neurodegenerative disorders, axonal pathology may originate from impaired oligodendrocyte-to-axon support of energy substrates. We previously established transgenic mice that allow measuring axonal ATP levels in electrically active optic nerves. Here, we utilize this technique to explore axonal ATP dynamics in the &lt;i&gt;Plp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;null/y&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model of spastic paraplegia. Optic nerves from &lt;i&gt;Plp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;null/y&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited lower and more variable basal axonal ATP levels and reduced compound action potential (CAP) amplitudes, providing a missing link between axonal pathology and a role of oligodendrocytes in brain energy metabolism. Surprisingly, when &lt;i&gt;Plp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;null/y&lt;/sup&gt; optic nerves are challenged with transient glucose deprivation, both ATP levels and CAP decline slower, but recover faster upon reperfusion of glucose. Structurally, myelin sheaths display an increased frequency of cytosolic channels comprising glucose and monocarboxylate transporters, possibly facilitating accessibility of energy substrates to the axon. These data imply that complex metabolic alterations of the axon–myelin unit contribute to the phenotype of &lt;i&gt;Plp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;null/y&lt;/sup&gt; mice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2T3lQGswVJ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to disentangle the comparative effects of lipids and apolipoproteins on ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms associated with low‐ and high‐density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A‐I and B (apoA‐I and apoB) at the level of genomewide significance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;) in the UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. Summary‐level data for ischemic stroke and its subtypes were obtained from the MEGASTROKE consortium with 514,791 individuals (60,341 ischemic stroke cases, and 454,450 non‐cases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased levels of apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke in the main and sensitivity univariable MR analyses. In multivariable MR analysis including apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in the same model, apoB retained a robust effect (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas the estimate for LDL cholesterol was reversed, and that for triglycerides largely attenuated. Decreased levels of apoA‐I and HDL cholesterol were robustly associated with increased risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke in all univariable MR analyses, but the association for apoA‐I was attenuated to the null after mutual adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present MR study reveals that apoB is the predominant trait that accounts for the etiological basis of apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in relation to ischemic stroke, in particular large artery and small vessel stroke. Whether HDL cholesterol exerts a protective effect on ischemic stroke independent of apoA‐I needs further investigation. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1229–1236&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) induces headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features in patients with persistent post‐traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐way crossover study was conducted. Analyses were intention‐to‐treat. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 65 years and had a history of persistent PTH after mild TBI for at least 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of 1.5μg/min of CGRP or placebo (isotonic saline) over 20 minutes on two separate experimental days. A 12‐hour observational period was used to evaluate the following outcomes: (1) difference in incidence of headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features and (2) difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty patients (mean age = 37 years, 25 women [83%]) were randomized and completed the study. During the 12‐hour observational period, 21 of 30 patients (70%) developed headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features after CGRP, compared with 6 patients (20%) after placebo (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.001). The baseline‐corrected area under the curve for headache intensity scores was significantly larger after CGRP, compared with placebo (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with persistent PTH are hypersensitive to CGRP, which underscores its pathophysiological importance. Furthermore, CGRP‐targeted therapies might provide a novel mechanism‐based treatment option for patients with persistent PTH. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1220–1228&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25912?af=R"/>
		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25912?af=R</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain, temperature, and itch are conventionally thought to be exclusively transduced by the intraepidermal nerve endings. Although recent studies have shown that epidermal keratinocytes also participate in sensory transduction, the mechanism underlying keratinocyte communication with intraepidermal nerve endings remains poorly understood. We sought to demonstrate the synaptic character of the contacts between keratinocytes and sensory neurons and their involvement in sensory communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contacts were explored by morphological, molecular, and functional approaches in cocultures of epidermal keratinocytes and sensory neurons. To interrogate whether structures observed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were also present in the human epidermis, &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; correlative light electron microscopy was performed on human skin biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidermal keratinocytes dialogue with sensory neurons through en passant synaptic‐like contacts. These contacts have the ultrastructural features and molecular hallmarks of chemical synaptic‐like contacts: narrow intercellular cleft, keratinocyte synaptic vesicles expressing synaptophysin and synaptotagmin 1, and sensory information transmitted from keratinocytes to sensory neurons through SNARE‐mediated (syntaxin1) vesicle release.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing selective communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons, synaptic‐like contacts are the hubs of a 2‐site receptor. The permanent epidermal turnover, implying a specific &lt;i&gt;en passant&lt;/i&gt; structure and high plasticity, may have delayed their identification, thereby contributing to the long‐held concept of nerve endings passing freely between keratinocytes. The discovery of keratinocyte–sensory neuron synaptic‐like contacts may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in cutaneous sensory perception and sheds new light on the pathophysiology of pain and itch as well as the physiology of touch.

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25911?af=R"/>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined the relationship between tau pathology and neuroinflammation using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 PET in 17 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and tau protein aggregation colocalize macroscopically, and correlate with clinical severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;) for each ligand was quantified in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). The [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; values were correlated across all regions. The spatial distributions of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 binding were determined by principal component analyses (PCAs), and the loading of each spatial component compared against the patients’ clinical severity (using the PSP rating scale).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 binding were positively correlated (R = 0.577, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The PCA identified 4 components for each ligand, reflecting the relative expression of tau pathology or neuroinflammation in distinct groups of brain regions. Positive associations between [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 components’ loadings were found in both subcortical (R = 0.769, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and cortical regions (R = 0.836, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). There were positive correlations between clinical severity and both subcortical tau pathology (R = 0.667, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003) and neuroinflammation (R = 0.788, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that tau pathology and neuroinflammation colocalize in PSP, and that individual differences in subcortical tau pathology and neuroinflammation are linked to clinical severity. Although longitudinal studies are needed to determine causal associations between these molecular pathologies, we suggest that the combination of tau‐ and immune‐oriented strategies may be useful for effective disease‐modifying treatments in PSP.

 &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to characterise both neuronal autoantibodies and levels of interferon α, two proposed causative agents in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 35 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 15 with NPSLE) showed no antibodies against natively expressed N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs), or the surface of live hippocampal neurons. By comparison to controls (n = 104), patients with SLE had antibodies that bound to a peptide representing the extracellular domain of NMDARs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), however, binding was retained against both rearranged peptides and no peptide (r = 0.85 and r = 0.79, respectively, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In summary, neuronal‐surface reactive antibodies were not detected in NPSLE. Further, while interferon α levels were higher in SLE (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), they lacked specificity for NPSLE. Our findings mandate a search for novel biomarkers in this condition.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current understanding of the neuromodulatory effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on large‐scale brain networks remains elusive, largely due to the lack of techniques that can reveal DBS‐induced activity at the whole‐brain level. Using a novel 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐compatible stimulator, we investigated whole‐brain effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in patients with Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen patients received STN‐DBS treatment and participated in a block‐design functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, wherein stimulations were delivered during “ON” blocks interleaved with “OFF” blocks. fMRI responses to low‐frequency (60Hz) and high‐frequency(130Hz) STN‐DBS were measured 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postsurgery. To ensure reliability, multiple runs (48 minutes) of fMRI data were acquired at each postsurgical visit. Presurgical resting‐state fMRI (30 minutes) data were also acquired.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two neurocircuits showed highly replicable, but distinct responses to STN‐DBS. A circuit involving the globus pallidus internus (GPi), thalamus, and deep cerebellar nuclei was significantly activated, whereas another circuit involving the primary motor cortex (M1), putamen, and cerebellum showed DBS‐induced deactivation. These 2 circuits were dissociable in terms of their DBS‐induced responses and resting‐state functional connectivity. The GPi circuit was frequency‐dependent, selectively responding to high‐frequency stimulation, whereas the M1 circuit was responsive in a time‐dependent manner, showing enhanced deactivation over time. Finally, activation of the GPi circuit was associated with overall motor improvement, whereas M1 circuit deactivation was related to reduced bradykinesia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent DBS‐fMRI using 3T revealed 2 distinct circuits that responded differentially to STN‐DBS and were related to divergent symptoms, a finding that may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying DBS. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1178–1193&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology by their 5th decade. Compared with the general population, traditional vascular risks in adults with DS are rare, allowing examination of cerebrovascular disease in this population and insight into its role in AD without the confound of vascular risk factors. We examined in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology in adults with DS, and determined their cross‐sectional relationship with age, beta‐amyloid pathology, and mild cognitive impairment or clinical AD diagnostic status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome study (n = 138, 50 ± 7 years, 39% women) with MRI data and a subset (n = 90) with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) were included. We derived MRI‐based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology, including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), as well as PET‐based biomarkers of amyloid burden. Participants were characterized as cognitively stable (CS), mild cognitive impairment–DS (MCI‐DS), possible AD dementia, or definite AD dementia based on in‐depth assessments of cognition, function, and health status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were detectable WMH, enlarged PVS, infarcts, and microbleeds as early as the 5th decade of life. There was a monotonic increase in WMH volume, enlarged PVS, and presence of infarcts across diagnostic groups (CS &amp;lt; MCI‐DS &amp;lt; possible AD dementia &amp;lt; definite AD dementia). Higher amyloid burden was associated with a higher likelihood of an infarct.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in adults with DS and add to a growing body of evidence that implicates cerebrovascular disease as a core feature of AD and not simply a comorbidity. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1165–1177&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Targeted metabolomics study of early pathological features in hippocampus of triple transgenic Alzheimer’s disease male mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/70eeef84-bff6-4bd2-b7f2-05ed817a128b/jnr24750-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using targeted metabolomics methods, the differential metabolites of hippocampal tissues of triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and wild‐type mice at an early age and the pathogenesis associated with these metabolites were obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease in people of age 65 or above. The detailed etiology and pathogenesis of AD have not been elucidated yet. In this study, the hippocampi of 2‐ and 6‐month‐old triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and age–sex‐matched wild‐type (WT) mice were analyzed by using targeted metabolomics approach. Compared with WT mice, 24 and 60 metabolites were found with significant differences in 2‐ and 6‐month‐old AD mice. Among these, 14 metabolites were found common while 10 metabolites showed consistent variable trends in both groups. These differential metabolites are found associated with amino acid, lipid, vitamin, nucleotide‐related base, neurotransmitter and energy metabolisms, and oxidative stress. The results suggest that these differential metabolites might play a critical role in AD pathophysiology, and may serve as potential biomarkers for AD. Moreover, the results highlight the involvement of abnormal purine, pyrimidine, arginine, and proline metabolism, along with glycerophospholipid metabolism in early pathology of AD. For the first time, several differential metabolites are found to be associated with AD in this study. Targeted metabolomics can be used for rapid and accurate quantitative analysis of specific target metabolites associated with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Illumination of nonmyelinating corneal Schwann cells (nm‐cSCs) of the transparent and avascular cornea. (a) Outline of experimental procedures for the endothelial cell‐depleted central corneal cell preparation for scRNA‐seq analysis from rabbit. (b) Major corneal cell populations were identified by unsupervised clustering, with the nm‐cSCs being represented by the purple colored dots. Each dot represents a single cell that was designated by color of the cluster. Dickkopf‐related protein 1 (DKK1) is one of the novel cornea‐specific SC targets identified and cross‐species validated in mouse corneas. The proteolipid protein 1 promoter‐enhanced green fluorescent protein (Plp1‐eGFP) reporter mouse cornea was immunostained for DKK1 (&lt;i&gt;red&lt;/i&gt;), revealing its co‐localization with eGFP (&lt;i&gt;green&lt;/i&gt;) reporter expression in SCs. (c) The image on the left shows a cartoon representation of the cornea corresponding to the immunostained images (panels on the right) from the central cornea (&lt;i&gt;dotted circle, top panel)&lt;/i&gt; and limbal/peripheral area (&lt;i&gt;dotted rectangle, bottom panel&lt;/i&gt;). Detailed magnified views reveal DKK1‐positive staining in nm‐cSCs of the central cornea, as well as myelinated SCs of the peripheral cornea. Scale bars, 10 µm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cornea is the most innervated tissue in the human body. Myelinated axons upon inserting into the peripheral corneal stroma lose their myelin sheaths and continue into the central cornea wrapped by only nonmyelinating corneal Schwann cells (nm‐cSCs). This anatomical organization is believed to be important for central vision. Here we employed single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq), microscopy, and transgenics to characterize these nm‐cSCs of the central cornea. Using principal component analysis, uniform manifold approximation and projection, and unsupervised hierarchal cell clustering of scRNA‐seq data derived from central corneal cells of male rabbits, we successfully identified several clusters representing different corneal cell types, including a unique cell cluster representing nm‐cSCs. To confirm protein expression of cSC genes, we performed cross‐species validation, employing corneal whole‐mount immunostaining with confocal microscopy in mouse corneas. The expression of several representative proteins of nm‐cSCs were validated. As the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene was also expressed in nm‐cSCs, we explored the &lt;i&gt;Plp1&lt;/i&gt;‐eGFP transgenic reporter mouse line to visualize cSCs. Specific and efficient eGFP expression was observed in cSCs in adult mice of different ages. Of several putative cornea‐specific SC genes identified, Dickkopf‐related protein 1 was shown to be present in nm‐cSCs. Taken together, our findings, for the first time, identify important insights and tools toward the study nm‐cSCs in isolated tissue and adult animals. We expect that our results will advance the future study of nm‐cSCs in applications of nerve repair, and provide a resource for the study of corneal sensory function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In the vertebrate olfactory bulb (OB), axonless granule cells (GC) mediate self- and lateral inhibitory interactions between mitral/tufted cells via reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses. Locally triggered release of GABA from the large reciprocal GC spines occurs on both fast and slow time scales, possibly enabling parallel processing during olfactory perception. Here we investigate local mechanisms for asynchronous spine output. To reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics of postsynaptic ion transients, we imaged spine and adjacent dendrite Ca&lt;sup&gt;2 +&lt;/sup&gt;- and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals with minimal exogenous buffering by the respective fluorescent indicator dyes upon two-photon uncaging of DNI-glutamate in OB slices from juvenile rats. Both postsynaptic fluorescence signals decayed slowly, with average half durations in the spine head of t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;_Δ[Ca&lt;sup&gt;2 +&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ∼500 ms and t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;_Δ[Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ∼1,000 ms. We also analyzed the kinetics of already existing data of postsynaptic spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2 +&lt;/sup&gt;-signals in response to glomerular stimulation in OB slices from adult mice, either WT or animals with partial GC glutamate receptor deletions (NMDAR: GluN1 subunit; AMPAR: GluA2 subunit). In a large subset of spines the fluorescence signal had a protracted rise time (average time to peak ∼400 ms, range 20 to &amp;gt;1,000 ms). This slow rise was independent of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2 +&lt;/sup&gt; entry via NMDARs, since similarly slow signals occurred in ΔGluN1 GCs. Additional Ca&lt;sup&gt;2 +&lt;/sup&gt; entry in ΔGluA2 GCs (with AMPARs rendered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2 +&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable), however, resulted in larger ΔF/Fs that rose yet more slowly. Thus GC spines appear to dispose of several local mechanisms to promote asynchronous GABA release, which are reflected in the time course of mitral/tufted cell recurrent inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by the buildup of β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary Tau tangles. This leads to decreased synaptic efficacy, cell death, and, consequently, brain atrophy in patients. Behaviorally, this manifests as memory loss and confusion. Using a gene ontology analysis, we recently identified AD and other age-related dementias as candidate diseases associated with the loss of DEK expression. DEK is a nuclear phosphoprotein with roles in DNA repair, cellular proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis. Work from our laboratory determined that DEK is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions relevant to learning and memory, including the hippocampus. Moreover, we have also determined that DEK is highly expressed in neurons. Consistent with our gene ontology analysis, we recently reported that cortical DEK protein levels are inversely proportional to dementia severity scores in elderly female patients. However, the functional role of DEK in neurons is unknown. Thus, we knocked down DEK in an in vitro neuronal model, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, hypothesizing that DEK loss would result in cellular and molecular phenotypes consistent with AD. We found that DEK loss resulted in increased neuronal death by apoptosis (i.e., cleaved caspases 3 and 8), decreased β-catenin levels, disrupted neurite development, higher levels of total and phosphorylated Tau at Ser262, and protein aggregates. We have demonstrated that DEK loss in vitro recapitulates cellular and molecular phenotypes of AD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a chemical synapse formed between a presynaptic motor neuron and a postsynaptic muscle cell. NMJs in most vertebrate species share many essential features; however, some differences distinguish human NMJs from others. This review will describe the pre- and postsynaptic structures of human NMJs and compare them to NMJs of laboratory animals. We will focus on age-dependent declines in function and changes in the structure of human NMJs. Furthermore, we will describe insights into the aging process revealed from mouse models of accelerated aging. In addition, we will compare aging phenotypes to other human pathologies that cause impairments of pre- and postsynaptic structures at NMJs. Finally, we will discuss potential intervention approaches for attenuating age-related NMJ dysfunction and sarcopenia in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the clinical value of non-invasive ultrasound imaging in the evaluation of brain death caused by traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-four patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury were admitted to hospital within 48 h after injury. All patients were monitored intracranial pressure, transcranial Doppler, echocardiography examination, collection intracranial pressure, MCA-Vs, MCA-Vd, MCA-Vm, EF, LVMPI, RVMPI and other indicators, and combined with clinical conditions and other related data for comparative study and statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The blood flow spectrum was characterized by diastolic retrograde blood flow spectrum pattern and nail waveform spectrum shape when the patient had clinical brain death. For the parameters of transcranial Doppler, there were significant differences in MCA-Vm and PI between clinical brain death group and normal control group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). For the parameters of echocardiography, there were statistically significant differences in EF, LVMPI, and RVMPI between clinical brain death group and normal control group (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive dynamic monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics and cardiac function parameters in patients with severe craniocerebral injury can provide a high accuracy and reliability for the preliminary diagnosis of brain death in patients with severe craniocerebral injury. It is helpful for early evaluation of prognosis and provides effective monitoring methods and guidance for clinical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This article presents an open source software able to convert, display, and process medical images. It differentiates itself from the existing software by its ability to design complex processing pipelines and to wisely execute them on a large databases. An MP3 pipeline can contain unlimited homemade or ready-made processes and can be carried out with a parallel execution system. As a viewer, MP3 allows display of up to four images together and to draw Regions Of Interest (ROI). Two applications showing the strengths of the software are presented as examples: a preclinical study involving Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data and a clinical one involving Computed Tomography (CT) images.

 &lt;p&gt;Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been investigated as a treatment option for patients with refractory psychiatric illness. Over the past two decades, neuroimaging developments have helped to advance the field, particularly the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractographic reconstruction of white-matter pathways. In this article, we review translational considerations and how DTI and tractography have been used to improve targeting during DBS surgery for depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Childhood obesity has become a global epidemic and the etiology of maladaptive ingestive behavior in children warrants further research. Mounting evidence suggests that the caudate is associated with body weight gain and obesity in adults. In adolescents, however, how caudate-related neural networks are associated with body weight gain is unclear because their central nervous systems are still developing.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The current longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that caudate-related neural networks have a role in weight gain in adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study included 20 healthy adolescents with a mean age of 17.5 ± 2.0 years and a mean body mass index of 20.6 ± 2.1 who underwent baseline rs-fMRI then follow-up rs-fMRI approximately 1 year later. Body mass index (BMI) was measured at both timepoints. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was utilized to analyze caudate-related functional connectivity (FC) using the caudate as a seed. Associations between caudate-related FC and BMI at baseline were assessed, as were associations between change in BMI and caudate-related FC between baseline and follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;At baseline, greater caudate-lateral prefrontal cortex FC was correlated with lower BMI (family wise error-corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05). Compared to the baseline, increased FC in the caudate-lateral prefrontal cortex at follow up were negatively associated with increased BMI (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Given that the lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate are associated with inhibitory control, the caudate-lateral prefrontal cortex FC may have a preventive effect on weight gain in adolescents. The results of the current study suggest that developing inhibitory control would lead to the prevention of childhood obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Healthy aging is associated with deficits in focused and sustained attention and executive functions. However, cognitive training (CT) provides a promising method to counteract these deficits. In the present randomized controlled study, we examined to what extent CT regimes can improve attention, verbal skills, and inhibition capacities. Over a period of 16 weeks, healthy older adults (65 years and older, mean: 70 years) received a trainer-guided multidomain paper-and-pencil and computerized CT. Pre- and post-training, a battery of psychometric tests was applied that measured the critical functions. This study used two control groups: a passive control and an active control group performing a relaxation training. Compared to a passive control group, the CT led to enhanced performance in the attentional endurance test and the interference list of the Stroop test, whereas no benefits in verbal and crystalized tests were found. Similar effects were found on the attentional endurance compared to the active control group. Additionally, word fluency was enhanced after CT, but the improvement in the Stroop test did not reach significance compared to the active control. The contents of CT were dissimilar to the psychometric tests showing far transfer, whereas no transfer to attentional or memory functions in the daily life assessed by the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire was found. This demonstrates specific gains of multidomain CT on cognitive functions not explicitly trained and lack of transfer to daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Repeated practice is fundamental to the acquisition of skills, which is typically accompanied by increasing reliability of neural representations that manifested as more stable activation patterns for the trained stimuli. However, large-scale neural pattern induced by learning has been rarely studied. Here, we investigated whether global connectivity patterns became more reliable as a result of motor learning using a novel analysis of the multivariate pattern of functional connectivity (MVPC). Human participants were trained with a finger-tapping motor task for five consecutive days and went through Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning before and after training. We found that motor learning increased the whole-brain MVPC stability of the primary motor cortex (M1) when participants performed the trained sequence, while no similar effects were observed for the untrained sequence. Moreover, the increase of MVPC stability correlated with participants’ improvement in behavioral performance. These findings suggested that the acquisition of motor skills was supported by the increased connectivity pattern stability between the M1 and the rest of the brain. In summary, our study not only suggests global neural pattern stabilization as a neural signature for effective learning but also advocates applying the MVPC analysis to reveal mechanisms of distributed network reorganization supporting various types of learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In this paper we investigate the active inference framework as a means to enable autonomous behavior in artificial agents. Active inference is a theoretical framework underpinning the way organisms act and observe in the real world. In active inference, agents act in order to minimize their so called free energy, or prediction error. Besides being biologically plausible, active inference has been shown to solve hard exploration problems in various simulated environments. However, these simulations typically require handcrafting a generative model for the agent. Therefore we propose to use recent advances in deep artificial neural networks to learn generative state space models from scratch, using only observation-action sequences. This way we are able to scale active inference to new and challenging problem domains, whilst still building on the theoretical backing of the free energy principle. We validate our approach on the mountain car problem to illustrate that our learnt models can indeed trade-off instrumental value and ambiguity. Furthermore, we show that generative models can also be learnt using high-dimensional pixel observations, both in the OpenAI Gym car racing environment and a real-world robotic navigation task. Finally we show that active inference based policies are an order of magnitude more sample efficient than Deep Q Networks on RL tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Acupuncturing the ST36 acupoint can evoke the response of the sensory nervous system, which is translated into output electrical signals in the spinal dorsal root. Neural response activities, especially synchronous spike events, evoked by different acupuncture manipulations have remarkable differences. In order to identify these network collaborative activities, we analyze the underlying spike correlation in the synchronous spike event. In this paper, we adopt a log-linear model to describe network response activities evoked by different acupuncture manipulations. Then the state-space model and Bayesian theory are used to estimate network spike correlations. Two sets of simulation data are used to test the effectiveness of the estimation algorithm and the model goodness-of-fit. In addition, simulation data are also used to analyze the relationship between spike correlations and synchronous spike events. Finally, we use this method to identify network spike correlations evoked by four different acupuncture manipulations. Results show that reinforcing manipulations (twirling reinforcing and lifting-thrusting reinforcing) can evoke the third-order spike correlation but reducing manipulations (twirling reducing and lifting-thrusting reducing) does not. This is the main reason why synchronous spikes evoked by reinforcing manipulations are more abundant than reducing manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a term that describes one form of regulated non-apoptotic cell death. It is triggered by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides. Emerging evidence suggests a link between ferroptosis and the pathophysiological processes of neurological disorders, including stroke, degenerative diseases, neurotrauma, and cancer. Hemorrhagic stroke, also known as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), belongs to a devastating illness for its high level in morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are few established treatments and limited knowledge about the mechanisms of post-ICH neuronal death. The secondary brain damage after ICH is mainly attributed to oxidative stress and hemoglobin lysate, including iron, which leads to irreversible damage to neurons. Therefore, ferroptosis is becoming a common trend in research of neuronal death after ICH. Accumulative data suggest that the inhibition of ferroptosis may effectively prevent neuronal ferroptosis, thereby reducing secondary brain damage after ICH in animal models. Ferroptosis has a close relationship with oxidative damage and iron metabolism. This review reveals the pathological pathways and regulation mechanism of ferroptosis following ICH and then offers potential intervention strategies to mitigate neuron death and dysfunction after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, necessary for various forms of behavioral plasticity, is triggered by the combined engagement of dopamine D1 and ionotropic glutamate receptors. In this study, we investigated the potential crosstalk between glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-TrkB inputs to ERK cascade by using an ex vivo model of mouse striatal slices. Our results confirmed that the concomitant stimulation of D1 and glutamate receptors is necessary to activate ERK in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Moreover, we found that ERK activation is significantly enhanced when BDNF is co-applied either with glutamate or the D1 agonist SKF38393, supporting the idea of possible integration between BDNF, glutamate, and D1R-mediated signaling. Interestingly, ERK activation via BDNF-TrkB is upregulated upon blockade of either AMPAR/NMDAR or D1 receptors, suggesting a negative regulatory action of these two neurotransmitter systems on BDNF-mediated signaling. However, the observed enhancement of ERK1/2 phosphorylation does not result in corresponding downstream signaling changes at the nuclear level. Conversely, the TrkB antagonist cyclotraxin B partially prevents glutamate- and D1-mediated ERK activation. Altogether, these results suggest a complex and unexpected interaction among dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and BDNF receptor systems to modulate the ERK pathway in striatal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Backgrounds: Aging-related impairment of cerebral blood flow regulation leads to the disruption of neuronal micro-environmental homeostasis. Anesthetics should be carefully selected for aging patients since they have less cognition capacity. Effects and mechanisms of propofol or isoflurane have been widely investigated. However, how different combinations of propofol and isoflurane affect neurons and the mechanism still needs to be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We cultured rat hippocampal neurons and established a hypoxic injury model to imitate the micro-environment of aging brains. Three different combinations of propofol and isoflurane were applied to find out an optimum group via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, real-time qPCR, and immunofluorescence of key proteins. Then BiP was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to explore the mechanism of how isoflurane and propofol affect neurons. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence. To detect GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α1 subunit proteostasis and its function, real-time qPCR, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot were carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Hypoxic neurons showed no different changes on cell viability, LDH leakage, and ER stress after treatment with 1% isoflurane and 1.2 μg/ml of propofol. Hypoxic neurons showed a sharp increase of LDH leakage and ER stress and a decrease of cell viability after treatment with 1.4% isoflurane and 0.6 μg/ml of propofol or 0.5% isoflurane and 1.8 μg/ml of propofol. After knockdown of BiP, the application of 1% isoflurane and 1.2 μg/ml of propofol led to the decrease of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α1 subunit protein content and viability of cell, as well as aggravation of ER stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A combination of 1% isoflurane and 1.2 μg/ml of propofol causes the least damage than do other dosages of both two drugs, and endogenous BiP plays an important role in this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the potential usefulness of cognitive training procedures in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have received increased attention.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the face-to-face cognitive virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) and to compare it to that of face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual for individuals with MCI. Moreover, we assessed the possibility of prolonging the effects of treatment with a telerehabilitation system.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 49 subjects with MCI were assigned to 1 of 3 study groups in a randomized controlled trial design: (a) those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS (12 sessions of individualized cognitive rehabilitation over 4 weeks) followed by telerehabilitation (36 sessions of home-based cognitive VRRS training, three sessions for week); (b) those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS followed by at-home unstructured cognitive stimulation (36 sessions of home-based unstructured cognitive stimulation, three sessions for week); and (c) those who received face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual (12 sessions of face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;An improvement in memory, language and visuo-constructional abilities was observed after the end of face-to-face VRRS treatment compared to face-to-face treatment as usual. The application of home-based cognitive VRRS telerehabilitation seems to induce more maintenance of the obtained gains than home-based unstructured stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The present study provides preliminary evidence in support of individualized VRRS treatment and telerehabilitation delivery for cognitive rehabilitation and should pave the way for future studies aiming at identifying optimal cognitive treatment protocols in subjects with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03486704.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Visual and auditory brain network connectivity decline with age, but less is known about age effects on vestibular functional connectivity and its association with behavior. We assessed age differences in the connectivity of the vestibular cortex with other sensory brain regions, both during rest and during vestibular stimulation. We then assessed the relationship between vestibular connectivity and postural stability. A sample of seventeen young and fifteen older adults participated in our study. We assessed the amount of body sway in performing the Romberg balance task, with degraded somatosensory and visual inputs. The results showed no significant difference in balance performance between age groups. However, functional connectivity analyses revealed a main effect of age and condition, suggesting that vestibular connectivity was higher in young adults than older adults, and vestibular connectivity increased from resting state to stimulation trials. Surprisingly, young adults who exhibited higher connectivity during stimulation also had greater body sway. This suggests that young adults who exhibit better balance are those who respond more selectively to vestibular inputs. This correlation is non-significant in older adults, suggesting that the relationship between vestibular functional connectivity and postural stability differs with age.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Intracranial recordings reveal ubiquitous in‐phase and in‐antiphase functional connectivity between homotopic brain regions in humans&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7cc1ca20-6ba7-4f8a-81e8-4fd21a25790e/jnr24748-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard phase lag index (standard‐PLI) and offset‐PLI (insensitive and sensitive to zero‐lag connectivity, respectively) for pairs of electrodes separated by more than 105 mm plotted against their homotopic distance. Significant connectivity (dots above the red‐dashed line) is found only between homotopic regions and mostly for zero‐lag connectivity (offset‐PLI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether neuronal populations exhibit zero‐lag (in‐phase or in‐antiphase) functional connectivity is a fundamental question when conceptualizing communication between cell assemblies. It also has profound implications on how we assess such interactions. Given that the brain is a delayed network due to the finite conduction velocity of the electrical impulses traveling across its fibers, the existence of long‐distance zero‐lag functional connectivity may be considered improbable. However, in this study, using human intracranial recordings we demonstrate that most interhemispheric connectivity between homotopic cerebral regions is zero‐lagged and that this type of connectivity is ubiquitous. Volume conduction can be safely discarded as a confounding factor since it is known to drop almost completely within short interelectrode distances (&amp;lt;20 mm) in intracranial recordings. This finding should guide future electrophysiological connectivity studies and highlight the importance of considering the role of zero‐lag connectivity in our understanding of communication between cell assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Sexual reproduction is such a successful way of creating progeny with subtle genetic variations that the vast majority of eukaryotic species use it. In mammals, it involves the formation of highly specialised cells: the sperm in males and the egg in females, each carrying the genetic inheritance of an individual. The interaction of sperm and egg culminates with the fusion of their cell membranes, triggering the molecular events that result in the formation of a new genetically distinct organism. Although we have a good cellular description of fertilisation in mammals, many of the molecules involved remain unknown, and especially the identity and role of cell surface proteins that are responsible for sperm–egg recognition, binding, and fusion. Here, we will highlight and discuss these gaps in our knowledge and how the role of some recently discovered sperm cell surface and secreted proteins contribute to our understanding of this fundamental process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EZvRCrmjJ6E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Metabolic reprogramming to fulfill the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of cancer cells has aroused great interest in recent years. However, metabolic reprogramming for cancer metastasis has not been well elucidated. Here, we screened a subpopulation of breast cancer cells with highly metastatic capacity to the lung in mice and investigated the metabolic alternations by analyzing the metabolome and the transcriptome, which were confirmed in breast cancer cells, mouse models, and patients’ tissues. The effects and the mechanisms of nucleotide de novo synthesis in cancer metastasis were further evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In our study, we report an increased nucleotide de novo synthesis as a key metabolic hallmark in metastatic breast cancer cells and revealed that enforced nucleotide de novo synthesis was enough to drive the metastasis of breast cancer cells. An increased key metabolite of de novo synthesis, guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP), is able to generate more cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases PKG and downstream MAPK pathway, resulting in the increased tumor cell stemness and metastasis. Blocking de novo synthesis by silencing phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2) can effectively decrease the stemness of breast cancer cells and reduce the lung metastasis. More interestingly, in breast cancer patients, the level of plasma uric acid (UA), a downstream metabolite of purine, is tightly correlated with patient’s survival. Our study uncovered that increased de novo synthesis is a metabolic hallmark of metastatic breast cancer cells and its metabolites can regulate the signaling pathway to promote the stemness and metastasis of breast cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qz0X2Ozyfyo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion is a set of pacemaker neurons endowed with inherent bursting driven by the persistent sodium current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt;). How they proceed to regulate the locomotor rhythm remained unknown. Here, in neonatal rodents, we identified a persistent potassium current critical in regulating pacemakers and locomotion speed. This current recapitulates features of the M-current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;): a subthreshold noninactivating outward current blocked by 10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone dihydrochloride (XE991) and enhanced by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2-chloro-5-pyrimidinyl)-3,4-difluorobenzamide (ICA73). Immunostaining and mutant mice highlight an important role of Kv7.2-containing channels in mediating &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;. Pharmacological modulation of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; regulates the emergence and the frequency regime of both pacemaker and CPG activities and controls the speed of locomotion. Computational models captured these results and showed how an interplay between &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; endows the locomotor CPG with rhythmogenic properties. Overall, this study provides fundamental insights into how &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; work in tandem to set the speed of locomotion.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/9d4Muf1xKZ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides can form protease-resistant aggregates within and outside of neurons. Accumulation of these aggregates is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology and contributes to devastating cognitive deficits associated with this disorder. The primary etiological factor for Aβ aggregation is either an increase in Aβ production or a decrease in its clearance. Aβ is produced by the sequential activity of β- and γ-secretase on the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the clearance is mediated by chaperone-mediated mechanisms. The Aβ aggregates vary from soluble monomers and oligomers to insoluble senile plaques. While excess intraneuronal oligomers can transduce neurotoxic signals into neurons causing cellular defects like oxidative stress and neuroepigenetic mediated transcriptional dysregulation, extracellular senile plaques cause neurodegeneration by impairing neural membrane permeabilization and cell signaling pathways. Paradoxically, senile plaque formation is hypothesized to be an adaptive mechanism to sequester excess toxic soluble oligomers while leaving native functional Aβ levels intact. This hypothesis is strengthened by the absence of positive outcomes and side effects from immunotherapy clinical trials aimed at complete Aβ clearance, and support beneficial physiological roles for native Aβ in cellular function. Aβ has been shown to modulate synaptic transmission, consolidate memory, and protect against excitotoxicity. We discuss the current understanding of beneficial and detrimental roles for Aβ in synaptic function and epigenetic gene control and the future promising prospects of early therapeutic interventions aimed at mediating Aβ induced neuroepigenetic and synaptic dysfunctions to delay AD onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the cystatin B (CSTB) gene. Progression of the clinical symptoms in EPM1 patients, including stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, tonic-clonic seizures, and ataxia, are well described. However, the cellular dysfunction during the presymptomatic phase that precedes the disease onset is not understood. CSTB deficiency leads to alterations in GABAergic signaling, and causes early neuroinflammation followed by progressive neurodegeneration in brains of a mouse model, manifesting as progressive myoclonus and ataxia. Here, we report the first proteome atlas from cerebellar synaptosomes of presymptomatic Cstb-deficient mice, and propose that early mitochondrial dysfunction is important to the pathogenesis of altered synaptic function in EPM1. A decreased sodium- and chloride dependent GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) abundance was noted in synaptosomes with CSTB deficiency, but no functional difference was seen between the two genotypes in electrophysiological experiments with pharmacological block of GAT-1. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the early onset and pathogenesis of CSTB deficiency, and reveal greater complexity to the molecular pathogenesis of EPM1.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a fatal cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity and mortality, for which no effective therapies are currently available. Brain tissue damage caused by ICH is mediated by a newly identified form of non-apoptotic programmed cell death, called ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is characterized by the iron-induced accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to intracellular oxidative stress. Lipid ROS cause damage to nucleic acids, proteins, and cell membranes, eventually resulting in ferroptosis. Numerous biological processes are involved in ferroptosis, including iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione biosynthesis; therefore, iron chelators, lipophilic antioxidants, and other specific inhibitors can suppress ferroptosis, suggesting that these modulators are beneficial for treating brain injury due to ICH. Accumulating evidence indicates that ferroptosis differs from other types of programmed cell death, such as necroptosis, apoptosis, oxytosis, and pyroptosis, in terms of ultrastructural characteristics, signaling pathways, and outcomes. Although several studies have emphasized the importance of ferroptosis due to ICH, the detailed mechanism underlying ferroptosis remains unclear. This review summarizes the available evidence on the mechanism underlying ferroptosis and its relationship with other types of cell death, with the aim to identify therapeutic targets and potential interventions for ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was considered to be a disorder with high heterogeneity, as various abnormalities were found across widespread brain regions in recent neuroimaging studies. However, remarkable individual variability of cortical structure and function may have partially contributed to these discrepant findings. In this work, we applied the Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-Based Cortical Landmarks (DICCCOL) method to identify fine-granularity corresponding functional cortical regions across different subjects based on the shape of a white matter fiber bundle and measured functional connectivities between these cortical regions. Fiber bundle pattern and functional connectivity were compared between ADHD patients and normal controls in two independent samples. Interestingly, four neighboring DICCCOLs located close to the left parietooccipital area consistently exhibited discrepant fiber bundles in both datasets. The left precentral gyrus (DICCCOL 175, BA 6) and the right anterior cingulate gyrus (DICCCOL 321, BA 32) had the highest connection number among 78 pairs of abnormal functional connectivities with good cross-sample consistency. Furthermore, abnormal functional connectivities were significantly correlated with ADHD symptoms. Our studies revealed novel fine-granularity structural and functional alterations in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;The occurrence of death by suicide in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder is as much as 60 times greater than in the general population. Even during the state of euthymia patients are characterized by suicide risk. The aim of the study is to investigate the baseline brain activity in euthymic bipolar disorder patients in regard to suicide risk. We hypothesized that patients compared to healthy control group will demonstrate altered functional connectivity among resting state networks which will be directly related to current suicide risk.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;41 subjects were enrolled in the study consisting control group (n = 21) and euthymic bipolar disorder patients group (n = 20). Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate resting state brain activity and ROI–ROI functional connectivity analysis was performed. Suicidal risk was estimated using The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A two sample t-test revealed decreased functional connectivity between regions involved in the salience network in patients compared to the control group. This decrease was negatively correlated with current suicide risk.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Obtained results suggest the association between risk of suicide and activity of regions responsible for functions such as learning from mistakes, prospective thinking, and sensory integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Area prostriata in primates has recently been found to play important roles in rapid detection and processing of peripheral visual, especially fast-moving visual information. The prostriata in rodents was not discovered until recently and its connectivity is largely unknown. As a part of our efforts to reveal brain-wide connections of the prostriata in rat and mouse, this study focuses on its commissural projections in order to understand the mechanisms underlying interhemispheric integration of information, especially from peripheral visual field. Using anterograde, retrograde and Cre-dependent tracing techniques, we find a unique commissural connection pattern of the prostriata: its layers 2-3 in both hemispheres form strong homotopic commissural connections with few heterotopic projections to bilateral medial entorhinal cortex. This projection pattern is in sharp contrast to that of the presubiculum and parasubiculum, two neighbor regions of the prostriata. The latter two structures project very strongly to bilateral medial entorhinal cortex and to their contralateral counterparts. Our results also suggest the prostriata is a distinct anatomical structure from the presubiculum and parasubiculum and probably plays differential roles in interhemispheric integration and the balancing of spatial information between two hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Heteromers between mu opioid receptor (MOPr) and delta opioid receptor (DOPr) (i.e., MOPr-DOPr heteromer) have been found to be expressed in different brain regions, in the spinal cord, and in dorsal root ganglia. Recent studies on this heteromer reveal its important pathophysiological function in pain regulation including neuropathic pain; this suggests a role as a novel therapeutic target in chronic pain management. In addition, receptor transporter protein 4 (RTP4) has been shown to be involved in the intracellular maturation of the MOPr-DOPr heteromers. RTP4 appears to have unique distribution in vivo being highly expressed in sensory neurons and also macrophages; the latter are effector cells of the innate immune system that phagocytose foreign substances and secrete both pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators; this suggests a possible contribution of RTP4 to neuronal immune-related pathological conditions such as neuropathic pain. Although RTP4 could be considered as an important therapeutic target in the management of pain via MOPr-DOPr heteromer, a few reports have supported this. This review will summarize the possible role or functions of the MOPr-DOPr heteromer and its regulatory molecule RTP4 in pain modulation at sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The brain of adult mammals, including humans, contains neural stem cells (NSCs) located within specific niches of which the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is the largest one. Under physiological conditions, NSCs proliferate, self-renew and produce new neurons and glial cells. Several recent studies established that oncogenic mutations in adult NSCs of the V-SVZ are responsible for the emergence of malignant primary brain tumors called glioblastoma. These aggressive tumors contain a small subpopulation of cells, the glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), that are endowed with proliferative and self-renewal abilities like NSCs from which they may arise. GSCs are thus considered as the cells that initiate and sustain tumor growth and, because of their resistance to current treatments, provoke tumor relapse. A growing body of studies supports that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling controls a variety of processes in NSCs and GSCs. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is a ubiquitous second messenger whose fluctuations of its intracellular concentrations are handled by channels, pumps, exchangers, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding proteins. The concerted action of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; toolkit components encodes specific Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals with defined spatio-temporal characteristics that determine the cellular responses. In this review, after a general overview of the adult brain NSCs and GSCs, we focus on the multiple roles of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; toolkit in NSCs and discuss how GSCs hijack these mechanisms to promote tumor growth. Extensive knowledge of the role of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; toolkit in the management of essential functions in healthy and pathological stem cells of the adult brain should help to identify promising targets for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that selectively affects motor neurons (MNs) of the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Several genes have been linked to both familial (fALS) and sporadic (sALS) cases of ALS. Among all the ALS-related genes, a group of genes known to directly affect cytoskeletal dynamics (ALS2, DCTN1, PFN1, KIF5A, NF-L, NF-H, PRPH, SPAST, and TUBA4A) is of high importance for MN health and survival, considering that MNs are large polarized cells with axons that can reach up to 1 m in length. In particular, cytoskeletal dynamics facilitate the transport of organelles and molecules across the long axonal distances within the cell, playing a key role in synapse maintenance. The majority of ALS-related genes affecting cytoskeletal dynamics were identified within the past two decades, making it a new area to explore for ALS. The purpose of this review is to provide insights into ALS-associated cytoskeletal genes and outline how recent studies have pointed towards novel pathways that might be impacted in ALS. Further studies making use of extensive analysis models to look for true hits, the newest technologies such as CRIPSR/Cas9, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and axon sequencing, as well as the development of more transgenic animal models could potentially help to: differentiate the variants that truly act as a primary cause of the disease from the ones that act as risk factors or disease modifiers, identify potential interactions between two or more ALS-related genes in disease onset and progression and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to cytoskeletal defects. Altogether, this information will give us a hint on the real contribution of the cytoskeletal ALS-related genes during this lethal disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common and severe neurological disorder that can effectively induce oxidative stress responses. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is a member of the NOX family of oxidases. It is expressed in the brain normally and involved in cell signal transduction and the removal of harmful substances. In some pathological conditions, it mediates inflammation and the aging of cells. However, few studies have focused on whether NOX4 is involved in brain injury caused by ICH. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the role of NOX4 in the pathological process that occurs after ICH and the potential mechanism underlying its role. A rat model of ICH was established by the injection of collagenase type IV, and the expression of NOX4 was then determined. Further, siRNA-mediated protein expression knockdown technology was used for NOX4 knockdown, and western immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and other molecular biological techniques were performed to assess the effects of NOX4 knockdown. Neurobiological scoring, brain water content determination, and other brain injury detection methods were also performed to assess the role of NOX4 following ICH. We found that the expression of NOX4 increased in the brains of rats after ICH, and that it was mainly expressed in neurons, astrocytes, vascular endothelial cells and microglia. Following NOX4 knockdown, the level of oxidative stress in the brain decreased considerably, the neurobehavioral scores improved, the levels of neuronal apoptosis reduced markedly, and the impairment of blood-brain barrier function was significantly ameliorated in rats with ICH. In conclusion, this study suggests that NOX4 expression is upregulated after ICH, which may cause an imbalance in the oxidative stress of relevant cells in the brain, leading to subsequent apoptosis of neurons and damage to the blood-brain barrier due to secondary brain injury following ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Population averaged brain templates are an essential tool for imaging-based neuroscience research, providing investigators with information about the expected size and morphology of brain structures and the spatial relationships between them, within a demographic cross-section. This allows for a standardized comparison of neuroimaging data between subjects and provides neuroimaging software with a probabilistic framework upon which further processing and analysis can be based. Many different templates have been created to represent specific study populations and made publicly available for human and animal research. An increasingly studied animal model in the neurosciences that still lacks appropriate brain templates is the adult Yucatan micropig. In particular, T2-weighted templates are absent in this species as a whole. To address this need and provide a tool for neuroscientists wishing to pursue neuroimaging research in the adult micropig, we present the construction of population averaged (n = 16) T2-weighted MRI brain template for the adult Yucatan micropig. Additionally, we present initial analysis of T1-weighted (n = 3), and diffusion-weighted (n = 3) images through multimodal registration of these contrasts to our T2 template. The strategies used here may also be generalized to create similar templates for other study populations or species in need of template construction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia (SCH) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share several common aetiological and symptomatic features suggesting they may be included in a common spectrum. For example, recent results suggest that excitatory/inhibitory imbalance is relevant in the etiology of SCH and ASD. Numerous studies have investigated this imbalance in regions like the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, relatively little is known about neuroanatomical changes that could reduce inhibition in subcortical structures, such as the caudate nucleus (CN), in neuropsychiatric disorders. We recently showed a significant decrease in calretinin-immunopositive (CR-ip) interneuronal density in the CN of patients with ASD without significant change in the density of neuropeptide Y-immunopositive (NPY-ip) neurons. These subtypes together constitute more than 50% of caudate interneurons and are likely necessary for maintaining excitatory/inhibitory balance. Consequently, and since SCH and ASD share characteristic features, here we tested the hypothesis, that the density of CR-ip neurons in the CN is decreased in patients with SCH. We used immunohistochemistry and qPCR for CR and NPY in six patients with schizophrenia and six control subjects. As expected, small, medium and large CR-ip interneurons were detected in the CN. We found a 38% decrease in the density of all CR-ip interneurons (P &amp;lt; 0.01) that was driven by the loss of the small CR-ip interneurons (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in patients with SCH. The densities of the large CR-ip and of the NPY-ip interneurons were not significantly altered. The lower density detected could have been due to inflammation-induced degeneration. However, the state of microglial activation assessed by quantification of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1)- and transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119)-immunopositive cells showed no significant difference between patients with SCH and controls. Our results warrant further studies focussing on the role of CR-ip neurons and on the striatum being a possible hub for information selection and regulation of associative cortical fields whose function have been altered in SCH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;NMDA receptors are important players for neuronal differentiation. We previously reported that antagonizing NMDA receptors with APV blocked the growth-promoting effects evoked by the overexpression of specific calcium-permeable or flip-spliced AMPA receptor subunits and of type I transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins which both exclusively modify apical dendritic length and branching of cortical pyramidal neurons. These findings led us to characterize the role of GluN2B and GluN2A for dendritogenesis using organotypic cultures of rat visual cortex. Antagonizing GluN2B with ifenprodil and Ro25-6981 strongly impaired basal dendritic growth of supra- and infragranular pyramidal cells at DIV 5–10, but no longer at DIV 15–20. Growth recovered after washout, and protein blots revealed an increase of synaptic GluN2B-containing receptors as indicated by a enhanced phosphorylation of the tyrosine 1472 residue. Antagonizing GluN2A with TCN201 and NVP-AAM077 was ineffective at both ages. Dendrite growth of non-pyramidal interneurons was not altered. We attempted to overexpress GluN2A and GluN2B. However, although the constructs delivered currents in HEK cells, there were neither effects on dendrite morphology nor an enhanced sensitivity to NMDA. Further, co-expressing GluN1-1a and GluN2B did not alter dendritic growth. Visualization of overexpressed, tagged GluN2 proteins was successful after immunofluorescence for the tag which delivered rather weak staining in HEK cells as well as in neurons. This suggested that the level of overexpression is too weak to modify dendrite growth. In summary, endogenous GluN2B, but not GluN2A is important for pyramidal cell basal dendritic growth during an early postnatal time window.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Sleep complaints are the most prevalent syndromes in older adults, particularly in women. Moreover, they are frequently accompanied with a high level of depression and stress. Although several diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies reported associations between sleep quality and brain white matter (WM) microstructure, it is still unclear whether gender impacts the effect of sleep quality on structural alterations, and whether these alterations mediate the effects of sleep quality on emotional regulation. We included 389 older participants (176 females, age = 65.5 ± 5.5 years) from the 1000BRAINS project. Neuropsychological examinations covered the assessments of sleep quality, depressive symptomatology, current stress level, visual working memory, and selective attention ability. Based on the DTI dataset, the diffusion parameter maps, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), were calculated and normalized to a population-specific FA template. According to the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 119 poor sleepers (PSQI: 10∼17) and 120 good sleepers (PSQI: 3∼6) were identified. We conducted a two by two (good sleepers/poor sleepers) × (males/females) analysis of variance by using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and JHU-ICBM WM atlas-based comparisons. Moreover, we performed a voxel-wise correlation analysis of brain WM microstructure with the neuropsychological tests. Finally, we applied a mediation analysis to explore if the brain WM microstructure mediates the relationship between sleep quality and emotional regulation. No significant differences in brain WM microstructure were detected on the main effect of sleep quality. However, the MD, AD, and RD of pontine crossing tract and bilateral inferior cerebellar peduncle were significant lower in the males than females. Voxel-wise correlation analysis revealed that FA and RD values in the corpus callosum were positively related with depressive symptomatology and negatively related with current stress levels. Additionally, we found a significantly positive association between higher FA values in visual-related WM tracts and better outcomes in a visual pattern recognition test. Furthermore, a mediation analysis suggested that diffusion metrics within the corpus callosum partially mediated the associations between poor sleep quality/high stress and depressive symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Papers describing software are an important part of computational fields of scientific research. These “software papers” are unique in a number of ways, and they require special consideration to improve their impact on the scientific community and their efficacy at conveying important information. Here, we discuss 10 specific rules for writing software papers, covering some of the different scenarios and publication types that might be encountered, and important questions from which all computational researchers would benefit by asking along the way.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/39EYQupRqIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Systematic knockout studies in mice have shown that a large fraction of the gene replacements show no lethal or other overt phenotypes. This has led to the development of more refined analysis schemes, including physiological, behavioral, developmental and cytological tests. However, transcriptomic analyses have not yet been systematically evaluated for non-lethal knockouts. We conducted a power analysis to determine the experimental conditions under which even small changes in transcript levels can be reliably traced. We have applied this to two gene disruption lines of genes for which no function was known so far. Dedicated phenotyping tests informed by the tissues and stages of highest expression of the two genes show small effects on the tested phenotypes. For the transcriptome analysis of these stages and tissues, we used a prior power analysis to determine the number of biological replicates and the sequencing depth. We find that under these conditions, the knockouts have a significant impact on the transcriptional networks, with thousands of genes showing small transcriptional changes. GO analysis suggests that &lt;i&gt;A930004D18Rik&lt;/i&gt; is involved in developmental processes through contributing to protein complexes, and &lt;i&gt;A830005F24Rik&lt;/i&gt; in extracellular matrix functions. Subsampling analysis of the data reveals that the increase in the number of biological replicates was more important that increasing the sequencing depth to arrive at these results. Hence, our proof-of-principle experiment suggests that transcriptomic analysis is indeed an option to study gene functions of genes with weak or no traceable phenotypic effects and it provides the boundary conditions under which this is possible.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y4Esignvs20&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Eukaryotic genome sequencing and de novo assembly, once the exclusive domain of well-funded international consortia, have become increasingly affordable, thus fitting the budgets of individual research groups. Third-generation long-read DNA sequencing technologies are increasingly used, providing extensive genomic toolkits that were once reserved for a few select model organisms. Generating high-quality genome assemblies and annotations for many aquatic species still presents significant challenges due to their large genome sizes, complexity, and high chromosome numbers. Indeed, selecting the most appropriate sequencing and software platforms and annotation pipelines for a new genome project can be daunting because tools often only work in limited contexts. In genomics, generating a high-quality genome assembly/annotation has become an indispensable tool for better understanding the biology of any species. Herein, we state 12 steps to help researchers get started in genome projects by presenting guidelines that are broadly applicable (to any species), sustainable over time, and cover all aspects of genome assembly and annotation projects from start to finish. We review some commonly used approaches, including practical methods to extract high-quality DNA and choices for the best sequencing platforms and library preparations. In addition, we discuss the range of potential bioinformatics pipelines, including structural and functional annotations (e.g., transposable elements and repetitive sequences). This paper also includes information on how to build a wide community for a genome project, the importance of data management, and how to make the data and results Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) by submitting them to a public repository and sharing them with the research community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SFRYvOAodxE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The transition from mitosis into the first gap phase of the cell cycle in budding yeast is controlled by the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN). The network interprets spatiotemporal cues about the progression of mitosis and ensures that release of Cdc14 phosphatase occurs only after completion of key mitotic events. The MEN has been studied intensively; however, a unified understanding of how localisation and protein activity function together as a system is lacking. In this paper, we present a compartmental, logical model of the MEN that is capable of representing spatial aspects of regulation in parallel to control of enzymatic activity. We show that our model is capable of correctly predicting the phenotype of the majority of mutants we tested, including mutants that cause proteins to mislocalise. We use a continuous time implementation of the model to demonstrate that Cdc14 Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) ensures robust timing of anaphase, and we verify our findings in living cells. Furthermore, we show that our model can represent measured cell–cell variation in Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPoC) mutants. This work suggests a general approach to incorporate spatial effects into logical models. We anticipate that the model itself will be an important resource to experimental researchers, providing a rigorous platform to test hypotheses about regulation of mitotic exit.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7sXa2Hr7n4Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Emotions are multifaceted phenomena affecting mind, body, and behavior. Previous studies sought to link particular emotion categories (e.g., fear) or dimensions (e.g., valence) to specific brain substrates but generally found distributed and overlapping activation patterns across various emotions. In contrast, distributed patterns accord with multi-componential theories whereby emotions emerge from appraisal processes triggered by current events, combined with motivational, expressive, and physiological mechanisms orchestrating behavioral responses. According to this framework, components are recruited in parallel and dynamically synchronized during emotion episodes. Here, we use functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate brain-wide systems engaged by theoretically defined components and measure their synchronization during an interactive emotion-eliciting video game. We show that each emotion component recruits large-scale cortico-subcortical networks, and that moments of dynamic synchronization between components selectively engage basal ganglia, sensory-motor structures, and midline brain areas. These neural results support theoretical accounts grounding emotions onto embodied and action-oriented functions triggered by synchronized component processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MAf_3GnUew8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, has moved rapidly around the globe, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used—appropriately and less appropriately—to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, often dominated by a small number of individuals, and heavily influenced by superspreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features of SARS-CoV-2, e.g., high stochasticity under low prevalence (as compared to other pathogens, such as influenza), and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics cannot be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings, stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, produce processing facilities, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties, and nightclubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity to effectively contain outbreaks with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the different types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, empirical evidence for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hPyMz8UJ2O4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;HCN channels in the mammalian cochlea: Expression pattern, subcellular location, and age‐dependent changes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b1889eab-65c9-4609-ae8b-48f950f97348/jnr24754-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All HCN channel subtypes were located at subcellular level in human and compared with other mammals such as guinea pig, cat, and three mouse strains. Changes in HCN expression levels were quantified in aging mice and murine postnatal development. The widespread expression and distinct localization emphasized the importance of HCN channels for sound coding and electrical stimulation with cochlear implants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal diversity in the cochlea is largely determined by ion channels. Among voltage‐gated channels, hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated (HCN) channels open with hyperpolarization and depolarize the cell until the resting membrane potential. The functions for hearing are not well elucidated and knowledge about localization is controversial. We created a detailed map of subcellular location and co‐expression of all four HCN subunits across different mammalian species including CBA/J, C57Bl/6N, Ly5.1 mice, guinea pigs, cats, and human subjects. We correlated age‐related hearing deterioration in CBA/J and C57Bl/6N with expression levels of HCN1, −2, and −4 in individual auditory neurons from the same cohort. Spatiotemporal expression during murine postnatal development exposed HCN2 and HCN4 involvement in a critical phase of hair cell innervation. The huge diversity of subunit composition, but lack of relevant heteromeric pairing along the perisomatic membrane and axon initial segments, highlighted an active role for auditory neurons. Neuron clusters were found to be the hot spots of HCN1, −2, and −4 immunostaining. HCN channels were also located in afferent and efferent fibers of the sensory epithelium. Age‐related changes on HCN subtype expression were not uniform among mice and could not be directly correlated with audiometric data. The oldest mice groups revealed HCN channel up‐ or downregulation, depending on the mouse strain. The unexpected involvement of HCN channels in outer hair cell function where HCN3 overlaps prestin location emphasized the importance for auditory function. A better understanding may open up new possibilities to tune neuronal responses evoked through electrical stimulation by cochlear implants.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are zinc finger transcription factors implicated in diverse biological processes, including differentiation of neural cells. The ability of mammalian neurons to elongate axons decreases during postnatal development in parallel with a decrease in cAMP, and increase in expression of several Klf genes. The paralogous KLFs 9 and 13 inhibit neurite outgrowth, and we hypothesized that their actions are mediated through repression of cAMP signaling. To test this we used the adult mouse hippocampus-derived cell line HT22 engineered to control expression of Klf9 or Klf13 with doxycycline, or made deficient for these Klfs by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We also used primary hippocampal cells isolated from wild type, Klf9&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; and Klf13&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Forced expression of Klf9 or Klf13 in HT22 changed the mRNA levels of several genes involved with cAMP signaling; the predominant action was gene repression, and KLF13 influenced ∼4 times more genes than KLF9. KLF9 and KLF13 repressed promoter activity of the protein kinase a catalytic subunit alpha gene in transfection-reporter assays; KLF13, but not KLF9 repressed the calmodulin 3 promoter. Forskolin activation of a cAMP-dependent promoter was reduced after forced expression of Klf9 or Klf13, but was enhanced in Klf gene knockout cells. Forced expression of Klf9 or Klf13 blocked cAMP-dependent neurite outgrowth in HT22 cells, and axon growth in primary hippocampal neurons, while Klf gene knockout enhanced the effect of elevated cAMP. Taken together, our findings show that KLF9 and KLF13 inhibit neurite/axon growth in hippocampal neurons, in part, by inhibiting the cAMP signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) mediate interactions of neurons with the extracellular environment by forming adhesive bonds with CAMs on adjacent membranes or via binding to proteins of the extracellular matrix. Binding of CAMs to their extracellular ligands results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, leading to changes in neuronal structure and the molecular composition and function of neuronal contacts. Ultimately, many of these changes depend on the synthesis of new proteins. In this review, we summarize the evidence showing that CAMs regulate protein synthesis by modulating the activity of transcription factors, gene expression, protein translation, and the structure and distribution of organelles involved in protein synthesis and transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage has been implicated to play a dominant role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nicotine, a principal additive compound for tobacco users, is thought as a candidate to attenuate amyloid-β-mediated neurotoxicity and NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Previous studies demonstrated that nicotine exerted this neuroprotective action on oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms underlying how nicotine contributes on oxidative injury in immortalized hippocampal HT-22 cells remain largely unknown. Therefore, in this study we investigated that the potential effects of nicotine on hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-induced oxidative injury and underlying mechanisms in HT-22 cells. We found that pretreatment with nicotine at low concentrations markedly recovered the cell cycle that was arrested at the G2/M phase in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through reduced intracellular ROS generation. Moreover, nicotine attenuated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions. Mechanistically, the application of nicotine significantly upregulated the levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2. The neuroprotective effects of nicotine, in turn, were abolished by PD0325901, a selective Erk1/2 inhibitor. Further obtained investigation showed that nicotine exerted its neuroprotective effects via specifically activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs). A selective inhibitor of α7-nAChRs, methyllycaconitine citrate (MLA), not only completely prevented nicotine-mediated antioxidation but also abolished expression of p-Erk1/2. Taken together, our findings suggest that nicotine suppresses H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced HT-22 cell injury through activating the α7-nAChR/Erk1/2 signaling pathway, which indicates that nicotine may be a novel strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are significant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathophysiology of NDD is still debated, and there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms behind the onset and progression of these heterogenous diseases. The eye represents a unique window to the brain that can be easily assessed via non-invasive ocular imaging. As such, ocular measurements have been recently considered as potential sources of biomarkers for the early detection and management of NDD. However, the current use of ocular biomarkers in the clinical management of NDD patients is particularly challenging. Specifically, many ocular biomarkers are influenced by local and systemic factors that exhibit significant variation among individuals. In addition, there is a lack of methodology available for interpreting the outcomes of ocular examinations in NDD. Recently, mathematical modeling has emerged as an important tool capable of shedding light on the pathophysiology of multifactorial diseases and enhancing analysis and interpretation of clinical results. In this article, we review and discuss the clinical evidence of the relationship between NDD in the brain and in the eye and explore the potential use of mathematical modeling to facilitate NDD diagnosis and management based upon ocular biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Essential tremor (ET) patients often experience hand tremor that impairs daily activities. Non-invasive electrical stimulation of median and radial nerves in the wrist using a recently developed therapy called transcutaneous afferent patterned stimulation (TAPS) has been shown to provide symptomatic tremor relief in ET patients and improve patients’ ability to perform functional tasks, but the duration of tremor reduction is unknown. In this single-arm, open-label study, fifteen ET patients performed four hand tremor-specific tasks (postural hold, spiral drawing, finger-to-nose reach, and pouring) from the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale (FTM-CRS) prior to, during, and 0, 30, and 60 min following TAPS. At each time point, tremor severity was visually rated according to the FTM-CRS and simultaneously measured by wrist-worn accelerometers. The duration of tremor reduction was assessed using (1) improvement in the mean FTM-CRS score across all four tasks relative to baseline, and (2) reduction in accelerometer-measured tremor power relative to baseline for each task. Patients were labeled as having at least 60 min of therapeutic benefit from TAPS with respect to each specified metric if all three (i.e., 0, 30, and 60 min) post-therapy measurements were better than that metric’s baseline value. The mean FTM-CRS scores improved for at least 60 min beyond the end of TAPS for 80% (12 of 15, p = 4.6e–9) of patients. Similarly, for each assessed task, tremor power improved for at least 60 min beyond the end of TAPS for over 70% of patients. The postural hold task had the largest reduction in tremor power (median 5.9-fold peak reduction in tremor power) and had at least 60 min of improvement relative to baseline beyond the end of TAPS therapy for 73% (11 of 15, p = 9.8e–8) of patients. Clinical ratings of tremor severity were correlated to simultaneously recorded accelerometer-measured tremor power (r = 0.33–0.76 across the four tasks), suggesting tremor power is a valid, objective tremor assessment metric that can be used to track tremor symptoms outside the clinic. These results suggest TAPS can provide reductions in upper limb tremor symptoms for at least 1 h post-therapy in some patients, which may improve patients’ ability to perform tasks of daily living.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the urgent need to develop and deploy treatment approaches that can minimize mortality and morbidity. As infection, resulting illness, and the often prolonged recovery period continue to be characterized, therapeutic roles for transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) have emerged as promising non-pharmacological interventions. tES techniques have established therapeutic potential for managing a range of conditions relevant to COVID-19 illness and recovery, and may further be relevant for the general management of increased mental health problems during this time. Furthermore, these tES techniques can be inexpensive, portable, and allow for trained self-administration. Here, we summarize the rationale for using tES techniques, specifically transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), across the COVID-19 clinical course, and index ongoing efforts to evaluate the inclusion of tES optimal clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Immature auditory perception in children has generally been ascribed to deficiencies in cognitive factors, such as working memory and inattention. This notion appears to be commonly accepted for all children despite limited empirical evidence. In the present work, we examined whether working memory capacity would predict basic aspects of hearing, pure-tone frequency discrimination and temporal gap detection, in typically-developing, normal-hearing children (7–12 years). Contrary to our expectation, working memory capacity, as measured by digit spans, or intrinsic auditory attention (on- and off-task response variability) did not consistently predict the individual variability in auditory perception. Present results provide no evidence for a role of working memory capacity in basic measures of auditory perception in children. This lack of a relationship may partly explain why some children with perceptual deficits despite normal audiograms (commonly referred to as auditory processing disorders) may have typical cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Pitch labeling in absolute pitch (AP), the ability to recognize the pitch class of a sound without an external reference, is effortless, fast, and presumably automatic. Previous studies have shown that pitch labeling in AP can interfere with task demands. In the current study, we used a cued auditory Go/Nogo task requiring same/different decisions to investigate both behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of increased inhibitory demands related to automatic pitch labeling. The task comprised two Nogo conditions: a Nogo condition with pitch differences larger than one semitone, and a second Nogo condition with pitch differences of only a quarter semitone. The first Nogo condition tested if auditory-related inhibition processes are generally altered in AP musicians. The second Nogo condition tested the suppressibility of the pitch labeling using a Stroop-like effect: the two tones belonged to the same pitch class but were not identical in terms of tone frequency. If pitch labeling cannot be suppressed, the conflicting information would be expected to increase the inhibitory load in AP musicians. Our data provided no evidence for an increased difficulty to inhibit a prepotent response or to suppress conflicting pitch-labeling information in AP: AP musicians showed similar commission error rates as non-AP musicians in both Nogo conditions. N2d and P3d amplitudes of AP musicians were also comparable to those of non-AP musicians. The event-related potentials (ERPs) were, however, modulated by the Nogo condition, probably indicating an effect of stimulus similarity. It is possible that, depending on the context, pitch labeling in AP musicians is not entirely automatic and can be suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;There is controversy about the influence of compression garments on balance control. A positive influence was reported in elderly and injured individuals, whereas no beneficial effects were observed in young healthy active subjects, which is likely due to the large inter-individual differences in these subjects. Hence, this study investigated the acute effects of compression garments on balance control in young healthy active subjects by addressing the issue of heterogeneity of individuals’ responses to the wearing of compression garments. Thirteen young, healthy, active subjects were recruited. They stood on a force plate which recorded the center of foot pressure displacements in a monopedal stance with the eyes closed and on a wobble board with the eyes open, while wearing compression garments or not. Statistics were first calculated with the data from the whole sample. A hierarchical cluster analysis was also performed in order to categorize the participants’ behaviors into subgroups with similar characteristics. The whole group analysis showed that there were no significant effects attributed to compression garments. The clustering analysis identified distinct and homogeneous subgroups of participants. Only participants who swayed the more at baseline benefited from the wearing of compression garments to improve their balance control. These participants might have either a gravity-dependent preferred sensorimotor strategy with an exploratory postural behavior or poorer balance/proprioceptive abilities. Since poor balance control is a predictor of sports injury risk, wearing compression garments during sports practice could be viewed as a potential prevention strategy for individuals at risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Individuals who have suffered a severe brain injury typically require extensive hospitalization in intensive care units (ICUs), where critical treatment decisions are made to maximize their likelihood of recovering consciousness and cognitive function. These treatment decisions can be difficult when the neurological assessment of the patient is limited by unreliable behavioral responses. Reliable objective and quantifiable markers are lacking and there is both (1) a poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the brain’s ability to reconstitute consciousness and cognition after an injury and (2) the absence of a reliable and clinically feasible method of tracking cognitive recovery in ICU survivors. Our goal is to develop and validate a clinically relevant EEG paradigm that can inform the prognosis of unresponsive, brain-injured patients in the ICU. This protocol describes a study to develop a point-of-care system intended to accurately predict outcomes of unresponsive, brain-injured patients in the ICU. We will recruit 200 continuously-sedated brain-injured patients across five ICUs. Between 24 h and 7 days post-ICU admission, high-density EEG will be recorded from behaviorally unresponsive patients before, during and after a brief cessation of pharmacological sedation. Once patients have reached the waking stage, they will be asked to complete an abridged Cambridge Brain Sciences battery, a web-based series of neurocognitive tests. The test series will be repeated every day during acute admission (ICU, ward), or as often as possible given the constraints of ICU and ward care. Following discharge, patients will continue to complete the same test series on weekly, and then monthly basis, for up to 12 months following injury. Functional outcomes will also be assessed up to 12 months post-injury. We anticipate our findings will lead to an increased ability to identify patients, as soon as possible after their brain injury, who are most likely to survive, and to make accurate predictions about their long-term cognitive and functional outcome. In addition to providing critically needed support for clinical decision-making, this study has the potential to transform our understanding of key functional EEG networks associated with consciousness and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Interest and investment in closed-loop or adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) systems have quickly expanded due to this neurotechnology’s potential to more safely and effectively treat refractory movement and psychiatric disorders compared to conventional DBS. A large neuroethics literature outlines potential ethical concerns about conventional DBS and aDBS systems. Few studies, however, have examined stakeholder perspectives about ethical issues in aDBS research and other next-generation DBS devices. To help fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with researchers involved in aDBS trials (n = 23) to gain insight into the most pressing ethical questions in aDBS research and any concerns about specific features of aDBS devices, including devices’ ability to measure brain activity, automatically adjust stimulation, and store neural data. Using thematic content analysis, we identified 8 central themes in researcher responses. The need to measure and store neural data for aDBS raised concerns among researchers about data privacy and security issues (noted by 91% of researchers), including the avoidance of unintended or unwanted third-party access to data. Researchers reflected on the risks and safety (83%) of aDBS due to the experimental nature of automatically modulating then observing stimulation effects outside a controlled clinical setting and in relation to need for surgical battery changes. Researchers also stressed the importance of ensuring informed consent and adequate patient understanding (74%). Concerns related to automaticity and device programming (65%) were discussed, including current uncertainties about biomarker validity. Additionally, researchers discussed the potential impacts of automatic stimulation on patients’ autonomy and control over stimulation (57%). Lastly, researchers discussed concerns related to patient selection (defining criteria for candidacy) (39%), challenges of ensuring post-trial access to care and device maintenance (39%), and potential effects on personality and identity (30%). To help address researcher concerns, we discuss the need to minimize cybersecurity vulnerabilities, advance biomarker validity, promote the balance of device control between patients and clinicians, and enhance ongoing informed consent. The findings from this study will help inform policies that will maximize the benefits and minimize potential harms of aDBS and other next-generation DBS devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural patterns associated with viewing energy-dense foods can predict changes in eating-related outcomes. However, most research on this topic is limited to one follow-up time point, and single outcome measures. The present study seeks to add to that literature by employing a more refined assessment of food craving and consumption outcomes along with a more detailed neurobiological model of behavior change over several time points. Here, a community sample of 88 individuals (age: M = 39.17, SD = 3.47; baseline BMI: M = 31.5, SD = 3.9, range 24–42) with higher body mass index (BMI) performed a food craving reactivity and regulation task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. At that time—and 1, 3, and 6 months later—participants reported craving for and consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods via the Food Craving Inventory (FCI) and ASA24 (N at 6 months = 52–55 depending on the measure). A priori hypotheses that brain activity associated with both viewing and regulating personally desired unhealthy, energy-dense foods would be associated with self-reported craving for and consumption of unhealthy foods at baseline were not supported by the data. Instead, regression models controlling for age, sex, and BMI demonstrated that brain activity across several regions measured while individuals were regulating their desires for unhealthy food was associated with the self-reported craving for and consumption of healthy food. The hypothesis that vmPFC activity would predict patterns of healthier eating was also not supported. Instead, linear mixed models controlling for baseline age and sex, as well as changes in BMI, revealed that more regulation-related activity in the dlPFC, dACC, IFG, and vmPFC at baseline predicted decreases in the craving for and consumption of healthy foods over the course of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes across the menstrual cycle have been shown to influence reward-related motivation and impulsive behaviors. Here, with the aim of examining the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control of impulsivity, we compared event-related monetary delay discounting task behavior and concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed brain activity as well as resting state (rs)-fMRI activity, between women in the mid-luteal phase (LP) and women in the late follicular phase (FP). The behavioral data were analyzed and related to neural activation data. In the delay discounting task, women in the late FP were more responsive to short-term rewards (i.e., showed a greater discount rate) than women in the mid-LP, while also showing greater activity in the dorsal striatum (DS). Discount rate (transformed k) correlated with functional connectivity between the DS and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), consistent with previous findings indicating that DS-dlPFC circuitry may regulate impulsivity. Our rs-fMRI data further showed that the right dlPFC was significantly more active in the mid-LP than in late FP, and this effect was sensitive to absolute and relative estradiol levels during the mid-LP. DS-dlPFC functional connectivity magnitude correlated negatively with psychometric impulsivity scores during the late FP, consistent with our behavioral data and further indicating that relative estradiol levels may play an important role in augmenting cognitive control. These findings provide new insight into the treatment of conditions characterized by hyper-impulsivity, such as obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In conclusion, our results suggest that cyclical gonadal hormones affect cognitive control of impulsive behavior in a periodic manner, possibility via DS-dlPFC circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Environmental hyperthermia is a common risk factor for occupational safety in many situations due to decreased vigilance performances. Previously, we have reported that decreased resting-state functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and decreased activations in dorsal attention network (DAN) such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were correlated with selective attention deficits during hyperthermia. However, whether the inherent functionally organized anti-correlation between the DMN and DAN would contribute to the behavioral deficits remains unclear. In this study, we collected the resting-state fMRI data of 25 participants during two simulated thermal conditions: normothermic condition (25°C for 1 h) and hyperthermic condition (50°C for 1 h). Using group independent component analysis (ICA), we investigated the functional connectivity within the DMN and DAN, as well as the anti-correlations between both networks. Paired comparisons revealed that decreased intranetwork functional connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the DMN contributed to executive control performance during hyperthermia using multivariate linear regression analysis. Paired comparison on the DAN showed that increased one in the posterior part of the middle and inferior temporal gyrus nearby the temporal–parietal junction area contributed to preserved alerting performance. Lastly but most importantly, we found that decreased correlation between mPFC in the DMN and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) area in the DAN contributed to the executive control deficit, suggesting a weaker intrinsic anti-correlation between DMN and DAN during hyperthermia. These findings indicated that a functional reorganized architecture of DMN and DAN might provide a potential neural basis of the selective deficits for different cognitive-demand attention tasks in high-temperature environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered as the third generation of artificial neural networks, which are more closely with information processing in biological brains. However, it is still a challenge for how to train the non-differential SNN efficiently and robustly with the form of spikes. Here we give an alternative method to train SNNs by biologically-plausible structural and functional inspirations from the brain. Firstly, inspired by the significant top-down structural connections, a global random feedback alignment is designed to help the SNN propagate the error target from the output layer directly to the previous few layers. Then inspired by the local plasticity of the biological system in which the synapses are more tuned by the neighborhood neurons, a differential STDP is used to optimize local plasticity. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark MNIST (98.62%) and Fashion MNIST (89.05%) have shown that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art SNNs trained with backpropagation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability and mortality in children and young adults and has a profound impact on the socio-economic wellbeing of patients and their families. Initially, brain damage is caused by mechanical stress-induced axonal injury and vascular dysfunction, which can include hemorrhage, blood-brain barrier disruption, and ischemia. Subsequent neuronal degeneration, chronic inflammation, demyelination, oxidative stress, and the spread of excitotoxicity can further aggravate disease pathology. Thus, TBI treatment requires prompt intervention to protect against neuronal and vascular degeneration. Rapid advances in the field of stem cells (SCs) have revolutionized the prospect of repairing brain function following TBI. However, more than that, SCs can contribute substantially to our knowledge of this multifaced pathology. Research, based on human induced pluripotent SCs (hiPSCs) can help decode the molecular pathways of degeneration and recovery of neuronal and glial function, which makes these cells valuable tools for drug screening. Additionally, experimental approaches that include hiPSC-derived engineered tissues (brain organoids and bio-printed constructs) and biomaterials represent a step forward for the field of regenerative medicine since they provide a more suitable microenvironment that enhances cell survival and grafting success. In this review, we highlight the important role of hiPSCs in better understanding the molecular pathways of TBI-related pathology and in developing novel therapeutic approaches, building on where we are at present. We summarize some of the most relevant findings for regenerative therapies using biomaterials and outline key challenges for TBI treatments that remain to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Hereditary hearing loss is a disorder with high genetic and allelic heterogeneity. Diagnostic screening of candidate genes commonly yields novel variants of unknown clinical significance. TBC1D24 is a pleiotropic gene associated with recessive DOORS syndrome, epileptic encephalopathy, myoclonic epilepsy, and both recessive and dominant hearing impairment. Genotype-phenotype correlations have not been established to date but could facilitate diagnostic variant assessment and elucidation of pathomechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods and Results: Whole-exome and gene panel screening identified a novel (c.919A&amp;gt;C; p.Asn307His) causative variant in TBC1D24 in two unrelated Caucasian families with Autosomal dominant (AD) nonsyndromic late-onset hearing loss. Protein modeling on the Drosophila TBC1D24 ortholog Skywalker crystal structure showed close interhelix proximity (6.8Å) between the highly conserved residue p.Asn307 in α18 and the position of the single known pathogenic dominant variation (p.Ser178Leu) in α11 that causes a form of deafness with similar clinical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Genetic variants affecting two polar hydrophilic residues in neighboring helices of TBC1D24 cause AD nonsyndromic late-onset hearing loss. The spatial proximity of the affected residues suggests the first genotype-phenotype association in TBC1D24-related disorders. Three conserved residues in α18 contribute to the formation of a functionally relevant cationic phosphoinositide binding pocket that regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking which may be involved in the molecular mechanism of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss is a common disability often caused by the loss of sensory hair cells in the cochlea. Hair cell (HCs) regeneration has long been the main target for the development of novel therapeutics for sensorineural hearing loss. In the mammalian cochlea, hair cell regeneration is limited, but the auditory epithelia of non-mammalian organisms retain the capacity for hair cell regeneration. In the avian basilar papilla (BP), supporting cells (SCs), which give rise to regenerated hair cells, are usually quiescent. Hair cell loss induces both direct transdifferentiation and mitotic division of supporting cells. Here, we established an explant culture model for hair cell regeneration in chick basilar papillae and validated it for investigating the initial phase of hair cell regeneration. The histological assessment demonstrated hair cell regeneration via direct transdifferentiation of supporting cells. Labeling with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) revealed the occurrence of mitotic division in the supporting cells at specific locations in the basilar papillae, while no EdU labeling was observed in newly generated hair cells. RNA sequencing indicated alterations in known signaling pathways associated with hair cell regeneration, consistent with previous findings. Also, unbiased analyses of RNA sequencing data revealed novel genes and signaling pathways that may be related to the induction of supporting cell activation in the chick basilar papillae. These results indicate the advantages of our explant culture model of the chick basilar papillae for exploring the molecular mechanisms of hair cell regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have presented a promising neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Olfactory mucosa MSCs (OM-MSCs), a novel source of MSCs located in the human nasal cavity, are easy to obtain and situated for autologous transplantation. The present study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of OM-MSCs on cerebral I/R injury and the possible mechanisms. In the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) model, excessive oxidative stress and increased swollen mitochondria were observed in the peri-infarct cortex. Intravenous injection of OM-MSCs ameliorated mitochondrial damage and restored oxidant/antioxidant imbalance. Using the oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in vitro, we discovered that the exposure of mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells to OGD/R triggers excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and induces mitochondrial deterioration with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces ATP content. OM-MSC transwell coculture attenuated the above perturbations accompanied with increased UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing 1 (UBIAD1) expression, whereas these protective effects of OM-MSCs were blocked when UBIAD1 was knocked down. UBIAD1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the increased membrane potential and ATP content promoted by OM-MSCs. Additionally, UBIAD1-specific siRNA blocked the oxidant/antioxidant balance treated by OM-MSCs. Overall, our results suggested that OM-MSCs exert neuroprotective effects in cerebral I/R injury by attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction and enhancing antioxidation via upregulation of UBIAD1.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sound localization requires extremely precise development of auditory brainstem circuits, the molecular mechanisms of which are largely unknown. We previously demonstrated a novel requirement for non-apoptotic activity of the protease caspase-3 in chick auditory brainstem development. Here, we used mass spectrometry to identify proteolytic substrates of caspase-3 during chick auditory brainstem development. These auditory brainstem caspase-3 substrates were enriched for proteins previously shown to be cleaved by caspase-3, especially in non-apoptotic contexts. Functional annotation analysis revealed that our caspase-3 substrates were also enriched for proteins associated with several protein categories, including proteins found in extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-bound nanoparticles that function in intercellular communication. The proteome of EVs isolated from the auditory brainstem was highly enriched for our caspase-3 substrates. Additionally, we identified two caspase-3 substrates with known functions in axon guidance, namely Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM) and Neuronal-glial Cell Adhesion Molecule (Ng-CAM), that were found in auditory brainstem EVs and expressed in the auditory pathway alongside cleaved caspase-3. Taken together, these data suggest a novel developmental mechanism whereby caspase-3 influences auditory brainstem circuit formation through the proteolytic cleavage of extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Cognitive demands for postural control increase with aging and cognitive-motor interference (CMI) exists for a number of walking situations, especially with visuo-spatial cognitive tasks. Such interference also influences spatial learning abilities among older adults; however, this is rarely considered in research on aging in spatial navigation. We posited that visually and physically exploring an unknown environment may be subject to CMI for older adults. We investigated potential indicators of postural control interfering with spatial learning. Given known associations between age-related alterations in gait and brain structure, we also examined potential neuroanatomical correlates of this interference. Fourteen young and 14 older adults had to find an invisible goal in an unfamiliar, real, ecological environment. We measured walking speed, trajectory efficiency (direct route over taken route) and goal fixations (proportion of visual fixations toward the goal area). We calculated the change in walking speed between the first and last trials and adaptation indices for all three variables to quantify their modulation across learning trials. All participants were screened with a battery of visuo-cognitive tests. Eighteen of our participants (10 young, 8 older) also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Older adults reduced their walking speed considerably on the first, compared to the last trial. The adaptation index of walking speed correlated positively with those of trajectory efficiency and goal fixations, indicating a reduction in resource sharing between walking and encoding the environment. The change in walking speed correlated negatively with gray matter volume in superior parietal and occipital regions and the precuneus. We interpret older adults’ change in walking speed as indicative of CMI, similar to dual task costs. This is supported by the correlations between the adaptation indices and between the change in walking speed and gray matter volume in brain regions that are important for navigation, given that they are involved in visual attention, sensory integration and encoding of space. These findings under ecological conditions in a natural spatial learning task question what constitutes dual tasking in older adults and they can lead future research to reconsider the actual cognitive burden of postural control in aging navigation research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the value of MRI-based radiomic model based on the radiomic features of different basal nuclei in differentiating idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) from Parkinsonian variants of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Radiomics was applied to the 3T susceptibility- weighted imaging (SWI) from 102 MSA-P patients and 83 IPD patients (allocated to a training and a testing cohort, 7:3 ratio). The substantia nigra (SN), caudate nucleus (CN), putamen (PUT), globus pallidus (GP), red nucleus (RN), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) were manually segmented, and 396 features were extracted. After feature selection, support vector machine (SVM) was generated, and its predictive performance was calculated in both the training and testing cohorts using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Seven radiomic features were selected from the PUT, by which the SVM classifier achieved the best diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.867 in the training cohort and an AUC of 0.862 in the testing cohort. Furthermore, the combined model, which incorporating part III of the Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRSIII) scores into radiomic features of the PUT, further improved the diagnostic performance. However, radiomic features extracted from RN, SN, GP, CN, and STN had moderate to poor diagnostic performance, with AUC values that ranged from 0.610 to 0.788 in the training cohort and 0.583 to 0.766 in the testing cohort.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Radiomic features derived from the PUT had optimal value in differentiating IPD from MSA-P. A combined radiomic model, which contained radiomic features of the PUT and UPDRSIII scores, further improved performance and may represent a promising tool for distinguishing between IPD and MSA-P.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Financial exploitation (FE) in old age is devastating and common; however, the neural correlates of FE are poorly understood. Previous studies of FE in older adults have implicated declines in decision making and social cognition as two risk factors for FE in later life. Here we examined whether functional connectivity among brain regions implicated in decision making and social cognition differed for those with an experience of FE vs. those without. Participants included 16 older adults without cognitive impairment who reported FE (Mean age = 70.5, 62.5% female, Mean education = 16.0 years) and 16 demographically and cognitively matched adults who denied a history of FE (Mean age = 65.1, 37.5% female, Mean education = 15.1 years). Measures of whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity in the hippocampus, insula, and medial frontal cortex were derived for each group. Compared to the non-FE group, FE was associated with greater functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and bilateral temporal regions, and less functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and the right cerebellum and bilateral lingual gyri. The FE group showed less connectivity between the right and left insula and cingulate cortex, and between the right insula and regions of the left lateral temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Finally, the FE group showed greater functional connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and the right lateral temporal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex, and less functional connectivity with the right pre- and postcentral gyri. Results suggest that perceived FE in old age is associated with whole-brain functional connectivity differences involving the hippocampus, insula, and medial frontal cortex, consistent with models implicating age-associated changes in decision making and social cognition in FE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The disease biology of frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTD) is complex and not fully understood, with limited translational value appreciated from animal models to date. Human cellular systems that can recapitulate phenotypic features of disease offer promise as translational tools to not only increase our understanding of disease processes but also increase the probability of success of translating novel treatment options to patients. However not all researchers may necessarily have access to well-characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human neurons. As an example, we therefore comprehensively profiled phenotypic features over time in one commercially-available IPSC-derived human neuron cell line. This included systems-level assessments of neurite outgrowth dynamics, neuronal network function, and genome-wide gene expression. By investigating progranulin biology as an example we then demonstrated the utility of these cells as a tool to investigate human disease biology. For example, by using the siRNA-mediated knockdown of the progranulin (GRN) gene, we demonstrated the establishment of an isogenic human cellular model to facilitate translational FTD research. We reproduced findings from rodent neurons by demonstrating that recombinant progranulin (rPGRN) mediated neuroprotection. Contrary to previous rodent data, in our human cellular models, growth factor treatment showed no consistent sensitivity to modulate neurite outgrowth dynamics. Our study further provides the first evidence that rRPGRN modulated neuronal firing and synchrony in human neurons. Taken together, our datasets are a valuable systems-level resource demonstrating the utility of the tested commercially-available human iPSC neurons for investigating basic human neurobiology, translational neuroscience, and drug discovery applications in neurodegenerative and other CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-related deficits in selective attention have been demonstrated to depend on the sensory modality through which targets and distractors are presented. Some of these investigations suggest a specific impairment of cross-modal auditory selective attention. For the first time, this study is taking on a whole brain approach while including a passive perception baseline, to investigate the neural underpinnings of selective attention across age groups, and taking the sensory modality of relevant and irrelevant (i.e., distracting) stimuli into account. Sixteen younger (mean age = 23.3 years) and 14 older (mean age = 65.3 years), healthy participants performed a series of delayed match-to-sample tasks, in which participants had to selectively attend to visual stimuli, selectively attend to auditory stimuli, or passively view and hear both types of stimuli, while undergoing 3T fMRI. The imaging analyses showed that areas recruited by cross-modal visual and auditory selective attention in both age groups included parts of the dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks (i.e., intraparietal sulcus, insula, fusiform gyrus, anterior cingulate, and inferior frontal cortex). Most importantly, activation throughout the brain did not differ across age groups, suggesting intact brain function during cross-modal selective attention in older adults. Moreover, stronger brain activation during cross-modal visual vs. cross-modal auditory selective attention was found in both age groups, which is consistent with earlier accounts of visual dominance. In conclusion, these results do not support the hypothesized age-related deficit of cross-modal auditory selective attention. Instead, they suggest that the underlying neural correlates of cross-modal selective attention are similar in younger and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are short non-coding sequences involved in gene regulation in many biological processes and diseases. The lack of a complete comprehension of their biological functionality, especially in a genome-wide scenario, has demanded new computational approaches to annotate their roles. It is widely known that secondary structure is determinant to know RNA function and machine learning based approaches have been successfully proven to predict RNA function from secondary structure information. Here we show that RNA function can be predicted with good accuracy from a lightweight representation of sequence information without the necessity of computing secondary structure features which is computationally expensive. This finding appears to go against the dogma of secondary structure being a key determinant of function in RNA. Compared to recent secondary structure based methods, the proposed solution is more robust to sequence boundary noise and reduces drastically the computational cost allowing for large data volume annotations. Scripts and datasets to reproduce the results of experiments proposed in this study are available at: https://github.com/bioinformatics-sannio/ncrna-deep.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RPcEoAI8veQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provides 3D visualization of subcellular components in the near-native state and at sub-molecular resolutions in single cells, demonstrating an increasingly important role in structural biology &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;. However, systematic recognition and recovery of macromolecular structures in cryo-ET data remain challenging as a result of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small sizes of macromolecules, and high complexity of the cellular environment. Subtomogram structural classification is an essential step for such task. Although acquisition of large amounts of subtomograms is no longer an obstacle due to advances in automation of data collection, obtaining the same number of structural labels is both computation and labor intensive. On the other hand, existing deep learning based supervised classification approaches are highly demanding on labeled data and have limited ability to learn about new structures rapidly from data containing very few labels of such new structures. In this work, we propose a novel approach for subtomogram classification based on few-shot learning. With our approach, classification of unseen structures in the training data can be conducted given few labeled samples in test data through instance embedding. Experiments were performed on both simulated and real datasets. Our experimental results show that we can make inference on new structures given only five labeled samples for each class with a competitive accuracy (&amp;gt; 0.86 on the simulated dataset with SNR = 0.1), or even one sample with an accuracy of 0.7644. The results on real datasets are also promising with accuracy &amp;gt; 0.9 on both conditions and even up to 1 on one of the real datasets. Our approach achieves significant improvement compared with the baseline method and has strong capabilities of generalizing to other cellular components.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/krPd1qOwjh8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Complete resection of the tumor is important for survival in glioma patients. Even if the gross total resection was achieved, left-over micro-scale tissue in the excision cavity risks recurrence. High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS NMR) technique can distinguish healthy and malign tissue efficiently using peak intensities of biomarker metabolites. The method is fast, sensitive and can work with small and unprocessed samples, which makes it a good fit for real-time analysis during surgery. However, only a targeted analysis for the existence of known tumor biomarkers can be made and this requires a technician with chemistry background, and a pathologist with knowledge on tumor metabolism to be present during surgery. Here, we show that we can accurately perform this analysis in real-time and can analyze the full spectrum in an untargeted fashion using machine learning. We work on a new and large HRMAS NMR dataset of glioma and control samples (n = 565), which are also labeled with a quantitative pathology analysis. Our results show that a random forest based approach can distinguish samples with tumor cells and controls accurately and effectively with a median AUC of 85.6% and AUPR of 93.4%. We also show that we can further distinguish benign and malignant samples with a median AUC of 87.1% and AUPR of 96.1%. We analyze the feature (peak) importance for classification to interpret the results of the classifier. We validate that known malignancy biomarkers such as creatine and 2-hydroxyglutarate play an important role in distinguishing tumor and normal cells and suggest new biomarker regions.

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childhood obesity is associated with negative physiological and cognitive health outcomes. The hippocampus is a diverse subcortical structure involved in learned feeding behaviors and energy regulation, and research has shown that the hippocampus is vulnerable to the effects of excess adiposity. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced hippocampal volume in overweight and obese children; however, it is unclear if certain subregions are selectively affected. The purpose of this study was to determine how excess body weight influences regional hippocampal surface morphology and memory performance in a large cross‐sectional cohort of 588 children and adolescents between 8.33 and 19.92 years of age using body mass index expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile cutoff (%BMIp95). We demonstrate %BMIp95 is associated with reduced radial thickness in the superior anterior region of the left hippocampus, and this relationship is predominantly driven by children younger than 14 years. We also found %BMIp95 was associated with worse performance on a spatial episodic memory task and this relationship was partially mediated by the radial thickness of the significant shape cluster. These results demonstrate the differential influence of excess body weight on regional hippocampal structure and hippocampal‐dependent behavior in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Novel circular RNA 2960 contributes to secondary damage of spinal cord injury by sponging miRNA‐124&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fa87c22f-989a-4099-8f32-aaf745ccdcdb/cne25030-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequencing analysis for the lesion site of the rat SCI model revealed that the injury significantly stimulated the expression of circRNA‐2960, which acted as a miRNA‐124 sponge to regulate the downstream pathways. Increased circRNA‐2960 expression in SCI decreased the activity of miRNA‐124, which further promoted neuroinflammation and apoptosis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in many human diseases, but their roles in secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. In the current study circRNA sequencing was performed in the damaged tissues of SCI rats on the seventh day after injury, and related molecular mechanisms were investigated. Quantitative PCR validations of molecules that exhibited significantly altered expression in SCI mice were performed. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted to assess differentially expressed circRNAs. A novel circRNA‐2960 was the most significantly upregulated in the SCI group. It could downregulate its target molecule miRNA‐124, then exacerbate the inflammatory response and induce apoptosis at the lesion site. Disrupting circRNA‐2960 expression promoted recovery of tissues affected by secondary SCI damage. The results of the present study may provide new insight into the mechanisms of secondary injury in SCI, and a new molecular marker for the diagnosis and treatment of SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptive memory requires the organism to form associations that bridge between events separated in time. Many studies show interactions between hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during formation of such associations. We analyze neural recording from monkey HPC and PFC during a memory task that requires the monkey to associate stimuli separated by about a second in time. After the first stimulus was presented, large numbers of units in both HPC and PFC fired in sequence. Many units fired only when a particular stimulus was presented at a particular time in the past. These results indicate that both HPC and PFC maintain a temporal record of events that could be used to form associations across time. This temporal record of the past is a key component of the temporal coding hypothesis, a hypothesis in psychology that memory not only encodes what happened, but when it happened.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of cancer‐related pain is 64% among patients with metastatic, advanced, or terminal cancer, 59% among patients undergoing anticancer treatment, and 33% among patients who completed curative treatment. According to the World Health Organization cancer pain relief guidelines, opioid analgesics are the mainstay analgesic therapy in addition to conventional first‐step analgesics, such as non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. The indications for strong opioids have recently been expanded to include mild‐to‐moderate pain in addition to moderate‐to‐severe pain. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines emphasize that realistic expectations should be weighed against potential serious harm from opioids, rather than relying on the unrealized long‐term benefits of these drugs. Therefore, treatment strategies for both cancer‐related chronic or acute pain have been unfortunately deviated from opioid analgesics. The barriers hindering adequate cancer‐related pain management with opioid analgesics are related to the inadequate knowledge of opioid analgesics (e.g., effective dose, adverse effects, and likelihood of addiction or tolerance). To achieve adequate opioid availability, these barriers should be overcome in a clinically suitable manner. Genetic assessments could play an important role in overcoming challenges in opioid management. To balance the improvement in opioid availability and the prevention of opioid misuse and addiction, the following two considerations concerning opioids and genetic polymorphisms warrant attention: (A) pain severity, opioid sensitivity, and opioid tolerance; and (B) vulnerability to opioid dependence and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Neuron‐specific cilia loss differentially alters locomotor responses to amphetamine in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/995d0cf5-19cb-4c0d-b5b9-fc46d367e600/jnr24755-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All neurons possess a primary cilium that projects from the cell body into the extracellular space. This study investigates the behavioral responses of mice engineered to lack a primary cilium on either Gad2 expressing GABAergic neurons, or Dopaminergic neurons, to injections of amphetamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural mechanisms that underlie responses to drugs of abuse are complex, and impacted by a number of neuromodulatory peptides. Within the past 10 years it has been discovered that several of the receptors for neuromodulators are enriched in the primary cilia of neurons. Primary cilia are microtubule‐based organelles that project from the surface of nearly all mammalian cells, including neurons. Despite what we know about cilia, our understanding of how cilia regulate neuronal function and behavior is still limited. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the contributions of primary cilia on specific neuronal populations to behavioral responses to amphetamine. To test the consequences of cilia loss on amphetamine‐induced locomotor activity we selectively ablated cilia from dopaminergic or GAD2‐GABAergic neurons in mice. Cilia loss had no effect on baseline locomotion in either mouse strain. In mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons, locomotor activity compared to wild‐ type mice was reduced in both sexes in response to acute administration of 3.0 mg/kg amphetamine. In contrast, changes in the locomotor response to amphetamine in mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons were primarily driven by reductions in locomotor activity in males. Following repeated amphetamine administration (1.0 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; over 5 days), mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons exhibited enhanced sensitization of the locomotor stimulant response to the drug, whereas mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons did not differ from wild‐type controls. These results indicate that cilia play neuron‐specific roles in both acute and neuroplastic responses to psychostimulant drugs of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Detecting changes in the environment is fundamental for our survival. According to predictive coding theory, detecting these irregularities relies both on incoming sensory information and our top–down prior expectations (or internal generative models) about the world. Prediction errors (PEs), detectable in event-related potentials (ERPs), occur when there is a mismatch between the sensory input and our internal model (i.e., a surprise event). Many changes occurring in our environment are irrelevant for survival and may remain unseen. Such changes, even if subtle, can nevertheless be detected by the brain without emerging into consciousness. What remains unclear is how these changes are processed in the brain at the network level. Here, we used a visual oddball paradigm in which participants engaged in a central letter task during electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings while presented with task-irrelevant high- or low-coherence background, random-dot motion. Critically, once in a while, the direction of the dots changed. After the EEG session, we confirmed that changes in motion direction at high- and low-coherence were visible and invisible, respectively, using psychophysical measurements. ERP analyses revealed that changes in motion direction elicited PE regardless of the visibility, but with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. To understand these responses, we applied dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to the EEG data. Bayesian Model Averaging showed visible PE relied on a release from adaptation (repetition suppression) within bilateral MT+, whereas invisible PE relied on adaptation at bilateral V1 (and left MT+). Furthermore, while feedforward upregulation was present for invisible PE, the visible change PE also included downregulation of feedback between right MT+ to V1. Our findings reveal a complex interplay of modulation in the generative network models underlying visible and invisible motion changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a highly variable and complex set of neurological disorders that alter neurodevelopment and cognitive function, which usually presents with social and learning impairments accompanied with other comorbid symptoms like hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity, or repetitive behaviors. Autism can be caused by genetic and/or environmental factors and unraveling the etiology of ASD has proven challenging, especially given that different genetic mutations can cause both similar and different phenotypes that all fall within the autism spectrum. Furthermore, the list of ASD risk genes is ever increasing making it difficult to synthesize a common theme. The use of rodent models to enhance ASD research is invaluable and is beginning to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disease. Recently, zebrafish have been recognized as a useful model of neurodevelopmental disorders with regards to genetics, pharmacology and behavior and one of the main foundations supporting autism research (SFARI) recently identified 12 ASD risk genes with validated zebrafish mutant models. Here, we describe what is known about those 12 ASD risk genes in human, mice and zebrafish to better facilitate this research. We also describe several non-genetic models including pharmacological and gnotobiotic models that are used in zebrafish to study ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: It has been consistently reported that the deficiency of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensitive purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) ameliorates symptoms in animal models of brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to investigate the role of P2X7R in rodent models of acute and subchronic schizophrenia based on phencyclidine (PCP) delivery in animals lacking or overexpressing P2X7R, and to identify the underlying mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The psychotomimetic effects of acute i.p. PCP administration in C57Bl/6J wild-type, P2X7R knockout (P2rx7&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) and overexpressing (P2X7-EGFP) young adult mice were quantified. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of P2rx7&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; and heterozygous P2X7-EGFP acutely treated animals was characterized through immunohistochemical staining. The prefrontal cortices of young adult P2rx7&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; and P2rx7&lt;sup&gt;tg/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice were examined with tritiated dopamine release experiments and the functional properties of the mPFC pyramidal neurons in layer V from P2rx7&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice were assessed by patch-clamp recordings. P2rx7&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; animals were subjected to a 7 days subchronic systemic PCP treatment. The animals working memory performance and PFC cytokine levels were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our data strengthen the hypothesis that P2X7R modulates schizophrenia-like positive and cognitive symptoms in NMDA receptor antagonist models in a receptor expression level-dependent manner. P2X7R expression leads to higher medial PFC susceptibility to PCP-induced circuit hyperactivity. The mPFC of P2X7R knockout animals displayed distinct alterations in the neuronal activation pattern, microglial organization, specifically around hyperactive neurons, and were associated with lower intrinsic excitability of mPFC neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: P2X7R expression exacerbated PCP-related effects in C57Bl/6J mice. Our findings suggest a pleiotropic role of P2X7R in the mPFC, consistent with the observed behavioral phenotype, regulating basal dopamine concentration, layer-specific neuronal activation, intrinsic excitability of neurons in the mPFC, and the interaction of microglia with hyperactive neurons. Direct measurements of P2X7R activity concerning microglial ramifications and dynamics could help to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The degeneration of light-detecting rod and cone photoreceptors in the human retina leads to severe visual impairment and ultimately legal blindness in millions of people worldwide. Multiple therapeutic options at different stages of degeneration are being explored but the majority of ongoing clinical trials involve adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based gene supplementation strategies for select forms of inherited retinal disease. Over 300 genes are associated with inherited retinal degenerations and only a small proportion of these will be suitable for gene replacement therapy. However, while the origins of disease may vary, there are considerable similarities in the physiological changes that occur in the retina. When early therapeutic intervention is not possible and patients suffer loss of photoreceptor cells but maintain remaining layers of cells in the neural retina, there is an opportunity for a universal gene therapy approach that can be applied regardless of the genetic origin of disease. Optogenetic therapy offers such a strategy by aiming to restore vision though the provision of light-sensitive molecules to surviving cell types of the retina that enable light perception through the residual neurons. Here we review the recent progress in attempts to restore visual function to the degenerate retina using optogenetic therapy. We focus on multiple pre-clinical models used in optogenetic strategies, discuss their strengths and limitations, and highlight considerations including vector and transgene designs that have advanced the field into two ongoing clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurofunctional mechanisms of speech production and their pathologies is still incomplete. In this paper, a comprehensive model of speech production based on the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) is presented. This model is able to activate sensorimotor plans based on cognitive-functional processes (i.e., generation of the intention of an utterance, selection of words and syntactic frames, generation of the phonological form and motor plan; feedforward mechanism). Since the generation of different states of the utterance are tied to different levels in the speech production hierarchy, it is shown that different forms of speech errors as well as speech disorders can arise at different levels in the production hierarchy or are linked to different levels and different modules in the speech production model. In addition, the influence of the inner feedback mechanisms on normal as well as on disordered speech is examined in terms of the model. The model uses a small number of core concepts provided by the NEF, and we show that these are sufficient to create this neurobiologically detailed model of the complex process of speech production in a manner that is, we believe, clear, efficient, and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Olfaction plays an important role in the evaluation, motivation, and palatability of food. The chemical identity of odorants is coded by a spatial combination of activated glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, which is referred to as the odor map. However, the functional roles of the olfactory cortex, a collective region that receives axonal projections from the olfactory bulb, and higher olfactory centers in odor-guided eating behaviors are yet to be elucidated. The olfactory tubercle (OT) is a component of the ventral striatum and forms a node within the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. Recent studies have revealed the anatomical domain structures of the OT and their functions in distinct odor-guided motivated behaviors. Another component of the ventral striatum, the nucleus accumbens, is well known for its involvement in motivation and hedonic responses for foods, which raises the possibility of functional similarities between the OT and nucleus accumbens in eating. This review first summarizes recent findings on the domain- and neuronal subtype-specific roles of the OT in odor-guided motivated behaviors and then proposes a model for the regulation of eating behaviors by the OT.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has a brain neurotropism through binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed by neurones and glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia. Systemic infection which accompanies severe cases of COVID-19 also triggers substantial increase in circulating levels of chemokines and interleukins that compromise the blood-brain barrier, enter the brain parenchyma and affect its defensive systems, astrocytes and microglia. Brain areas devoid of a blood-brain barrier such as the circumventricular organs are particularly vulnerable to circulating inflammatory mediators. The performance of astrocytes and microglia, as well as of immune cells required for brain health, is considered critical in defining the neurological damage and neurological outcome of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the implication of neuroinflammation, adaptive and innate immunity, autoimmunity, as well as astrocytic and microglial immune and homeostatic functions in the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during ageing, in the presence of systemic comorbidities, and for the exposed pregnant mother and foetus are also covered.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurons have been long regarded as the basic functional cells of the brain, whereas astrocytes and microglia have been regarded only as elements of support. However, proper intercommunication among neurons–astrocytes–microglia is of fundamental importance for the functional organization of the brain. Perturbation in the regulation of brain energy metabolism not only in neurons but also in astrocytes and microglia may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration, especially in hypoxia/ischemia. Glial activation has long been considered detrimental for survival of neurons, but recently it appears that glial responses to an insult are not equal but vary in different brain areas. In this review, we first take into consideration the modifications of the vascular unit of the glymphatic system and glial metabolism in hypoxic conditions. Using the method of triple-labeling fluorescent immunohistochemistry coupled with confocal microscopy (TIC), we recently studied the interplay among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in chronic brain hypoperfusion. We evaluated the quantitative and morpho-functional alterations of the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads comparing the hippocampal CA1 area, more vulnerable to ischemia, to the CA3 area, less vulnerable. In these contiguous and interconnected areas, in the same experimental hypoxic conditions, astrocytes and microglia show differential, finely regulated, region-specific reactivities. In both areas, astrocytes and microglia form triad clusters with apoptotic, degenerating neurons. In the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads, the cell body of a damaged neuron is infiltrated and bisected by branches of astrocyte that create a microscar around it while a microglial cell phagocytoses the damaged neuron. These coordinated actions are consistent with the scavenging and protective activities of microglia. In hypoxia, the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads are more numerous in CA3 than in CA1, further indicating their protective effects. These data, taken from contiguous and interconnected hippocampal areas, demonstrate that glial response to the same hypoxic insult is not equal but varies significantly. Understanding the differences of glial reactivity is of great interest to explain the differential susceptibility of hippocampal areas to hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies may evidence the differential reactivity of glia in different brain areas, explaining the higher or lower sensitivity of these areas to different insults and whether glia may represent a target for future therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Maternal exposure to the valproate short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) during pregnancy is known to possibly induce autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the offspring. By contrast, case studies have evidenced positive outcomes of this anticonvulsant drug in children with severe autism. Interestingly, the same paradoxical pattern applies to the IL-17a inflammatory cytokine involved in the immune system regulation. Such joint apparent contradictions can be overcome by pointing out that, among their respective signaling pathways, valproate and IL-17a share an enhancement of the “type A monoamine oxidase” (MAOA) enzyme carried by the X chromosome. In the Guided Propagation (GP) model of autism, such enzymatic rise triggers a prenatal epigenetic downregulation, which, without possible X-inactivation, and when coinciding with genetic expression variants of other brain enzymes, results in the delayed onset of autistic symptoms. The underlying imbalance of synaptic monoamines, serotonin in the first place, would reflect a mismatch between the environment to which the brain metabolism was prepared during gestation and the postnatal actual surroundings. Following a prenatal exposure to molecules that significantly elicit the MAOA gene expression, a daily treatment with the same metabolic impact would tend to recreate the fetal environment and contribute to rebalance monoamines, thus allowing proper neural circuits to gradually develop, provided behavioral re-education. Given the multifaceted other players than MAOA that are involved in the regulation of serotonin levels, potential compensatory effects are surveyed, which may underlie the autism heterogeneity. This explanatory framework opens up prospects regarding autism prevention and treatment, strikingly in line with current advances along the gut microbiome–brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Selective negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), targeting α5 subunit-containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) as potential therapeutic targets for disorders associated with cognitive deficits, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), continually fail clinical trials. We investigated whether this was due to the change in the expression of α5 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, consequently altering synaptic function during AD pathogenesis. Using medicinal chemistry and computational modeling, we developed aqueous soluble hybrids of 6,6-dimethyl-3-(2-hydroxyethyl) thio-1-(thiazol-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophene-4(5H)-one, that demonstrated selective binding and high negative allosteric modulation, specifically for the α5 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R subtypes in constructed HEK293 stable cell-lines. Using a knock-in mouse model of AD (APP&lt;sup&gt;NL−F/NL−F&lt;/sup&gt;), which expresses a mutant form of human amyloid-β (Aβ), we performed immunofluorescence studies combined with electrophysiological whole-cell recordings to investigate the effects of our key molecule, α5-SOP002 in the hippocampal CA1 region. In aged APP&lt;sup&gt;NL−F/NL−F&lt;/sup&gt; mice, selective preservation of α5 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs was observed in, calretinin- (CR), cholecystokinin- (CCK), somatostatin- (SST) expressing interneurons, and pyramidal cells. Previously, we reported that CR dis-inhibitory interneurons, specialized in regulating other interneurons displayed abnormally high levels of synaptic inhibition in the APP&lt;sup&gt;NL−F/NL−F&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model, here we show that this excessive inhibition was “normalized” to control values with bath-applied α5-SOP002 (1 μM). However, α5-SOP002, further impaired inhibition onto CCK and pyramidal cells that were already largely compromised by exhibiting a deficit of inhibition in the AD model. In summary, using a multi-disciplinary approach, we show that exposure to α5 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R NAMs may further compromise aberrant synapses in AD. We, therefore, suggest that the α5 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R is not a suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of AD or other cognitive deficits due to the widespread neuronal-networks that use α5 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Progression of neuronal deterioration within specific brain regions is considered as one of the principal bases for the development of major depressive disorders. Therefore, protects and promotes the maintaining of normal structure and function of neurons might be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of depression. Here, we report that the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), inhibited neuronal injury through its capacity to reduce oxidative stress and exerted antidepressant effects. Specifically, we show that antioxidant enzyme activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region of depressive rats, while treatment with NAC (300 mg/kg, i.p.) produced neuroprotective effects against mitochondrial oxidative stress injuries and oxidative DNA damage in CA1 neurons of these rats. Moreover, NAC treatment alleviated neuronal injury resulting from neuroinflammation and apoptosis in depressed rats, effects that were associated with reductions in dendritic spine atrophy, and synapse deficits. These effects appear to involve a down-regulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-JNK signaling along with an up-regulation of ERK signaling within the hippocampal CA1 region. Moreover, this NAC treatment significantly ameliorated depression-like behaviors as indicated by performance in the sucrose preference and forced swim tests (FST). Taken together, these results reveal the potential involvement of oxidative stress in the generation of depression. And, the antidepressant-like effects exerted by NAC may involve reductions in this oxidative stress that can result in neuronal deterioration. Such neuroprotective effects of NAC may indicate a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of stress-related depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Intrinsically organized large-scale brain networks and their interactions support complex cognitive function. Investigations suggest that the default network (DN) is the earliest disrupted network and that the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) are subsequently impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These large-scale networks comprise different subsystems (DN: medial temporal lobe (MTL), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DM) subsystems and a Core; FPCN: FPCNA and FPCNB). Our previous research has indicated that different DN subsystems are not equally damaged in AD. However, changes in the patterns of interactions among these large-scale network subsystems and the underlying cause of the alterations in AD remain unclear. We hypothesized that disrupted DN subsystems cause specific impairments in inter-system interactions and a higher regulatory burden for the FPCNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: To test this hypothesis, Granger causality analysis (GCA) was performed to explore effective functional connectivity (FC) pattern of these networks. The regional information flow strength (IFS) was calculated and compared across groups to explore changes in the subsystems and their inter-system interactions and the relationship between them. To investigate specific inter-system changes, we summed the inter-system IFS and performed correlation analyses of the bidirectional inter-system IFS, which was compared across groups. Additionally, correlation analyses of dynamic effective FC patterns were performed to reveal alterations in the temporal co-evolution of sets of inter-subsystem interactions. Furthermore, we used partial correlation analysis to quantify the FPCN's regulatory effects. Finally, we applied a support vector machine (SVM) linear classifier to probe which network most effectively discriminated patients from controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with controls, AD patients showed a decreased intra-DN regional IFS, which was significantly related to the inter-network's IFS. The IFS between the DN subsystems and FPCN subsystems/DAN decreased. Critically, the correlation values of the decreased bidirectional IFS between the DN subsystems and FPCNA diminished. Additionally, the Core and DM play pivotal roles in disordered temporal co-evolution. Furthermore, the FPCNA showed enhanced regulation of the Core. Finally, the MTL subsystem and Core were effective at discriminating patients from controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The predominantly disrupted DN subsystems caused impaired inter-system interactions and created a higher regulatory burden for the FPCNA.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) act as mediators and biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Two distinct forms of Alzheimer disease (AD) are known: a late-onset sporadic form (SAD) and an early-onset familial form (FAD). Recently, neurovascular dysfunction and altered systemic immunological components have been linked to AD neurodegeneration. Therefore, we characterized systemic-EVs from postmortem SAD and FAD patients and evaluated their effects on neuroglial and endothelial cells. We found increase CLN-5 spots with vesicular morphology in the abluminal portion of vessels from SAD patients. Both forms of AD were associated with larger and more numerous systemic EVs. Specifically, SAD patients showed an increase in endothelial- and leukocyte-derived EVs containing mitochondria; in contrast, FAD patients showed an increase in platelet-derived EVs. We detected a differential protein composition for SAD- and FAD-EVs associated with the coagulation cascade, inflammation, and lipid-carbohydrate metabolism. Using mono- and cocultures (endothelium-astrocytes-neurons) and human cortical organoids, we showed that AD-EVs induced cytotoxicity. Both forms of AD featured decreased neuronal branches area and astrocytic hyperreactivity, but SAD-EVs led to greater endothelial detrimental effects than FAD-EVs. In addition, FAD- and SAD-EVs affected calcium dynamics in a cortical organoid model. Our findings indicate that the phenotype of systemic AD-EVs is differentially defined by the etiopathology of the disease (SAD or FAD), which results in a differential alteration of the NVU cells implied in neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Astrocytes have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in specific cortical synapses, but our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remains limited. Here we present a new biophysicochemical model of a somatosensory cortical layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapse to study the role of astrocytes in spike-timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. By applying the synapse model and electrophysiological data recorded from rodent somatosensory cortex, we show that a signal from a postsynaptic neuron, orchestrated by endocannabinoids, astrocytic calcium signaling, and presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors coupled with calcineurin signaling, induces t-LTD which is sensitive to the temporal difference between post- and presynaptic firing. We predict for the first time the dynamics of astrocyte-mediated molecular mechanisms underlying t-LTD and link complex biochemical networks at presynaptic, postsynaptic, and astrocytic sites to the time window of t-LTD induction. During t-LTD a single astrocyte acts as a delay factor for fast neuronal activity and integrates fast neuronal sensory processing with slow non-neuronal processing to modulate synaptic properties in the brain. Our results suggest that astrocytes play a critical role in synaptic computation during postnatal development and are of paramount importance in guiding the development of brain circuit functions, learning and memory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hl6PJIbIOEc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Computational science has been greatly improved by the use of containers for packaging software and data dependencies. In a scholarly context, the main drivers for using these containers are transparency and support of reproducibility; in turn, a workflow’s reproducibility can be greatly affected by the choices that are made with respect to building containers. In many cases, the build process for the container’s image is created from instructions provided in a Dockerfile format. In support of this approach, we present a set of rules to help researchers write understandable Dockerfiles for typical data science workflows. By following the rules in this article, researchers can create containers suitable for sharing with fellow scientists, for including in scholarly communication such as education or scientific papers, and for effective and sustainable personal workflows.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4EN5XLEWE9Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Hypertension is the most important cause of death and disability in the elderly. In 9 out of 10 cases, the molecular cause, however, is unknown. One mechanistic hypothesis involves impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Indeed, ROS forming NADPH oxidase (&lt;i&gt;Nox&lt;/i&gt;) genes associate with hypertension, yet target validation has been negative. We re-investigate this association by molecular network analysis and identify NOX5, not present in rodents, as a sole neighbor to human vasodilatory endothelial nitric oxide (NO) signaling. In hypertensive patients, endothelial microparticles indeed contained higher levels of NOX5—but not NOX1, NOX2, or NOX4—with a bimodal distribution correlating with disease severity. Mechanistically, mice expressing human &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;ox5 in endothelial cells developed—upon aging—severe systolic hypertension and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to uncoupled NO synthase (NOS). We conclude that NOX5-induced uncoupling of endothelial NOS is a causal mechanism and theragnostic target of an age-related hypertension endotype. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;ox5 knock-in (KI) mice represent the first mechanism-based animal model of hypertension.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OYrIOvWWwEA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Echolocating bats rely upon spectral interference patterns in echoes to reconstruct fine details of a reflecting object’s shape. However, the acoustic modulations required to do this are extremely brief, raising questions about how their auditory cortex encodes and processes such rapid and fine spectrotemporal details. Here, we tested the hypothesis that biosonar target shape representation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) is more reliably encoded by changes in spike timing (latency) than spike rates and that latency is sufficiently precise to support a synchronization-based ensemble representation of this critical auditory object feature space. To test this, we measured how the spatiotemporal activation patterns of A1 changed when naturalistic spectral notches were inserted into echo mimic stimuli. Neurons tuned to notch frequencies were predicted to exhibit longer latencies and lower mean firing rates due to lower signal amplitudes at their preferred frequencies, and both were found to occur. Comparative analyses confirmed that significantly more information was recoverable from changes in spike times relative to concurrent changes in spike rates. With this data, we reconstructed spatiotemporal activation maps of A1 and estimated the level of emerging neuronal spike synchrony between cortical neurons tuned to different frequencies. The results support existing computational models, indicating that spectral interference patterns may be efficiently encoded by a cascading tonotopic sequence of neural synchronization patterns within an ensemble of network activity that relates to the physical features of the reflecting object surface.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3FZBnVuZ3uI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioral correlates, with the magnitude and vigor of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. Theory and empirical experiments suggest theta‐movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi‐step regression, we find that the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using a generalized linear model, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and amplitude. Our findings suggest movement‐speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Characterization of mWake expression in the murine brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/16d4202a-8edb-4ba0-aff8-5dcbc5ea051c/cne25066-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) was first identified in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; as a clock‐output molecule that regulates the timing of sleep and arousal. There is a single homolog of WAKE (mWAKE/ANKFN1/NMF9) in mice, which has previously shown to be enriched in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian pacemaker. This present work surveys the brain expression pattern of mWAKE using multiple approaches. First, &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression is examined using RNAscope in situ hybridization. Second, mWAKE protein expression is investigated using two different transgenic animal models: an &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;V5&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mouse where a V5 tag is fused directly to the end of the protein and an &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;tdTomato‐2A‐Cre&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mouse where tdTomato is inserted in‐frame within the gene. Third, we analyze scRNA‐Seq data to characterize the molecular identity of &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt; neurons in the hypothalamus. These data reveal that mWAKE labels a distributed subset of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons across the brainstem, subcortical regions, and cortex, with significant expression in the hypothalamus. This study may provide a potential roadmap for future studies of the circadian regulation of distinct circuits and behaviors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structure–function analyses of the mammalian brain have historically relied on anatomically‐based approaches. In these investigations, physical, chemical, or electrolytic lesions of anatomical structures are applied, and the resulting behavioral or physiological responses assayed. An alternative approach is to focus on the expression pattern of a molecule whose function has been characterized and then use genetic intersectional methods to optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulate distinct circuits. We previously identified WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, a clock output molecule that mediates the temporal regulation of sleep onset and sleep maintenance. More recently, we have studied the mouse homolog, mWAKE/ANKFN1, and our data suggest that its basic role in the circadian regulation of arousal is conserved. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the expression pattern of &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, protein, and cells throughout the adult mouse brain. We find that mWAKE labels neurons in a restricted, but distributed manner, in multiple regions of the hypothalamus (including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and tuberomammillary nucleus region), the limbic system, sensory processing nuclei, and additional specific brainstem, subcortical, and cortical areas. Interestingly, mWAKE is also observed in non‐neuronal ependymal cells. In addition, to describe the molecular identities and clustering of &lt;i&gt;mWake&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells, we provide detailed analyses of single cell RNA sequencing data from the hypothalamus, a region with particularly significant mWAKE expression. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies into the potential role of mWAKE&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the rhythmic control of diverse behaviors and physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Identification of retinal ganglion cell types and brain nuclei expressing the transcription factor Brn3c/Pou4f3 using a Cre recombinase knock‐in allele&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/94eb4f7d-16e1-4dbf-84c3-b2b713efdfe6/cne25065-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left—Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; retinal ganglion cells (RGC) innervate the thalamic reticular nucleus, known to be involved in cortical feedback to the relay thalamic nuclei. Right—Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Brn3b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGCs cluster in an area of increased RGC density akin to an area centralis subtending the binocular field of the mouse.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the POU4F/Brn3 transcription factor family have an established role in the development of retinal ganglion cell (RGCs) types, the main transducers of visual information from the mammalian eye to the brain. Our previous work using sparse random recombination of a conditional knock‐in reporter allele expressing alkaline phosphatase (AP) and intersectional genetics had identified three types of Brn3c positive (Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) RGCs. Here, we describe a novel Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mouse allele generated by serial Dre to Cre recombination and use it to explore the expression overlap of Brn3c with Brn3a and Brn3b and the dendritic arbor morphologies and visual stimulus response properties of Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGC types. Furthermore, we explore brain nuclei that express Brn3c or receive input from Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Our analysis reveals a much larger number of Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGCs and more diverse set of RGC types than previously reported. Most RGCs expressing Brn3c during development are still Brn3c positive in the adult, and all express Brn3a while only about half express Brn3b. Genetic Brn3c‐Brn3b intersection reveals an area of increased RGC density, extending from dorsotemporal to ventrolateral across the retina and overlapping with the mouse binocular field of view. In addition, we report a Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGC projection to the thalamic reticular nucleus, a visual nucleus that was not previously shown to receive retinal input. Furthermore, Brn3c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons highlight a previously unknown subdivision of the deep mesencephalic nucleus. Thus, our newly generated allele provides novel biological insights into RGC type classification, brain connectivity, and cytoarchitectonic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
