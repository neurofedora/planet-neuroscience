 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Sleep spindles are distinctive transient patterns of brain activity that typically occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in humans and other mammals. Thought to be important for the consolidation of learning, they may also be useful for indicating the progression of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize sleep spindles in sheep (&lt;i&gt;Ovis aries&lt;/i&gt;). We recorded electroencephalographs wirelessly from six sheep over a continuous period containing 2 nights and a day. We detected and characterized spindles using an automated algorithm. We found that sheep sleep spindles fell within the classical range seen in humans (10–16 Hz), but we did not see a further separation into fast and slow bands. Spindles were detected predominantly during NREM sleep. Spindle characteristics (frequency, duration, density, topography) varied between individuals, but were similar within individuals between nights. Spindles that occurred during NREM sleep in daytime were indistinguishable from those found during NREM sleep at night. Surprisingly, we also detected numerous spindle-like events during unequivocal periods of wake during the day. These events were mainly local (detected at single sites), and their characteristics differed from spindles detected during sleep. These &quot;wake spindles&quot; are likely to be events that are commonly categorized as &quot;spontaneous alpha activity&quot; during wake. We speculate that wake and sleep spindles are generated via different mechanisms, and that wake spindles play a role in cognitive processes that occur during the daytime.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Fever is a common phenomenon during infection or inflammatory conditions. This stereotypic rise in body temperature (Tb) in response to inflammatory stimuli is a result of autonomic responses triggered by prostaglandin E2 action on EP3 receptors expressed by neurons in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO&lt;sup&gt;EP3R&lt;/sup&gt; neurons). To investigate the identity of MnPO&lt;sup&gt;EP3R&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, we first used &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to show coexpression of EP3R and the VGluT2 transporter in MnPO neurons. Retrograde tracing showed extensive direct projections from MnPO&lt;sup&gt;VGluT2&lt;/sup&gt; but few from MnPO&lt;sup&gt;Vgat&lt;/sup&gt; neurons to a key site for fever production, the raphe pallidus. Ablation of MnPO&lt;sup&gt;VGluT2&lt;/sup&gt; but not MnPO&lt;sup&gt;Vgat&lt;/sup&gt; neurons abolished fever responses but not changes in Tb induced by behavioral stress or thermal challenges. Finally, we crossed EP3R conditional knock-out mice with either VGluT2-IRES-cre or Vgat-IRES-cre mice and used both male and female mice to confirm that the neurons that express EP3R and mediate fever are glutamatergic, not GABAergic. This finding will require rethinking current concepts concerning the central thermoregulatory pathways based on the MnPO&lt;sup&gt;EP3R&lt;/sup&gt; neurons being GABAergic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Body temperature is regulated by the CNS. The rise of the body temperature, or fever, is an important brain-orchestrated mechanism for fighting against infectious or inflammatory disease, and is tightly regulated by the neurons located in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Here we demonstrate that excitatory MnPO neurons mediate fever and examine a potential central circuit underlying the development of fever responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/12/2562?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;When selectively attending to a speech stream in multi-talker scenarios, low-frequency cortical activity is known to synchronize selectively to fluctuations in the attended speech signal. Older listeners with age-related sensorineural hearing loss (presbycusis) often struggle to understand speech in such situations, even when wearing a hearing aid. Yet, it is unclear whether a peripheral hearing loss degrades the attentional modulation of cortical speech tracking. Here, we used psychoacoustics and electroencephalography (EEG) in male and female human listeners to examine potential effects of hearing loss on EEG correlates of speech envelope synchronization in cortex. Behaviorally, older hearing-impaired (HI) listeners showed degraded speech-in-noise recognition and reduced temporal acuity compared with age-matched normal-hearing (NH) controls. During EEG recordings, we used a selective attention task with two spatially separated simultaneous speech streams where NH and HI listeners both showed high speech recognition performance. Low-frequency (&amp;lt;10 Hz) envelope-entrained EEG responses were enhanced in the HI listeners, both for the attended speech, but also for tone sequences modulated at slow rates (4 Hz) during passive listening. Compared with the attended speech, responses to the ignored stream were found to be reduced in both HI and NH listeners, allowing for the attended target to be classified from single-trial EEG data with similar high accuracy in the two groups. However, despite robust attention-modulated speech entrainment, the HI listeners rated the competing speech task to be more difficult. These results suggest that speech-in-noise problems experienced by older HI listeners are not necessarily associated with degraded attentional selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; People with age-related sensorineural hearing loss often struggle to follow speech in the presence of competing talkers. It is currently unclear whether hearing impairment may impair the ability to use selective attention to suppress distracting speech in situations when the distractor is well segregated from the target. Here, we report amplified envelope-entrained cortical EEG responses to attended speech and to simple tones modulated at speech rates (4 Hz) in listeners with age-related hearing loss. Critically, despite increased self-reported listening difficulties, cortical synchronization to speech mixtures was robustly modulated by selective attention in listeners with hearing loss. This allowed the attended talker to be classified from single-trial EEG responses with high accuracy in both older hearing-impaired listeners and age-matched normal-hearing controls.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/12/2553?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning (RL) refers to the behavioral process of learning to obtain reward and avoid punishment. An important component of RL is managing explore–exploit tradeoffs, which refers to the problem of choosing between exploiting options with known values and exploring unfamiliar options. We examined correlates of this tradeoff, as well as other RL related variables, in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) while three male monkeys performed a three-armed bandit learning task. During the task, novel choice options periodically replaced familiar options. The values of the novel options were unknown, and the monkeys had to explore them to see if they were better than other currently available options. The identity of the chosen stimulus and the reward outcome were strongly encoded in the responses of single OFC neurons. These two variables define the states and state transitions in our model that are relevant to decision-making. The chosen value of the option and the relative value of exploring that option were encoded at intermediate levels. We also found that OFC value coding was stimulus specific, as opposed to coding value independent of the identity of the option. The location of the option and the value of the current environment were encoded at low levels. Therefore, we found encoding of the variables relevant to learning and managing explore–exploit tradeoffs in OFC. These results are consistent with findings in the ventral striatum and amygdala and show that this monosynaptically connected network plays an important role in learning based on the immediate and future consequences of choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in representing the expected values of choices. Here we extend these results and show that OFC also encodes information relevant to managing explore–exploit tradeoffs. Specifically, OFC encodes an exploration bonus, which characterizes the relative value of exploring novel choice options. OFC also strongly encodes the identity of the chosen stimulus, and reward outcomes, which are necessary for computing the value of novel and familiar options.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Seeing movement promotes survival. It results from an uncertain interplay between evolution and experience, making it hard to isolate the drivers of computational architectures found in brains. Here we seek insight into motion perception using a neural network (MotionNet) trained on moving images to classify velocity. The network recapitulates key properties of motion direction and speed processing in biological brains, and we use it to derive, and test, understanding of motion (mis)perception at the computational, neural, and perceptual levels. We show that diverse motion characteristics are largely explained by the statistical structure of natural images, rather than motion per se. First, we show how neural and perceptual biases for particular motion directions can result from the orientation structure of natural images. Second, we demonstrate an interrelation between speed and direction preferences in (macaque) MT neurons that can be explained by image autocorrelation. Third, we show that natural image statistics mean that speed and image contrast are related quantities. Finally, using behavioral tests (humans, both sexes), we show that it is knowledge of the speed-contrast association that accounts for motion illusions, rather than the distribution of movements in the environment (the &quot;slow world&quot; prior) as premised by Bayesian accounts. Together, this provides an exposition of motion speed and direction estimation, and produces concrete predictions for future neurophysiological experiments. More broadly, we demonstrate the conceptual value of marrying artificial systems with biological characterization, moving beyond &quot;black box&quot; reproduction of an architecture to advance understanding of complex systems, such as the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using an artificial systems approach, we show that physiological properties of motion can result from natural image structure. In particular, we show that the anisotropic distribution of orientations in natural statistics is sufficient to explain the cardinal bias for motion direction. We show that inherent autocorrelation in natural images means that speed and direction are related quantities, which could shape the relationship between speed and direction tuning of MT neurons. Finally, we show that movement speed and image contrast are related in moving natural images, and that motion misperception can be explained by this speed-contrast association not a &quot;slow world&quot; prior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/12/2519?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a forebrain region highly responsive to stress that expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and is implicated in mood disorders, such as anxiety. However, the exact mechanism by which chronic stress induces CRH-mediated dysfunction in BNST and maladaptive behaviors remains unclear. Here, we first confirmed that selective acute optogenetic activation of the oval nucleus BNST (ovBNST) increases maladaptive avoidance behaviors in male mice. Next, we found that a 6 week chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) paradigm resulted in maladaptive behaviors and increased cellular excitability of ovBNST CRH neurons by potentiating mEPSC amplitude, altering the resting membrane potential, and diminishing M-currents (a voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current that stabilizes membrane potential) in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slices. CVMS also increased c-fos&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in ovBNST following handling. We next investigated potential molecular mechanism underlying the electrophysiological effects and observed that CVMS increased CRH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (PACAP; a CRH upstream regulator) cells but decreased striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (a STEP CRH inhibitor) cells in ovBNST. Interestingly, the electrophysiological effects of CVMS were reversed by CRHR1-selective antagonist R121919 application. CVMS also activated protein kinase A (PKA) in BNST, and chronic infusion of the PKA-selective antagonist H89 into ovBNST reversed the effects of CVMS. Coadministration of the PKA agonist forskolin prevented the beneficial effects of R121919. Finally, CVMS induced an increase in surface expression of phosphorylated GluR1 (S845) in BNST. Collectively, these findings highlight a novel and indispensable stress-induced role for PKA-dependent CRHR1 signaling in activating BNST CRH neurons and mediating maladaptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic stress and acute activation of oval bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST) induces maladaptive behaviors in rodents. However, the precise molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chronic variable mild stress activates corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-associated stress signaling and CRH neurons in ovBNST by potentiating mEPSC amplitude and decreasing M-current in male mice. These electrophysiological alterations and maladaptive behaviors were mediated by BNST protein kinase A-dependent CRHR1 signaling. Our results thus highlight the importance of BNST CRH dysfunction in chronic stress-induced disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Memories for past experiences can range from vague recognition to full-blown recall of associated details. Electroencephalography has shown that recall signals unfold a few hundred milliseconds after simple recognition, but has only provided limited insights into the underlying brain networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed a &quot;core recollection network&quot; (CRN) centered on posterior parietal and medial temporal lobe regions, but the temporal dynamics of these regions during retrieval remain largely unknown. Here we used Magnetoencephalography in a memory paradigm assessing correct rejection (CR) of lures, item recognition (IR) and associative recall (AR) in human participants of both sexes. We found that power decreases in the alpha frequency band (10–12 Hz) systematically track different mnemonic outcomes in both time and space: Over left posterior sensors, alpha power decreased in a stepwise fashion from 500 ms onward, first from CR to IR and then from IR to AR. When projecting alpha power into source space, the CRN known from fMRI studies emerged, including posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and hippocampus. While PPC showed a monotonic change across conditions, hippocampal effects were specific to recall. These region-specific effects were corroborated by a separate fMRI dataset. Importantly, alpha power time courses revealed a temporal dissociation between item and associative memory in hippocampus and PPC, with earlier AR effects in hippocampus. Our data thus link engagement of the CRN to the temporal dynamics of episodic memory and highlight the role of alpha rhythms in revealing when and where different types of memories are retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our ability to remember ranges from the vague feeling of familiarity to vivid recollection of associated details. Scientific understanding of episodic memory thus far relied upon separate lines of research focusing on either temporal (via electroencephalography) or spatial (via functional magnetic resonance imaging) dimensions. However, both techniques have limitations that have hindered understanding of when and where memories are retrieved. Capitalizing on the enhanced temporal and spatial resolution of magnetoencephalography, we show that changes in alpha power reveal both when and where different types of memory are retrieved. Having access to the temporal and spatial characteristics of successful retrieval provided new insights into the cross-regional dynamics in the hippocampus and parietal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Previous research suggests that so-called implicit and explicit processes of motor adaptation are implemented by distinct neural structures. Here we tested whether implicit sensorimotor adaptation and strategic re-aiming used to reduce movement error are reflected by spatially distinct EEG oscillatory components. We analyzed beta-band oscillations (~13–30 Hz), which have long been linked to sensorimotor functions, at the time when these adaptive processes intervene for movement planning. We hypothesized that beta-band activity within sensorimotor regions relates to implicit adaptive processes, whereas beta-band activity within medial motor areas reflects deliberate re-aiming. In female and male human volunteers, we recorded EEG in a motor adaptation task in which a visual rotation was introduced in short series of trials separated by unperturbed trials. Participants were instructed in advance about the nature of the visual perturbation and trained to counter it by strategically re-aiming at a neighboring target. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that preparatory beta-band activities within the two regions exhibited different patterns of modulation. Beta power in lateral central regions was attenuated when a change in the visual condition rendered internal-model predictions uncertain. In contrast, beta power in medial frontal regions was selectively decreased when participants strategically re-aimed their reaches. We propose that the reduction in lateral central beta power reflects an increased weighting of peripheral sensory information implicitly triggered when an adaptive change in the sensorimotor mapping is required, whereas the reduction in medial frontal beta-band activity relates to the inhibition of automatic motor responses in favor of cognitively controlled movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Behavioral and modeling studies have proposed that so-called implicit and explicit components of motor adaptation recruit different neural circuits. Here, we investigated whether these different processes are reflected by spatially distinct beta-band activities. Analyzing EEG signals at the time they influence movement planning, during the foreperiod, we found that beta power within lateral central regions was decreased when a change in visual conditions required implicit sensorimotor remapping, which may reflect enhanced sensory processing when internal-model predictions are rendered uncertain. In contrast, beta-band power within medial frontal areas was selectively attenuated when participants deliberately re-aimed their movements to improve task performance, which may be associated with the inhibition of automatic motor responses in favor of cognitively controlled movements.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/12/2485?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We recently developed a rat model of relapse to drug seeking after food choice-induced voluntary abstinence. Here, we used this model to study the role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and its afferent projections in relapse to fentanyl seeking. We trained male and female rats to self-administer palatable food pellets for 6 d (6 h/d) and intravenous fentanyl (2.5 μg/kg/infusion) for 12 d (6 h/d). We assessed relapse to fentanyl seeking after 13–14 voluntary abstinence days, achieved through a discrete choice procedure between fentanyl infusions and palatable food (20 trials/d). In both sexes, relapse after food choice-induced abstinence was associated with increased expression of the activity marker Fos in the OFC. Pharmacological inactivation of the OFC with muscimol plus baclofen (50 + 50 ng/side) decreased relapse to fentanyl seeking. We then determined projection-specific activation of OFC afferents during the relapse test by using Fos plus the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (injected into the OFC). Relapse to fentanyl seeking was associated with increased Fos expression in the piriform cortex (Pir) neurons projecting to the OFC, but not in projections from the basolateral amygdala and thalamus. Pharmacological inactivation of the Pir with muscimol plus baclofen decreased relapse to fentanyl seeking after voluntary abstinence. Next, we used an anatomical disconnection procedure to determine whether projections between the Pir and OFC are critical for relapse to fentanyl seeking. Unilateral muscimol plus baclofen injections into the Pir in one hemisphere plus unilateral muscimol plus baclofen injections into the OFC in the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, hemisphere decreased relapse. Our results identify Pir–OFC projections as a new motivation-related pathway critical to relapse to opioid seeking after voluntary abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; There are few preclinical studies of fentanyl relapse, and these studies have used experimenter-imposed extinction or forced abstinence procedures. In humans, however, abstinence is often voluntary, with drug available in the drug environment but forgone in favor of nondrug alternative reinforcers. We recently developed a rat model of drug relapse after palatable food choice-induced voluntary abstinence. Here, we used classical pharmacology, immunohistochemistry, and retrograde tracing to demonstrate a critical role of the piriform and orbitofrontal cortices in relapse to opioid seeking after voluntary abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA3 has been suggested to shape synaptic transmission and activity-dependent plasticity in endbulb-bushy cell synapses (endbulb synapses) in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, yet the specific roles of GluA3 in the synaptic transmission at endbulb synapses remains unexplored. Here, we compared WT and GluA3 KO mice of both sexes and identified several important roles of GluA3 in the maturation of synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity in endbulb synapses. We show that GluA3 largely determines the ultrafast kinetics of endbulb synapses glutamatergic currents by promoting the insertion of postsynaptic AMPARs that contain fast desensitizing flop subunits. In addition, GluA3 is also required for the normal function, structure, and development of the presynaptic terminal which leads to altered short term-depression in GluA3 KO mice. The presence of GluA3 reduces and slows synaptic depression, which is achieved by lowering the probability of vesicle release, promoting efficient vesicle replenishment, and increasing the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. Surprisingly, GluA3 also makes the speed of synaptic depression rate-invariant. We propose that the slower and rate-invariant speed of depression allows an initial response window that still contains presynaptic firing rate information before the synapse is depressed. Because this response window is rate-invariant, GluA3 extends the range of presynaptic firing rates over which rate information in bushy cells can be preserved. This novel role of GluA3 may be important to allowing the postsynaptic targets of spherical bushy cells in mice use rate information for encoding sound intensity and sound localization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report novel roles of the glutamate receptor subunit GluA3 in synaptic transmission in synapses between auditory nerve fibers and spherical bushy cells (BCs) in the cochlear nucleus. We show that GluA3 contributes to the generation of ultrafast glutamatergic currents at these synapses, which is important to preserve temporal information about the sound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GluA3 contributes to the normal function and development of the presynaptic terminal, whose properties shape short-term plasticity. GluA3 slows and attenuates synaptic depression, and makes it less dependent on the presynaptic firing rates. This may help BCs to transfer information about the high rates of activity that occur at the synapse &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; to postsynaptic targets that use rate information for sound localization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Many tasks demand that information is kept online for a few seconds before it is used to guide behavior. The information is kept in working memory as the persistent firing of neurons encoding the memorized information. The neural mechanisms responsible for persistent activity are not yet well understood. Theories attribute an important role to ionotropic glutamate receptors, and it has been suggested that NMDARs are particularly important for persistent firing because they exhibit long time constants. Ionotropic AMPARs have shorter time constants and have been suggested to play a smaller role in working memory. Here we compared the contribution of AMPARs and NMDARs to persistent firing in the dlPFC of male macaque monkeys performing a delayed saccade to a memorized spatial location. We used iontophoresis to eject small amounts of glutamate receptor antagonists, aiming to perturb, but not abolish, neuronal activity. We found that both AMPARs and NMDARs contributed to persistent activity. Blockers of the NMDARs decreased persistent firing associated with the memory of the neuron's preferred spatial location but had comparatively little effect on the representation of the antipreferred location. They therefore decreased the information conveyed by persistent firing about the memorized location. In contrast, AMPAR blockers decreased activity elicited by the memory of both the preferred and antipreferred location, with a smaller effect on the information conveyed by persistent activity. Our results provide new insights into the contribution of AMPARs and NMDARs to persistent activity during working memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Working memory enables us to hold on to information that is no longer available to the senses. It relies on the persistent activity of neurons that code for the memorized information, but the detailed mechanisms are not yet well understood. Here we investigated the role of NMDARs and AMPARs in working memory using iontophoresis of antagonists in the PFC of monkeys remembering the location of a visual stimulus for an eye movement response. AMPARs and NMDARs both contributed to persistent activity. NMDAR blockers mostly decreased persistent firing associated with the memory of the neuron's preferred spatial location, whereas AMPAR blockers caused a more general suppression. These results provide new insight into the contribution of AMPARs and NMDARs to working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Layer 6 appears to perform a very important role in the function of macaque primary visual cortex, V1, but not enough is understood about the functional characteristics of neurons in the layer 6 population. It is unclear to what extent the population is homogeneous with respect to their visual properties or if one can identify distinct subpopulations. Here we performed a cluster analysis based on measurements of the responses of single neurons in layer 6 of primary visual cortex in male macaque monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt;) to achromatic grating stimuli that varied in orientation, direction of motion, spatial and temporal frequency, and contrast. The visual stimuli were presented in a stimulus window that was also varied in size. Using the responses to parametric variation in these stimulus variables, we extracted a number of tuning response measures and used them in the cluster analysis. Six main clusters emerged along with some smaller clusters. Additionally, we asked whether parameter distributions from each of the clusters were statistically different. There were clear separations of parameters between some of the clusters, particularly for f1/f0 ratio, direction selectivity, and temporal frequency bandwidth, but other dimensions also showed differences between clusters. Our data suggest that in layer 6 there are multiple parallel circuits that provide information about different aspects of the visual stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cortex is multilayered and is involved in many high-level computations. In the current study, we have asked whether there are subpopulations of neurons, clusters, in layer 6 of cortex with different functional tuning properties that provide information about different aspects of the visual image. We identified six major functional clusters within layer 6. These findings show that there is much more complexity to the circuits in cortex than previously demonstrated and open up a new avenue for experimental investigation within layers of other cortical areas and for the elaboration of models of circuit function that incorporate many parallel pathways with different functional roles.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural signals recorded at different scales contain information about environment and behavior and have been used to control Brain Machine Interfaces with varying degrees of success. However, a direct comparison of their efficacy has not been possible due to different recording setups, tasks, species, etc. To address this, we implanted customized arrays having both microelectrodes and electrocorticogram (ECoG) electrodes in the primary visual cortex of 2 female macaque monkeys, and also recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), while they viewed a variety of naturalistic images and parametric gratings. Surprisingly, ECoG had higher information and decodability than all other signals. Combining a few ECoG electrodes allowed more accurate decoding than combining a much larger number of microelectrodes. Control analyses showed that higher decoding accuracy of ECoG compared with local field potential was not because of differences in low-level visual features captured by them but instead because of larger spatial summation of the ECoG. Information was high in the 30–80 Hz range and at lower frequencies. Information in different frequencies and scales was nonredundant. These results have strong implications for Brain Machine Interface applications and for study of population representation of visual stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Electrophysiological signals captured across scales by different recording electrodes are regularly used for Brain Machine Interfaces, but the information content varies due to electrode size and location. A systematic comparison of their efficiency for Brain Machine Interfaces is important but technically challenging. Here, we recorded simultaneous signals across four scales: spikes, local field potential, electrocorticogram (ECoG), and EEG, and compared their information and decoding accuracy for a large variety of naturalistic stimuli. We found that ECoGs were highly informative and outperformed other signals in information content and decoding accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular exercise (CE) is a promising intervention strategy to facilitate cognition and motor learning in healthy and diseased populations of all ages. CE elevates humoral parameters, such as growth factors, and stimulates brain changes potentially relevant for learning and behavioral adaptations. However, the causal relationship between CE-induced brain changes and human's ability to learn remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that CE elicits a positive effect on learning via alterations in brain structure (morphological changes of gray and white matter) and function (functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow in resting state). We conducted a randomized controlled trial with healthy male and female human participants to compare the effects of a 2 week CE intervention against a non-CE control group on subsequent learning of a challenging new motor task (dynamic balancing; DBT) over 6 consecutive weeks. We used multimodal neuroimaging [T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI, and resting state functional MRI] to investigate the neural mechanisms mediating between CE and learning. As expected, subjects receiving CE subsequently learned the DBT at a higher rate. Using a modified nonparametric combination approach along with multiple mediator analysis, we show that this learning boost was conveyed by CE-induced increases in cerebral blood flow in frontal brain regions and changes in white matter microstructure in frontotemporal fiber tracts. Our study revealed neural mechanisms for the CE–learning link within the brain, probably allowing for a higher flexibility to adapt to highly novel environmental stimuli, such as learning a complex task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is established that cardiovascular exercise (CE) is an effective approach to promote learning and memory, yet little is known about the underlying neural transfer mechanisms through which CE acts on learning. We provide evidence that CE facilitates learning in human participants via plasticity in prefrontal white matter tracts and a colocalized increase in cerebral blood flow. Our findings are among the first to demonstrate a transfer potential of experience-induced brain plasticity. In addition to practical implications for health professionals and coaches, our work paves the way for future studies investigating effects of CE in patients suffering from prefrontal hypoperfusion or white matter diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;α2 proteins (&lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1-4&lt;/i&gt;) are auxiliary subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels that also drive synapse formation and maturation. Because cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) predominantly, if not exclusively, express one isoform of this family, α2-2 (&lt;i&gt;Cacna2d2&lt;/i&gt;), we used PCs as a model system to examine roles of α2 in excitatory synaptic function in male and female &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d2&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (KO) mice. Whole-cell recordings of PCs from acute cerebellar slices revealed altered climbing fiber (CF)-evoked complex spike generation, as well as increased amplitude and faster decay of CF-evoked EPSCs. CF terminals in the KO were localized more proximally on PC dendrites, as indicated by VGLUT2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immunoreactive puncta, and computational modeling demonstrated that the increased EPSC amplitude can be partly attributed to the more proximal location of CF terminals. In addition, CFs in KO mice exhibited increased multivesicular transmission, corresponding to greater sustained responses during repetitive stimulation, despite a reduction in the measured probability of release. Electron microscopy demonstrated that mutant CF terminals had twice as many vesicle release sites, providing a morphologic explanation for the enhanced glutamate release. Though KO CFs evoked larger amplitude EPSCs, the charge transfer was the same as wild-type as a result of increased glutamate reuptake, producing faster decay kinetics. Together, the larger, faster EPSCs in the KO explain the altered complex spike responses, which degrade information transfer from PCs and likely contribute to ataxia in &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Our results also illustrate the multidimensional synaptic roles of α2 proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; α2 proteins (&lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1-4&lt;/i&gt;) regulate synaptic transmission and synaptogenesis, but coexpression of multiple α2 isoforms has obscured a clear understanding of how various α2 proteins control synaptic function. We focused on roles of the α2-2 protein (&lt;i&gt;Cacna2d2&lt;/i&gt;), the deletion of which causes cerebellar ataxia and epilepsy in mice and humans. Because cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) only express this single isoform, we studied excitatory climbing fiber synaptic function onto PCs in &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Using optical and electrophysiological analysis, we provide a detailed description of the changes in PCs lacking α2-2, and provide a comprehensive mechanistic explanation for how functional synaptic phenotypes contribute to the altered cerebellar output.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Hair cells in both the auditory and vestibular systems receive efferent innervation. A number of prior studies have indicated that efferent regulation serves to diminish the overall sensitivity of the auditory system. The efferent pathway is believed to affect the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the hair cell by modulating its membrane potential. However, its effect on the mechanical response of the hair cell has not been established. We explored how stimulation of the efferent neurons affects the mechanical responsiveness of an individual hair bundle. We tested this effect on &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; preparations of hair cells in the sacculi of American bullfrogs of both genders. Efferent stimulation routinely resulted in an immediate increase of the frequency of hair bundle spontaneous oscillations for the duration of the stimulus. Enlarging the stimulus amplitude and pulse length, or conversely, decreasing the interpulse interval led to oscillation suppression. Additionally, we tested the effects of efference on the hair bundle response to mechanical stimulation. The receptive field maps of hair cells undergoing efferent actuation demonstrated an overall desensitization with respect to those of unstimulated cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The efferent system is an important aide for the performance of the auditory system. It has been seen to contribute to sound detection and localization, ototoxicity prevention, and speech comprehension. Although measurements have demonstrated that efference suppresses basilar membrane movement, there is still much unknown about how efferent activity affects hearing mechanics. Here, we explore the mechanical basis for the efferent system's capabilities at the level of the hair bundle. We present optical recordings, receptive field maps, and sensitivity curves that show a hair bundle is desensitized by efferent stimulation. This supports the hypothesis that efferent regulation may be a biological control parameter for tuning the hair bundle's mechanical sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Altered synaptic function is thought to play a role in many neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms for synaptic dysfunction. The squid giant synapse (SGS) is a classical model for studying synaptic electrophysiology and ultrastructure, as well as molecular mechanisms of neurotransmission. Here, we conduct a multidisciplinary study of synaptic actions of misfolded human G85R-SOD1 causing familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (fALS). G85R-SOD1, but not WT-SOD1, inhibited synaptic transmission, altered presynaptic ultrastructure, and reduced both the size of the Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles and mobility from the Reserved Pool (RP) to the RRP. Unexpectedly, intermittent high frequency stimulation (iHFS) blocked inhibitory effects of G85R-SOD1 on synaptic transmission, suggesting aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling may underlie G85R-SOD1 toxicity. Ratiometric Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging showed significantly increased presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induced by G85R-SOD1 that preceded synaptic dysfunction. Chelating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; using EGTA prevented synaptic inhibition by G85R-SOD1, confirming the role of aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating G85R-SOD1 toxicity. These results extended earlier findings in mammalian motor neurons and advanced our understanding by providing possible molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in ALS as well as a unique model for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The squid giant synapse presents one of the few mature nervous systems &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; that mimics mammalian neuromuscular junctions, while allowing precise experimental manipulations and live measurement with superior spatial and temporal resolution. Applying these unique features to studying the molecular mechanisms of ALS, a devastating adult-onset neurodegenerative disease without cure, offers clues to understand the pathogenesis of the disease. Our results demonstrating synaptic dysfunction caused by ALS-associated mutant SOD1 protein and its underlying molecular pathways may suggest a novel approach to an effective therapeutic intervention as well as identify biomarkers for early diagnosis. Furthermore, the altered synaptic vesicle behavior and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics revealed through the perturbation of neurotransmission by ALS extends our understanding of fundamental synaptic physiology at both molecular and cellular levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;In the auditory system, the spectrotemporal structure of acoustic signals determines the temporal pattern of spikes. Here we investigated this effect in neurons of the barn owl’s auditory midbrain (&lt;i&gt;Tyto furcata&lt;/i&gt;) that are selective for auditory space and whether it can influence the coding of sound direction. We found that in the nucleus where neurons first become selective to combinations of sound localization cues, reproducibility of spike trains across repeated trials of identical sounds, a metric of across-trial temporal fidelity of spiking patterns evoked by a stimulus, was maximal at the sound direction that elicited the highest firing rate. We then tested the hypothesis that this stimulus-dependent patterning resulted in rate co-modulation of cells with similar frequency and spatial selectivity, driving stimulus-dependent synchrony of population responses. Tetrodes were used to simultaneously record multiple nearby units in the optic tectum (OT), where auditory space is topographically represented. While spiking of neurons in OT showed lower reproducibility across trials compared to upstream nuclei, spike-time synchrony between nearby OT neurons was highest for sounds at their preferred direction. A model of the midbrain circuit explained the relationship between stimulus-dependent reproducibility and synchrony, and demonstrated that this effect can improve the decoding of sound location from the OT output. Thus, stimulus-dependent spiking patterns in the auditory midbrain can have an effect on spatial coding. This study reports a functional connection between spike patterning elicited by spectrotemporal features of a sound and the coding of its location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Spike timing of auditory neurons is modulated by the spectrotemporal structure of sounds. Whether this effect may have implications for coding of sound location remains unresolved. This question was approached in neurons of the owl’s midbrain, where temporal spiking patterns are modulated by the sound’s envelope while firing rate is driven by sound direction. We found that temporal patterns were dependent on binaural cues, leading to stimulus-dependent synchrony of nearby cells. Theoretical analysis showed that stimulus-dependent temporal patterning predicts stimulus-dependent synchrony in nearby cells sharing input with similar spectrotemporal structure, which in turn can sharpen the downstream readout of sound direction. This work shows how stimulus-dependent spike timing can affect the downstream coding of sound location by firing rate, a mechanism that can be generalized to sensory neurons sensitive to the temporal structure of the stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Nicotine use increases the risk for subsequent abuse of other addictive drugs, but the biological basis underlying this risk remains largely unknown. Interactions between nicotine and other drugs of abuse may arise from nicotine-induced neural adaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, a common pathway for the reinforcing effects of many addictive substances. Previous work identified nicotine-induced neuroadaptations that alter inhibitory transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here, we test whether nicotine-induced dysregulation of GABAergic signaling within the VTA increases the vulnerability for benzodiazepine abuse that has been reported in smokers. We demonstrate in rats that nicotine exposure dysregulates diazepam-induced inhibition of VTA GABA neurons and increases diazepam consumption. In VTA GABA neurons, nicotine impaired KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion, depolarized the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; reversal potential, and shifted the pharmacological effect of diazepam on GABA neurons from inhibition toward excitation. In parallel, nicotine-related alterations in GABA signaling observed &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; were associated with enhanced diazepam-induced inhibition of lateral VTA DA neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Targeting KCC2 with the agonist CLP290 normalized diazepam-induced effects on VTA GABA transmission and reduced diazepam consumption following nicotine administration to the control level. Together, our results provide insights into midbrain circuit alterations resulting from nicotine exposure that contribute to the abuse of other drugs, such as benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The connection between brain and behavior is a longstanding issue in the
areas of behavioral science, artificial intelligence, and neurobiology.
Particularly in artificial intelligence research, behavior is generated by a
black box approximating the brain. As is standard among models of artificial
and biological neural networks, an analogue of the fully mature brain is
presented as a blank slate. This model generates outputs and behaviors from a
priori associations, yet this does not consider the realities of biological
development and developmental learning. Our purpose is to model the development
of an artificial organism that exhibits complex behaviors. We will introduce
our approach, which is to use Braitenberg Vehicles (BVs) to model the
development of an artificial nervous system. The resulting developmental BVs
will generate behaviors that range from stimulus responses to group behavior
that resembles collective motion. Next, we will situate this work in the domain
of artificial brain networks. Then we will focus on broader themes such as
embodied cognition, feedback, and emergence. Our perspective will then be
exemplified by three software instantiations that demonstrate how a BV-genetic
algorithm hybrid model, multisensory Hebbian learning model, and multi-agent
approaches can be used to approach BV development. We introduce use cases such
as optimized spatial cognition (vehicle-genetic algorithm hybrid model), hinges
connecting behavioral and neural models (multisensory Hebbian learning model),
and cumulative classification (multi-agent approaches). In conclusion, we will
revisit concepts related to our approach and how they might guide future
development.

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical regions without direct neuronal connections have been observed to
exhibit synchronized dynamics. A recent empirical study has further revealed
that such regions that share more common neighbors are more likely to behave
coherently. To analytically investigate the underlying mechanisms, we consider
that a set of n oscillators, which have no direct connections, are linked
through m intermediate oscillators (called mediators), forming a complete
bipartite network structure. Modeling the oscillators by the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi
model, we rigorously prove that mediated remote synchronization, i.e.,
synchronization between those n oscillators that are not directly connected,
becomes more robust as the number of mediators increases. Simulations are also
carried out to show that our theoretical findings can be applied to other
general and complex networks.

 &lt;p&gt;Adaptive behavior emerges through a dynamic interaction between cognitive
agents and changing environmental demands. The investigation of information
processing underlying adaptive behavior relies on controlled experimental
settings in which individuals are asked to accomplish demanding tasks whereby a
hidden state or an abstract rule has to be learned dynamically. Although
performance in such tasks is regularly considered as a proxy for measuring
high-level cognitive processes, the standard approach consists in summarizing
response patterns by simple heuristic scoring measures. With this work, we
propose and validate a new computational Bayesian model accounting for
individual performance in the established Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. We embed
the new model within the mathematical framework of Bayesian Brain Theory,
according to which beliefs about the hidden environmental states are
dynamically updated following the logic of Bayesian inference. Our
computational model maps distinct cognitive processes into separable,
neurobiologically plausible, information-theoretic constructs underlying
observed response patterns. We assess model identification and expressiveness
in accounting for meaningful human performance through extensive simulation
studies. We further apply the model to real behavioral data in order to
highlight the utility of the proposed model in recovering cognitive dynamics at
an individual level. Practical and theoretical implications of our
computational modeling approach for clinical and cognitive neuroscience
research are finally discussed, as well as potential future improvements.

 &lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is the ventral part of the striatum and the interface between cognition, emotion, and action. It is composed of three major subnuclei: i.e., NAc core (NAcC), lateral shell (NAcLS), and medial shell (NAcMS), which exhibit functional heterogeneity. Thus, determining the synaptic inputs of the subregions of the NAc is important for understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in regulating different functions. Here, we simultaneously labeled subregions of the NAc with cholera toxin subunit B conjugated with multicolor Alexa Fluor, then imaged serial sections of the whole brain with a fully automated slide scanning system. Using the interactive WholeBrain framework, we characterized brain-wide inputs to the NAcC subdomains, including the rostral, caudal, dorsal, and ventral subdomains (i.e., rNAcC, cNAcC, dNAcC, and vNAcC, respectively) and the NAc subnuclei. We found diverse brain regions, distributed from the cerebrum to brain stem, projecting to the NAc. Of the 57 brain regions projecting to the NAcC, the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) exhibited the greatest inputs. The input neurons of rNAcC and cNAcC are two distinct populations but share similar distribution over the same upstream brain regions, whereas the input neurons of dNAcC and vNAcC exhibit slightly different distributions over the same upstream regions. Of the 55 brain regions projecting to the NAcLS, the piriform area contributed most of the inputs. Of the 72 brain regions projecting to the NAcMS, the lateral septal nucleus contributed most of the inputs. The input neurons of NAcC and NAcLS share similar distributions, whereas the NAcMS exhibited brain-wide distinct distribution. Thus, the NAcC subdomains appeared to share the same upstream brain regions, although with distinct input neuron populations and slight differences in the input proportions, whereas the NAcMS subnuclei received distinct inputs from multiple upstream brain regions. These results lay an anatomical foundation for understanding the different functions of NAcC subdomains and NAc subnuclei.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain aging is the critical and common factor among several neurodegenerative disorders and dementia. Cellular, biochemical and molecular studies have shown intimate links between oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction during aging and age-associated neuronal diseases. Brain aging is accompanied by oxidative damage of nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA, and diminished repair. Recent studies have reported epigenetic alterations during aging of the brain which involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) that regulates various systems through distinct mechanisms. However, there are studies which depict differing roles of reactive oxidant species as a major factor during aging. In this review, we describe the evidence to show how oxidative stress is intricately linked to age-associated cognitive decline. The review will primarily focus on implications of age-associated oxidative damage on learning and memory, and the cellular events, with special emphasis on associated epigenetic machinery. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms may provide a perspective on the development of potential therapeutic targets within the oxidative system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Oxytocin, acting through the oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) in the periphery, is best known for its roles in regulating parturition and lactation. However, it is also now known to possess a number of important social functions within the central nervous system, including social preference, memory and aggression, that vary to different degrees in different species. The Oxtr is found in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the brain and research is focusing on how, for example, activation of the receptor in interneurons can enhance the signal-to-noise of neuronal transmission. It is important to understand which neurons in the mouse dorsal hippocampus might be activated during memory formation. Therefore, we examined the colocalization of transcripts in over 5,000 neurons for Oxtr with those for nine different markers often found in interneurons using hairpin chain reaction in situ hybridization on hippocampal sections. Most pyramidal cell neurons of CA2 and many in the CA3 express Oxtr. Outside of those excitatory neurons, over 90% of Oxtr-expressing neurons co-express glutamic acid decarboxylase-1 (Gad-1) with progressively decreasing numbers of co-expressing cholecystokinin, somatostatin, parvalbumin, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, the serotonin 3a receptor, the vesicular glutamate transporter 3, calbindin 2 (calretinin), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons. Distributions were analyzed within hippocampal layers and regions as well. These findings indicate that Oxtr activation will modulate the activity of ~30% of the Gad-1 interneurons and the majority of the diverse population of those, mostly, interneuron types specifically examined in the mouse hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the MAPT gene can lead to disease-associated variants of tau. However, the pathological mechanisms behind these genetic tauopathies are poorly understood. Here, we characterized the aggregation stages and conformational changes of tau C291R, a recently described MAPT mutation with potential pathogenic functions. The C291R variant of the tau four-repeat domain (tau-K18; a functional fragment with increased aggregation propensity compared with the full-length protein), aggregated into a mix of granular oligomers, amorphous and annular pore-like aggregates, in native-state and heparin-treated reactions as observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and negative-stained electron microscopy. On extended incubation in the native-state, tau-K18 C291R oligomers, unlike wild type (WT) tau-K18, aggregated to form protofibrils of four different phenotypes: (1) spherical annular; (2) spherical annular encapsulating granular oligomers; (3) ring-like annular but non-spherical; and (4) linear protofibrils. The ring-like tau-K18 C291R aggregates shared key properties of annular protofibrils previously described for other amyloidogenic proteins, in addition to two unique features: irregular/non-spherical-shaped annular protofibrils, and spherical protofibrils encapsulating granular oligomers. Tau-K18 C291R monomers had a circular dichroism (CD) peak at ~210 nm compared with ~199 nm for tau-K18 WT. These data suggest mutation-enhanced β-sheet propensity. Together, we describe the characterization of tau-K18 C291R, the first genetic mutation substituting a cysteine residue. The aggregation mechanism of tau-K18 C291R appears to involve β-sheet-rich granular oligomers which rearrange to form unique protofibrillar structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization plays key roles in cell cycle progression, the pathogenesis of cancer, and age-related neurodegeneration. Most of our knowledge about the role of phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization and the enzyme catalyzing this reaction, the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (Pin1), is largely limited to proteins not present in neurons. Only a handful of examples have shown that phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization, Pin1 binding, or Pin1-mediated peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization regulate proteins present at excitatory synapses. In this work, I confirm previous findings showing that Pin1 binds postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) and identify an alternative binding site in the phosphorylated N-terminus of the PSD-95. Pin1 associates via its WW domain with phosphorylated threonine (T19) and serine (S25) in the N-terminus domain of PSD-95 and this association alters the local conformation of PSD-95. Most importantly, I show that proline-directed phosphorylation of the N-terminus domain of PSD-95 alters the local conformation of this region. Therefore, proline-directed phosphorylation of the N-terminus of PSD-95, Pin1 association, and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization may all play a role in excitatory synaptic function and synapse development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the most common causative gene for autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson’s disease, encodes a large protein kinase harboring multiple characteristic domains. LRRK2 phosphorylates a set of Rab GTPases in cells, which is enhanced by the Parkinson-associated LRRK2 mutations. Accumulating evidence suggests that LRRK2 regulates intracellular vesicle trafficking and organelle maintenance including Golgi, endosomes and lysosomes. Furthermore, genetic knockout or inhibition of LRRK2 cause lysosomal abnormalities in rodents and primates, and cells from Parkinson’s patients with LRRK2 mutations also exhibit altered lysosome morphology. Cell biological studies on LRRK2 in a diverse cellular context further strengthen the potential connection between LRRK2 and regulation of the endolysosomal system, part of which is mediated by Rab phosphorylation by LRRK2. We will focus on the latest advances on the role of LRRK2 and Rab in relation to the endolysosomal system, and discuss the possible link to the pathomechanism of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides is regarded as the hallmark of neurodegenerative alterations in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. In the eye, accumulation of Aβ peptides has also been suggested to be a trigger of retinal neurodegenerative mechanisms. Some pathological aspects associated with Aβ levels in the brain are synaptic dysfunction, neurochemical remodeling and glial activation, but these changes have not been established in the retina of animals with Aβ accumulation. We have employed the Octodon degus in which Aβ peptides accumulated in the brain and retina as a function of age. This current study investigated microglial morphology, expression of PSD95, synaptophysin, Iba-1 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the retina of juvenile, young and adult degus using immunolabeling methods. Neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were detected using immunogold labeling and glutamate receptor subunits were quantified using Western blotting. There was an age-related increase in presynaptic and a decrease in post-synaptic retinal proteins in the retinal plexiform layers. Immunolabeling showed changes in microglial morphology characteristic of intermediate stages of activation around the optic nerve head (ONH) and decreasing activation toward the peripheral retina. Neurotransmitter expression pattern changed at juvenile ages but was similar in adults. Collectively, the results suggest that microglial activation, synaptic remodeling and neurotransmitter changes may be consequent to, or parallel to Aβ peptide and phosphorylated tau accumulation in the retina.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neonates born premature or who suffer brain injury at birth often have oral feeding dysfunction and do not meet oral intake requirements needed for discharge. Low oral intake volumes result in extended stays in the hospital (&amp;gt;2 months) and can lead to surgical implant and explant of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube). Prior work suggests pairing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with motor activity accelerates functional improvements after stroke, and transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) has emerged as promising noninvasive form of VNS. Pairing taVNS with bottle-feeding rehabilitation may improve oromotor coordination and lead to improved oral intake volumes, ultimately avoiding the need for G-tube placement. We investigated whether taVNS paired with oromotor rehabilitation is tolerable and safe and facilitates motor learning in infants who have failed oral feeding. We enrolled 14 infants [11 premature and 3 hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)] who were slated for G-tube placement in a prospective, open-label study of taVNS-paired rehabilitation to increase feeding volumes. Once-daily taVNS was delivered to the left tragus during bottle feeding for 2 weeks, with optional extension. The primary outcome was attainment of oral feeding volumes and weight gain adequate for discharge without G-tube while also monitoring discomfort and heart rate (HR) as safety outcomes. We observed no adverse events related to stimulation, and stimulation-induced HR reductions were transient and safe and likely confirmed vagal engagement. Eight of 14 participants (57%) achieved adequate feeding volumes for discharge without G-tube (mean treatment length: 16 ± 6 days). We observed significant increases in feeding volume trajectories in responders compared with pre-stimulation (p &amp;lt; 0.05). taVNS-paired feeding rehabilitation appears safe and may improve oral feeding in infants with oromotor dyscoordination, increasing the rate of discharge without G-tube, warranting larger controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model has been one of the most successful electrical interpretation of nerve membrane which led to revolutions in the field of computational neuroscience. On the contrary, experimental observations indicate that, an Action Potential (AP) is accompanied with certain physiological changes in the nerve membrane such as, production and absorption of heat; variation of axon diameter, pressure and length. Although, in the early 1900's a Pressure Wave Theory was proposed by E. Wilke, but, due to lack of sophisticated experimental techniques it was left uncharted. Until recently, when Heimburg-Jackson, Hady-Machta and Rvachev, independently proposed Soliton Theory (thermodynamic interpretation of nerve membrane), Mechanical Surface Waves theory (electro-mechanical interpretation) and Rvachev Model (mechano-electrical activation of voltage gated sodium ion channels) respectively; encouraging a deviation from the traditional HH interpretation with justification for the physical changes in the nerve membrane observed experimentally. But, these theories lead to a “hit and miss” scenario because, they do explain certain features (increase/decrease in axon diameter) but miss to explain, correlation between the strength of stimuli and spike rate of AP. Bio-physical models of nerve membrane are thus important for enhancing our understanding regarding the governing dynamics of neural activities encompassing the experimental observations. A novel theory is proposed here which, unravels vortex ring formation due to ion currents in the intracellular and extracellular region leading to variation of pressure causing the increment/decrement in axon diameter. These formations manifest as membrane oscillations which are used to establish a correlation between the strength of stimuli and spike rate of AP. The theory proposed in this paper, brings a paradigm shift in our understanding of neural dynamics from a thorough bio-physical and physiological perspective with promising applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to modulate behavior and immunity. We recently reported that both short and long-term EE enhance baseline locomotion and alleviate depressive-like behavior, but only long-term EE affects locomotion adversely in a threatening environment and enhances anxiety-like behavior in middle-age mice. We have now investigated whether the observed changes in behavior after short- and long-term EE were associated with underlying immune changes. Hence, at the end of behavioral testing, mice were sacrificed, and brains and cervical lymph nodes were collected to investigate the differential effects of the duration of EE (short- and long-term) on the number of immunopositive glial cells in the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and proportions of T cell subsets in the cervical lymph nodes using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, respectively. EE, regardless of duration, caused an increase in microglia number within the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions, but only long-term EE increased astrocytes number within the dentate gyrus and CA3 hippocampal regions. A significantly higher proportion of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; naive T cells was observed after long-term EE vs. short-term EE. No significant differences were observed in the proportion of central memory and effector memory T cells or early activated CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells between any of the test groups. Our results suggest that EE, irrespective of duration, enhances the numbers of microglia, but long-term EE is required to modify astrocyte number and peripheral T cell proportions in middle-aged mice. Our findings provide new insights into the therapeutic effects of EE on various brain disorders, which may be at least partly mediated by glial and neuroimmune modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;During the past 50 years, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been studied in great detail. A plethora of signaling pathways have been identified that account for synaptic changes based on positive and negative feedback mechanisms. Yet, the biological significance of Hebbian synaptic plasticity (= positive feedback) and homeostatic synaptic plasticity (= negative feedback) remains a matter of debate. Specifically, it is unclear how these opposing forms of plasticity, which share common downstream mechanisms, operate in the same networks, neurons, and synapses. Based on the observation that rapid and input-specific homeostatic mechanisms exist, we here discuss a model that is based on signaling pathways that may adjust a balance between Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Hence, “alterations” in Hebbian plasticity may, in fact, resemble “enhanced” homeostasis, which rapidly returns synaptic strength to baseline. In turn, long-lasting experience-dependent synaptic changes may require attenuation of homeostatic mechanisms or the adjustment of homeostatic setpoints at the single-synapse level. In this context, we propose a role for the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in setting a balance between the ability of neurons to express Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the impact of evolution on the central nervous system has been studied by comparing the sizes of brain regions between species. However, more recent work has demonstrated that environmental factors, such as sensory experience, modulate brain region sizes intraspecifically, clouding the distinction between evolutionary and environmental sources of neuroanatomical variation in a sampled brain. Here, we review how teleost fish have played a central role in shaping this traditional understanding of brain structure evolution between species as well as the capacity for the environment to shape brain structure similarly within a species. By demonstrating that variation measured by brain region size varies similarly both inter- and intraspecifically, work on teleosts highlights the depth of the problem of studying brain evolution using neuroanatomy alone: even neurogenesis, the primary mechanism through which brain regions are thought to change size between species, also mediates experience-dependent changes within species. Here, we argue that teleost models also offer a solution to this overreliance on neuroanatomy in the study of brain evolution. With the advent of work on teleosts demonstrating interspecific evolutionary signatures in embryonic gene expression and the growing understanding of developmental neurogenesis as a multi-stepped process that may be differentially regulated between species, we argue that the tools are now in place to reframe how we compare brains between species. Future research can now transcend neuroanatomy to leverage the experimental utility of teleost fishes in order to gain deeper neurobiological insight to help us discern developmental signatures of evolutionary adaptation from phenotypic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stroke remains a leading cause of death, disability, and medical care burden worldwide. However, transformation from laboratory findings toward effective pharmacological interventions for clinical stroke has been unsatisfactory. Novel evidence has been gained on the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic potential related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in several disorders. The TRP superfamily consists of a diverse group of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable non-selective cation channels. In particular, the members of TRP subfamilies, TRP canonical (TRPC) channels and TRPC6, have been found in different cell types in the whole body and have high levels of expression in the central nervous system (CNS). Notably, the TRPCs and TRPC6 channel have been implicated in neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival during normal development and in a range of CNS pathological conditions. Recent studies have shown that suppression of TRPC6 channel degradation prevents ischemic neuronal cell death in experimental stroke. Accumulating evidence supports the important functions of TRPC6 in brain ischemia. We have highlighted some crucial advancement that points toward an important involvement of TRPCs and TRPC6 in ischemic stroke. This review will make an overview of the TRP and TRPC channels due to their roles as targets for clinical trials and CNS disorders. Besides, the primary goal is to discuss and update the critical role of TRPC6 channels in stroke and provide a promising target for stroke prevention and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Mechanical forces are fundamental regulators of cell behaviors. However, molecular regulation of mechanotransduction remain poorly understood. Here we identified the mechanosensitive channels Piezo1 and Piezo2 as key force sensors required for bone development and osteoblast differentiation. Loss of Piezo1, or more severely Piezo1/2, in mesenchymal or osteoblast progenitor cells, led to multiple spontaneous bone fractures in newborn mice due to inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and increased bone resorption. In addition, loss of Piezo1/2 rendered resistant to further bone loss caused by unloading in both bone development and homeostasis. Mechanistically, Piezo1/2 relayed fluid shear stress and extracellular matrix stiffness signals to activate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx to stimulate Calcineurin, which promotes concerted activation of NFATc1, YAP1 and β-catenin transcription factors by inducing their dephosphorylation as well as NFAT/YAP1/β-catenin complex formation. Yap1 and β-catenin activities were reduced in the Piezo1 and Piezo1/2 mutant bones and such defects were partially rescued by enhanced β-catenin activities.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Action-stopping is a canonical executive function thought to involve top-down control over the motor system. Here we aimed to validate this stopping system using high temporal resolution methods in humans. We show that, following the requirement to stop, there was an increase of right frontal beta (~13 to 30 Hz) at ~120 ms, likely a proxy of right inferior frontal gyrus; then, at 140 ms, there was a broad skeletomotor suppression, likely reflecting the impact of the subthalamic nucleus on basal ganglia output; then, at ~160 ms, suppression was detected in the muscle, and, finally, the behavioral time of stopping was ~220 ms. This temporal cascade supports a physiological model of action-stopping, and partitions it into subprocesses that are isolable to different nodes and are more precise than the behavioral latency of stopping. Variation in these subprocesses, including at the single-trial level, could better explain individual differences in impulse control.</content>

 The clone size distribution of the human naive T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is an important determinant of adaptive immunity. We estimated the abundance of TCR sequences in samples of naive T cells from blood using an accurate quantitative sequencing protocol. We observe most TCR sequences only once, consistent with the enormous diversity of the repertoire. However, a substantial number of sequences were observed multiple times. We detect abundant TCR sequences even after exclusion of methodological confounders such as sort contamination, and multiple mRNA sampling from the same cell. By combining experimental data with predictions from models we describe two mechanisms contributing to TCR sequence abundance. TCRα abundant sequences can be primarily attributed to many identical recombination events in different cells, while abundant TCRβ sequences are primarily derived from large clones, which make up a small percentage of the naive repertoire, and could be established early in the development of the T-cell repertoire.</content>

The identification of structural variants using short-read data remains challenging. Most approaches that use discordant paired-end sequences ignore non-trivial signatures presented by variants containing 3 breakpoints, such as those generated by various copy-paste and cut-paste mechanisms. This can result in lower precision and sensitivity in the identification of the more common structural variants such as deletions and duplications. We present SVXplorer, which uses a graph-based clustering approach streamlined by the integration of non-trivial signatures from discordant paired-end alignments, split-reads and read depth information to improve upon existing methods. We show that SVXplorer is more sensitive and precise compared to several existing approaches on multiple real and simulated datasets.

The nycthemeral transcriptome embodies all genes displaying a rhythmic variation of their mRNAs periodically every 24 hours, including but not restricted to circadian genes. In this study, we show that the nycthemeral rhythmicity at the gene expression level is biologically functional and that this functionality is more conserved between orthologous genes than between random genes. We used this conservation of the rhythmic expression to assess the ability of seven methods (ARSER, Lomb Scargle, RAIN, JTK, empirical-JTK, GeneCycle, and meta2d) to detect rhythmic signal in gene expression. We have contrasted them to a naive method, not based on rhythmic parameters. By taking into account the tissue-specificity of rhythmic gene expression and different species comparisons, we show that no method is strongly favored. The results show that these methods designed for rhythm detection, in addition to having quite similar performances, are consistent only among genes with a strong rhythm signal. Rhythmic genes defined with a standard &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-value threshold of 0.01 for instance, could include genes whose rhythmicity is biologically irrelevant. Although these results were dependent on the datasets used and the evolutionary distance between the species compared, we call for caution about the results of studies reporting or using large sets of rhythmic genes. Furthermore, given the analysis of the behaviors of the methods on real and randomized data, we recommend using primarily ARS, empJTK, or GeneCycle, which verify expectations of a classical distribution of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values. Experimental design should also take into account the circumstances under which the methods seem more efficient, such as giving priority to biological replicates over the number of time-points, or to the number of time-points over the quality of the technique (microarray vs RNAseq). GeneCycle, and to a lesser extent empirical-JTK, might be the most robust method when applied to weakly informative datasets. Finally, our analyzes suggest that rhythmic genes are mainly highly expressed genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XQPboTkpOqc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Pain is a multidimensional experience of sensory-discriminative, cognitive, and affective processes; however, current basic research methods rely heavily on response to threshold stimuli, bypassing the supraspinal processing that ultimately gives rise to the pain experience. We developed the operant plantar thermal assay (OPTA), which utilizes a novel, conflict-based operant task requiring evaluation and active decision-making to obtain reward under thermally aversive conditions to quantify thermal pain tolerance. In baseline measures, male and female mice exhibited similar temperature preferences, however in the OPTA, female mice exhibited greater temperature-dependent tolerance, as defined by choice time spent in an adverse thermal condition to obtain reward. Increasing reward salience (4% vs 10% sucrose solution) led to increased thermal tolerance for males but not females. To determine whether neuropathic and inflammatory pain models alter thermal tolerance, animals with chronic constriction injury (CCI) or complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), respectively, were tested in the OPTA. Surprisingly, neuropathic animals exhibited increased thermal tolerance, as shown by greater time spent in the reward zone in an adverse thermal condition, compared with sham animals. There was no effect of inflammation on thermal tolerance. Administration of clonidine in the CCI model led to increased thermal tolerance in both injured and sham animals. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meloxicam was anti-hyperalgesic in the CFA model, but reduced thermal pain tolerance. These data support the feasibility of using the OPTA to assess thermal pain tolerance to gain new insights into complex pain behaviors and to investigate novel aspects of analgesic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic scaling is a form of synaptic plasticity where individual synapses scale their strengths to compensate for global suppression or elevation of neuronal activity. This process can be studied by measuring miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes and frequencies following the regulation of activity in neuronal cultures. Here we demonstrate a quantitative approach to characterize multiplicative synaptic scaling using immunolabelling of hippocampal neuronal cultures treated with tetrodotoxin or bicuculline to extract scaling factors for various synaptic proteins. This approach allowed us to directly examine the scaling of pre- and postsynaptic scaffolding molecules along with neurotransmitter receptors in primary cultures from mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. We show robust multiplicative scaling of synaptic scaffolding molecules namely, Shank2, PSD95, Bassoon, and AMPA receptor subunits and quantify their scaling factors. We use super-resolution microscopy to calculate scaling factors of surface expressed GluA2 within functional zones of the synapse and show that there is differential and correlated scaling of GluA2 levels within the spine, the postsynaptic density, and the perisynaptic regions. Our method opens a novel paradigm to quantify relative molecular changes of synaptic proteins within distinct subsynaptic compartments from a large number of synapses in response to alteration of neuronal activity, providing anatomical insights into the intricacies of variability in strength of individual synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Here we demonstrate a novel quantitative method based on rank ordered analysis to characterize multiplicative synaptic scaling from immunolabelling of hippocampal neuronal cultures after activity blockade. We show that along with glutamatergic receptors, several scaffolding molecules are scaled after blocking activity. This analysis paradigm can be generalized to any protein which alters its content post plasticity protocols. With the aid of conventional and super-resolution microscopy, we examine pools of AMPA type glutamatergic receptors, and confirm that they are scaled differentially within functional zones of synapses. Furthermore, we show that the AMPA receptor content within the postsynaptic density and perisynaptic compartments are altered differentially during homeostatic scaling, indicating a differential regulation of receptors within various subsynaptic compartments during homeostatic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Newly born neurons express high levels of TUBA1A α-tubulin to assemble microtubules for neurite extension and to provide tracks for intracellular transport. In the adult brain, &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;/i&gt; expression decreases dramatically. A mouse that harbors a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding TUBA1A (&lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; allows us to ask whether TUBA1A is important for the function of mature neurons. α-tubulin levels are about half of wild type in juvenile &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; brains, but are close to normal in older animals. In P0 cultured neurons, reduced TUBA1A allows for assembly of less microtubules in axons resulting in more pausing during organelle trafficking. While &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse behavior is indistinguishable from wild type siblings at weaning, &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice develop adult-onset ataxia. Neurons important for motor function in &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; remain indistinguishable from wild type with respect to morphology and number and display no evidence of axon degeneration. &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction synapses are the same size as wild type before the onset of ataxia, but are reduced in size in older animals. Together, these data indicate that the TUBA1A-rich microtubule tracks that are assembled during development are essential for mature neuron function and maintenance of synapses over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Defects in axonal trafficking have been reported in models of movement disorders, but it has been unclear if trafficking defects are coincident or causative. Our results suggest that deficits in TUBA1A αTubulin can cause trafficking defects that impair synaptic maintenance leading to a movement disorder without axon degeneration or impacting myelination or neuron survival.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Physics deals with Newtonian particles described by position q and momentum
p. The precision of the simultaneous measurement of q and p is limited by the
uncertainty relation ruled by Planck's constant. From the uncertainty relation
all quantum consequences emerge, including entanglement. On the other hand,
Homoclinic Chaos (HC) , that consists of sequences of identical pulses,
unevenly spaced in time, entails a non-Newtonian description. Synchronization
of finite HC spike sequences (SFSS) display quantum features ruled by a
constant different from hbar, yielding entanglement. As a relevant example, we
describe how brain neurons generate HC voltage pulses. SFSS is the way two
different words coded as HC pulses compare their content and extract a
meaningful sequence by exploiting quantum entanglement that lasts over a
de-coherence time in the range of human linguistic processes.

 &lt;p&gt;Cascading large-amplitude bursts in neural activity, termed avalanches, are
thought to provide insight into the complex spatially distributed interactions
in neural systems. In human neuroimaging, for example, avalanches occurring
during resting-state show scale-invariant dynamics, supporting the hypothesis
that the brain operates near a critical point that enables long range spatial
communication. In fact, it has been suggested that such scale-invariant
dynamics, characterized by a power-law distribution in these avalanches, are
universal in neural systems and emerge through a common mechanism. While the
analysis of avalanches and subsequent criticality is increasingly seen as a
framework for using complex systems theory to understand brain function, it is
unclear how the framework would account for the omnipresent cognitive
variability, whether across individuals and/or tasks. To address this, we
analyzed avalanches in the EEG activity of healthy humans during rest as well
as two distinct task conditions that varied in cognitive demands and produced
behavioral measures unique to each individual. In both rest and task conditions
we observed that avalanche dynamics demonstrate scale-invariant
characteristics, but differ in their specific features, demonstrating
individual variability. Using a new metric we call normalized engagement, which
estimates the likelihood for a brain region to produce high-amplitude bursts,
we also investigated regional features of avalanche dynamics. Normalized
engagement showed not only the expected individual and task dependent
variability, but also scale-specificity that correlated with individual
behavior. Our findings expand our understanding of avalanche features and are
supportive of the emerging theoretical idea that the dynamics of an active
human brain operate close to a critical-like region and not a singular
critical-state.

 &lt;p&gt;Sensory predictions by the brain in all modalities take place as a result of
bottom-up and top-down connections both in the neocortex and between the
neocortex and the thalamus. The bottom-up connections in the cortex are
responsible for learning, pattern recognition, and object classification, and
have been widely modelled using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Here, we
present a neural network architecture modelled on the top-down corticothalamic
connections and the behaviour of the thalamus: a corticothalamic neural network
(CTNN), consisting of an auto-encoder connected to a difference engine with a
threshold. We demonstrate that the CTNN is input agnostic, multi-modal, robust
during partial occlusion of one or more sensory inputs, and has significantly
higher processing efficiency than other predictive coding models, proportional
to the number of sequentially similar inputs in a sequence. This increased
efficiency could be highly significant in more complex implementations of this
architecture, where the predictive nature of the cortex will allow most of the
incoming data to be discarded.

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes play a fundamental role in synapse formation, pruning, and plasticity, which are associated with learning and memory. However, the role of astrocytes in learning and memory is still largely unknown. Our previous study showed that astrocyte-specific ephrin-B1 knock-out (KO) enhanced but ephrin-B1 overexpression (OE) in hippocampal astrocytes impaired contextual memory recall following fear conditioning. The goal of this study was to understand the mechanism by which astrocytic ephrin-B1 influences learning; specifically, learning-induced remodeling of synapses and dendritic spines in CA1 hippocampus using fear-conditioning paradigm. While we found a higher dendritic spine density and clustering on c-Fos-positive (+) neurons activated during contextual memory recall in both wild-type (WT) and KO mice, overall spine density and mEPSC amplitude were increased in CA1 neurons of KO compared to WT. In contrast, ephrin-B1 OE in hippocampal astrocytes impaired dendritic spine formation and clustering, specifically on c-Fos(+) neurons, coinciding with an overall decrease in vGlut1/PSD95 co-localization. Although astrocytic ephrin-B1 influenced learning-induced spine formation, the changes in astrocytic ephrin-B1 levels did not affect spine enlargement as no genotype differences in spine volume were observed between trained WT, KO, and OE groups. Our results suggest that a reduced formation of new spines rather than spine maturation in activated CA1 hippocampal neurons is most likely responsible for impaired contextual learning in OE mice due to abundantly high ephrin-B1 levels in astrocytes. The ability of astrocytic ephrin-B1 to negatively influence new spine formation during learning can potentially regulate new synapse formation at specific dendritic domains and underlie memory encoding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dentate granule cells (DGCs), the progeny of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG), must develop and functionally integrate with the mature cohort of neurons in order to maintain critical hippocampal functions throughout adulthood. Dysregulation in the continuum of DGC development can result in aberrant morphology and disrupted functional maturation, impairing neuroplasticity of the network. Yet, the molecular underpinnings of the signaling involved in adult-born DGC maturation including dendritic growth, which correlates with functional integration, remains incompletely understood. Given the high metabolic activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) required to achieve continuous neurogenesis, we investigated the potential regulatory role of a cellular metabolism-linked gene recently implicated in NSC cycling and neuroblast migration, called Four and a half LIM domain 2 (FHL2). The FHL2 protein modulates numerous pathways related to proliferation, migration, survival and cytoskeletal rearrangement in peripheral tissues, interacting with the machinery of the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway, also known to be highly active especially in the hippocampus. Yet, the potential relevance of FHL2 to adult-born DGC development remains unknown. To elucidate the role of FHL2 in DGC development in the adult brain, we first confirmed the endogenous expression of FHL2 in NSCs and new granule cells within the DG, then engineered viral vectors for genetic manipulation experiments, investigating morphological changes in early stages of DGC development. Overexpression of FHL2 during early DGC development resulted in marked sprouting and branching of dendrites, while silencing of FHL2 increased dendritic length. Together, these findings suggest a novel role of FHL2 in adult-born DGC morphological maturation, which may open up a new line of investigation regarding the relevance of this gene in physiology and pathologies of the hippocampus such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is an extremely significant public health issue, since it is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, nevertheless it is still widely undiagnosed because of its devious nature. Glaucoma diagnosis criteria are well-defined and have to be strictly observed and recognized: the earlier the disease is diagnosed, the earlier the patient can undergo the most suitable treatment, the better can be the prognosis. The three levels of prevention are essential in the approach to the disease and its pathophysiological features make it eligible for screening. This review provides an overview of the current state of the art in glaucoma management, starting from its prevention and coming to the hub-and-spoke organization. This model applied to glaucoma aims to direct patients toward professional and not professional figures who may guide them in integrated care pathway. This path should be designed in accordance with best practice to coordinate glaucoma prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow up with the best cost-benefit ratio, protecting both the interests of the patient and of the society.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accurately digitizing the brain at the micro-scale is crucial for investigating brain structure-function relationships and documenting morphological alterations due to neuropathies. Here we present a new Smart Region Growing algorithm (SmRG) for the segmentation of single neurons in their intricate 3D arrangement within the brain. Its Region Growing procedure is based on a homogeneity predicate determined by describing the pixel intensity statistics of confocal acquisitions with a mixture model, enabling an accurate reconstruction of complex 3D cellular structures from high-resolution images of neural tissue. The algorithm’s outcome is a 3D matrix of logical values identifying the voxels belonging to the segmented structure, thus providing additional useful volumetric information on neurons. To highlight the algorithm’s full potential, we compared its performance in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, precision and robustness of 3D neuron reconstructions based on microscopic data from different brain locations and imaging protocols against both manual and state-of-the-art reconstruction tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This article starts by discussing the state of the art in accessible interactive maps for use by blind and visually impaired (BVI) people. It then describes a behavioral experiment investigating the efficacy of a new type of low-cost, touchscreen-based multimodal interface, called a vibro-audio map (VAM), for supporting environmental learning, cognitive map development, and wayfinding behavior on the basis of nonvisual sensing. In the study, eight BVI participants learned two floor-maps of university buildings, one using the VAM and the other using an analogous hardcopy tactile map (HTM) overlaid on the touchscreen. They were asked to freely explore each map, with the task of learning the entire layout and finding three hidden target locations. After meeting a learning criterion, participants performed an environmental transfer test, where they were brought to the corresponding physical layout and were asked to plan/navigate routes between learned target locations from memory, i.e., without access to the map used at learning. The results using Bayesian analyses aimed at assessing equivalence showed highly similar target localization accuracy and route efficiency performance between conditions, suggesting that the VAM supports the same level of environmental learning, cognitive map development, and wayfinding performance as is possible from interactive displays using traditional tactile map overlays. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the VAM for supporting complex spatial tasks without vision using a commercially available, low-cost interface and open the door to a new era of mobile interactive maps for spatial learning and wayfinding by BVI navigators.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One approach to the rehabilitation of navigation impairments is to train the use of compensatory egocentric or allocentric navigation strategies. Yet, it is unknown whether and to what degree training programs can influence strategic navigation preferences. In validating this approach, the key assumption that strategic preference can be changed by using a navigation training was assessed in a group of healthy participants (n = 82). The training program consisted of a psychoeducation session and a software package that included either allocentric or egocentric navigation exercises in virtual environments. Strategic navigation preference, objective and self-reported spatial abilities were assessed in pre- and post-training sessions. Based on their pre-training strategic preference, participants received either the egocentric training (n = 19) or the allocentric training (n = 21) version of the training. These participants engaged in four training sessions over a period of 2–3 weeks. The second group of participants did not use the training software (n = 43) and served as a control group. The results show that 50% of participants that received the egocentric training shifted from an allocentric to and an egocentric strategic preference. The proportion of participants that switched their strategic preference as a result of the allocentric training was identical to this proportion in the control group (19%). The training did not affect objective and self-reported navigation abilities as measured in the pre- and post-training sessions. We conclude that strategic navigation preferences can be influenced by using home-based training in healthy participants. However, using the current approach, only a preference shift from an allocentric to an egocentric navigation strategy could be achieved. The effectiveness of this navigation strategy training should next be assessed in relevant patient populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) refers to the temporary retention and manipulation of information, and its capacity is highly susceptible to training. Yet, the neural mechanisms that allow for increased performance under demanding conditions are not fully understood. We expected that post-training efficiency in WM performance modulates neural processing during high load tasks. We tested this hypothesis, using electroencephalography (EEG) (N = 39), by comparing source space spectral power of healthy adults performing low and high load auditory WM tasks. Prior to the assessment, participants either underwent a modality-specific auditory WM training, or a modality-irrelevant tactile WM training, or were not trained (active control). After a modality-specific training participants showed higher behavioral performance, compared to the control. EEG data analysis revealed general effects of WM load, across all training groups, in the theta-, alpha-, and beta-frequency bands. With increased load theta-band power increased over frontal, and decreased over parietal areas. Centro-parietal alpha-band power and central beta-band power decreased with load. Interestingly, in the high load condition a tendency toward reduced beta-band power in the right medial temporal lobe was observed in the modality-specific WM training group compared to the modality-irrelevant and active control groups. Our finding that WM processing during the high load condition changed after modality-specific WM training, showing reduced beta-band activity in voice-selective regions, possibly indicates a more efficient maintenance of task-relevant stimuli. The general load effects suggest that WM performance at high load demands involves complementary mechanisms, combining a strengthening of task-relevant and a suppression of task-irrelevant processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Early nutritional compromise after preterm birth is shown to affect long-term neurodevelopment, however, there has been a lack of early functional measures of nutritional effects. Recent progress in computational electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has provided means to measure the early maturation of cortical activity. Our study aimed to explore whether computational metrics of early sequential EEG recordings could reflect early nutritional care measured by energy and macronutrient intake in the first week of life. A higher energy or macronutrient intake was assumed to associate with improved development of the cortical activity. We analyzed multichannel EEG recorded at 32 weeks (32.4 ± 0.7) and 36 weeks (36.6 ± 0.9) of postmenstrual age in a cohort of 28 preterm infants born before 32 weeks of postmenstrual age (range: 24.3–32 weeks). We computed several quantitative EEG measures from epochs of quiet sleep (QS): (i) spectral power; (ii) continuity; (iii) interhemispheric synchrony, as well as (iv) the recently developed estimate of maturational age. Parenteral nutritional intake from day 1 to day 7 was monitored and clinical factors collected. Lower calories and carbohydrates were found to correlate with a higher reduction of spectral amplitude in the delta band. Lower protein amount associated with higher discontinuity. Both higher proteins and lipids intake correlated with a more developmental increase in interhemispheric synchrony as well as with better progress in the estimate of EEG maturational age (EMA). Our study shows that early nutritional balance after preterm birth may influence subsequent maturation of brain activity in a way that can be observed with several intuitively reasoned and transparent computational EEG metrics. Such measures could become early functional biomarkers that hold promise for benchmarking in the future development of therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural activity related to language can be modulated within widespread networks following learning or in response to disruption—including the experimental application of noninvasive brain stimulation. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of such modulation remain insufficiently explored. The present study combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the modulation of activity across the language network following continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) of the left pars opercularis. In 10 healthy subjects (21 ± 2 years old, four females), neuronavigated cTBS was delivered over the left pars opercularis of the frontal operculum (part of the traditional Broca’s area) at 80% of active motor threshold (AMT) stimulation intensity. Real cTBS and sham cTBS were performed in two different visits separated by at least 48 h. Before, immediately, and 10 min after cTBS, 30 single pulses of TMS were delivered to the left pars opercularis at 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT), whereas EEG was simultaneously recorded. We examined the cTBS-induced modulation of phase locking values (PLVs) between the TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded over the pars opercularis and those recorded over its right-hemispheric homolog area, the left supramarginal area, and the left superior temporal area in different EEG frequency bands and different time windows following cTBS. cTBS to the left pars opercularis induced within the gamma band: (1) a significant increase in TEP phase synchronization between the left and right pars opercularis at an early time window (250–350 ms) following cTBS; and (2) significantly increased PLV with the left supramarginal area and the left superior temporal area at a later time window (600–700 ms). In the theta and delta band, cTBS to the left pars opercularis induced significantly increased phase synchronization of TEPs between the left pars opercularis and the posterior left hemispheric language areas at a late time window. In sham condition, there was a significant decrease in TEP phase synchronization of the high beta band between left pars opercularis and left superior temporal area at 200–300 ms. These results contribute to characterize the dynamics of the language network and may have implications in the development of noninvasive stimulation protocols to promote the language rehabilitation in aphasia patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Many popular activities are thought by the general public to improve cognitive function. Such expectations can influence how often people engage in these activities, as well as the scientific evaluation of their putative cognitive benefits, e.g., via placebo effects. Here, we gathered survey data about the public’s perceptions of nine different activities commonly thought to be cognitively stimulating, including “brain-training” games. Information was collected about the degree to which participants thought each activity was beneficial for improving cognitive function and how often they engaged in each activity. The patterns of correlation between ratings reveal details about the perception of cognitive benefits and its relation to engagement. They suggest that participants varied with respect to an overarching perception of the entire set of activities, which were perceived also as divided into three clusters. Frequency of engagement and perceived cognitive benefits were positively correlated across participants for each activity considered individually. But, when the activities were compared, the magnitude of their perceived benefits was not a good predictor of their frequency of engagement (and vice versa). Though small, there were systematic demographic differences. Women were more optimistic than men about cognitive benefits. Individual participants differed in the range of their ratings of benefit across activities, and these ranges were greater for younger than older participants, suggesting that perceptions of benefit are more differentiated among the young. Besides contributing to a better understanding of public expectations of cognitive benefits, the findings of this study are relevant to the critical evaluation of such benefits. Our survey can be viewed as providing an interface between expectations held by the general public and the design of studies examining the efficacy of cognitive training. The type of information it provides could be used in the selection of activities performed by an active control group, so that control activities match the treatment intervention as closely as possible with respect to such expectations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;An experience-driven increase in oligodendrocytes and myelin in the somatosensory cortex (S1) has emerged as a new marker of adult cortical plasticity. That finding contrasts with the view that myelin is a structural brake on plasticity, and that contributes to ending the critical period (CP) in the visual cortex (V1). Despite the evidence that myelin-derived signaling acts to end CP in V1, there is no information about myelin changes during adult plasticity in V1. To address this, we quantified the effect of three manipulations that drive adult plasticity (monocular deprivation (MD), fluoxetine treatment or the combination of MD and fluoxetine) on the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in adult rat V1. In tandem, we validated that environmental enrichment (EE) increased cortical myelin by measuring MBP in adult S1. For comparison with the MBP measurements, three plasticity markers were also quantified, the spine markers drebrin E and drebrin A, and a plasticity maintenance marker Ube3A. First, we confirmed that EE increased MBP in S1. Next, that expression of the plasticity markers was affected in S1 by EE and in V1 by the visual manipulations. Finally, we found that after adult MD, MBP increased in the non-deprived V1 hemisphere, but it decreased in the deprived hemisphere, and those changes were not influenced by fluoxetine. Together, the findings suggest that modulation of myelin expression in adult V1 may reflect the levels of visually driven activity rather than synaptic plasticity caused by adult plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Granule cell dispersion (GCD) is a common pathological feature observed in the hippocampus of patients with Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE). Pathomechanisms underlying GCD remain to be elucidated, but one hypothesis proposes aberrant reactivation of neurodevelopmental migratory pathways, possibly triggered by febrile seizures. This study aims to compare the proteomes of basal and dispersed granule cells in the hippocampus of eight MTLE patients with GCD to identify proteins that may mediate GCD in MTLE. Quantitative proteomics identified 1,882 proteins, of which 29% were found in basal granule cells only, 17% in dispersed only and 54% in both samples. Bioinformatics analyses revealed upregulated proteins in dispersed samples were involved in developmental cellular migratory processes, including cytoskeletal remodeling, axon guidance and signaling by Ras homologous (Rho) family of GTPases (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The expression of two Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1, was subsequently explored in immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies involving eighteen MTLE cases with or without GCD, and three normal post mortem cases. In cases with GCD, most dispersed granule cells in the outer-granular and molecular layers have an elongated soma and bipolar processes, with intense RhoA immunolabeling at opposite poles of the cell soma, while most granule cells in the basal granule cell layer were devoid of RhoA. A higher percentage of cells expressing RhoA was observed in cases with GCD than without GCD (P &amp;lt; 0.004). In GCD cases, the percentage of cells expressing RhoA was significantly higher in the inner molecular layer than the granule cell layer (P &amp;lt; 0.026), supporting proteomic findings. In situ hybridization studies using probes against RHOA and RAC1 mRNAs revealed fine peri- and nuclear puncta in granule cells of all cases. The density of cells expressing RHOA mRNAs was significantly higher in the inner molecular layer of cases with GCD than without GCD (P = 0.05). In summary, our study has found limited evidence for ongoing adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of patients with MTLE, but evidence of differential dysmaturation between dispersed and basal granule cells has been demonstrated, and elevated expression of Rho GTPases in dispersed granule cells may contribute to the pathomechanisms underpinning GCD in MTLE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia present in older adults; its etiology involves genetic and environmental factors. In recent years, epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between AD and chronic epilepsy since a considerable number of patients with AD may present seizures later on. Although the pathophysiology of seizures in AD is not completely understood, it could represent the result of several molecular mechanisms linked to amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ) accumulation and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which may induce an imbalance in the release and recapture of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, structural alterations of the neuronal cytoskeleton, synaptic loss, and neuroinflammation. These changes could favor the recurrent development of hypersynchronous discharges and epileptogenesis, which, in a chronic state, favor the neurodegenerative process and influence the cognitive decline observed in AD. Supporting this correlation, histopathological studies in the brain tissue of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients have revealed the presence of Aβ deposits and the accumulation of tau protein in the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), accompanied by an increase of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) activity that may lead to an imminent alteration in posttranslational modifications of some microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), mainly tau. The present review is focused on understanding the pathological aspects of GSK3β and tau in the development of TLE and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Several lines of evidence point to alteration in brain metabolic homeostasis in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), yet the metabolic mechanism in different brain regions underlying PD and LID remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to uncover the metabolic pathways across anatomical regions in the brain of PD and LID. Using an NMR-based metabolomic approach, we generated the metabolomics profiling data from six different brain regions of PD rats and following the onset of LIDs. The diversity of metabolite patterns across the brain and its relation to PD and LID were further investigated through principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate general linear model. Compared with control rats, dopamine loss in PD rats produced a marked and persistent metabolic disturbance in neurotransmitter metabolism and energy pathway, resulting in a metabolic imbalance among different brain regions. In LID rats, levodopa replacement did not restore the midbrain-striatum metabolic crosstalk and metabolic disturbance throughout the brain was involved in levodopa related involuntary movements. Most notably, the midbrain and right cortex were identified as the primary regions of metabolic abnormalities in PD and LID rats. Neurochemical differences in metabolic phenotypes were mainly defined by various neurotransmitters including glutamate, glutamine and aspartate. Accordingly, we found that the PD and LID rats exhibited lower levels of synaptophysin (SYP), a marker for synaptic plasticity, compared with control rats. These findings provide key insights into the metabolic mechanism underlying PD and LID by defining brain-region specific metabolic phenotype, with implications for developing targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One of the pivotal challenges of aging is to maintain independence in the activities of daily life. In order to adapt to changes in the environment, it is crucial to continuously process and accurately combine simultaneous input from different sensory systems, i.e., crossmodal or multisensory integration. With aging, performance decreases in multiple domains, affecting bottom-up sensory processing as well as top-down control. However, whether this decline leads to impairments in crossmodal interactions remains an unresolved question. While some researchers propose that crossmodal interactions degrade with age, others suggest that they are conserved or even gain compensatory importance. To address this question, we compared the behavioral performance of older and young participants in a well-established crossmodal matching task, requiring the evaluation of congruency in simultaneously presented visual and tactile patterns. Older participants performed significantly worse than young controls in the crossmodal task when being stimulated at their individual unimodal visual and tactile perception thresholds. Performance increased with adjustment of stimulus intensities. This improvement was driven by better detection of congruent stimulus pairs, while the detection of incongruent pairs was not significantly enhanced. These results indicate that age-related impairments lead to poor performance in complex crossmodal scenarios and demanding cognitive tasks. Crossmodal congruency effects attenuate the difficulties of older adults in visuotactile pattern matching and might be an important factor to drive the benefits of older adults demonstrated in various crossmodal integration scenarios.

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder defined by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra in the brain. It is associated with cytosolic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. The major component of Lewy bodies is aggregated alpha-synuclein. The molecular mechanism of alpha-synuclein aggregation is not known. Our conceptual model is that alpha-synuclein aggregates due to a dysregulation of its interactions with other protein partners that are required for its biogenesis. In this mini review article, we identified alpha-synuclein interactions using both current literature and predictive pathway analysis. Alterations of these interactions may be crucial elements for the molecular mechanism of the protein aggregation and related pathology in the disease. Identification of alpha-synuclein interactions provides valuable tools to understand PD pathology and find new pharmacological targets for disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with changes in brain functional patterns as well as cognition. The present research sought to investigate longitudinal changes in whole brain functional connectivity strength (FCS) and cognitive performance scores in very old cognitively unimpaired individuals. We studied 34 cognitively normal elderly individuals at both baseline and 4-year follow-up (baseline age = 78 ± 3.14 years) with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (r-fMRI), structural MRI scans, and neuropsychological assessments conducted. Voxel-based whole brain FCS was calculated and we found that bilateral superior parietal and medial frontal regions showed decreased FCS, while the supplementary motor area (SMA) and insula showed increased FCS with age, along with a decrease in bilateral prefrontal cortical thickness. The changes of FCS in left precuneus were associated with an aging-related decline in global cognition. Taken together, our results suggest changes in FCS with aging with the precuneus as a hub and this may underlie changes in global cognition that accompany aging. These findings help better understand the normal aging mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Associative memory is one of the first cognitive functions negatively affected by healthy and pathological aging processes. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are easily administrable tools to support memory. However, the optimal stimulation parameters inducing a reliable positive effect on older adult’s memory performance remain mostly unclear. In our randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, 28 healthy older adults (16 females; 71.18 + 6.42 years of age) received anodal transcranial direct (tDCS), alternating current in the theta range (tACS), and sham stimulation over the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) each once during encoding. We tested associative memory performance with cued recall and recognition tasks after a retention period and again on the following day. Overall, neither tDCS nor tACS showed effects on associative memory performance. Further analysis revealed a significant difference for performance on the cued recall task under tACS compared to sham when accounting for age. Our results suggest that tACS might be more effective to improve associative memory performance than tDCS in higher aged samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Recently, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been described as the earliest at-risk state of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and drawn attention of investigators. Studies suggested that SCD-community individuals may constitute a more vulnerable population than SCD-clinic patients, therefore, to investigate the early changes of the brain may provide guidance for treatment of the disease. We sought to investigate the changes of structure and functional connectivity alternation of the hippocampus in individuals with SCD recruited from the community using structural and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five SCD patients and 32 healthy controls were recruited. Resting-state fMRI data and high-resolution T1-weighted images were collected. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry was used to examine the brain structural changes. We also used the hippocampal tail and the whole hippocampus as seeds to investigate functional connectivity alternation in SCD.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Individuals with SCD showed significant gray matter volume decreases in the bilateral hippocampal tails and enlargement of the bilateral paracentral lobules. We also found that individuals with SCD showed decreased hippocampal tail resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) with the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and decreased whole hippocampus rsFC with the bilateral mPFC and TPJ. These brain region and FC showing significant differences also showed significantly correlation with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Individuals with SCD recruited from the community is associated with structural and functional changes of the hippocampus, and these changes may serve as potential biomarkers of SCD.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;The Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was registered in http://www.chictr.org.cn.

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical activity during jaw movement has been analyzed using various non-invasive brain imaging methods, but the contribution of orofacial sensory input to voluntary jaw movements remains unclear. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe brain activities during a simple teeth tapping task in adult dentulous (AD), older dentulous (OD), and older edentulous subjects who wore dentures (OEd) or did not wear dentures (OE) to analyze their functional network connections. (1) To assess the effect of age on natural activation patterns during teeth tapping, a comparison of groups with natural dentition—AD and OD—was undertaken. A general linear model analysis indicated that the major activated site in the AD group was the primary sensory cortex (SI) and motor cortex (MI) (p &amp;lt; 0.05, family wise error corrected). In the OD group, teeth tapping induced brain activity at various foci (p &amp;lt; 0.05, family wise error corrected), including the SI, MI, insula cortex, supplementary motor cortex (SMC)/premotor cortex (PMA), cerebellum, thalamus, and basal ganglia in each group. (2) Group comparisons between the OD and OEd subjects showed decreased activity in the SI, MI, Brodmann’s area 6 (BA6), thalamus (ventral posteromedial nucleus, VPM), basal ganglia, and insular cortex (p ¡ 0.005, uncorrected). This suggested that the decreased S1/M1 activity in the OEd group was related to missing teeth, which led to reduced periodontal afferents. (3) A conjunction analysis in the OD and OEd/OE groups revealed that commonly activated areas were the MI, SI, cerebellum, BA6, thalamus (VPM), and basal ganglia (putamen; p &amp;lt; 0.05, FWE corrected). These areas have been associated with voluntary movements. (4) Psychophysiological interaction analysis (OEd vs OE) showed that subcortical and cortical structures, such as the MI, SI, DLPFC, SMC/PMA, insula cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, likely function as hubs and form an integrated network that participates in the control of teeth tapping. These results suggest that oral sensory inputs are involved in the control of teeth tapping through feedforward control of intended movements, as well as feedback control of ongoing movements.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Language is sustained by large-scale networks in the human brain. Stroke often severely affects function and network dynamics. However, the adaptive potential of the brain to compensate for lesions is poorly understood. A key question is whether upregulation of the right hemisphere is adaptive for language recovery. Targeting the potential for short-term reorganization in the lesioned brain, we applied 'virtual lesions' over left anterior or posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in post-stroke patients with left temporo-parietal lesions prior to functional neuroimaging. Perturbation of the posterior IFG selectively delayed phonological decisions and decreased phonological activity. The individual response delay was correlated with the upregulation of the lesion homologue, likely reflecting compensation. Moreover, stronger individual tract integrity of the right superior longitudinal fascicle was associated with lesser disruption. Our results provide evidence for functional and structural underpinnings of plasticity in the lesioned language network, and a compensatory role of the right hemisphere.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Previously, we demonstrated that high coverage of piped water in the seven years preceding a parasitological survey was strongly predictive of &lt;i&gt;Schistosomiasis haematobium&lt;/i&gt; infection in a nested cohort of 1,976 primary school children [1]. Here, we report on the prospective follow up of infected members of this nested cohort (N=333) for two successive rounds following treatment. Using a negative binomial regression fitted to egg count data, we found that every percentage point increase in piped water coverage was associated with 4.4% decline in intensity of re-infection (incidence rate ratio = 0.96, 95%CI: 0.93-0.98, P= 0.002) among the treated children. We therefore provide further compelling evidence in support of the scaleup of piped water as an effective control strategy against &lt;i&gt;Schistosomiasis haematobium&lt;/i&gt; transmission.</content>

 Previous research showed that spontaneous neuronal activity presents sloppiness: the collective behavior is strongly determined by a small number of parameter combinations, defined as 'stiff' dimensions, while it is insensitive to many others ('sloppy' dimensions). Here, we analyzed neural population activity from the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats while the brain spontaneously transited through different synchronized and desynchronized states and intermittently received sensory inputs. We showed that cortical state transitions were determined by changes in stiff parameters associated with the activity of a core of neurons with low responses to stimuli and high centrality within the observed network. In contrast, stimulus-evoked responses evolved along sloppy dimensions associated with the activity of neurons with low centrality and displaying large ongoing and stimulus-evoked fluctuations without affecting the integrity of the network. Our results shed light on the interplay among stability, flexibility, and responsiveness of neuronal collective dynamics during intrinsic and induced activity.</content>

 Tremor is currently ranked as the most common movement disorder. The brain regions and neural signals that initiate the debilitating shakiness of different body parts remain unclear. Here, we found that genetically silencing cerebellar Purkinje cell output blocked tremor in mice that were given the tremorgenic drug harmaline. We show in awake behaving mice that the onset of tremor is coincident with rhythmic Purkinje cell firing, which alters the activity of their target cerebellar nuclei cells. We mimic the tremorgenic action of the drug with optogenetics and present evidence that highly patterned Purkinje cell activity drives a powerful tremor in otherwise normal mice. Modulating the altered activity with deep brain stimulation directed to the Purkinje cell output in the cerebellar nuclei reduced tremor in freely moving mice. Together, the data implicate Purkinje cell connectivity as a neural substrate for tremor and a gateway for signals that mediate the disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological diseases, but elucidation of underlying mechanisms is limited experimentally by the inability to damage specific mitochondria in defined neuronal groups. We developed a precision chemoptogenetic approach to target neuronal mitochondria in the intact nervous system in vivo. MG2I, a chemical fluorogen, produces singlet oxygen when bound to the fluorogen-activating protein dL5** and exposed to far-red light. Transgenic zebrafish expressing dL5** within neuronal mitochondria showed dramatic MG2I- and light-dependent neurobehavioral deficits, caused by neuronal bioenergetic crisis and acute neuronal depolarization. These abnormalities resulted from loss of neuronal respiration, associated with mitochondrial fragmentation, swelling and elimination of cristae. Remaining cellular ultrastructure was preserved initially, but cellular pathology downstream of mitochondrial damage eventually culminated in neuronal death. Our work provides powerful new chemoptogenetic tools for investigating mitochondrial homeostasis and pathophysiology and shows a direct relationship between mitochondrial function, neuronal biogenetics and whole-animal behavior.</content>

 The glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) superfamily utilizes a glycyl radical cofactor to catalyze difficult chemical reactions in a variety of anaerobic microbial metabolic pathways. Recently, a GRE, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-4-hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp) dehydratase (HypD), was discovered that catalyzes the dehydration of Hyp to (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C). This enzyme is abundant in the human gut microbiome and also present in prominent bacterial pathogens. However, we lack an understanding of how HypD performs its unusual chemistry. Here, we have solved the crystal structure of HypD from the pathogen &lt;i&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/i&gt; with Hyp bound in the active site. Biochemical studies have led to the identification of key catalytic residues and have provided insight into the radical mechanism of Hyp dehydration.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Hair follicle (HF) development is orchestrated by coordinated signals from adjacent epithelial and mesenchymal cells. In humans this process only occurs during embryogenesis and viable strategies to induce new HFs in adult skin are lacking. Here, we reveal that activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in adjacent epithelial and stromal cells induces new HFs in adult, unwounded dorsal mouse skin. Formation of de novo HFs recapitulated embryonic HF development, and mature follicles produced hair co-occurring with epithelial tumors. In contrast, Hh-pathway activation in epithelial or stromal cells alone resulted in tumor formation or stromal cell condensation respectively, without induction of new HFs. Provocatively, adjacent epithelial-stromal Hh-pathway activation induced de novo HFs also in hairless paw skin, divorced from confounding effects of pre-existing niche signals in haired skin. Altogether, cell-type-specific modulation of a single pathway is sufficient to reactivate embryonic programs in adult tissues, thereby inducing complex epithelial structures even without wounding.</content>

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the aging population. Evidence implicates elevated soluble oligomeric A{beta} as one of the primary triggers during the prodromic phase leading to AD, effected largely via hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. At low, physiological levels (pM-nM), however, oligomeric A{beta} has been found to regulate synaptic plasticity as a neuromodulator. Through mutational analysis, we found a core hexapeptide sequence within the N-terminal domain of A{beta}(N-A{beta}core) accounting for its physiological activity, and subsequently found that the N-A{beta}core peptide is neuroprotective. Here, we characterized the neuroprotective potential of the N-A{beta}core against dysfunction of synaptic plasticity assessed in ex vivo hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 mice, specifically hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). The N-A{beta}core was shown to reverse impairment in synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 model mice, both for LTP and LTD. The reversal by the N-A{beta}core correlated with alleviation of downregulation of hippocampal AMPA-type glutamate receptors in preparations from 5xFAD mice. The action of the N-A{beta}core depended upon a critical di-histidine sequence and involved the PI3 kinase pathway via mTOR. Together, the present findings indicate that the non-toxic N-A{beta}core hexapeptide is not only neuroprotective at the cellular level but is able to reverse synaptic dysfunction in AD-like models, specifically alterations in synaptic plasticity.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is the most common idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, and several reports have suggested that mitochondrial abnormalities are involved in its etiology. We recruited 9 sIBM patients and found significant histological changes and an elevation of growth differential factor 15 (GDF15), a marker of mitochondrial disease, strongly suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction. Bioenergetic analysis of sIBM patient myoblasts revealed impaired mitochondrial function. Decreased ATP production, reduced mitochondrial size and reduced mitochondrial dynamics were also observed in sIBM myoblasts. Cell vulnerability to oxidative stress also suggested the existence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochonic acid-5 (MA-5) increased the cellular ATP level, reduced mitochondrial ROS, and provided protection against sIBM myoblast death. MA-5 also improved the survival of sIBM skin fibroblasts as well as mitochondrial morphology and dynamics in these cells. The reduction in the gene expression levels of Opa1 and Drp1 was also reversed by MA-5, suggesting the modification of the fusion/fission process. These data suggest that MA-5 may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for treating not only mitochondrial diseases but also sIBM.</content>

 Like many forms of long-term synaptic plasticity, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) depends on intracellular Ca2+ signaling for its induction. Yet, all in vitro studies devoted to STDP used abnormally high external Ca2+ concentration. We measured STDP at the CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses under different extracellular Ca2+ concentrations and found that the sign, shape and magnitude of plasticity strongly depend on Ca2+. A pre-post protocol that results in robust LTP in high Ca2+, yielded only LTD or no plasticity in the physiological Ca2+ range. LTP could be restored by either increasing the number of post-synaptic spikes or increasing the pairing frequency. A calcium-based plasticity model in which depression and potentiation depend on post-synaptic Ca2+ transients was found to fit quantitatively all the data, provided NMDA receptor-mediated non-linearities were implemented. In conclusion, STDP rule is profoundly altered in physiological Ca2+ but specific activity regimes restore a classical STDP profile.</content>

 The spinal cord is a fascinating structure responsible for coordinating all movement in vertebrates. Spinal motor neurons control the activity of virtually every organ and muscle throughout the body by transmitting signals that originate in the spinal cord. These neurons are remarkably heterogeneous in their activity and innervation targets. However, because motor neurons represent only a small fraction of cells within the spinal cord and are difficult to isolate, the full complement of motor neuron subtypes remains unknown. Here we comprehensively describe the molecular heterogeneity of motor neurons within the adult spinal cord. We profiled 43,890 single-nucleus transcriptomes using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting to enrich for spinal motor neuron nuclei. These data reveal a transcriptional map of the adult mammalian spinal cord and the first unbiased characterization of all transcriptionally distinct autonomic and somatic spinal motor neuron subpopulations. We identify 16 sympathetic motor neuron subtypes that segregate spatially along the spinal cord. Many of these subtypes selectively express specific hormones and receptors, suggesting neuromodulatory signaling within the autonomic nervous system. We describe skeletal motor neuron heterogeneity in the adult spinal cord, revealing numerous novel markers that distinguish alpha and gamma motor neurons, cell populations that are specifically affected in neurodegenerative disease. We also provide evidence for a novel transcriptional subpopulation of skeletal motor neurons. Collectively, these data provide a single-cell transcriptional atlas for investigating motor neuron diversity as well as the cellular and molecular basis of motor neuron function in health and disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Brain networks can be defined and explored using different types of connectivity. Here, we studied P=48 healthy participants with neuroimaging state-of-the-art techniques and analyzed the relationship between the actual structural connectivity (SC) networks (between 2514 regions of interest covering the entire brain and brainstem) and the dynamical functional connectivity (DFC) among the same regions. To do so, we focused on a combination of two metrics: the first one measures the degree of SC-DFC similarity --i.e. how much functional correlations can be explained by structural pathways-- and the second one, the intrinsic variability of DFC networks across time. Overall, we found that cerebellar networks have smaller DFC variability than other networks in the cerebrum. Moreover, our results clearly evidence the internal structure of the cerebellum, which is divided in two differentiated networks, the posterior and anterior parts, the latter also being connected to the brain stem. The mechanism for keeping the DFC variability low in the posterior part of the cerebellum is consistent with another finding, namely, it exhibits the highest SC-DFC similarity among all other sub-networks, i.e. its structure constrains very strongly its dynamics. On the other hand, the anterior part of the cerebellum, which also exhibits a low level of DFC variability, has the lowest SC-DFC similarity, suggesting very different dynamical mechanisms. It is likely that its connections with the brain stem --which regulates sleep cycles, cardiac and respiratory functioning-- might have a critical role in DFC variations in the anterior part. A lot is known about cerebellar networks, such as having extremely rich and complex anatomy and functionality, connecting to the brainstem, and cerebral hemispheres, and participating in a large variety of cognitive functions, such as movement control and coordination, executive function, visual-spatial cognition, language processing, and emotional regulation. However, as far as we know, our findings of low variability in the dynamical functional connectivity of cerebellar networks and its possible relation with the above functions, have not been reported so far. Further research is still needed to shed light on these findings.</content>

 Adversarial examples are carefully crafted input patterns that are surprisingly poorly classified by artificial and/or natural neural networks. Here we examine adversarial vulnerabilities in the processes responsible for learning and choice in humans. Building upon recent recurrent neural network models of choice processes, we propose a general framework for generating adversarial opponents that can shape the choices of individuals in particular decision-making tasks towards the behavioural patterns desired by the adversary. We show the efficacy of the framework through two experiments involving action selection and response inhibition. We further investigate the strategy used by the adversary in order to gain insights into the vulnerabilities of human choice. The framework may find applications across behavioural sciences in helping detect and avoid flawed choice.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Williams Syndrome (WS) are complex cognitive conditions exhibiting quite opposite features in the social domain: whereas people with ASD are mostly hyposocial, subjects with WS are usually reported as hypersocial. At the same time, ASD and WS share some common underlying behavioral and cognitive deficits. It is not clear, however, which genes account for the attested differences (and similarities) in the socio-cognitive domain. In this paper we adopted a comparative-molecular approach and looked for genes that might be differentially (or similarly) regulated in the blood of people with these conditions. We found a significant overlap between genes dysregulated in the blood of patients compared to neurotypical controls, with most of them being upregulated or, in some cases, downregulated. Still, genes with similar expression trends can exhibit quantitative differences between conditions, with most of them being more dysregulated in WS than in ASD. Differentially-expressed genes are involved in aspects of brain development and function (particularly, dendritogenesis) and are expressed in brain areas (particularly, the cerebellum, the thalamus and the striatum) of relevance for the ASD and the WS etiopathogenesis. Overall, these genes emerge as promising candidates for the similarities and differences between the ASD and the WS socio-cognitive profiles.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Sensorimotor adaptation is driven by sensory prediction errors, the difference between the predicted and actual feedback. When the position of the feedback is made uncertain, adaptation is attenuated. This effect, in the context of optimal sensory integration models, has been attributed to a weakening of the error signal driving adaptation. Here we consider an alternative hypothesis, namely that uncertainty alters the perceived location of the feedback. We present two visuomotor adaptation experiments to compare these hypotheses, varying the size and uncertainty of a visual error signal. Uncertainty attenuated learning when the error size was small but had no effect when the error size was large. This pattern of results favors the hypothesis that uncertainty does not impact the strength of the error signal, but rather, leads to mis-localization of the error. We formalize these ideas to offer a novel perspective on the effect of visual uncertainty on implicit sensorimotor adaptation.</content>

 Theta oscillations play a major role in temporarily defining the hippocampal rate code by translating behavioural sequences into neuronal representations. However, mechanisms constraining phase timing and cell-type specific phase preference are unknown. Here, we employ computational models tuned with evolutionary algorithms to evaluate phase preference of individual CA1 pyramidal cells recorded in mice and rats not engaged in any particular memory task. We applied unbiased and hypothesis-free approaches to identify effects of intrinsic and synaptic factors, as well as cell morphology, in determining phase preference. We found that perisomatic inhibition delivered by complementary populations of basket cells interacts with input pathways to shape phase-locked specificity of deep and superficial pyramidal cells. Somatodendritic integration of fluctuating glutamatergic inputs defined cycle-by-cycle by unsupervised methods demonstrated that firing selection is tuneable across sublayers. Our data identify different mechanisms of phase-locking selectivity that are instrumental for flexible dynamical representations of theta sequences.</content>

Estimation of pathogenic life-history values, for instance the duration a pathogen is retained in an insect vector (i.e., retention period) is of particular importance for understanding plant disease epidemiology. How can we extract values for these epidemiological parameters from conventional small-scale laboratory experiments in which transmission success is measured in relation to durations of vector access to host plants? We provide a solution to this problem by deriving formulae for the empirical curves that these experiments produce, called access period response curves (i.e., transmission success vs access period). We do this by writing simple equations for the fundamental life-cycle components of insect vectors in the laboratory. We then infer values of epidemiological parameters by matching the theoretical and empirical gradients of access period response curves. Using the example of &lt;i&gt;Cassava brown streak virus&lt;/i&gt; (CBSV), which has emerged in sub-Saharan Africa and now threatens regional food security, we illustrate the method of matching gradients. We show how applying the method to published data produces a new understanding of CBSV through the inference of retention period, acquisition period and inoculation period parameters. We found that CBSV is retained for a far shorter duration in its insect vector (&lt;i&gt;Bemisia tabaci&lt;/i&gt; whitefly) than had previously been assumed. Our results shed light on a number of critical factors that may be responsible for the transition of CBSV from sub- to super-threshold &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in sub-Saharan Africa. The method is applicable to plant pathogens in general, to supply epidemiological parameter estimates that are crucial for practical management of epidemics and prediction of pandemic risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mW3kcWMn1Tg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Autism is still diagnosed on the basis of subjective assessments of elusive notions such as interpersonal contact and social reciprocity. We propose to decompose reciprocal social interactions in their basic computational constituents. Specifically, we test the assumption that autistic individuals disregard information regarding the stakes of social interactions when adapting to others. We compared 24 adult autistic participants to 24 neurotypical (NT) participants engaging in a repeated dyadic competitive game against artificial agents with calibrated reciprocal adaptation capabilities. Critically, participants were framed to believe either that they were competing against somebody else or that they were playing a gambling game. Only the NT participants did alter their adaptation strategy when they held information regarding others' competitive incentives, in which case they outperformed the AS group. Computational analyses of trial-by-trial choice sequences show that the behavioural repertoire of autistic people exhibits subnormal flexibility and mentalizing sophistication, especially when information regarding opponents’ incentives was available. These two computational phenotypes yield 79% diagnosis classification accuracy and explain 62% of the severity of social symptoms in autistic participants. Such computational decomposition of the autistic social phenotype may prove relevant for drawing novel diagnostic boundaries and guiding individualized clinical interventions in autism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/maqMjNM0JuM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Networks based on coordinated spike coding can encode information with high efficiency in the spike trains of individual neurons. These networks exhibit single-neuron variability and tuning curves as typically observed in cortex, but paradoxically coincide with a precise, non-redundant spike-based population code. However, it has remained unclear whether the specific synaptic connectivities required in these networks can be learnt with local learning rules. Here, we show how to learn the required architecture. Use coding efficiency as an objective, we derive spike-timing-dependent learning rules for a recurrent neural network, and we provide exact solutions for the networks’ convergence to an optimal state. As a result, we deduce an entire network from its input distribution and a firing cost. After learning, basic biophysical quantities such as voltages, firing thresholds, excitation, inhibition, or spikes acquire precise functional interpretations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JZqRdXgZFOI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The circadian clock orchestrates biological processes so that they occur at specific times of the day, thereby facilitating adaptation to diurnal and seasonal environmental changes. In plants, mathematical modelling has been comprehensively integrated with experimental studies to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the complex genetic regulatory network comprising the clock. However, with an increasing number of circadian genes being discovered, there is a pressing need for methods facilitating the expansion of computational models to incorporate these newly-discovered components. Conventionally, plant clock models have comprised differential equation systems based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, the difficulties associated with modifying interactions using this approach—and the concomitant problem of robustly identifying regulation types—has contributed to a complexity bottleneck, with quantitative fits to experimental data rapidly becoming computationally intractable for models possessing more than ≈50 parameters. Here, we address these issues by constructing the first plant clock models based on the S-System formalism originally developed by Savageau for analysing biochemical networks. We show that despite its relative simplicity, this approach yields clock models with comparable accuracy to the conventional Michaelis-Menten formalism. The S-System formulation also confers several key advantages in terms of model construction and expansion. In particular, it simplifies the inclusion of new interactions, whilst also facilitating the modification of regulation types, thereby making it well-suited to network inference. Furthermore, S-System models mitigate the issue of parameter identifiability. Finally, by applying linear systems theory to the models considered, we provide some justification for the increased use of aggregated protein equations in recent plant clock modelling, replacing the separate cytoplasmic/nuclear protein compartments that were characteristic of the earlier models. We conclude that as well as providing a simplified framework for model development, the S-System formalism also possesses significant potential as a robust modelling method for designing synthetic gene circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IwQR4sEYASY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

With the improvement of -omics and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, along with the lowered cost of generating these types of data, the analysis of high-throughput biological data has become standard both for forming and testing biomedical hypotheses. Our knowledge of how to normalize datasets to remove latent undesirable variances has grown extensively, making for standardized data that are easily compared between studies. Here we present the CAncer bioMarker Prediction Pipeline (CAMPP), an open-source R-based wrapper (https://github.com/ELELAB/CAncer-bioMarker-Prediction-Pipeline -CAMPP) intended to aid bioinformatic software-users with data analyses. CAMPP is called from a terminal command line and is supported by a user-friendly manual. The pipeline may be run on a local computer and requires little or no knowledge of programming. To avoid issues relating to R-package updates, a renv .lock file is provided to ensure R-package stability. Data-management includes missing value imputation, data normalization, and distributional checks. CAMPP performs (I) k-means clustering, (II) differential expression/abundance analysis, (III) elastic-net regression, (IV) correlation and co-expression network analyses, (V) survival analysis, and (VI) protein-protein/miRNA-gene interaction networks. The pipeline returns tabular files and graphical representations of the results. We hope that CAMPP will assist in streamlining bioinformatic analysis of quantitative biological data, whilst ensuring an appropriate bio-statistical framework.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4tX46Deg1pQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The high-resolution and mass accuracy of Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT-MS) has made it an increasingly popular technique for discerning the composition of soil, plant and aquatic samples containing complex mixtures of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, lignins, hydrocarbons, phytochemicals and other compounds. Thus, there is a growing demand for informatics tools to analyze FT-MS data that will aid investigators seeking to understand the availability of carbon compounds to biotic and abiotic oxidation and to compare fundamental chemical properties of complex samples across groups. We present &lt;i&gt;ftmsRanalysis&lt;/i&gt;, an R package which provides an extensive collection of data formatting and processing, filtering, visualization, and sample and group comparison functionalities. The package provides a suite of plotting methods and enables expedient, flexible and interactive visualization of complex datasets through functions which link to a powerful and interactive visualization user interface, Trelliscope. Example analysis using FT-MS data from a soil microbiology study demonstrates the core functionality of the package and highlights the capabilities for producing interactive visualizations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/juwxkf7JGCY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Coordinated motion and collective decision-making in fish schools result from complex interactions by which individuals integrate information about the behavior of their neighbors. However, little is known about how individuals integrate this information to take decisions and control their motion. Here, we combine experiments with computational and robotic approaches to investigate the impact of different strategies for a fish to interact with its neighbors on collective swimming in groups of rummy-nose tetra (&lt;i&gt;Hemigrammus rhodostomus&lt;/i&gt;). By means of a data-based agent model describing the interactions between pairs of &lt;i&gt;H. rhodostomus&lt;/i&gt; (Calovi &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;., 2018), we show that the simple addition of the pairwise interactions with two neighbors quantitatively reproduces the collective behavior observed in groups of five fish. Increasing the number of interacting neighbors does not significantly improve the simulation results. Remarkably, and even without confinement, we find that groups remain cohesive and polarized when each agent interacts with only one of its neighbors: the one that has the strongest contribution to the heading variation of the focal agent, dubbed as the “most influential neighbor”. However, group cohesion is lost when each agent only interacts with its nearest neighbor. We then investigate by means of a robotic platform the collective motion in groups of five robots. Our platform combines the implementation of the fish behavioral model and a control system to deal with real-world physical constraints. A better agreement with experimental results for fish is obtained for groups of robots only interacting with their most influential neighbor, than for robots interacting with one or even two nearest neighbors. Finally, we discuss the biological and cognitive relevance of the notion of “most influential neighbors”. Overall, our results suggest that fish have to acquire only a minimal amount of information about their environment to coordinate their movements when swimming in groups.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EH6md4iZAiw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Complex, highly-computational, individual-based models are abundant in epidemiology. For epidemics such as macro-parasitic diseases, detailed modelling of human behaviour and pathogen life-cycle are required in order to produce accurate results. This can often lead to models that are computationally-expensive to analyse and perform model fitting, and often require many simulation runs in order to build up sufficient statistics. Emulation can provide a more computationally-efficient output of the individual-based model, by approximating it using a statistical model. Previous work has used Gaussian processes (GPs) in order to achieve this, but these can not deal with multi-modal, heavy-tailed, or discrete distributions. Here, we introduce the concept of a mixture density network (MDN) in its application in the emulation of epidemiological models. MDNs incorporate both a mixture model and a neural network to provide a flexible tool for emulating a variety of models and outputs. We develop an MDN emulation methodology and demonstrate its use on a number of simple models incorporating both normal, gamma and beta distribution outputs. We then explore its use on the stochastic SIR model to predict the final size distribution and infection dynamics. MDNs have the potential to faithfully reproduce multiple outputs of an individual-based model and allow for rapid analysis from a range of users. As such, an open-access library of the method has been released alongside this manuscript.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fHA23vtdYcU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) inhibit small-conductance calcium-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (SK channels) and enhance synaptic weight via this mechanism. SK channels are also involved in activity-dependent plasticity of membrane excitability (&quot;intrinsic plasticity&quot;). Here, we investigate whether mAChR activation can drive SK channel-dependent intrinsic plasticity in L2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from these neurons in slices prepared from mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we find that brief bath application of the mAChR agonist oxotremorine-m (oxo-m) causes long-term enhancement of excitability in wild-type mice that is not observed in mice deficient of SK channels of the SK2 isoform. Similarly, repeated injection of depolarizing current pulses into the soma triggers intrinsic plasticity that is absent from SK2 null mice. Intrinsic plasticity lowers spike frequency adaptation and attenuation of spike firing upon prolonged activation, consistent with SK channel modulation. Depolarization-induced plasticity is prevented by bath application of the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89, and the casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitor TBB, respectively. These findings point toward a recruitment of two known signaling pathways in SK2 regulation: SK channel trafficking (PKA) and reduction of the calcium sensitivity (CK2). Using mice with an inactivation of CaMKII (T305D mice), we show that intrinsic plasticity does not require CaMKII. Finally, we demonstrate that repeated injection of depolarizing pulses in the presence of oxo-m causes intrinsic plasticity that surpasses the plasticity amplitude reached by either manipulation alone. Our findings show that muscarinic activation enhances membrane excitability in L2/3 pyramidal neurons via a downregulation of SK2 channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Endocannabinoid signaling system (ECS), encompassing cannabinoid receptors and enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of the endogenous cannabinoid signaling lipids, is highly expressed in the cerebellar cortex of adult humans and rodents. In addition to their well-established role in neuromodulation, endocannabinoids (eCBs) have been shown to play key roles in aspects of neurodevelopment in the fore- and mid-brain, including neurogenesis, cell migration, and synapse specification. However, little is known about the role of ECS in cerebellar development. In this study we carried out immunohistochemical characterization of ECS components through key stages of cerebellar development in mice utilizing antibodies for 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthetizing and degrading enzymes and the major brain cannabinoid receptor, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), in combination with cerebellar cell markers. Our results reveal a temporally, spatially, and cytologically dynamic pattern of expression. Production, receptor binding, and degradation of eCBs are tightly controlled, thus localization of eCB receptors and the complementary cannabinoid signaling machinery determines the direction, duration, and ultimately the outcome of eCB signaling. To gain insights into the role of eCB signaling in cerebellar development, we characterized gross anatomy of cerebellar midvermis in CB1 knockout (CB1 KO) mice, as well as their performance in cerebellar-influenced motor tasks. Our results show persistent and selective anatomical and behavioral alterations in CB1 KOs. Consequently, the insights gained from this study lay down the foundation for investigating specific cellular and molecular mechanisms regulated by eCB signaling during cerebellar development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE&lt;/b&gt; In this study we show that components of the endocannabinoid signaling system are prominently expressed in the perinatal (E17.5-P14) mouse hindbrain. Our comprehensive characterization highlights developmentally dynamic and spatially restricted expression of cannabinoid receptor 1, prominent at birth in pontocerebellar axons, and later in migrating and differentiating anterior vermis granule cells. We identify the role of Purkinje cells in the regulation of endocannabinoid 2-AG availability, since they express both catabolic and anabolic enzymes DAGLα and MAGL. Furthermore, we demonstrate a requirement for endocannabinoid signaling in the regulation of pontocerebellar axon distribution and of postnatal cerebellar growth. CB1 knockouts exhibit impairments in cerebellar-influenced fine-motor, but not gross-motor behaviors. Together, these results illuminate a previously unrecognized role of endocannabinoid signaling in the regulation of cerebellar development and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;A variety of electrical synapses are capable of activity-dependent plasticity, including both activity-dependent potentiation and activity-dependent depression. In several types of neurons, activity-dependent electrical synapse plasticity depends on changes in the local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; environment. To enable study of local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling that regulates plasticity, we developed a GCaMP Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; biosensor fused to the electrical synapse protein Connexin 36. Cx36-GCaMP transfected into mammalian cell cultures formed gap junctions at cell-cell boundaries and supported Neurobiotin tracer coupling that was regulated by protein kinase A signaling in the same way as Cx36. Cx36-GCaMP gap junctions robustly reported local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increases in response to addition of a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ionophore with increases in fluorescence that recovered during washout. Recovery was strongly dependent on Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchange activity. In cells transfected with NMDA receptor subunits, Cx36-GCaMP revealed transient and concentration-dependent increases in local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; upon brief application of glutamate. In HeLa cells, glutamate application increased Cx36-GCaMP tracer coupling through a mechanism that depended in part on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity. This potentiation of coupling did not require exogenous expression of glutamate receptors, but could be accomplished by endogenously expressed glutamate receptors with pharmacological characteristics reminiscent of NMDA and Kainate receptors. Analysis of RNA Sequencing data from HeLa cells confirmed expression of NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2C and NR3B. In summary, Cx36-GCaMP is an effective tool to measure changes in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; microenvironment around Cx36 gap junctions. Furthermore, HeLa cells can serve as a model system to study glutamate receptor-driven potentiation of electrical synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; We have developed a Connexin 36-GCaMP3 fusion construct that effectively reports the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; microenvironment in the vicinity of Cx36 gap junctions. This tool will be valuable to investigate the dynamic changes in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that are responsible for some forms of electrical synapse plasticity. Furthermore, we have discovered that a widely used model system for in vitro studies, the HeLa cell, endogenously expresses glutamate receptors that effectively drive intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II signaling. This signaling can be exploited in many types of studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Computational modeling is becoming a widely used methodology in modern
neuroscience. However, as the complexity of the phenomena under study
increases, the analysis of the results emerging from the simulations
concomitantly becomes more challenging. In particular, the configuration and
validation of brain circuits involving learning often require the processing of
large amounts of action potentials and their comparison to the stimulation
being presented to the input of the system. In this study we present a
systematic work-flow for the configuration of spiking-neuronal-network-based
learning systems including evolutionary algorithms for information transmission
optimization, advanced visualization tools for the validation of the best
suitable configuration and customized scripts for final quantitative evaluation
of the learning capabilities. By integrating both grouped action potential
information and stimulation-related events, the proposed visualization
framework provides qualitatively assessment of the evolution of the learning
process in the simulation under study. The proposed work-flow has been used to
study how receptive fields emerge in a network of inhibitory interneurons with
excitatory and inhibitory spike-timing dependent plasticity when it is exposed
to repetitive and partially overlapped stimulation patterns. According to our
results, the output population reliably detected the presence of the
stimulation patterns, even when the fan-in ratio of the interneurons was
considerably restricted.

 &lt;p&gt;In the visual decoding domain, visually reconstructing presented images given
the corresponding human brain activity monitored by functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) is difficult, especially when reconstructing viewed
natural images. Visual reconstruction is a conditional image generation on fMRI
data and thus generative adversarial network (GAN) for natural image generation
is recently introduced for this task. Although GAN-based methods have greatly
improved, the fidelity and naturalness of reconstruction are still
unsatisfactory due to the small number of fMRI data samples and the instability
of GAN training. In this study, we proposed a new GAN-based Bayesian visual
reconstruction method (GAN-BVRM) that includes a classifier to decode
categories from fMRI data, a pre-trained conditional generator to generate
natural images of specified categories, and a set of encoding models and
evaluator to evaluate generated images. GAN-BVRM employs the pre-trained
generator of the prevailing BigGAN to generate masses of natural images, and
selects the images that best matches with the corresponding brain activity
through the encoding models as the reconstruction of the image stimuli. In this
process, the semantic and detailed contents of reconstruction are controlled by
decoded categories and encoding models, respectively. GAN-BVRM used the
Bayesian manner to avoid contradiction between naturalness and fidelity from
current GAN-based methods and thus can improve the advantages of GAN.
Experimental results revealed that GAN-BVRM improves the fidelity and
naturalness, that is, the reconstruction is natural and similar to the
presented image stimuli.

 &lt;p&gt;The macroscopic dynamics of large populations of neurons can be
mathematically analyzed using low-dimensional firing-rate or neural-mass
models. However, these models fail to capture spike synchronization effects of
stochastic spiking neurons such as the non-stationary population response to
rapidly changing stimuli. Here, we derive low-dimensional firing-rate models
for homogeneous populations of general renewal-type neurons, including
integrate-and-fire models driven by white noise. Renewal models account for
neuronal refractoriness and spike synchronization dynamics. The derivation is
based on an eigenmode expansion of the associated refractory density equation,
which generalizes previous spectral methods for Fokker-Planck equations to
arbitrary renewal models. We find a simple relation between the eigenvalues,
which determine the characteristic time scales of the firing rate dynamics, and
the Laplace transform of the interspike interval density or the survival
function of the renewal process. Analytical expressions for the Laplace
transforms are readily available for many renewal models including the leaky
integrate-and-fire model. Retaining only the first eigenmode yields already an
adequate low-dimensional approximation of the firing-rate dynamics that
captures spike synchronization effects and fast transient dynamics at stimulus
onset. We explicitly demonstrate the validity of our model for a large
homogeneous population of Poisson neurons with absolute refractoriness, and
other renewal models that admit an explicit analytical calculation of the
eigenvalues. The here presented eigenmode expansion provides a systematic
framework for novel firing-rate models in computational neuroscience based on
spiking neuron dynamics with refractoriness.

 &lt;p&gt;Interruptions (interfering stimuli to respond to) and distractions (interfering stimuli to be ignored) have been shown to negatively impact performance, particularly in tasks requiring working memory (WM). This study investigated how these two types of external interference affect task performance and attentional and WM processes as indexed by specific event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG. A Continuous Number Task (CNT) was applied, in which participants had to either decide whether the current number (condition without WM load) or the sum of the current and the preceding number (condition with WM load) was odd or even while responding to interlaced single letters (interruptions) or ignoring them (distractions). Contrary to previous research, we did not find external interference to affect performance under WM load. Unexpectedly, our results rather show that performance was significantly improved in trials after distractions compared to before. This effect was reflected particularly in a significantly increased P3 mean amplitude indicating enhanced attentional reallocation to task-relevant stimuli. Interestingly, this P3 effect appeared independent of WM load and also following interruptions. This underpins the account of P3 amplitudes being modulated by the interval between two task-relevant stimuli rather than by overall task-difficulty. Moreover, a pronounced fronto-central and posterior slow wave following interference suggest more control resources to maintain task-relevant stimuli in WM independent of the preceding interfering stimulus. Our results thus suggest that the type and foreknowledge of external interference may modulate the amount of interference and may also facilitate resource preparation under WM load.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Malpighian tubules have low rates of cell turnover but are vulnerable to damage caused by stones, like their mammalian counterparts, kidneys. We show that &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; renal stem cells (RSCs) in the ureter and lower tubules comprise a unique, unipotent regenerative compartment. RSCs respond only to loss of nearby principal cells (PCs), cells critical for maintaining ionic balance. Large polyploid PCs are outnumbered by RSCs, which replace each lost cell with multiple PCs of lower ploidy. Notably, RSCs do not replenish principal cells or stellate cells in the upper tubules. RSCs generate daughters by asymmetric Notch signaling, yet RSCs remain quiescent (cell cycle-arrested) without damage. Nevertheless, the capacity for RSC-mediated repair extends the lifespan of flies carrying kidney stones. We propose that abundant, RSC-like stem cells exist in other tissues with low rates of turnover where they may have been mistaken for differentiated tissue cells.</content>

 The inability of cells to adapt to increased environmental tonicity can lead to inflammatory gene expression and pathogenesis. The Rel family of transcription factors TonEBP and NF-κB p65 play critical roles in the switch from osmoadaptive homeostasis to inflammation, respectively. Here we identified PACT-mediated PKR kinase activation as a marker of the termination of adaptation and initiation of inflammation in &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; embryonic fibroblasts. We found that high stress-induced PACT-PKR activation inhibits the interaction between NF-κB c-Rel and TonEBP essential for the increased expression of TonEBP-dependent osmoprotective genes. This resulted in enhanced formation of TonEBP/NF-κB p65 complexes and enhanced proinflammatory gene expression. These data demonstrate a novel role of c-Rel in the adaptive response to hyperosmotic stress, which is inhibited via a PACT/PKR-dependent dimer redistribution of the Rel family transcription factors. Our results suggest that inhibiting PACT-PKR signaling may prove a novel target for alleviating stress-induced inflammatory diseases.</content>

 Establishing appropriate sizes and shapes of dendritic arbors is critical for proper wiring of the central nervous system. Here we report that Insulin-like Peptide 2 (DILP2) locally activates transiently expressed insulin receptors in the central dendrites of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Dm8 amacrine neurons to positively regulate dendritic field elaboration. We found DILP2 was expressed in L5 lamina neurons, which have axonal terminals abutting Dm8 dendrites. Proper Dm8 dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation required insulin signaling through TOR (target of rapamycin) and SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein), acting in parallel with previously identified negative regulation by Activin signaling to provide robust control of Dm8 dendrite elaboration. A simulation of dendritic growth revealed trade-offs between dendritic field size and robustness when branching and terminating kinetic parameters were constant, but dynamic modulation of the parameters could mitigate these trade-offs. We suggest that antagonistic DILP2 and Activin signals from different afferents appropriately size Dm8 dendritic fields.</content>

 Microglia cells are the main mediators of neuroinflammation. Activation of microglia often aggravates the pathological process of various neurological diseases. Natural chemicals have unique advantages in inhibiting microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and improving neuronal function. Here, we examined the effects of asperosaponin VI (ASA VI) on LPS-activated primary microglia. Microglia were isolated from mice and pretreated with different doses of ASA VI, following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Activation and inflammatory response of microglia cells were evaluated by q-PCR, immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Signaling pathways were detected by western blotting. We found that the ASA VI inhibited the morphological expansion of microglia cells, decreased the expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines, and promoted the expression of antiinflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. ASA VI also activated PPAR-{gamma} signaling pathway in LPS-treated microglia. The anti-inflammatory effects of ASA VI in microglia were blocked by treating PPAR-{gamma} antagonist (GW9662). These results showed that ASA VI promote the transition of microglia cells from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory by regulating PPAR-{gamma} pathway.</content>

 Understanding how neural networks generate activity patterns and communicate with each other requires monitoring the electrical activity from many neurons simultaneously. Perfectly suited tools for addressing this challenge are genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) because they can be targeted to specific cell types and optically report the electrical activity of individual, or populations of neurons. However, analyzing and interpreting the data from voltage imaging experiments is challenging because high recording speeds and properties of current GEVIs yield only low signal-to-noise ratios, making it necessary to apply specific analytical tools. Here, we present NOSA (Neuro-Optical Signal Analysis), a novel open source software designed for analyzing voltage imaging data and identifying temporal interactions between electrical activity patterns of different origin.

In this manuscript we explain the challenges that arise during voltage imaging experiments and provide hands-on analytical solutions. We demonstrate how NOSAs baseline fitting, filtering algorithms and movement correction can compensate for shifts in baseline fluorescence and extract electrical patterns from low signal-to-noise recordings. Moreover, NOSA contains powerful features to identify oscillatory frequencies in electrical patterns and extract neuronal firing characteristics. NOSA is the first open-access software to provide an option for analyzing simultaneously recorded optical and electrical data derived from patch-clamp or other electrode-based recordings. To identify temporal relations between electrical activity patterns we implemented different options to perform cross correlation analysis, demonstrating their utility during voltage imaging in Drosophila and mice. All features combined, NOSA will facilitate the first steps into using GEVIs and help to realize their full potential for revealing cell-type specific connectivity and functional interactions. If you would like to test NOSA, please send an email to the lead contact.</content>

 Stimulation of neural activity is an important scientific and clinical tool, causally testing hypotheses and treating neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. However, current stimulation approaches cannot flexibly control the pattern of activity in populations of neurons. To address this, we developed an adaptive, closed-loop stimulation (ACLS) system that uses patterned, multi-site electrical stimulation to control the pattern of activity in a population of neurons. Importantly, ACLS is a learning system; it monitors the response to stimulation and iteratively updates the stimulation pattern to produce a specific neural response. In silico and in vivo experiments showed ACLS quickly learns to produce specific patterns of neural activity (~15 minutes) and was robust to noise and drift in neural responses. In visual cortex of awake mice, ACLS learned electrical stimulation patterns that produced responses similar to the natural response evoked by visual stimuli. Similar to how repetition of a visual stimulus causes an adaptation in the neural response, the response to electrical stimulation was adapted when it was preceded by the associated visual stimulus. Altogether, our results show ACLS can learn, in real-time, to generate specific patterns of neural activity, providing a framework for using closed-loop learning to control neural activity.</content>

 In the vestibular peripheral organs, type I and type II hair cells (HCs) transmit incoming signals via glutamatergic quantal transmission onto afferent nerve fibers. Additionally, type I HCs transmit via non-quantal transmission to calyx afferent fibers, by accumulation of glutamate and potassium in the synaptic cleft. Vestibular efferent inputs originating in the brainstem contact type II HCs and vestibular afferents. Here, we aimed at characterizing the synaptic efferent inputs to type II HCs using electrical and optogenetic stimulation of efferent fibers combined with in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recording from type II HCs in the rodent vestibular crista. Properties of efferent synaptic currents in type II HCs were similar to those found in cochlear hair cells and mediated by activation of 9/10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and SK potassium channels. While efferents showed a low probability of release at low frequencies of stimulation, repetitive stimulation resulted in facilitation and increased probability of release. Notably, the membrane potential of type II HCs measured during optogenetic stimulation of efferents showed a strong hyperpolarization even in response to single pulses and was further enhanced by repetitive stimulation. Such efferent-mediated inhibition of type II HCs can provide a mechanism to adjust the contribution of signals from type I and type II HCs to vestibular nerve fibers. As a result, the relative input of type I hair cells to vestibular afferents will be strengthened, emphasizing the phasic properties of the incoming signal that are transmitted via fast non-quantal transmission.</content>

 The ability to successfully regulate negative emotions such as fear and anxiety is vital for mental health. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) acts as important modulator of emotion regulation, as reflected by reduced amygdala responses but increased amygdala prefrontal cortex (PFC) functional connectivity in response to threatening stimuli. The present randomized, between-subject, placebo (PLC) controlled pharmacological study combined intranasal administration of OXT with functional MRI during an explicit (cognitive) emotion regulation (i.e. distancing reappraisal) paradigm in 65 healthy male participants to investigate the modulatory effects of OXT on both bottom-up and top-down emotion regulation. OXT attenuated the activation in posterior insular cortex and amygdala during anticipation of top-down regulation of predictable threat stimuli in participants with high trait anxiety, providing evidence to support the anxiolytic action of OXT. In contrast, OXT enhanced amygdala activity during bottom-up anticipation of an unpredictable threat stimulus in participants with low trait anxiety. OXT may thus facilitate top-down goal-directed attention by attenuating amygdala activity in high anxiety individuals, while promote bottom-up attention/vigilance to unexpected threat by enhancing anticipatory amygdala activity in low anxiety individuals. The opposite effects of OXT on anticipatory amygdala activation in high versus low anxiety individuals may suggest a baseline anxiety level dependent mechanism via which OXT promotes optimal levels of amygdala activation during the anticipation of an imminent threat. OXT may thus have the potential to promote an adaptive balance between bottom-up and top-down attention systems depending on individual levels of pre-treatment trait anxiety levels.</content>

 The drift-diffusion model (DDM) is an important decision-making model in cognitive neuroscience. However, innovations in model form have been limited by methodological challenges. Here, we introduce the generalized drift-diffusion model (GDDM) framework for building, simulating, and fitting DDM extensions, and provide a software package which implements the framework. The GDDM framework augments traditional DDM parameters through arbitrary user-defined functions. Models are simulated numerically by directly solving the Fokker-Planck equation using efficient numerical methods, yielding a 100-fold or greater speedup over standard methodology. This speed allows GDDMs to be fit to data using maximum likelihood on the full response time (RT) distribution. We show that a GDDM fit with our framework explains a classic open dataset with better accuracy and fewer parameters than several DDMs implemented using the latest methodology. Overall, our framework will allow for decision-making model innovation and novel experimental designs.</content>

		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.14.992016v1?rss=1"/>

 Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impaired learning of culturally transmitted behaviors like social skills, speech, and language. These are learned by copying parents and other social models during development, a two-stage process that involves forming memories of appropriate behaviors during social experiences and then using those memories to guide imitation. How ASD-linked genes impair these often-intertwined aspects of learning is not known, thereby limiting our understanding of the developmental progression of ASD and the targeting of therapeutic interventions. Here we show that these aspects of learning are dissociable and that the ASD-linked gene FoxP1 selectively impairs learning from social experience, but not behavioral imitation. Haploinsufficiency of FOXP1 in humans causes FOXP1 syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder typified by severe disruptions in speech and language development, and other ASD-associated symptoms. We tested how knockdown of FoxP1 (FP1-KD) affects the cultural transmission of vocal behaviors in zebra finches, a songbird that learns by memorizing and vocally copying the song of an adult song-tutor. We find that FP1-KD blocks song learning in juvenile birds by selectively impairing their ability to encode a memory during social experiences with a song-tutor. These learning deficits are linked to disruptions in experience-driven structural and functional plasticity. However, if birds are exposed to tutor-song prior to FP1-KD, their ability to imitate that song during development is unaffected. Thus, FP1-KD impairs cultural transmission of vocalizations by disrupting the ability to form appropriate vocal memories, yet spares the ability to use previously acquired memories to guide vocal learning. This indicates that learning from social experience may be particularly vulnerable in FOXP1 syndrome.</content>

		<content type="html">
 There is growing evidence that integrity of the locus coeruleus - norepinephrine (LC-NE) system is important for later-life cognition. Less understood is how LC-NE system integrity relates to brain correlates of cognition, such as brain structure. Here, we assessed the relationship between cortical thickness and a measure of LC neuronal integrity in older (n = 229) and younger adults (n = 67). Using neuromelanin-sensitive MRI, we assessed LC integrity as a contrast between signal intensity of the LC and that of neighboring pontine reference tissue. The Freesurfer software suite was used to quantify cortical thickness. We found that LC contrast was positively related to cortical thickness in older but not younger adults, and this association was prominent in parietal, frontal, and occipital regions. Brain regions where LC contrast was related to cortical thickness include portions of the frontoparietal network and have been implicated in cognitive functions which are subject to strong noradrenergic modulation. These findings provide novel evidence for a link between LC integrity and brain structure in later adulthood.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Production of learned vocalizations requires precise selection and accurate sequencing of appropriate vocal-motor actions. The basal ganglia are essential for the selection and sequencing of motor actions, but the cellular specializations and circuit mechanisms governing accurate sequencing of vocalizations are unknown. Here, we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing and genetic manipulations to map basal ganglia cell types and circuits involved in the production of songbird vocal sequences. We identify cell-type specializations in direct-like and indirect-like basal ganglia pathways, including evolutionary expansion of striatal and arkypallidal cell-types that could facilitate vocal sequencing. Surprisingly, we find that FoxP2, a gene important for vocal development, can potently and reversibly control accurate sequencing of adult birdsong, and that phasic dopamine selectively regulates repetition of syllables independent of its role in reinforcement-based learning of how they are sung. These findings identify key evolutionary specializations and circuits essential for selection and sequencing of vocal-motor actions necessary for vocal communication.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not uniform as dopamine neurons from the ventral tier are lost more rapidly than those of the dorsal tier. Identifying the intrinsic differences that account for this differential vulnerability may provide a key for developing new treatments for PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we compared the RNA‐sequenced transcriptomes of ~100 laser captured micro‐dissected SNpc neurons from each tier from seven healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expression levels of dopaminergic markers were similar across the tiers while markers specific to the neighbouring ventral tegmental area were virtually undetected. After accounting for unwanted sources of variation, we identified one hundred and six differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the SNpc tiers. The genes higher in the dorsal/resistant SNpc tier neurons displayed coordinated patterns of expression across the human brain, their protein products had more interactions than expected by chance and they demonstrated evidence of functional convergence. No significant shared functionality was found for genes higher in the ventral/vulnerable SNpc tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly but importantly, none of the identified DEGs were among the familial PD genes or genome‐wide associated loci. Finally, we found some DEGs in opposite tier orientation between human and analogous mouse populations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results highlight functional enrichments of vesicular trafficking, ion transport/homeostasis and oxidative stress genes showing higher expression in the resistant neurons of the SNpc dorsal tier. Furthermore, the comparison of gene expression variation in human and mouse SNpc populations strongly argues for the need of human‐focused Omics studies.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are highly transmissible and play critical roles in propagation of tau pathology although its mechanism remains elusive. Here, for the first time, we comprehensively characterized the pathogenic effect of human brain-derived EVs isolated from Alzheimers disease (AD), prodromal AD (pAD) and non-demented control (CTRL) cases. AD-EVs are significantly enriched in epitope-specific tau oligomers in comparison to pAD-EVs or CTRL-EVs as determined by dot-blot and atomic force microscopy. AD-EVs were more efficiently internalized by murine cortical neurons and transferred tau, and had higher aggregation potency than pAD-EVs and CTRL-EVs in vitro. Strikingly, the inoculation of AD-EVs or pAD-EVs containing 300 pg of tau into the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) in 18 months-old C57BL/6 mice induced tau propagation throughout the hippocampus in 4.5 months, whereas inoculation of the equal amount of tau from CTRL-EV or as the oligomer or fibril-enriched fraction from the same AD donor show little propagation as determined by the semiquantitative brain-wide immunohistochemistry using multiple anti-phosphor-tau (p-tau) antibodies. AD-EVs induced accumulation of tau in the hippocampal region as both oligomers and sarkosyl-insoluble forms. Unexpectedly, p-tau+ cells were mostly GAD67+ GABAergic neurons followed by GluR2/3+ excitatory mossy cells, indicating preferential EV-mediated tau propagation to GABAergic neurons. Whole cell patch clamp recording of Cornu Ammonis (CA1) pyramidal cells showed significant reduction in the amplitude of inhibitory post-synaptic current. This is accompanied by the reduction in GAD67+GABAergic neuronal puncta around CA1 pyramidal neurons and in c-fos+ GAD67+ GABAergic neurons in the CA1 regions, reconfirming the reduced interneuronal projections to the CA1. Our study posits a novel mechanism of brain-derived EVs in spreading pathological tau in hippocampal neurons therefore leading to their dysfunction.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Aim: Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) is responsible for the progression of the kynurenine pathway, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammation-induced depression. It has been reported that asperosaponin VI (ASA VI) could play a neuroprotective role through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. In this study, we examined the antidepressant effect of ASA VI in LPS-treated mice and further explored its molecular mechanism by insight into the microglial kynurenine pathway. Methods: To produce the model, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.83 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally to mice. The mice received ASA VI (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) thirty minutes prior to LPS injection. Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated based on the duration of immobility in the forced swim test. Microglial activation and inflammatory cytokines were detected by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and ELISA. The TLR4/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway and the expression of IDO, GluA2, and CamKII{beta} were measured by western blotting. Results: ASA VI demonstrated significant antidepressant activity in the presence of LPS on immobility and latency times in the forced swim test. The LPS-induced activation of microglia and inflammatory response were inhabited by ASA VI in a dose-dependent manner. TLR4/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway also was suppressed by ASA VI in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of LPS-treated mice. Furthermore, ASA VI inhibited the increase in IDO protein expression and normalized the aberrant glutamate transmission in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex as a result of LPS administration. Conclusion: Our results propose a promising antidepressant effect for ASA VI possibly through the downregulation of IDO expression and normalization of the aberrant glutamate transmission. This remedying effect of ASA VI could be attributed to suppress microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response via inhibiting the TLR4/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway.</content>

Rational drug design for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is limited by the small number of available atomic resolution structures. We assessed the use of homology modeling to predict the structures of two therapeutically relevant GPCRs and strategies to improve the performance of virtual screening against modeled binding sites. Homology models of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dopamine (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) and serotonin 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) were generated based on crystal structures of 16 different GPCRs. Comparison of the homology models to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R crystal structures showed that accurate predictions could be obtained, but not necessarily using the most closely related template. Assessment of virtual screening performance was based on molecular docking of ligands and decoys. The results demonstrated that several templates and multiple models based on each of these must be evaluated to identify the optimal binding site structure. Models based on aminergic GPCRs displayed ligand enrichment and there was a trend toward improved virtual screening performance with increasing binding site accuracy. The best models even displayed ligand enrichment better than that of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R crystal structures. Methods to consider binding site plasticity were explored to further improve predictions. Molecular docking to ensembles of structures did not outperform the best individual binding site models, but could increase the diversity of hits from virtual screens and be advantageous for GPCR targets with few known ligands. Molecular dynamics refinement resulted in moderate improvements of structural accuracy and the virtual screening performance of snapshots was either comparable to or worse than that of the raw homology models. These results provide guidelines for successful application of structure-based ligand discovery using GPCR homology models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3s2xA9w3VrQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The overall malaria burden in the Americas has decreased dramatically over the past two decades, but residual transmission pockets persist across the Amazon Basin, where &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; is the predominant infecting species. Current elimination efforts require a better quantitative understanding of malaria transmission dynamics for planning, monitoring, and evaluating interventions at the community level. This can be achieved with mathematical models that properly account for risk heterogeneity in communities approaching elimination, where few individuals disproportionately contribute to overall malaria prevalence, morbidity, and onwards transmission. Here we analyse demographic information combined with routinely collected malaria morbidity data from the town of Mâncio Lima, the main urban transmission hotspot of Brazil. We estimate the proportion of high-risk subjects in the host population by fitting compartmental susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) transmission models simultaneously to age-stratified vivax malaria incidence densities and the frequency distribution of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; malaria attacks experienced by each individual over 12 months. Simulations with the best-fitting SIS model indicate that 20% of the hosts contribute 86% of the overall vivax malaria burden. Despite the low overall force of infection typically found in the Amazon, about one order of magnitude lower than that in rural Africa, high-risk individuals gradually develop clinical immunity following repeated infections and eventually constitute a substantial infectious reservoir comprised of asymptomatic parasite carriers that is overlooked by routine surveillance but likely fuels onwards malaria transmission. High-risk individuals therefore represent a priority target for more intensive and effective interventions that may not be readily delivered to the entire community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t9McFNjeAq0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Coexistence of bacteriophages, or phages, and their host bacteria plays an important role in maintaining the microbial communities. In natural environments with limited nutrients, motile bacteria can actively migrate towards locations of richer resources. Although phages are not motile themselves, they can infect motile bacterial hosts and spread in space via the hosts. Therefore, in a migrating microbial community coexistence of bacteria and phages implies their co-propagation in space. Here, we combine an experimental approach and mathematical modeling to explore how phages and their motile host bacteria coexist and co-propagate. When lytic phages encountered motile host bacteria in our experimental set up, a sector-shaped lysis zone formed. Our mathematical model indicates that local nutrient depletion and the resulting inhibition of proliferation and motility of bacteria and phages are the key to formation of the observed lysis pattern. The model further reveals the straight radial boundaries in the lysis pattern as a telltale sign for coexistence and co-propagation of bacteria and phages. Emergence of such a pattern, albeit insensitive to extrinsic factors, requires a balance between intrinsic biological properties of phages and bacteria, which likely results from coevolution of phages and bacteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Mt22RpZ9ec0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing same-type odorant receptors typically project to a pair of glomeruli in the medial and lateral sides of the olfactory bulbs (OBs) in rodents. This multiple glomerular representation of homologous inputs is considered to have more important functional roles for odor information processing than the redundant backup system. However, a consensus idea is lacking and this hinders interpretation of the phenomenon. In addition, the shared and unique odorant response properties of the homologous glomeruli remain unclear because the majority of medial glomeruli are hidden in the septal OB, and thus it is difficult to directly compare them. OSNs, which express trace amine-associated odorant receptors (TAARs), were recently identified that project to a pair of glomeruli uniquely located in the dorsal OB. In this study, we measured the odorant-induced calcium responses of homologous pairs of TAAR glomeruli simultaneously in anesthetized mice and directly compared their response patterns. We found that they exhibited similar temporal response patterns and could not find differences in onset latency, rise time, decay time, or response amplitude. However, the medial glomeruli had significantly larger respiration-locked calcium fluctuations than the lateral glomeruli. This trend was observed with/without odorant stimulation in postsynaptic neurons of GABAergic, dopaminergic, and mitral/tufted cells, but not in presynaptic olfactory sensory axon terminals. This indicates that, at least in these TAAR glomeruli, the medial rather than the lateral OB map enhances the respiration-locked rhythm and transfers this information to higher brain centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Songbirds are a powerful model to study vocal learning given that aspects of the underlying behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms are analogous in many ways to mechanisms involved in speech learning. Perineuronal nets (PNN) represent one of the mechanisms controlling the closing of sensitive periods for vocal learning in the songbird brain. In zebra finches, PNN develop around parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in selected song control nuclei during ontogeny and their development is delayed if juveniles are deprived of a tutor. However, song learning in zebra finches takes place during a relatively short period of development and it is difficult to determine whether PNN development correlates with the end of the sensory or the sensorimotor learning period. Canaries have a longer period of sensorimotor vocal learning, spanning over their first year of life so that it should be easier to test whether PNN development correlates with the end of sensory or sensorimotor vocal learning. Here we quantified PNN around PV-interneurons in the brain of male canaries from hatching until the first breeding season and analyzed in parallel the development of their song. PNN development around PV-interneurons specifically took place and their number reached its maximum around the end of the sensorimotor learning stage, well after the end of sensory vocal learning, and correlated with song development. This suggests that PNN are specifically involved in the termination of the sensitive period for sensorimotor vocal learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Perineuronal nets (PNN) are accumulations of components of the extracellular matrix that form usually around parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons. PNN have been associated with various forms of experience- or activity-dependent learning in mammals where they appear to control the end of sensitive periods for learning. It was recently demonstrated that PNN are associated with vocal learning in juveniles and adults of several species of songbirds, but the specific aspect of the learning process they control has not been formally identified. We demonstrate here that during ontogeny in male canaries, PNN develop essentially during the sensorimotor phase of song learning, which suggests that they represent part of the neuronal mechanisms underlying song crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human observers perceptually discriminate the dynamic deformation of materials in the real world. However, the psychophysical and neural mechanisms responsible for the perception of dynamic deformation have not been fully elucidated. By using a deforming bar as the stimulus, we showed that the spatial frequency of deformation was a critical determinant of deformation perception. Simulating the response of direction-selective units (i.e., MT pattern motion cells) to stimuli, we found that the perception of dynamic deformation was well explained by assuming a higher-order mechanism monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses. Our model with the higher-order mechanism also successfully explained the appearance of a visual illusion wherein a static bar apparently deforms against a tilted drifting grating. In particular, it was the lower spatial frequencies in this pattern that strongly contributed to the deformation perception. Finally, by manipulating the luminance of the static bar, we observed that the mechanism for the illusory deformation was more sensitive to luminance than contrast cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; From the psychophysical and computational points of view, the present study tried to answer the question, &quot;how do human observers see deformation?&quot;. In the psychophysical experiment, we used a clip wherein a bar dynamically deformed. We also tested the illusory deformation of a bar, which was caused by tilted drifting grating, because it was unclear whether the illusory deformation could be described by our model. In the computational analysis, in order to explain psychophysical data for deformation perception, it was necessary to assume an additional unit monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses of MT cells that were sensitive to local image motion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Fifty years have passed since David Marr, Masao Ito, and James Albus proposed
seminal models of cerebellar functions. These models share the essential
concept that parallel-fiber-Purkinje-cell synapses undergo plastic changes,
guided by climbing-fiber activities during sensorimotor learning. However, they
differ in several important respects, including holistic versus complementary
roles of the cerebellum, pattern recognition versus control as computational
objectives, potentiation versus depression of synaptic plasticity, teaching
signals versus error signals transmitted by climbing-fibers, sparse expansion
coding by granule cells, and cerebellar internal models. In this review, we
evaluate the different features of the three models based on recent
computational and experimental studies. While acknowledging that the three
models have greatly advanced our understanding of cerebellar control mechanisms
in eye movements and classical conditioning, we propose a new direction for
computational frameworks of the cerebellum. That is, hierarchical reinforcement
learning with multiple internal models.

 &lt;p&gt;The post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) plays a central role in excitatory synapse development and synaptic plasticity. Phosphorylation of the N-terminus of PSD-95 at threonine 19 (T19) and serine 25 (S25) decreases PSD-95 stability at synapses; however, a molecular mechanism linking PSD-95 phosphorylation to altered synaptic stability is lacking. Here, we show that phosphorylation of T19/S25 recruits the phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase (Pin1) and reduces the palmitoylation of Cysteine 3 and Cysteine 5 in PSD-95. This reduction in PSD-95 palmitoylation accounts for the observed loss in the number of dendritic PSD-95 clusters, the increased AMPAR mobility, and the decreased number of functional excitatory synapses. We find the effects of Pin1 overexpression were all rescued by manipulations aimed at increasing the levels of PSD-95 palmitoylation. Therefore, Pin1 is a key signaling molecule that regulates the stability of excitatory synapses and may participate in the destabilization of PSD-95 following the induction of synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: A neurophysiologic biomarker for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly desirable and can improve diagnosis, monitoring, and assessment of therapeutic response among children with ASD. We investigated the utility of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) applied to the motor cortex (M1) as a biomarker for children and adolescents with high-functioning (HF) ASD compared to their age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) controls. We also compared the developmental trajectory of long-term depression- (LTD-) like plasticity in the two groups. Finally, we explored the influence of a common brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism on cTBS aftereffects in a subset of the ASD group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-nine children and adolescents (age range 10–16) in ASD (n = 11) and TD (n = 18) groups underwent M1 cTBS. Changes in MEP amplitude at 5–60 min post-cTBS and their cumulative measures in each group were calculated. We also assessed the relationship between age and maximum cTBS-induced MEP suppression (ΔMEP&lt;sub&gt;Max&lt;/sub&gt;) in each group. Finally, we compared cTBS aftereffects in BDNF Val/Val (n = 4) and Val/Met (n = 4) ASD participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Cumulative cTBS aftereffects were significantly more facilitatory in the ASD group than in the TD group (P&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt;’s &amp;lt; 0.03). ΔMEP&lt;sub&gt;Max&lt;/sub&gt; was negatively correlated with age in the ASD group (r = −0.67, P = 0.025), but not in the TD group (r = −0.12, P = 0.65). Cumulative cTBS aftereffects were not significantly different between the two BDNF subgroups (P-values &amp;gt; 0.18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The results support the utility of cTBS measures of cortical plasticity as a biomarker for children and adolescents with HF-ASD and an aberrant developmental trajectory of LTD-like plasticity in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Potential pathogenic factors, other than well-known APP, APOE4, and PSEN, can be further identified from transcriptomics studies of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are specific for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but findings are often inconsistent or even contradictory. Evidence corroboration by combining meta-analysis and bioinformatics methods may help to resolve existing inconsistencies and contradictions. This study aimed to demonstrate a systematic workflow for evidence synthesis of transcriptomic studies using both meta-analysis and bioinformatics methods to identify potential pathogenic factors. Transcriptomic data were assessed from GEO and ArrayExpress after systematic searches. The DEGs and their dysregulation states from both DNA microarray and RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed and corroborated by meta-analysis. Statistically significant DEGs were used for enrichment analysis based on KEGG and protein–protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis based on STRING. AD-specific modules were further determined by the DIAMOnD algorithm, which identifies significant connectivity patterns between specific disease-associated proteins and non-specific proteins. Within AD-specific modules, the nodes of highest degrees (&amp;gt;95th percentile) were considered as potential pathogenic factors. After systematic searches of 225 datasets, extensive meta-analyses among 25 datasets (21 DNA microarray datasets and 4 RNA sequencing datasets) identified 9,298 DEGs. The dysregulated genes and pathways in AD were associated with impaired amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance. From the AD-specific module, Fyn, and EGFR were the most statistically significant and biologically relevant. This meta-analytical study suggested that the reduced Aβ clearance in AD pathogenesis was associated with the genes encoding Fyn and EGFR, which were key receptors in Aβ downstream signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proved to be effective in the treatment of movement disorders. However, the direct contact between the metal contacts of the DBS electrode and the brain can cause RF heating in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, due to an increase of local specific absorption rate (SAR). Recently, micro coils (μMS) have demonstrated excitation of neuronal tissue through the electromagnetic induction both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In contrast to electrical stimulation, in μMS, there is no direct contact between the metal and the biological tissue.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We compared the heating of a μMS coil with a control case of a metal wire. The heating was induced by RF fields in a 1.5 T MRI head birdcage coil (often used for imaging patients with implants) at 64 MHz, and normalized results to 3.2 W/kg whole head average SAR.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The μMS coil or wire implants were placed inside an anatomically accurate head saline-gel filled phantom inserted in the RF coil, and we observed approximately 1°C initial temperature rise at the μMS coil, while the wire exhibited a 10°C temperature rise in the proximity of the exposed end. The numerical simulations showed a 32-times increase of local SAR induced at the tips of the metal wire compared to the μMS.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In this work, we show with measurements and electromagnetic numerical simulations that the RF-induced increase in local SAR and induced heating during MRI scanning can be greatly reduced by using magnetic stimulation with the proposed μMS technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We propose that correlations among neurons are generically strong enough to organize neural activity patterns into a discrete set of clusters, which can each be viewed as a population codeword. Our reasoning starts with the analysis of retinal ganglion cell data using maximum entropy models, showing that the population is robustly in a frustrated, marginally sub-critical, or glassy, state. This leads to an argument that neural populations in many other brain areas might share this structure. Next, we use latent variable models to show that this glassy state possesses well-defined clusters of neural activity. Clusters have three appealing properties: (i) clusters exhibit error correction, i.e., they are reproducibly elicited by the same stimulus despite variability at the level of constituent neurons; (ii) clusters encode qualitatively different visual features than their constituent neurons; and (iii) clusters can be learned by downstream neural circuits in an unsupervised fashion. We hypothesize that these properties give rise to a “learnable” neural code which the cortical hierarchy uses to extract increasingly complex features without supervision or reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study describes the cytoarchitecture of the torus longitudinalis (TL) in adult zebrafish by using light and electron microscopy, as well as its main connections as revealed by DiI tract tracing. In addition, by using high resolution confocal imaging followed by digital tracing, we describe the morphology of tectal pyramidal cells (type I cells) that are GFP positive in the transgenic line Tg(1.4dlx5a-dlx6a:GFP)&lt;sup&gt;ot1&lt;/sup&gt;. The TL consists of numerous small and medium-sized neurons located in a longitudinal eminence attached to the medial optic tectum. A small proportion of these neurons are GABAergic. The neuropil shows three types of synaptic terminals and numerous dendrites. Tracing experiments revealed that the main efference of the TL is formed of parallel-like fibers that course within the marginal layer of the optic tectum. A toral projection to the thalamic nucleus rostrolateralis is also observed. Afferents to the TL come from visual and cerebellum-related nuclei in the pretectum, namely the central, intercalated and the paracommissural pretectal nuclei, as well as from the subvalvular nucleus in the isthmus. Additional afferents to the TL may come from the cerebellum but their origins could not be confirmed. The tectal afferent projection to the TL originates from cells similar to the type X cells described in other cyprinids. Tectal pyramidal neurons show round or piriform cell bodies, with spiny apical dendritic trees in the marginal layer. This anatomical study provides a basis for future functional and developmental studies focused on this cerebellum-like circuit in zebrafish.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a highly conserved degradative process that conveys dysfunctional proteins, lipids, and organelles to lysosomes for degradation. The post-mitotic nature, complex and highly polarized morphology, and high degree of specialization of neurons make an efficient autophagy essential for their homeostasis and survival. Dysfunctional autophagy occurs in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and autophagy at synaptic sites seems to play a crucial role in neurodegeneration. Moreover, a role of autophagy is emerging for neural development, synaptogenesis, and the establishment of a correct connectivity. Thus, it is not surprising that defective autophagy has been demonstrated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, often associated with early-onset epilepsy. Here, we discuss the multiple roles of autophagy in neurons and the recent experimental evidence linking neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy to genes coding for autophagic/lysosomal system-related proteins and envisage possible pathophysiological mechanisms ranging from synaptic dysfunction to neuronal death.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Little is known about the underlying mechanisms of the similarities in the core features of postoperative delirium (POD) and α-synuclein (α-syn)-related cognitive disorders. We herein investigated associations between fluctuated levels of exosomal α-syn in the plasma and POD presentation in geriatric hip fracture patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We conducted an observational, prospective, and 1:1 matched (on age older than 65, hip fracture diagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologist’ (ASA) physical status, duration of surgery, and intraoperative bleeding) case-control study: POD cases and non-POD controls were selected from the overall cohort by using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Delirium severity was measured by the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Plasma exosome levels of α-syn were examined preoperatively and at the time that POD was diagnosed, by using an established immunocapture technology based on a putative brain-cell-specific marker. Circulating concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were also determined. The relationship between α-syn levels and POD risk, as well as the association between α-syn and MDAS scores and plasma cytokines, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: POD incidence was 8.4% (17/202). Postoperative α-syn were either elevated or lowered. As primary outcome variables, the change of α-syn in POD patients was significantly higher than non-POD ones (21.0 ± 29.3 pg.ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; vs.1.9 ± 20.0, P = 0.047). The α-syn alteration was positively correlated to MDAS (r = 0.436, P = 0.010) and the change of IL-6 (r = 0.383, P = 0.025).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Exosome α-syn release in plasma may be associated with the POD development which might be due to systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier ChiCTR-IPR-17012301.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior Presentation: The abstract of this work has been selected for presentation in the 2019 ANESTHESIOLOGY Journal Symposium “What’s New with the old,” and it has been present in the ASA 2019 annual meeting October 21st, 2019 in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: Till now, the effect of serum lipid levels on cognitive function is still controversial. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the most critical genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment. Additionally, APOE ε4 allele has a major impact on lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the APOE genotype-dependent relationship between peripheral serum lipid levels and cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 1,273 subjects aged 40–86 years participated in this cross-sectional study. Serum lipid levels and the APOE genotype were detected. Mini-Mental State Examination was used to diagnose the cognitive impairment or not. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the relationships between APOE genotype, serum lipid levels, and cognition function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After controlling for all possible covariates, a significant interaction between low serum high-density lipoprotein and the APOE ε4 allele on cognitive impairment (Wald’s χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.269, df = 1, OR = 20.094, p = 0.039) was found in the total participants. In APOE ε4 carriers, low serum high-density lipoprotein was positively associated with cognitive impairment (Wald’s χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8.200, df = 1, OR = 60.335, p = 0.004) and serum high-density lipoprotein levels were positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination score (r = 0.217, df = 176, p = 0.004). There was no significant correlation between serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides (TG) levels, and cognitive impairment in either the total participants or APOE ε4 carriers/non-carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: APOE ε4 carriers, but not non-carriers, with lower serum high-density lipoprotein had a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment and a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score. These results suggest that the APOE ε4 allele may affect the relationship between serum lipid levels and cognitive impairment. However, the specific mechanism needs to be further elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Adaptive immunity vitally depends on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules loaded with peptides. Selective loading of peptides onto MHC I, referred to as peptide editing, is catalyzed by tapasin and the tapasin-related TAPBPR. An important catalytic role has been ascribed to a structural feature in TAPBPR called the scoop loop, but the exact function of the scoop loop remains elusive. Here, using a reconstituted system of defined peptide-exchange components including human TAPBPR variants, we uncover a substantial contribution of the scoop loop to the stability of the MHC I-chaperone complex and to peptide editing. We reveal that the scoop loop of TAPBPR functions as an internal peptide surrogate in peptide-depleted environments stabilizing empty MHC I and impeding peptide rebinding. The scoop loop thereby acts as an additional selectivity filter in shaping the repertoire of presented peptide epitopes and the formation of a hierarchical immune response.</content>

 Members of the &lt;i&gt;Corynebacterineae &lt;/i&gt;suborder of Actinobacteria have a unique cell surface architecture and, unlike most well-studied bacteria, grow by tip-extension. To investigate the distinct morphogenic mechanisms shared by these organisms, we performed a genome-wide phenotypic profiling analysis using &lt;i&gt;Corynebacterium glutamicum&lt;/i&gt; as a model. A high-density transposon mutagenized library was challenged with a panel of antibiotics and other stresses. The fitness of mutants in each gene under each condition was then assessed by transposon-sequencing. Clustering of the resulting phenotypic fingerprints revealed a role for several genes of previously unknown function in surface biogenesis. Further analysis identified CofA (Cgp_0016) as an interaction partner of the peptidoglycan synthase PBP1a that promotes its stable accumulation at sites of polar growth. The related &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; proteins were also found to interact, highlighting the utility of our dataset for uncovering conserved principles of morphogenesis for this clinically relevant bacterial suborder.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Ion selectivity is a defining feature of a given ion channel and is considered immutable. Here we show that ion selectivity of the lysosomal ion channel TPC2, which is hotly debated (Calcraft et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2017; Jha et al., 2014; Ruas et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012), depends on the activating ligand. A high throughput screen identified two structurally distinct TPC2 agonists. One of these evoked robust Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and non-selective cation currents, the other weaker Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective currents. These properties were mirrored by the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-mobilizing messenger, NAADP and the phosphoinositide, PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Agonist action was differentially inhibited by mutation of a single TPC2 residue and coupled to opposing changes in lysosomal pH and exocytosis. Our findings resolve conflicting reports on the permeability and gating properties of TPC2 and they establish a new paradigm whereby a single ion channel mediates distinct, functionally-relevant ionic signatures on demand.</content>

The influence of red blood cell (RBC) deformability in whole blood on platelet margination is investigated using confocal microscopy measurements of flowing human blood and cell resolved blood flow simulations. Fluorescent platelet concentrations at the wall of a glass chamber are measured using confocal microscopy with flowing human blood containing varying healthy-to-stiff RBC fractions. A decrease is observed in the fluorescent platelet signal at the wall due to the increase of stiffened RBCs in flow, suggesting a decrease of platelet margination due to an increased fraction of stiffened RBCs present in the flow. In order to resolve the influence of stiffened RBCs on platelet concentration at the channel wall, cell-pair and bulk flow simulations are performed. For homogeneous collisions between RBC pairs, a decrease in final displacement after a collision with increasing membrane stiffness is observed. In heterogeneous collisions between healthy and stiff RBC pairs, it is found that the stiffened RBC is displaced most. The influence of RBC deformability on collisions between RBCs and platelets was found to be negligible due to their size and mass difference. For a straight vessel geometry with varying healthy-to-stiff RBC ratios, a decrease was observed in the red blood cell-free layer and platelet margination due to an increase in stiffened RBCs present in flow.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AGjg1s708qU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Antigen recognition by T-cells is guided by the T-cell receptor (TCR) heterodimer formed by α and β chains. A huge diversity of TCR sequences should be maintained by the immune system in order to be able to mount an effective response towards foreign pathogens, so, due to cooperative binding of α and β chains to the pathogen, any constraints on chain pairing can have a profound effect on immune repertoire structure, diversity and antigen specificity. By integrating available structural data and paired chain sequencing results we were able to show that there are almost no constraints on pairing in TCRαβ complexes, allowing naive T-cell repertoire to reach the highest possible diversity. Additional analysis reveals that the specific choice of contacting amino acids can still have a profound effect on complex conformation. Moreover, antigen-driven selection can distort the uniform landscape of chain pairing, while small, yet significant, differences in the pairing can be attributed to various specialized T-cell subsets such as MAIT and iNKT T-cells, as well as other TCR sets specific to certain antigens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AEqpGdCC3f8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Calcium imaging has been widely used for measuring spiking activities of neurons. When using calcium imaging, we need to extract summarized information from the raw movie beforehand. Recent studies have used matrix deconvolution for this preprocessing. However, such an approach can neither directly estimate the generative mechanism of spike trains nor use stimulus information that has a strong influence on neural activities. Here, we propose a new deconvolution method for calcium imaging using marked point processes. We consider that the observed movie is generated from a probabilistic model with marked point processes as hidden variables, and we calculate the posterior of these variables using a variational inference approach. Our method can simultaneously estimate various kinds of information, such as cell shape, spike occurrence time, and tuning curve. We apply our method to simulated and experimental data to verify its performance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xvVCa8A-Lno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In recent years, many studies have drawn attention to the important role of collective awareness and human behaviour during epidemic outbreaks. A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources—Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive—to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dFYVKQ4wlYc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with a substantial genetic component and immune‐mediated neurodegeneration. Patients with MS show structural brain differences relative to individuals without MS, including smaller regional volumes and alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure. Whether genetic risk for MS is associated with brain structure during early neurodevelopment remains unclear. In this study, we explore the association between MS polygenic risk scores (PRS) and brain imaging outcomes from a large, population‐based pediatric sample to gain insight into the underlying neurobiology of MS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 8‐to‐12 year‐old genotyped participants from the Generation R Study in whom T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;‐weighted volumetric‐(n=1,136) and/or diffusion tensor imaging (n=1,088) had been collected. PRS for MS were calculated based on a large genome‐wide association study of MS (n=41,505), and were regressed on regional volumes, global and tract‐specific fractional anisotropy (FA) and global mean diffusivity using linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No associations were observed for the regional volumes. We observed a positive association between the MS‐PRS and global FA(β=0.098, standard error (SE)=0.030, p=1.08×10&lt;sup&gt;‐3&lt;/sup&gt;). Tract‐specific analyses showed higher FA and lower radial diffusivity in several tracts. We replicated our findings in an independent sample of children (n=186) who were scanned in an earlier phase (Global FA; β=0.189, SE=0.072, p=9.40×10&lt;sup&gt;‐3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to show that greater genetic predisposition for MS is associated with higher global brain WM FA at an early age in the general population. Our results suggest a pre‐adolescent time‐window within neurodevelopment in which MS risk variants act upon the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have found multiple effectors and cognitive strategies represented within a shared neural substrate in a structure termed &quot;partially mixed selectivity&quot; (Zhang et al., 2017). In this study, we examine whether the structure of these representations is preserved across changes in task context and is thus a robust and generalizable property of the neural population. Specifically, we test whether the structure is conserved from an open-loop motor imagery task (training) to a closed-loop cortical control task (online), a change that has led to substantial changes in neural behavior in prior studies in motor cortex. Recording from a 4 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 4 mm electrode array implanted in PPC of a human tetraplegic patient participating in a brain–machine interface (BMI) clinical trial, we studied the representations of imagined/attempted movements of the left/right hand and compare their individual BMI control performance using a one-dimensional cursor control task. We found that the structure of the representations is largely maintained between training and online control. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the structure observed in the context of an open-loop motor imagery task is maintained and accessible in the context of closed-loop BMI control. These results indicate that it is possible to decode the mixed variables found from a small patch of cortex in PPC and use them individually for BMI control. Furthermore, they show that the structure of the mixed representations is maintained and robust across changes in task context.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Occipital alpha is a prominent rhythm (~10 Hz) detected in electroencephalography (EEG) during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. The rhythm is generated by a subclass of thalamic pacemaker cells that burst at the alpha frequency, orchestrated by the interplay of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) and calcium channels in response to elevated levels of ambient acetylcholine. These oscillations are known to have a lower peak frequency and coherence in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Interestingly, calcium signaling, HCN channel expression and acetylcholine signaling, crucial for orchestrating the alpha rhythm, are also known to be aberrational in AD. In a biophysically detailed network model of the thalamic circuit, we investigate the changes in molecular signaling and the causal relationships between them that lead to a disrupted thalamic alpha in AD. Our simulations show that lowered HCN expression leads to a slower thalamic alpha, which can be rescued by increasing acetylcholine levels, a common therapeutic target of AD drugs. However, this rescue is possible only over a limited range of reduced HCN expression. The model predicts that lowered HCN expression can modify the network activity in the thalamic circuit leading to increased GABA release in the thalamus and disrupt the calcium homeostasis. The changes in calcium signaling make the network more susceptible to noise, causing a loss in rhythmic activity. Based on our results, we propose that reduced frequency and coherence of the occipital alpha rhythm seen in AD may result from down-regulated HCN expression, rather than modified cholinergic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Aggregation of amyloid-beta, modified expression of ion channels and alterations in calcium signaling are hallmarks of AD neurons. Separately, changes in the alpha rhythm is often an early observation in AD patients. We use a realistic computational model of the thalamus to elucidate the causal links between molecular changes in AD and their effect on alpha rhythm. Our model demonstrates that pathology of HCN, crucial for alpha generation, alters calcium signaling, modifies excitation-inhibition balance in the thalamus makes the network more sensitive to noise. Our model, when seen in conjunction with diverse experimental data, posits a causal relationship between the formation of amyloid-beta plaques, the down-regulation of HCN channels and aberrations in the occipital alpha rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Axonal demyelination injury and neuronal degeneration are the primary causes of visual disability in multiple sclerosis-linked optic neuritis (MS/optic neuritis) patients. Immunomodulatory therapies targeting inflammation have failed to avert the disease progression and no therapies exist to prevent the neuronal deficits seen in MS to date. Neuroprotective strategies targeting oligodendrocytes and astroglia have shown limited success due to a lack of axonal regeneration from injured neurons. In this study, we used the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS to investigate the axonal regenerative approach to improve the neuronal function. Our approach focused on targeted knockout of the developmentally regulated axon growth inhibitory Kruppel-like factor 4 (&lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt;) gene in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;mice by intravitreal delivery of AAV2-Cre-ires-EGFP recombinant virus 1) at the time of EAE sensitization, and 2) after the onset of optic neuritis-mediated visual defects in the mice. &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene knockout performed simultaneous with EAE sensitization prevented the visual loss as assessed by pattern electroretinograms (PERG) in the mice and protected the RGCs from EAE mediated death. More importantly, however, &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene knockout after the onset of optic neuritis also resulted in RGC neuroprotection with additional restoration of their function, thereby improving the visual function outcomes in the EAE model. This study establishes the efficacy of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; targeted knockdown in EAE even after the onset of disease symptoms, and thus should be further explored as a potential treatment strategy for MS/Optic neuritis patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Multiple sclerosis is a leading cause of permanent disability in young adults in which effective treatment has remained elusive. The neuroprotective strategies targeting oligodendrocytes and astroglia have shown limited success due to a lack of axonal regeneration from injured neurons. In the current study, we explored the axon regenerative approach to treat MS in mouse model and showed that targeted knockout of axon growth inhibitory &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene in RGCs of EAE mice is efficient in preventing not only the EAE mediated RGC death but also restoring the function of injured axons by facilitating regeneration, and thereby improving the visual function in the mice even after the onset of EAE mediated visual defects.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Population imaging markedly increased the size of functional-imaging
datasets, shedding new light on the neural basis of inter-individual
differences. Analyzing these large data entails new scalability challenges,
computational and statistical. For this reason, brain images are typically
summarized in a few signals, for instance reducing voxel-level measures with
brain atlases or functional modes. A good choice of the corresponding brain
networks is important, as most data analyses start from these reduced signals.
We contribute finely-resolved atlases of functional modes, comprising from 64
to 1024 networks. These dictionaries of functional modes (DiFuMo) are trained
on millions of fMRI functional brain volumes of total size 2.4TB, spanned over
27 studies and many research groups. We demonstrate the benefits of extracting
reduced signals on our fine-grain atlases for many classic functional data
analysis pipelines: stimuli decoding from 12,334 brain responses, standard GLM
analysis of fMRI across sessions and individuals, extraction of resting-state
functional-connectomes biomarkers for 2,500 individuals, data compression and
meta-analysis over more than 15,000 statistical maps. In each of these analysis
scenarii, we compare the performance of our functional atlases with that of
other popular references, and to a simple voxel-level analysis. Results
highlight the importance of using high-dimensional &quot;soft&quot; functional atlases,
to represent and analyse brain activity while capturing its functional
gradients. Analyses on high-dimensional modes achieve similar statistical
performance as at the voxel level, but with much reduced computational cost and
higher interpretability. In addition to making them available, we provide
meaningful names for these modes, based on their anatomical location. It will
facilitate reporting of results.

 &lt;p&gt;Functional connectomes, which are symmetric correlation matrices, have been
used to study changes in brain organization with aging, cognitive abilities and
across a wide range of brain disorders. They have also been shown to provide a
reproducible individual fingerprint, which has opened the possibility of
personalized medicine for neuro/psychiatric disorders. Thus, an accurate way to
compare functional connectomes is essential. Canonically, functional
connectomes are compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient of the entire
functional connectivity profiles. Recently, Venkatesh and colleagues proposed
the use of geodesic distance as a more accurate way of comparing functional
connectomes, one which reflects the underlying non-Euclidean geometry of the
data. They evaluated their approach in the context of participant
identification (or fingerprinting) and showed that it leads to higher
identification rates for all functional MRI conditions assessed. Computing
geodesic distance requires that the functional connectivity matrices being
compared are invertible (or positive-definite). As this requirement depends on
the fMRI scanning length and the parcellation used, it is not always
attainable. Hence Venkatesh and colleagues employed a simple regularization
procedure to ensure that the matrices were invertible. In the present technical
note, we show that regularization is not only crucial for making the functional
connectomes invertible, but also that an optimal magnitude of regularization
can lead to systematically higher identification rates. We also show that this
optimal value of regularization is highly dataset-dependent, and varies as a
function of condition, parcellation, and the number of frames used to compute
the functional connectomes.

 &lt;p&gt;Background / introduction. Vector symbolic architectures (VSA) are a viable
approach for the hyperdimensional representation of symbolic data, such as
documents, syntactic structures, or semantic frames. Methods. We present a
rigorous mathematical framework for the representation of phrase structure
trees and parse-trees of context-free grammars (CFG) in Fock space, i.e.
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space as being used in quantum field theory. We
define a novel normal form for CFG by means of term algebras. Using a recently
developed software toolbox, called FockBox, we construct Fock space
representations for the trees built up by a CFG left-corner (LC) parser.
Results. We prove a universal representation theorem for CFG term algebras in
Fock space and illustrate our findings through a low-dimensional principal
component projection of the LC parser states. Conclusions. Our approach could
leverage the development of VSA for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
by means of hyperdimensional deep neural computation. It could be of
significance for the improvement of cognitive user interfaces and other
applications of VSA in machine learning.

 &lt;p&gt;The human brain contains approximately $10^9$ neurons, each with
approximately $10^3$ connections, synapses, with other neurons. Most sensory,
cognitive and motor functions of our brains depend on the interaction of a
large population of neurons. In recent years, many technologies are developed
for recording large numbers of neurons either sequentially or simultaneously.
An increase in computational power and algorithmic developments have enabled
advanced analyses of neuronal population parallel to the rapid growth of
quantity and complexity of the recorded neuronal activity. Recent studies made
use of dimensionality and model order reduction techniques to extract coherent
features which are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. It has been
observed that the neuronal activity evolves on low-dimensional subspaces. The
aim of model reduction of large-scale neuronal networks is an accurate and fast
prediction of patterns and their propagation in different areas of the brain.
Spatiotemporal features of the brain activity are identified on low dimensional
subspaces with methods such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD), discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) and
combined parameter and state reduction. In this paper, we give an overview of
the currently used dimensionality reduction and model order reduction
techniques in neuroscience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work will be featured as a chapter in the upcoming Handbook on Model
Order Reduction,(P. Benner, S. Grivet-Talocia, A. Quarteroni, G. Rozza, W. H.
A. Schilders, L. M. Silveira, eds, to appear on DE GRUYTER)

 &lt;p&gt;When live imaging is not feasible, sample fixation allows preserving the
ultrastructure of biological samples for subsequent microscopy analysis. This
process could be performed with various methods, each one affecting differently
the biological structure of the sample. While these alterations were
well-characterized using traditional microscopy, little information is
available about the effects of the fixatives on the spatial molecular
orientation of the biological tissue. We tackled this issue by employing
Rotating-Polarization Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (RP-CARS)
microscopy to study the effects of different fixatives on the myelin
sub-micrometric molecular order and micrometric morphology. RP-CARS is a novel
technique derived from CARS microscopy that allows probing spatial orientation
of molecular bonds while maintaining the intrinsic chemical selectivity of CARS
microscopy. By characterizing the effects of the fixation procedures, the
present work represents a useful guide for the choice of the best fixation
technique(s), in particular for polarisation-resolved CARS microscopy. Finally,
we show that the combination of paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde can be
effectively employed as a fixative for RP-CARS microscopy, as long as the
effects on the molecular spatial distribution, here characterized, are taken
into account.

 &lt;p&gt;Although anatomical brain hemispheric asymmetries have been clearly documented in the infant brain, findings concerning functional hemispheric specialization have been inconsistent. The present report aims to assess whether bilaterally symmetric synchronous activity between the two hemispheres is a characteristic of the infant brain. To asses cortical bilateral synchronicity, we used decomposition by independent component analysis (ICA) of high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected in an auditory passive oddball paradigm. Decompositions of concatenated 64-channel EEG data epochs from each of 34 typically developing 6-month-old infants and from 18 healthy young adults participating in the same passive auditory oddball protocol were compared to characterize differences in functional brain organization between early life and adulthood. Our results show that infant EEG decompositions comprised a larger number of independent component (IC) effective source processes compatible with a cortical origin and having bilaterally near-symmetric scalp projections (13.8% of the infant data ICs presented a bilateral pattern vs. 4.3% of the adult data ICs). These IC projections could be modeled as the sum of potentials volume-conducted to the scalp from synchronous locally coherent field activities in corresponding left and right cortical source areas. To conclude, in this paradigm, source-resolved infant brain EEG exhibited more bilateral synchronicity than EEG produced by the adult brain, supporting the hypothesis that more strongly unilateral and likely more functionally specialized unihemispheric cortical field activities are concomitants of brain maturation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) can facilitate motor learning, but it has not been established how stimulation to other brain regions impacts online and offline motor sequence learning, as well as long-term retention. Here, we completed three experiments comparing the effects of tDCS and sham stimulation to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), M1, and the supplementary motor area complex to understand the contributions of these brain regions to motor sequence learning. In Experiment 1, we found that both left and right PFC tDCS groups displayed a slowing in learning in both reaction time and number of chunks, whereas stimulation over M1 improved both metrics over the course of three sessions. To better understand the sequence learning impairment of left PFC anodal stimulation, we tested a left PFC cathodal tDCS group in Experiment 2. The cathodal group demonstrated learning impairments similar to the left PFC anodal stimulation group. In Experiment 3, a subset of participants from the left PFC, M1, and sham tDCS groups of Experiment 1 returned to complete a single session without tDCS on the same sequences assigned to them 1 year previously. We found that the M1 tDCS group reduced reaction time at a faster rate relative to the sham and left PFC groups, demonstrating faster relearning after a one-year delay. Thus, our findings suggest that, regardless of the polarity of stimulation, tDCS to PFC impairs sequence learning, whereas stimulation to M1 facilitates learning and relearning, especially in terms of chunk formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Face and body perception is mediated by configural mechanisms, which allow the perception of these stimuli as a whole, rather than the sum of individual parts. Indirect measures of configural processing in visual cognition are the face and body inversion effects (FIE and BIE), which refer to the drop in performance when these stimuli are perceived upside-down. Albeit FIE and BIE have been well characterized at the behavioral level, much still needs to be understood in terms of the neurophysiological correlates of these effects. Thus, in the current study, the brain’s electrical activity has been recorded by a 128 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in 24 healthy participants while perceiving (upright and inverted) faces, bodies and houses. EEG data were analyzed in both the time domain (i.e., event-related potentials—ERPs) and the frequency domain [i.e., induced theta (5–7 Hz) and gamma (28–45 Hz) oscillations]. ERPs amplitude results showed increased N170 amplitude for inverted faces and bodies (compared to the same stimuli presented in canonical position) but not for houses. ERPs latency results showed delayed N170 components for inverted (vs. upright) faces, houses, but not bodies. Spectral analysis of induced oscillations indicated physiological FIE and BIE; that is decreased gamma-band synchronization over right occipito-temporal electrodes for inverted (vs. upright) faces, and increased bilateral frontoparietal theta-band synchronization for inverted (vs. upright) faces. Furthermore, increased left occipito-temporal and right frontal theta-band synchronization for upright (vs. inverted) bodies was found. Our findings, thus, demonstrate clear differences in the neurophysiological correlates of face and body perception. The neurophysiological FIE suggests disruption of feature binding processes (decrease in occipital gamma oscillations for inverted faces), together with enhanced feature-based attention (increase in frontoparietal theta oscillations for inverted faces). In contrast, the BIE may suggest that structural encoding for bodies is mediated by the first stages of configural processing (decrease in occipital theta oscillations for inverted bodies).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This article reviews current models of verbal working memory and considers the role of language comprehension and long-term memory in the ability to maintain and order verbal information for short periods of time. While all models of verbal working memory posit some interaction with long-term memory, few have considered the character of these long-term representations or how they might affect performance on verbal working memory tasks. Similarly, few models have considered how comprehension processes and production processes might affect performance in verbal working memory tasks. Modern theories of comprehension emphasize that people learn a vast web of correlated information about the language and the world and must activate that information from long-term memory to cope with the demands of language input. To date, there has been little consideration in theories of verbal working memory for how this rich input from comprehension would affect the nature of temporary memory. There has also been relatively little attention to the degree to which language production processes naturally manage serial order of verbal information. The authors argue for an emergent model of verbal working memory supported by a rich, distributed long-term memory for language. On this view, comprehension processes provide encoding in verbal working memory tasks, and production processes maintenance, serial ordering, and recall. Moreover, the computational capacity to maintain and order information varies with language experience. Implications for theories of working memory, comprehension, and production are considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The development of language functions is of great interest to neuroscientists, as these functions are among the fundamental capacities of human cognition. For many years, researchers aimed at identifying cerebral correlates of language abilities. More recently, the development of new data analysis tools has generated a shift toward the investigation of complex cerebral networks. In 2015, Weiss-Croft and Baldeweg published a very interesting systematic review on the development of functional language networks, explored through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Compared to fMRI and because of their excellent temporal resolution, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide different and important information on brain activity. Both therefore constitute crucial neuroimaging techniques for the investigation of the maturation of functional language brain networks. The main objective of this systematic review is to provide a state of knowledge on the investigation of language-related cerebral networks in children, through the use of EEG and MEG, as well as a detailed portrait of relevant MEG and EEG data analysis methods used in that specific research context. To do so, we have summarized the results and systematically compared the methodological approach of 24 peer-reviewed EEG or MEG scientific studies that included healthy children and children with or at high risk of language disabilities, from birth up to 18 years of age. All included studies employed functional and effective connectivity measures, such as coherence, phase locking value, and Phase Slope Index, and did so using different experimental paradigms (e.g., at rest or during language-related tasks). This review will provide more insight into the use of EEG and MEG for the study of language networks in children, contribute to the current state of knowledge on the developmental path of functional connectivity in language networks during childhood and adolescence, and finally allow future studies to choose the most appropriate type of connectivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Representations in the brain are encoded as patterns of activity of large populations of neurons. The science of population encoded representations, also known as parallel distributed processing (PDP), achieves neurological verisimilitude and has been able to account for a large number of cognitive phenomena in normal people, including reaction times (and reading latencies), stimulus recognition, the effect of stimulus salience on attention, perceptual invariance, simultaneous egocentric and allocentric visual processing, top-down/bottom-up processing, language errors, the effect of statistical regularities of experience, frequency, and age of acquisition, instantiation of rules and symbols, content addressable memory and the capacity for pattern completion, preservation of function in the face of noisy or distorted input, inference, parallel constraint satisfaction, the binding problem and gamma coherence, principles of hippocampal function, the location of knowledge in the brain, limitations in the scope and depth of knowledge acquired through experience, and Piagetian stages of cognitive development. PDP studies have been able to provide a coherent account for impairment in a variety of language functions resulting from stroke or dementia in a large number of languages and the phenomenon of graceful degradation observed in such studies. They have also made important contributions to our understanding of attention (including hemispatial neglect), emotional function, executive function, motor planning, visual processing, decision making, and neuroeconomics. The relationship of neural network population dynamics to electroencephalographic rhythms is starting to emerge. Nevertheless, PDP approaches have scarcely penetrated major areas of study of cognition, including neuropsychology and cognitive neuropsychology, as well as much of cognitive psychology. This article attempts to provide an overview of PDP principles and applications that addresses a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Prestimulus alpha oscillations associated with preparatory attention have an impact on response time (RT). However, little is known about whether there is a deficit in the relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and RT in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 28 older adults with MCI and 28 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs) when they were performing an Eriksen flanker task. For each participant, single-trial prestimulus alpha power was calculated for combinations of congruency (congruent vs. incongruent) and response speed (fast vs. slow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Statistical analysis indicated that prestimulus alpha power was significantly lower for fast trials than slow trials in HCs but not in older adults with MCI. The Fisher’s z scores of the within-subject correlation coefficients between single-trial prestimulus alpha power and RT were significantly larger in HCs than in older adults with MCI. In addition, machine learning analyses indicated that prestimulus alpha power and its correlation with RT could serve as features to distinguish older adults with MCI from HCs and to predict performance on some neuropsychological tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The reduced correlation between prestimulus alpha activity and RT suggests that older adults with MCI experience impaired preparatory attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) may simplify control of limb movements by activating certain combinations of muscles together, i.e., muscle synergies. Little is known, however, about the spinal cord interneurons that activate muscle synergies by exciting sets of motoneurons for different muscles. The turtle spinal cord, even without brain inputs and movement-related sensory feedback, can generate the patterns of motoneuron activity underlying forward swimming, three forms of scratching, and limb withdrawal. Spinal interneurons activated during scratching are typically activated during all three forms of scratching, to different degrees, even though each form of scratching has its own knee-hip synergy. Such spinal interneurons are also typically activated rhythmically during scratching motor patterns, with hip-related timing. We proposed a hypothesis that such interneurons that are most active during rostral scratch stimulation project their axons to both knee-extensor and hip-flexor motoneurons, thus generating the rostral scratch knee-hip synergy, while those interneurons most active during pocket scratch stimulation project their axons to both knee-extensor and hip-extensor motoneurons, thus generating the pocket scratch knee-hip synergy. The activity of the entire population would then generate the appropriate synergy, depending on the location of sensory stimulation. Mathematical modeling has demonstrated that this hypothesis is feasible. Here, we provide one test of this hypothesis by injecting two fluorescent retrograde tracers into the regions of knee-extensor motoneurons (more rostrally) and hip-extensor motoneurons (more caudally). We found that there were double-labeled interneurons, which projected their axons to both locations. The dual-projecting interneurons were widely distributed rostrocaudally, dorsoventrally, and mediolaterally within the hindlimb enlargement and pre-enlargement spinal segments examined. The existence of such dual-projecting interneurons is consistent with the hypothesis that they contribute to generating the knee-hip synergy for pocket scratching. The dual-projecting interneurons, however, were only about 1% of the total interneurons projecting to each location, which suggests that they might be one of several contributors to the appropriate knee-hip synergy. Indirect projections to both motor pools and/or knee extensor-dedicated interneurons might also contribute. There is evidence for dual-projecting spinal interneurons in frogs and mice as well, suggesting that they may contribute to limb motor control in a variety of vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Many studies supported that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) can differentiate into neural cells, but few researchers detected mature and function of nerve cells, especially in vivo study. Some researchers even suggested that BM-MSCs transplantation would not be able to differentiate into functional neural cells. To figure out the dispute, this study examined bone marrow-derived sphere-like cells, harvested via neural stem cell suspension culture, then identified as bone marrow-derived neural progenitor cells (BM-NPCs) by finding the expression of neural progenitor cells genes and proteins, neural progenitor cells characteristic and nerve cell differentiation induced through both methods. Moreover, BM-NPCs transplantation showed long-term survival and improved the ethological and histological indexes of brain injury rats, demonstrating functional nervous cells differentiated from BM-NPCs. These in vitro and in vivo results confirmed BM-NPCs differentiating into mature and functional nerve cells. This study provided valuable experimental data for BM-NPCs, suggesting a potential alternative treatment of central nervous injury disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether plasma transferrin levels are associated with longitudinal changes in cognitive performance in older individuals with normal cognition (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: At baseline, there were a total of 358 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, including 58 older individuals with CN, 198 older individuals with MCI, and 102 patients with AD. Linear mixed models were utilized to examine the associations of plasma transferrin levels with changes in cognitive performance over time after adjustment of several potential covariates. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were used to examine the global cognition of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: First, no significant differences in the plasma transferrin levels were observed across three diagnostic groups. Second, in the cross-sectional analyses, the baseline plasma transferrin levels were negatively associated with the MMSE scores in the CN group, but not in the MCI or the AD group. Third, in the longitudinal analyses, we found that a higher plasma transferrin was associated with a steeper cognitive decline in the MCI and AD groups, but not in the CN group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Higher plasma transferrin levels were associated with a steeper cognitive decline in participants with MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocyte (As) bidirectional dialog with neurons plays a fundamental role in major homeostatic brain functions, particularly providing metabolic support and antioxidant self-defense against reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) via the activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of oxidative stress. Disruption of As–neuron crosstalk is chiefly involved in neuronal degeneration observed in Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most common movement disorder characterized by the selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) cell bodies of the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (SNpc). Ventral midbrain (VM)-As are recognized to exert an important role in DAergic neuroprotection via the expression of a variety of factors, including wingless-related MMTV integration site 1 (Wnt1), a principal player in DAergic neurogenesis. However, whether As, by themselves, might fulfill the role of chief players in DAergic neurorestoration of aged PD mice is presently unresolved. Here, we used primary postnatal mouse VM-As as a graft source for unilateral transplantation above the SN of aged 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice after the onset of motor symptoms. Spatio-temporal analyses documented that the engrafted cells promoted: (i) a time-dependent nigrostriatal rescue along with increased high-affinity synaptosomal DA uptake and counteraction of motor deficit, as compared to mock-grafted counterparts; and (ii) a restoration of the impaired microenvironment via upregulation of As antioxidant self-defense through the activation of Nrf2/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suggesting that grafting As has the potential to switch the SN neurorescue-unfriendly environment to a beneficial antioxidant/anti-inflammatory prosurvival milieu. These findings highlight As-derived factors/mechanisms as the crucial key for successful therapeutic outcomes in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The exact cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in modern societies, is still unknown. Many scientists point out that PD is caused by a complex interaction between different factors. Although the main risk factor is age, there are other influences, genetic and environmental, that individually or in combination may trigger neurodegenerative changes leading to PD. Nowadays, research remains focused on better understanding which environmental factors are related to the risk of developing PD and why. In line with the knowledge on evidence on exposures that prevent/delay PD onset or that impact on disease progression, the aims of this review were: (i) to comment on the non-genetic risk factors that mainly affect idiopathic PD; and (ii) to comment on seemingly reliable preventive interventions. We discuss both environmental factors that may affect the central nervous system (CNS) or the intestinal tract, and the likely mechanisms underlying noxious or protective actions. Knowledge on risk, protective factors, and mechanisms may help to envisage why nigral dopaminergic neurons are so vulnerable in PD and, eventually, to design new strategies for PD prevention and/or anti-PD therapy. This article reviews the variety of the known and suspected environmental factors, such as lifestyle, gut microbiota or pesticide exposition, and distinguishes between those that are harmful or beneficial for the PD acquisition or progression. In fact, the review covers one of the most novel players in the whole picture, and we address the role of microbiota on keeping a healthy CNS and/or on preventing the “side-effects” related to aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Chronic electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used tool for monitoring cortical electrical activity in experimental animals. Although chronic implants allow for high-quality, long-term recordings in preclinical studies, the electrodes are foreign objects and might therefore be expected to induce a local inflammatory response. We here analyzed the effects of chronic cranial electrode implantation on glymphatic fluid transport and in provoking structural changes in the meninges and cerebral cortex of male and female mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue and dura revealed reactive gliosis in the cortex underlying the electrodes and extensive meningeal lymphangiogenesis in the surrounding dura. Meningeal lymphangiogenesis was also evident in mice prepared with the commonly used chronic cranial window. Glymphatic influx of a CSF tracer was significantly enhanced at 30 d postsurgery in both awake and ketamine-xylazine anesthetized mice with electrodes, supporting the concept that glymphatic influx and intracranial lymphatic drainage are interconnected. Altogether, the experimental results provide clear evidence that chronic implantation of EEG electrodes is associated with significant changes in the brain's fluid transport system. Future studies involving EEG recordings and chronic cranial windows must consider the physiological consequences of cranial implants, which include glial scarring, meningeal lymphangiogenesis, and increased glymphatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study shows that implantation of extradural electrodes provokes meningeal lymphangiogenesis, enhanced glymphatic influx of CSF, and reactive gliosis. The analysis based on CSF tracer injection in combination with immunohistochemistry showed that chronically implanted electroencephalography electrodes were surrounded by lymphatic sprouts originating from lymphatic vasculature along the dural sinuses and the middle meningeal artery. Likewise, chronic cranial windows provoked lymphatic sprouting. Tracer influx assessed in coronal slices was increased in agreement with previous reports identifying a close association between glymphatic activity and the meningeal lymphatic vasculature. Lymphangiogenesis in the meninges and altered glymphatic fluid transport after electrode implantation have not previously been described and adds new insights to the foreign body response of the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Post-stroke functional recovery can occur spontaneously during the subacute phase; however, how post-stroke fibrotic repair affects functional recovery is highly debated. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)-expressing pericytes are responsible for post-stroke fibrotic repair within infarct areas; therefore, we examined peri-infarct neural reorganization and functional recovery after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) using pericyte-deficient &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Time-dependent reduction of infarct area sizes, i.e., repair, was significantly impaired in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice with recovery of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ischemic areas attenuated by defective leptomeningeal arteriogenesis and intrainfarct angiogenesis. Peri-infarct astrogliosis, accompanied by increased STAT3 phosphorylation, was attenuated in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Pericyte-conditioned medium (PCM), particularly when treated with platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB) homodimer (PDGF-BB; PCM/PDGF-BB), activated STAT3 and enhanced the proliferation and activity of cultured astrocytes. Although peri-infarct proliferation of oligodendrocyte (OL) precursor cells (OPCs) was induced promptly after pMCAO regardless of intrainfarct repair, OPC differentiation and remyelination were significantly attenuated in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Consistently, astrocyte-CM (ACM) promoted OPC differentiation and myelination, which were enhanced remarkably by adding PCM/PDGF-BB to the medium. Post-stroke functional recovery correlated well with the extent and process of intrainfarct repair and peri-infarct oligodendrogenesis. Overall, pericyte-mediated intrainfarct fibrotic repair through PDGFRβ may promote functional recovery through enhancement of peri-infarct oligodendrogenesis as well as astrogliosis after acute ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gp1 mGluRs), including mGluR1 and mGluR5, are critical regulators for neuronal and synaptic plasticity. Dysregulated Gp1 mGluR signaling is observed with various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. It is well established that acute activation of Gp1 mGluRs leads to elevation of neuronal intrinsic excitability and long-term synaptic depression. However, it remains unknown how chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs can affect neural activity and what molecular mechanisms might be involved. In the current study, we employed a multielectrode array (MEA) recording system to evaluate neural network activity of primary mouse cortical neuron cultures. We demonstrated that chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs leads to elevation of spontaneous spike frequency while burst activity and cross-electrode synchronization are maintained at the baseline. We further showed that these neural network properties are achieved through proteasomal degradation of Akt that is dependent on the tumor suppressor p53. Genetically knocking down p53 disrupts the elevation of spontaneous spike frequency and alters the burst activity and cross-electrode synchronization following chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs. Importantly, these deficits can be restored by pharmacologically inhibiting Akt to mimic inactivation of Akt mediated by p53. Together, our findings reveal the effects of chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs on neural network activity and identify a unique signaling pathway involving p53 and Akt for these effects. Our data can provide insights into constitutively active Gp1 mGluR signaling observed in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors are critical effectors of neuroplasticity and essential for neurodevelopment and cognition. Constitutively active Gp1 mGluR signaling has been observed in many pathological conditions but the effects of chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs on neuroplasticity are largely unknown. Our study provides evidence to demonstrate that chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs refines the neural network properties through p53-dependent inactivation of Akt. These findings uncover an unconventional signaling pathway underlying Gp1 mGluR-dependent neuroplasticity and suggest distinct effects following acute versus chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In order to find effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we need
to identify subjects at risk of AD as early as possible. To this end, recently
developed disease progression models can be used to perform early diagnosis, as
well as predict the subjects' disease stages and future evolution. However,
these models have not yet been applied to rare neurodegenerative diseases, are
not suitable to understand the complex dynamics of biomarkers, work only on
large multimodal datasets, and their predictive performance has not been
objectively validated. In this work I developed novel models of disease
progression and applied them to estimate the progression of Alzheimer's disease
and Posterior Cortical atrophy, a rare neurodegenerative syndrome causing
visual deficits. My first contribution is a study on the progression of
Posterior Cortical Atrophy, using models already developed: the Event-based
Model (EBM) and the Differential Equation Model (DEM). My second contribution
is the development of DIVE, a novel spatio-temporal model of disease
progression that estimates fine-grained spatial patterns of pathology,
potentially enabling us to understand complex disease mechanisms relating to
pathology propagation along brain networks. My third contribution is the
development of Disease Knowledge Transfer (DKT), a novel disease progression
model that estimates the multimodal progression of rare neurodegenerative
diseases from limited, unimodal datasets, by transferring information from
larger, multimodal datasets of typical neurodegenerative diseases. My fourth
contribution is the development of novel extensions for the EBM and the DEM,
and the development of novel measures for performance evaluation of such
models. My last contribution is the organization of the TADPOLE challenge, a
competition which aims to identify algorithms and features that best predict
the evolution of AD.

 &lt;p&gt;Functional networks provide a topological description of activity patterns in
the brain, as they stem from the propagation of activity on the anatomical, or
structural network of synaptic connections, which possess a hierarchical
organization. While it is assumed that structural networks shape their
functional counterparts, it is also hypothesized that alterations of brain
activity may come with transformations of functional connectivity, and possibly
its deviation from the hierarchical topology. In this computational study, we
introduce a novel methodology to monitor the persistence and breakdown of
hierarchical order in functional networks, generated from simulations of
activity spreading on both synthetic and real structural connectomes. We show
that hierarchical connectivity is persistent in the quasi-critical regime
associated with optimal processing capabilities and normal brain function
(Griffiths phase) and breaks down in states deviating from this regime, often
associated with pathological conditions. Our results offer important clues for
the study of optimal neurocomputing architectures and processes, which are
capable of tuning patterns of activity and information flow, and show how the
hierarchical topology and its quasi-critical functional counterpart provide an
effective balance between local specialized processing and global integration.

 &lt;p&gt;Many neurodegenerative conditions are characterized by the deposition of protein aggregates (mainly amyloid-like) in the central nervous system (CNS). In post-mitotic CNS cells protein aggregation causes cytotoxicity by interfering with various cellular functions. Mutations in different genes may directly cause protein aggregation. However, genetic factors together with aging may contribute to the onset of protein aggregation also by affecting cellular degradative functions, in particular the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Increasing body of evidence show that ALP dysfunction and protein aggregation are functionally interconnected and induce each other during neurodegenerative processes. We will summarize the findings supporting these concepts by focusing on lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), a class of metabolic inherited conditions characterized by global lysosomal dysfunction and often associated to a severe neurodegenerative course. We propose a model by which the inherited lysosomal defects initiate aggregate-prone protein deposition, which, in turns, worsen ALP degradation function, thus generating a vicious cycle, which boost neurodegenerative cascades.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation (SD) induces hippocampal damage. Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is a neuronal protective factor. Silence information regulating factor 1 (Sirt1) plays an important role in neuroprotection. Therefore, this study was aimed at exploring whether H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S meliorates SD-induced hippocampal damage and whether Sirt1 mediates this protective role of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. We found that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a donor of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) alleviated SD-generated hippocampal oxidative stress, including increases in the activation of SOD and the level of GSH as well as a decrease in the level of MDA. Meanwhile, we found that NaHS reduced SD-exerted hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Stress, including downregulations of GRP78, CHOP, and cleaved-caspase-12 expression. Moreover, NaHS reduced the apoptosis in the SD-exposed hippocampus, and this included decreases in the number of apoptotic cells and the activation of caspase-3, downregulation of Bax expression, and upregulation of Bcl-2 expression. NaHS upregulated the expression of Sirt1 in the hippocampus of SD-exposed rats. Furthermore, Sirtinol, the inhibitor of Sirt1, abrogated the protection of NaHS against SD-exerted hippocampal oxidative stress, ER stress, and apoptosis. These results suggested that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S alleviates SD-induced hippocampal damage by upregulation of hippocampal Sirt1.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Structural and functional brain alterations have been always observed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis. The present study aimed to investigate the gray matter volume (GMV) changes in hemodialysis patients compared with those noted in healthy subjects, as well as explore the associated functional connectivity alterations based on the abnormal GMV regions. The experiments revealed the effects of regional morphometry aberrance on the brain functional integrity. A total of 46 hemodialysis patients (53.11 ± 1.58 years, 28 males) and 47 healthy subjects (55.57 ± 0.86 years, 22 males) were enrolled in the present study. All subjects underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging, resting-state functional MR imaging, and laboratory examinations were performed in hemodialysis patients. The GMV deficits were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and regions with GMV alteration were defined as seeds for functional connectivity analysis. Correlation analyses between significantly different regions and the results of the blood examination were further performed. We found that bilateral thalamus exhibited significantly increased volumes in the hemodialysis patients compared with those of the healthy subjects. However, the bilateral rectus, bilateral caudate, and bilateral temporal gyrus demonstrated significantly decreased volumes. When the regions with GMV alterations were defined as seeds, the hemodialysis patients exhibited decreased integrations in the thalamo-cortical network and within the basal-ganglia connection. The present study revealed the presence of different types of structural and functional brain impairments in hemodialysis patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The processing of self-referential information can be influenced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The present randomized controlled study investigated whether similar effects can be elicited through the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) regarding the “self-serving bias” (SSB) and the “mnemic neglect effect” (MNE). Seventy-five healthy males (M&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 25; SD = 4.3) were investigated in a between-groups design with random assignment by applying anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). After stimulation, the participants judged if 80 personality traits (40 positive, 40 negative) were self-descriptive or not. Finally, the participants had to recall the previously presented adjectives. All three stimulation groups showed the expected SSB and MNE. Still, and contrary to our hypotheses, tDCS revealed neither a significant interaction effect between groups and valence concerning the number of chosen self-referential traits (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,72)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.36, p = 0.26, ηG2 = 0.02) nor an interaction effect between groups, valence, and self-reference concerning the percentage of recalled words (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,71)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.69, p = 0.50, ηG2 = 0.01). However, a post hoc inspection of effect sizes revealed that less negative traits were indicated as self-referential in the anodal compared to the cathodal group (ES: −0.59; CI: −1.16 to −0.03). Moreover, the participants showed—regardless of self-reference and type of stimulation—a better recall with tDCS in comparison to sham stimulation. Our results indicate that tDCS of the mPFC in healthy young men has no influence on the SSB and the MNE. However, tDCS seems to improve memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: In geriatric age, cognitive impairment and cardiovascular disorders are frequent comorbidities. Age-related anatomical and functional cardiac changes, including the autonomic system, could interfere with the control of different cognitive domains. Therefore, we assess the relationship between long-term heart rate variability (HRV), as a measure of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning, and cognitive performance in elderly patients representative of outpatients in a real-life setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Of 155 elderly outpatients (aged &amp;gt;65 years) screened, 117 enrolled patients underwent anthropometric evaluation, cardiac assessment by 12-lead electrocardiogram, 24-h ECG recording, and blood pressure (BP) measurement, as well as global cognitive evaluation by a standardized multidimensional assessment, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA). HRV analysis was performed on 24-h ECG recordings focusing on time-domain indices [Standard deviation of the NN intervals (SDNN), standard deviations of 5-min mean values of the NN intervals for each 5-min interval (SDANN), and root mean squares of successive differences of the NN intervals (RMSSD)] and on frequency-domain measurements [heart rate (HR), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and LF/HF]. Multivariate linear analysis was used to explore the influence of the HRV significant variables on MMSE and MoCA test values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The MMSE and MoCA scores were both significantly and positively correlated with the sympathetic system parameters (SDNN, SDANN, LF, and LF/HF ratio), but not with the parasympathetic system parameters (RMSSD and HF). Multivariate analysis confirms this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our results show that, in a representative real-life community elderly population, an increased sympathetic activity, but not decreased vagal activity, is associated with better cognitive performances. These results support the sympathetic autonomic function, in that the relationship between better cognitive performances and a moderate prevalence of autonomic function appears dependent on long-term changes in heart rate, mediated by sympathetic activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Most modeling in systems neuroscience has been &lt;i&gt;descriptive&lt;/i&gt; where neural representations such as ‘receptive fields’, have been found by statistically correlating neural activity to sensory input. In the traditional physics approach to modelling, hypotheses are represented by &lt;i&gt;mechanistic&lt;/i&gt; models based on the underlying building blocks of the system, and candidate models are validated by comparing with experiments. Until now validation of mechanistic cortical network models has been based on comparison with neuronal spikes, found from the high-frequency part of extracellular electrical potentials. In this computational study we investigated to what extent the low-frequency part of the signal, the local field potential (LFP), can be used to validate and infer properties of mechanistic cortical network models. In particular, we asked the question whether the LFP can be used to accurately estimate synaptic connection weights in the underlying network. We considered the thoroughly analysed Brunel network comprising an excitatory and an inhibitory population of recurrently connected integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. This model exhibits a high diversity of spiking network dynamics depending on the values of only three network parameters. The LFP generated by the network was computed using a hybrid scheme where spikes computed from the point-neuron network were replayed on biophysically detailed multicompartmental neurons. We assessed how accurately the three model parameters could be estimated from power spectra of stationary ‘background’ LFP signals by application of convolutional neural nets (CNNs). All network parameters could be very accurately estimated, suggesting that LFPs indeed can be used for network model validation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/en3vGG03NXk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental cellular process and plays an essential role in development, tissue regeneration, and cancer metastasis. Interestingly, EMT is not a binary process but instead proceeds with multiple partial intermediate states. However, the functions of these intermediate states are not fully understood. Here, we focus on a general question about how the number of partial EMT states affects cell transformation. First, by fitting a hidden Markov model of EMT with experimental data, we propose a statistical mechanism for EMT in which many unobservable microstates may exist within one of the observable macrostates. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of intermediate states can accelerate the EMT process and that adding parallel paths or transition layers may accelerate the process even further. Last, a stabilized intermediate state traps cells in one partial EMT state. This work advances our understanding of the dynamics and functions of EMT plasticity during cancer metastasis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pZ-QQG0UAtA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The Hybrid Automata Library (HAL) is a Java Library developed for use in mathematical oncology modeling. It is made of simple, efficient, generic components that can be used to model complex spatial systems. HAL’s components can broadly be classified into: on- and off-lattice agent containers, finite difference diffusion fields, a GUI building system, and additional tools and utilities for computation and data collection. These components are designed to operate independently and are standardized to make them easy to interface with one another. As a demonstration of how modeling can be simplified using our approach, we have included a complete example of a hybrid model (a spatial model with interacting agent-based and PDE components). HAL is a useful asset for researchers who wish to build performant 1D, 2D and 3D hybrid models in Java, while not starting entirely from scratch. It is available on GitHub at https://github.com/MathOnco/HAL under the MIT License. HAL requires the Java JDK version 1.8 or later to compile and run the source code.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/U835N0G1po4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The first Wnt signaling ligand discovered, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Wingless [Wg (Wnt1 in mammals)], plays critical roles in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development, regulating synaptic architecture, and function. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), consisting of a core protein with heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, bind to Wg ligands to control both extracellular distribution and intercellular signaling function. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; HSPGs previously shown to regulate Wg trans-synaptic signaling at the NMJ include the glypican Dally-like protein (Dlp) and perlecan Terribly Reduced Optic Lobes (Trol). Here, we investigate synaptogenic functions of the most recently described &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; HSPG, secreted Carrier of Wingless (Cow), which directly binds Wg in the extracellular space. At the glutamatergic NMJ, we find that Cow secreted from the presynaptic motor neuron acts to limit synaptic architecture and neurotransmission strength. In c&lt;i&gt;ow&lt;/i&gt; null mutants, we find increased synaptic bouton number and elevated excitatory current amplitudes, phenocopying presynaptic Wg overexpression. We show &lt;i&gt;cow&lt;/i&gt; null mutants exhibit an increased number of glutamatergic synapses and increased synaptic vesicle fusion frequency based both on GCaMP imaging and electrophysiology recording. We find that membrane-tethered Wg prevents &lt;i&gt;cow&lt;/i&gt; null defects in NMJ development, indicating that Cow mediates secreted Wg signaling. It was shown previously that the secreted Wg deacylase Notum restricts Wg signaling at the NMJ, and we show here that Cow and Notum work through the same pathway to limit synaptic development. We conclude Cow acts cooperatively with Notum to coordinate neuromuscular synapse structural and functional differentiation via negative regulation of Wg trans-synaptic signaling within the extracellular synaptomatrix.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The molecular mechanisms governing normal neurodevelopment are tightly regulated by the action of transcription factors. Repressor element 1 (RE1) silencing transcription factor (REST) is widely documented as a regulator of neurogenesis that acts by recruiting corepressor proteins and repressing neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells. The REST corepressor 1 (CoREST1), CoREST2, and CoREST3 are best described for their role as part of the REST complex. However, recent evidence has shown the proteins have the ability to repress expression of distinct target genes in a REST-independent manner. These findings indicate that each CoREST paralogue may have distinct and critical roles in regulating neurodevelopment and are more than simply &quot;REST corepressors,&quot; whereby they act as independent repressors orchestrating biological processes during neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Theta-nested gamma oscillations have been reported in many areas of the brain
and are believed to represent a fundamental mechanism to transfer information
across spatial and temporal scales. In a series of recent experiments in vitro
it has been possible to replicate with an optogenetic theta frequency
stimulation several features of cross-frequency coupling among theta and gamma
rhythms observed in behaving animals. In order to reproduce the main findings
of these experiments we have considered a new class of neural mass models able
to reproduce exactly the macroscopic dynamics of spiking neural networks. In
this framework, we have examined two set-ups able to support collective gamma
oscillations: the pyramidal interneuronal network gamma (PING) and the
interneuronal network gamma (ING). In both set-ups we observe the emergence of
theta-nested gamma oscillations by driving the system with a sinusoidal
theta-forcing in proximity of a Hopf bifurcation. These mixed rhythms display
always phase amplitude coupling. However 2 different types of nested
oscillations can be identified: one characterized by a perfect phase locking
between theta and gamma rhythms, corresponding to an overall periodic
behaviour; another one where the locking is imperfect and the dynamics is
quasi-periodic or even chaotic. From our analysis it emerges that the locked
states are more frequent in the ING set-up. In agreement with the experiments,
we find theta-nested gamma oscillations for forcing frequencies in the range
[1:10] Hz, whose amplitudes grow proportionally to the forcing one and which
are clearly modulated by the theta phase. At variance with experimental
findings, the gamma-power peak does not shift to higher frequencies by
increasing the theta frequency. This effect can be obtained, in or model, only
by incrementing, at the same time, also the noise or the forcing amplitude.

 &lt;p&gt;A potential solution to the weight transport problem, which questions the
biological plausibility of the backpropagation of error algorithm, is proposed.
We derive our method based upon an (approximate) analysis of the dynamics of
leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We thereafter validate our method and show
that the use of spike timing alone out-competes existing biologically plausible
methods for synaptic weight inference in spiking neural network models.
Furthermore, our proposed method is also more flexible, being applicable to any
spiking neuron model, is conservative in how many parameters are required for
implementation and can be deployed in an online-fashion with minimal
computational overhead. These features, together with its biological
plausibility, make it an attractive candidate technique for weight inference at
single synapses.

 &lt;p&gt;The ability to quantify complex relationships within multivariate time series
is a key component of modelling many physical systems, from the climate to
brains and other biophysical phenomena. Unfortunately, even testing the
significance of simple dependence measures, such as Pearson correlation, is
complicated by altered sampling properties when autocorrelation is present in
the individual time series. Moreover, it has been recently established that
commonly used multivariate dependence measures---such as Granger
causality---can produce substantially inaccurate results when applying
classical hypothesis-testing procedures to digitally-filtered time series.
Here, we suggest that the digital filtering-induced bias in Granger causality
is an effect of autocorrelation, and we present a principled statistical
framework for the hypothesis testing of a large family of linear-dependence
measures between multiple autocorrelated time series. Our approach unifies the
theoretical foundations established by Bartlett and others on variance
estimators for autocorrelated signals with the more intricate multivariate
measures of linear dependence. Specifically, we derive the sampling
distributions and subsequent hypothesis tests for any measure that can be
decomposed into terms that involve independent partial correlations, which we
show includes Granger causality and mutual information under a multivariate
linear-Gaussian model. In doing so, we provide the first exact tests for
inferring linear dependence between vector autoregressive processes with
limited data. Using numerical simulations and brain-imaging datasets, we
demonstrate that our newly developed tests maintain the expected false-positive
rate (FPR) with minimally-sufficient samples, while the classical
log-likelihood ratio tests can yield an unbounded FPR depending on the
parameters chosen.

 &lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are the morphological basis of excitatory synapses in the cortex and their size and shape correlates with functional synaptic properties. Recent experiments show that spines exhibit large shape fluctuations that are not related to activity-dependent plasticity but nonetheless might influence memory storage at their synapses. To investigate the determinants of such spontaneous fluctuations, we propose a mathematical model for the dynamics of the spine shape and analyze it in 2D—related to experimental microscopic imagery—and in 3D. We show that the spine shape is governed by a local imbalance between membrane tension and the expansive force from actin bundles that originates from discrete actin polymerization foci. Experiments have shown that only few such polymerization foci co-exist at any time in a spine, each having limited life time. The model shows that the momentarily existing set of such foci pushes the membrane along certain directions until foci are replaced and other directions may now be affected. We explore these relations in depth and use our model to predict shape and temporal characteristics of spines from the different biophysical parameters involved in actin polymerization. Approximating the model by a single recursive equation we finally demonstrate that the temporal evolution of the number of active foci is sufficient to predict the size of the model-spines. Thus, our model provides the first platform to study the relation between molecular and morphological properties of the spine with a high degree of biophysical detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Studies suggest that neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum play an important role in childhood epilepsy. However, these investigations remain controversial due to inconsistent clinical results. The present study aimed to quantitatively summarize and assess whether CSF and serum NSE levels are associated with epilepsy in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : A systematic search of the Harvard Hollis+, Clinicaltrials, Open Gray, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases was performed. Studies investigating NSE and epilepsy were identified and retrieved. Original studies with data overlapping those from other investigations and those lacking the necessary data were excluded. The included studies were extracted and synthesized, and data were analyzed using a random-effects model in R Studio and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Random-effects meta-analysis of 26 studies, including 1,360 patients, and 1,256 healthy control, revealed that childhood epilepsy exhibited meaningfully increased CSF and serum levels of NSE compared with controls [Hedges' g = 1.962 (95% confidence interval, 1.413–2.512); P &amp;lt; 0.001]. No single study meaningfully influenced the overall association between CSF and serum levels of NSE and epilepsy after sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analyses according to sample source and assay type revealed a significant association between NSE levels and epilepsy. Stratified analysis confirmed that NSE levels were significantly correlated with the severity of neurological compromise. Metaregression analyses revealed that sample size, mean age, and sex may contribute to effect-size reductions; however, sample source, assay type, and country did not moderate effect size. Funnel plots constructed using the trim-and-fill method confirmed that the outcome of the meta-analysis could not be due to publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results demonstrated that childhood epilepsy exhibits significantly elevated levels of NSE in the CSF and serum, thus strengthening the association between increased NSE levels and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a widely distributed neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive deficits and pathologically by formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Vanadium is a biological trace element that has a function to mimic insulin for diabetes. Bis(ethylmaltolato) oxidovanadium (IV) (BEOV) has been reported to have a hypoglycemic property, but its effect on AD remains unclear. In this study, BEOV was supplemented at doses of 0.2 and 1.0 mmol/L to the AD model mice APPSwe/PS1dE9 for 3 months. The results showed that BEOV substantially ameliorated glucose metabolic disorder as well as synaptic and behavioral deficits of the AD mice. Further investigation revealed that BEOV significantly reduced Aβ generation by increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and insulin-degrading enzyme and by decreasing β-secretase 1 in the hippocampus and cortex of AD mice. BEOV also reduced tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B and regulating the pathway of insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. Furthermore, BEOV could enhance autophagolysosomal fusion and restore autophagic flux to increase the clearance of Aβ deposits and phosphorylated tau in the brains of AD mice. Collectively, the present study provides solid data for revealing the function and mechanism of BEOV on AD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Many studies in neuroscience use head-fixed behavioral preparations, which confer a number of advantages, including the ability to limit the behavioral repertoire and use techniques for large-scale monitoring of neural activity. But traditional studies using this approach use extremely limited behavioral measures, in part because it is difficult to detect the subtle movements and postural adjustments that animals naturally exhibit during head fixation. Here we report a new head-fixed setup with analog load cells capable of precisely monitoring the continuous forces exerted by mice. The load cells reveal the dynamic nature of movements generated not only around the time of task-relevant events, such as presentation of stimuli and rewards, but also during periods in between these events, when there is no apparent overt behavior. It generates a new and rich set of behavioral measures that have been neglected in previous experiments. We detail the construction of the system, which can be 3D-printed and assembled at low cost, show behavioral results collected from head-fixed mice, and demonstrate that neural activity can be highly correlated with the subtle, whole-body movements continuously produced during head restraint.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, is reported to interfere with cerebral blood flow and microcirculation in patients, but our current understanding is quite limited and the results are often controversial. Here we used longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate dynamic changes in cerebral vessels and velocities of red blood cells (RBC) following mTBI. Closed-head mTBI induced using a controlled cortical impact device resulted in a significant reduction of dwell time in a Rotarod test but no significant change in water maze test. Cerebral blood vessels were repeatedly imaged through a thinned skull window at baseline, 0.5, 1, 6 h, and 1 day following mTBI. In both arterioles and capillaries, their diameters and RBC velocities were significantly decreased at 0.5, 1, and 6 h after injury, and recovered in 1 day post-mTBI. In contrast, decreases in the diameter and RBC velocity of venules occurred only in 0.5–1 h after mTBI. We also observed formation and clearance of transient microthrombi in capillaries within 1 h post-mTBI. We concluded that in vivo two-photon imaging is useful for studying earlier alteration of vascular dynamics after mTBI and that mTBI induced reduction of cerebral blood flow, vasospasm, and formation of microthrombi in the acute stage following injury. These changes may contribute to early brain functional deficits of mTBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The developing nervous system is a complex yet organized system of neurons, glial support cells, and extracellular matrix that arranges into an elegant, highly structured network. The extracellular and intracellular events that guide axons to their target locations have been well characterized in many regions of the developing nervous system. However, despite extensive work, we have a poor understanding of how axonal growth cones interact with surrounding glial cells to regulate network assembly. Glia-to-growth cone communication is either direct through cellular contacts or indirect through modulation of the local microenvironment via the secretion of factors or signaling molecules. Microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, Schwann cells, neural progenitor cells, and olfactory ensheathing cells have all been demonstrated to directly impact axon growth and guidance. Expanding our understanding of how different glial cell types directly interact with growing axons throughout neurodevelopment will inform basic and clinical neuroscientists. For example, identifying the key cellular players beyond the axonal growth cone itself may provide translational clues to develop therapeutic interventions to modulate neuron growth during development or regeneration following injury. This review will provide an overview of the current knowledge about glial involvement in development of the nervous system, specifically focusing on how glia directly interact with growing and maturing axons to influence neuronal connectivity. This focus will be applied to the clinically-relevant field of regeneration following spinal cord injury, highlighting how a better understanding of the roles of glia in neurodevelopment can inform strategies to improve axon regeneration after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, researchers have sought to uncover the biological function of the enigmatic leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) enzyme, a large multi-domain protein with dual GTPase and kinase activities. Originally identified as a familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk gene, variations in LRRK2 are also associated with risk of idiopathic PD, inflammatory bowel disease and susceptibility to bacterial infections. LRRK2 is highly expressed in peripheral immune cells and the potential of LRRK2 to regulate immune and inflammatory pathways has emerged as common link across LRRK2-implicated diseases. This review outlines the current genetic and biochemical evidence linking LRRK2 to the regulation of innate immune inflammatory pathways, including the toll-like receptor and inflammasome pathways. Evidence suggests a complex interplay between genetic risk and protective alleles acts to modulate immune outcomes in a manner dependent on the particular pathogen and cell type invaded.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Exercise enhances cognitive function through increased neurogenesis but can also cause neurogenesis-induced forgetting. It remains unclear whether the diminished memory traces are completely forgotten. Our goals were to determine whether spatial memory is diminished by exercise, and if so, whether the memory is completely gone or whether only the local details disappear but not the acquired strategy. Two-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were trained on a spatial memory task using the Morris water maze and tested to determine that they had learned the platform location. Another mouse group received no training. Half the mice in each group then exercised on a running wheel, while the other half remained sedentary in home cages. After 4 weeks of this, previously trained mice were tested for their retention of the platform location. All mice were then subjected to the task, but the platform was located in a different position (reversal learning for previously trained mice). We found that exercise significantly facilitated the forgetting of the first platform location (i.e., diminished spatial memory) but also significantly enhanced reversal learning. Compared with mice that received no pre-exercise training, mice that had been previously trained, even those in the exercise group that had decreased recall, showed significantly better performance in the reversal learning test. Activation of new adult-born neurons was also examined. Although newborn neuron activation between groups that had or had not received prior task training was not different, activation was significantly higher in exercise groups than in sedentary groups after the probe test for reversal learning. These results indicated that the experience of pre-exercise training equally facilitated new learning in the sedentary and exercise groups, even though significantly lower memory retention was found in the exercise group, suggesting rule-based learning in mice. Furthermore, newborn neurons equally participated in similar and novel memory acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a kind of severe brain injury characterized with a high incidence rate and a high disability rate. Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (LITUS) is a promising neuroprotective method for improving the functional prognosis of TBI. The fractional anisotropy (FA) value and mean diffusivity (MD) value can be sensitive to abnormal brain structure and function and can thus be used to evaluate the effect of LITUS on TBI. Our purpose was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LITUS in a moderate TBI rat model with FA and MD values. For our method, we used 45 male Sprague Dawley rats (15 sham normal, 15 TBI, and 15 LITUS treatment rats). We used single-shot spin echo echo-planar imaging sequences at 3.0T to obtain the DTI parameters. Parameters of FA and MD on the treated side of the injury cortex were measured to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LITUS in a TBI rat model. For FA and MD values, groups were compared by using a two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures, and this was followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Differences were considered significant at P &amp;lt; 0.05. The results were that the FA value in the LITUS treatment group at 1 day after TBI was significantly higher than that in the control group (adjusted P = 0.0422) and significantly lower than that in the TBI group at 14, 21, and 35 days after TBI (adjusted P = 0.0015, 0.0064, and 0.0173, respectively). At the end of the scan time point, the differences between the two groups were not significant (adjusted P = 0.3242). The MD values in the LITUS treatment group were significantly higher in the early stage than that in the TBI group (adjusted P = 0.0167) and significantly lower at the following time points than in the TBI group. In conclusion, daily treatment with LITUS for 10 min effectively improved the brain damage in the Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI)-caused TBI model. FA and MD values can serve as evaluation indicators for the neuro-protective effect of LITUS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A variety of assessment tools are currently available to help clinicians assess Sports Related Concussion (SRC). Currently, the most widely available tools are neither objective nor portable, and are therefore not ideal for assessment at the site and time of a suspected injury. A portable system was developed to deliver a measurement of the steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP). This system involved a smartphone housed in a Google Cardboard frame, which delivered a 15-Hz flicker visual stimulus while an electroencephalography (EEG) headset recorded EEG signals. Sixty-five rugby union players were tested during their regular season and were stratified into healthy, concussed, and recovered groups based on clinical examination. Their SSVEP response was quantified into a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNRs of players in each study group were summarized. Additionally, the SNRs of individual players who had baseline, post-injury, and post-recovery readings were analyzed. Sixty-five participants completed a baseline evaluation to measure their SSVEP. Twelve of these participants sustained a medically diagnosed concussion and completed SSVEP re-testing within 72 h. Eight concussed players received follow-up SSVEP testing after recovery. Concussed participants had a lower SNR [2.20 (2.04–2.38)] when compared to their baseline [4.54 (3.79–5.10)]. When clinically recovered, participant SNR was not significantly different to their baseline [4.82 (4.13–5.18)]. The baseline SNRs of the players who experienced a concussion during the season were not different to those of players who did not experience a concussion [4.80 (4.07–5.68)]. This is the first study to identify differences in SSVEP responses in male amateur rugby union players with and without concussion. It is also the first SSVEP demonstration for concussion evaluation at point-of-care. SSVEPs are significantly attenuated in the presence of concussion in these male athletes. Individuals returned to their baseline SSVEP following clinical recovery from the concussive injury. The use of SSVEPs has the potential to be a supplemental aid for the assessment and management of concussion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Twenty-three young adults (4 Females, 25.13 ± 3.72 years) performed an intermittent maximal handgrip force task using their dominant hand for 20 min (3.5 s squeeze/6.5 s release, 120 blocks) with concurrent cortical activity imaging by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNRIS; OMM-3000, Shimadzu Corp., 111 channels). Subjects were grouped as physically active (n = 10) or inactive (n = 12) based on a questionnaire (active-exercise at least four times a week, inactive- exercise less than two times a week). We explored how motor task fatigue affected the vasomotion-induced oscillations in ΔHbO as measured by fNIRS at each hemodynamic frequency band: endothelial component (0.003–0.02 Hz) associated to microvascular activity, neurogenic component (0.02–0.04 Hz) related to intrinsic neuronal activity, and myogenic component (0.04–0.15 Hz) linked to activity of smooth muscles of arterioles. To help understand how these three neurovascular regulatory mechanisms relate to handgrip task performance we quantified several dynamic fNIRS metrics, including directional phase transfer entropy (dPTE), a computationally efficient and data-driven method used as a marker of information flow between cortical regions, and directional connectivity (DC), a means to compute directionality of information flow between two cortical regions. The relationship between static functional connectivity (SFC) and functional connectivity variability (FCV) was also explored to understand their mutual dependence for each frequency band in the context of handgrip performance as fatigued increased. Our findings ultimately showed differences between subject groups across all fNIRS metrics and hemodynamic frequency bands. These findings imply that physical activity modulates neurovascular control mechanisms at the endogenic, neurogenic, and myogenic frequency bands resulting in delayed fatigue onset and enhanced performance. The dynamic cortical network metrics quantified in this work for young, healthy subjects provides baseline measurements to guide future work on older individuals and persons with impaired cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional brain network (FBN) provides an effective biomarker for understanding brain activation patterns and a diagnostic criterion for neurodegenerative diseases detections. Unfortunately, it remains challenges to estimate the biologically meaningful or discriminative FBNs accurately, because of the poor quality of functional magnetic resonance imaging data or our limited understanding of human brain. In this study, a novel FBN estimation model based on group similarity prior was proposed. In particular, we extended the FBN estimation model to tensor form and incorporated the tensor trace-norm regularizer to formulate the group similarity constraint. To verify the proposed method, we conducted experiments on identifying mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) from normal controls (NCs) based on the estimated FBNs. Experimental results illustrated that our method is effective in modeling FBNs. Consequently, we achieved 91.97% classification accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. The post hoc analysis further demonstrated that more biologically meaningful functional brain connections were obtained using our proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is a common treatment method for menopausal syndrome; however, its therapeutic value for the treatment of neurological diseases is still unclear. Epidemiological studies were performed, and the effect of postmenopausal ERT on treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), was summarized through a meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-one articles were selected using a systematic searching of the contents listed on PubMed and Web of Science before June 1, 2019. Epidemiological studies were extracted, and relevant research data were obtained from the original articles based on the predefined inclusion criteria and data screening principles. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2 software was used to pool effective size, test heterogeneity, conduct meta-regression and subgroup analysis, and to calculate publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our results showed that ERT significantly decreased the risk of onset and/or development of AD [odds ratio (OR): 0.672; 95% CI: 0.581–0.779; P &amp;lt; 0.001] and PD (OR: 0.470; 95% CI: 0.368–0.600; P &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with the control group. A subgroup and meta-regression analysis showed that study design and measure of effect were the source of heterogeneity. Age, sample size, hormone therapy ascertainment, duration of the treatment, or route of administration did not play a significant role in affecting the outcome of the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We presented evidence here to support the use of estrogen therapy for the treatment of AD and PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Monte-Carlo Diffusion Simulations (MCDS) have been used extensively as a ground truth tool for the validation of microstructure models for Diffusion-Weighted MRI. However, methodological pitfalls in the design of the biomimicking geometrical configurations and the simulation parameters can lead to approximation biases. Such pitfalls affect the reliability of the estimated signal, as well as its validity and reproducibility as ground truth data. In this work, we first present a set of experiments in order to study three critical pitfalls encountered in the design of MCDS in the literature, namely, the number of simulated particles and time steps, simplifications in the intra-axonal substrate representation, and the impact of the substrate's size on the signal stemming from the extra-axonal space. The results obtained show important changes in the simulated signals and the recovered microstructure features when changes in those parameters are introduced. Thereupon, driven by our findings from the first studies, we outline a general framework able to generate complex substrates. We show the framework's capability to overcome the aforementioned simplifications by generating a complex crossing substrate, which preserves the volume in the crossing area and achieves a high packing density. The results presented in this work, along with the simulator developed, pave the way toward more realistic and reproducible Monte-Carlo simulations for Diffusion-Weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback (NFB) is an operant conditioning procedure whereby an individual learns to self-regulate the electrical activity of his/her brain. Initially developed as a treatment intervention for pathologies with underlying EEG dysfunctions, NFB is also used as a training tool to enhance specific cognitive states required in high-performance situations. The original idea behind the NFB training effect is that the changes should only be circumscribed to the trained EEG frequencies. The EEG frequencies which are not used as feedback frequencies should be independent and not affected by the neurofeedback training. Despite the success of sensorimotor rhythm NFB training in cognitive performance enhancement, it remains unclear whether all participants can intentionally modify the power densities of specifically selected electroencephalographic (EEG) frequencies. In the present study, participants were randomly assigned to either a control heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback (HRV) training group or a combination of HRV biofeedback and neurofeedback (HRV/NFB) training group. This randomized mixed design experiment consisted of two introductory theoretical lessons and a training period of 6 weeks. We investigated the evolution of the different EEG frequency bands of our two experimental groups across and within session. All the participants exhibited EEG changes across and within session. However, within the HRV/NFB training group, untrained EEG frequencies have been significantly modified, unlike some of the trained frequencies. Moreover, EEG activity was modified in both the HRV group and the HRV/NFB groups. Hence, the EEG changes were not only circumscribed to the trained frequency bands or to the training modality.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). As indispensable elements of the neurovascular unit, they are involved in the inflammatory response and disease-associated processes. Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is released into the extracellular space by neurons and can be internalized by adjacent astrocytes, which activates glial cells to induce neuroinflammation. We were interested in whether astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation is modulated by intracellular iron status and extracellular α-syn. Our results showed that recombinant α-syn (1 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml) treatment for 24 h did not affect the expression of the iron transporters divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and ferroportin 1 (FPN1), nor those of iron regulatory protein (IRP) 1 or IRP2. Several proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 exhibited up-regulated mRNA levels in 5 μg/ml α-syn-treated astrocytes. TNF-α release was increased, indicating that inflammatory responses were triggered in these cells. Pretreatment with the iron-overload reagent ferric ammonium citrate (FAC, 100 μmol/L) for 24 h had no effects on mRNA levels and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Inflammatory responses triggered by α-syn were not affected by iron overload. The iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO, 100 μmol/L) exerted suppressive effects on TNF-α mRNA levels, although no change was observed for TNF-α release. Hepcidin mRNA levels were down-regulated significantly in astrocytes co-treated with FAC and α-syn, although independent treatment with either FAC or α-syn did not alter hepcidin levels. In contrast, hepcidin mRNA levels were up-regulated in DFO and α-syn co-treated cells. As expected, ferritin protein levels were up-regulated or down-regulated with FAC or DFO treatment, respectively. Following the up-regulation of ferritin mediated by α-syn, hepcidin-to-ferritin levels were indicative of modulatory effects in α-syn-treated astrocytes with altered iron status. Therefore, we propose that the hepcidin-to-ferritin ratio is indicative of a detrimental response in primary cultured astrocytes experiencing iron and extracellular α-syn.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Aggregation of α-Synuclein, possibly caused by disturbance of proteostasis, has been identified as a common pathological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the initiating events of aggregation have not been fully illustrated, and this knowledge may be critical to understanding the disease mechanisms of PD. Proteostasis is essential in maintaining normal cellular metabolic functions, which regulate the synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation of proteins. The toxicity of the aggregating proteins is dramatically influenced by its physical and physiological status. Genetic mutations may also affect the metastable phase transition of proteins. In addition, neuroinflammation, as well as lipid metabolism and its interaction with α-Synuclein, are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. In this review article, we will highlight recent progress regarding α-Synuclein proteostasis in the context of PD. We will also discuss how the phase transition status of α-Synuclein could correlate with different functional consequences in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Peroxisomes exist in most cells, where they participate in lipid metabolism, as well as scavenging the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced as by-products of their metabolic functions. In certain tissues such as the liver and kidneys, peroxisomes have more specific roles, such as bile acid synthesis in the liver and steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands. In the brain, peroxisomes are critically involved in creating and maintaining the lipid content of cell membranes and the myelin sheath, highlighting their importance in the central nervous system (CNS). This review summarizes the peroxisomal lifecycle, then examines the literature that establishes a link between peroxisomal dysfunction, cellular aging, and age-related disorders that affect the CNS. This review also discusses the gap of knowledge in research on peroxisomes in the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cuprizone (CPZ)-feeding in mice induces atrophy of peripheral immune organs (thymus and spleen) and suppresses T-cell levels, thereby limiting its use as a model for studying the effects of the immune system in demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To investigate whether castration (Cx) can protect the peripheral immune organs from CPZ-induced atrophy and enable T-cell recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) following a breach of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), three related studies were carried out. In Study 1, Cx prevented the dose-dependent reductions (0.1% &amp;lt; 0.2% CPZ) in thymic and splenic weight, size of the thymic medulla and splenic white pulp, and CD4 and CD8 (CD4/8) levels remained comparable to gonadally intact (Gi) control males. Importantly, 0.1% and 0.2% CPZ were equipotent at inducing central demyelination and glial activation. In Study 2, combining Cx with 0.1% CPZ-feeding and BBB disruption with pertussis toxin (PT) enhanced CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell recruitment into the CNS. The increased CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell level observed in the parenchyma of the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord were confirmed by flow cytometry and western blot analyses of CNS tissue. In Study 3, PT+0.1% CPZ-feeding to Gi female mice resulted in similar effects on the peripheral immune organs, CNS demyelination, and gliosis comparable to Gi males, indicating that testosterone levels alone were not responsible for the immune response seen in Study 2. The combination of Cx+0.1% CPZ-feeding+PT indicates that CPZ-induced demyelination can trigger an “inside-out” immune response when the peripheral immune system is spared and may provide a better model to study the initiating events in demyelinating conditions such as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain structural network changes provide key information about the aging process of the brain. Unfortunately, there has yet to be a detailed characterization of these structural networks across different age groups. Efforts to classify these networks have also been hampered by their reliance on technically limited traditional methods, which are unable to track multiple fiber orientations within a voxel and consequently are prone to false detection and artifacts. In this study, a newly developed Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) based probabilistic tractography method was applied to construct a structural network, with the strength of the link between any two brain functional regions estimated according to the alignment of the EAP along connecting pathways. Age-related changes in the topological organization of human brain structural networks were thereby characterized across a broad age range (ages 8–75 years). The data from 48 healthy participants were divided into four age groups (Group 1 aged 8–15 years; Group 2 aged 25–35 years; Group 3 aged 45–55 years; and, Group 4 aged 65–75 years; N = 12 per group). We found that the brain structural network continues to strengthen during later adolescence and adulthood, through the first 20–30 years of life. Older adults, aged 65–75, had a significantly less optimized topological organization in their structural network, with decreased global efficiency and increased path lengths versus subjects in other groups. This study suggests that probabilistic tractography based on EAP provides a reliable method to construct macroscale structural connectivity networks to capture the age-associated changes of brain structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) generally have reduced risk of developing many types of cancers, except melanoma—a malignant tumor of melanin-producing cells in the skin. For decades, a large number of epidemiological studies have reported that the occurrence of melanoma is higher than expected among subjects with PD, and the occurrence of PD is reciprocally higher than expected among patients with melanoma. More recent epidemiological studies further indicated a bidirectional association, not only in the patients themselves but also in their relatives. This association between PD and melanoma offers a unique opportunity to understand PD. Here, we summarize epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence in regard to shared risk factors and possible underlying mechanisms for these two seemingly distinct conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been proven to alleviate stroke injury in young rats, but its protective effect and its mechanism in aged rats are still unclear. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is one of the important markers of stroke, and its high expression plays an important role in the pathogenesis of stroke. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RIPC could regulate the expression of HIF, leading to reduced inflammatory responses in aged rats. Stroke was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in aged rats, and RIPC was conducted in both hind limbs. The HIF-1α and HIF-2α mRNA and protein were examined by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting (WB). Inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood and brain were measured using AimPlex multiplex immunoassays. The protein levels of p-Akt, Akt, p-ERK, and ERK were examined by WB. We investigated that RIPC reduced the infarct size, improved neurological functions, and decreased the expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in the ischemic brain. RIPC reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ in the peripheral blood and the levels of IL-1β and IFN-γ in the ischemic brain 48 h post-stroke. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of the HIF inhibitor, acriflavine hydrochloride (ACF), abolished the protection of RIPC with respect to infarct size and neurological functions and neutralized the downregulation of pro-inflammatory IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ. ACF also reversed the activation of the Akt signaling pathway induced by RIPC following stroke. HIF may play a key role in RIPC, which was likely mediated by the Akt signaling pathway and systemic modulation of the inflammatory response in aged rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Mean Diffusivity (MD) as measured by diffusion tensor imaging can be used to detect microstructural alterations of the brain’s gray matter (GM). A previous study found that higher education, which is a proxy for cognitive reserve (CR), was related to decreased hippocampal MD in middle-aged healthy adults, indicating decreased microstructural damage in more educated participants. Based on this study, we aimed at determining the role of hippocampal GM MD in the interaction of AD pathology and CR in older people without dementia.
Method: We used a sample of 52 cognitively normal people and 38 participants with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) from the ADNI database. MCI and cognitively normal participants were analyzed separately. Using linear models, we regressed hippocampal GM MD on CR (quantified by a composite score), amyloid status and the interaction of both, adjusting for age, gender and memory score. 
Results: CR was not associated with hippocampal GM MD and hippocampal GM volume. Also, no interaction of amyloid status and CR was found.
Conclusions: Our results do not confirm an association of CR and hippocampal GM MD in older adults. In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between CR and microstructural, nor macrostructural alterations of the hippocampus in older adults. More research is needed to determine the influence of CR on hippocampal microstructural integrity in relation to age and AD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene play an important role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the APOE-ε4 allele is an established genetic risk factor for AD, while the APOE-ε2 allele is a protective factor against AD. However, the mechanism underlying this impact of APOE genotype on the pathogenesis of AD remain unclear. This study sought to investigate the influence of APOE genotype on cognition and neuroimaging features in cognitively normal (CN) elderly individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 177 participants were selected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, including 101 MCI patients and 76 CN individuals. A 2 × 3 (consisting of 2 groups and 3 APOE genotypes) analysis of covariance was carried out to measure the influences of diagnosis and APOE genotype on cognition and brain features, assessed based on global functional connectivity density (gFCD) and hippocampal volume. In addition, a mediation analysis was carried out to investigate the indirect influence of neuroimaging features on the relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive performance in the MCI group. This analysis revealed that APOE genotype had an influence on brain function in the bilateral precentral gyrus, right thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex. In addition, an interactive influence between diagnosis and APOE genotype was found on general cognition, immediate memory, executive function, hippocampal volume, and gFCD in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, this mediation analysis revealed that hippocampal volume and gFCD in the thalamus may mediate the relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive performance in the MCI group. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the genetically guided pathogenic mechanisms of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain magnetic resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Some automatic segmentation tools are already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL) based methods have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is achieved with three main steps: (1) a U-Net based segmentation, (2) a shape model estimation and (3) a second U-Net based segmentation which uses both the original input data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on image data of three diagnostic groups (AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and controls) from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of context information (i.e. autocontext and tissue-class context). Our results suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in cross-cohort validation, i.e. when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied to another. However, no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort validation, i.e. training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. Moreover, compared to other types of context information, the use of shape context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Automatic segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning of MS. Recent years have seen an increasing use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for this task. Although these methods provide accurate segmentation, their applicability in clinical settings remains limited due to a reproducibility issue across different image domains. MS images can have highly variable characteristics across patients, MRI scanners and imaging protocols; retraining a supervised model with data from each new domain is not a feasible solution because it requires manual annotation from expert radiologists. In this work, we explore an unsupervised solution to the problem of domain shift. We present a framework, Seg-JDOT, which adapts a deep model so that samples from a source domain and samples from a target domain sharing similar representations will be similarly segmented. We evaluated the framework on a multi-site dataset, MICCAI 2016, and showed that the adaptation toward a target site can bring remarkable improvements in a model performance over standard training.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Integrity of functional brain networks is closely associated with maintained cognitive performance at old age. Consistently, both carrier status of Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4), and age-related aggregation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology result in altered brain network connectivity. The posterior cingulate and precuneus (PCP) is a node of particular interest due to its role in crucial memory processes. Moreover, the PCP is subject to the early aggregation of AD pathology. The current study aimed at characterizing brain network properties associated with unimpaired cognition in old aged adults. To determine the effects of age-related brain change and genetic risk for AD, pathological proteins β-amyloid and tau were measured by Positron-emission tomography (PET), PCP connectivity as a proxy of cognitive network integrity, and genetic risk by APOE4 carrier status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fifty-seven cognitively unimpaired old-aged adults (MMSE = 29.20 ± 1.11; 73 ± 8.32 years) were administered 11C Pittsburgh Compound B and 18F Flutemetamol PET for assessing β-amyloid, and 18F AV-1451 PET for tau. Individual functional connectivity seed maps of the PCP were obtained by resting-state multiband BOLD functional MRI at 3-Tesla for increased temporal resolution. Voxelwise correlations between functional connectivity, β-amyloid- and tau-PET were explored by Biological Parametric Mapping (BPM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Local β-amyloid was associated with increased connectivity in frontal and parietal regions of the brain. Tau was linked to increased connectivity in more spatially distributed clusters in frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, and cerebellar regions. A positive interaction was observable for APOE4 carrier status and functional connectivity with brain regions characterized by increased local β-amyloid and tau tracer retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our data suggest an association between spatially differing connectivity systems and local β-amyloid, and tau aggregates in cognitively normal, old-aged adults, which is moderated by APOE4. Additional longitudinal studies may determine protective connectivity patterns associated with healthy aging trajectories of AD-pathology aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To characterize trajectories of normative cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older persons without dementia at study enrollment (n = 1,010) had annual cognitive testing for up to 24 years (mean = 9.9 years, standard deviation = 5.0), died, and underwent a neuropathologic examination to quantify 9 postmortem markers of common neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. To accommodate the heterogeneity in cognitive trajectories, we used functional mixed effects models, which allow individuals to have different patterns of cognitive decline under a unified model structure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a functional mixed effects model, postmortem markers (Alzheimer disease pathology, Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA‐binding protein 43 pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, atherosclerosis, gross infarcts) were associated with global cognitive decline. Residual global cognitive decline after adjustment for neuropathologic burden was weakly related to age at death; it occurred in only about one‐third of participants, mostly proximate to death. Results were comparable after eliminating the initial cognitive assessments to minimize retest learning or controlling for frailty proximate to death. Analyses were also conducted with composite measures of episodic memory and perceptual speed. Residual decline not attributable to neuropathologic burden was confined to a subset for each outcome and was most evident proximate to death. Age at death was unrelated to residual decline in episodic memory but was related to residual decline in perceptual speed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late life cognitive loss mainly reflects non‐normative pathologic and mortality‐related processes rather than normative age‐related processes. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X‐linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired‐pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS‐theta burst stimulation was used to probe long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short‐interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long‐interval intracortical inhibition (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). LTP‐like plasticity in M1 was abolished (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We describe a model of neurological disease based on dysfunctional brain oscillators. This is not a new model, but it is not one that is widely appreciated by clinicians. The value of this model lies in the predictions it makes and the utility it provides in translational applications, in particular for neuromodulation devices. Specifically, we provide a perspective on devices that provide input to sensory receptors and thus stimulate endogenous sensory networks. Current forms of clinically applied neuromodulation, including devices such as (implanted) deep brain stimulators (DBS) and various, noninvasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial current methods (tACS, tDCS), have been studied extensively. The potential strength of neuromodulation of a sensory organ is access to the same pathways that natural environmental stimuli use and, importantly, the modulatory signal will be transformed as it travels through the brain, allowing the modulation input to be consistent with regional neuronal dynamics. We present specific examples of devices that rely on sensory neuromodulation and evaluate the translational potential of these approaches. We argue that sensory neuromodulation is well suited to, ideally, repair dysfunctional brain oscillators, thus providing a broad therapeutic approach for neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) is an extensively used organophosphate in industry. It has been proven to lead to toxicity in different organ systems, especially in the nervous system. Neural stem cells (NSCs) play important roles in both embryonic and adult nervous systems. However, whether TOCP induces cytotoxicity in embryonic NSCs remains unclear. In this study, mouse NSCs were exposed to different concentrations of TOCP for 24 h. The results showed that TOCP led to impaired proliferation of NSCs and induced the autophagy of NSCs by increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2). Melatonin has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects via various mechanisms. Therefore, we further investigate whether melatonin has potential protective effects against TOCP-induced cytotoxicity on NSCs. Our data showed that melatonin pretreatment attenuated TOCP-induced autophagy by suppressing oxidative stress and restoring ERK1/2 phosphorylation consistently. Taken together, the results indicated that TOCP induced the autophagy in mouse NSCs, and melatonin may effectively protect NSCs against TOCP-induced autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The expression of contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), one of the major cellular components of the neurovascular unit (NVU), has been revealed recently. However, the physiological role of Caspr1 in BMECs remains unclear. We previously reported the nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid protein precursor (APP) pathway in the human BMECs (HBMECs). In this study, we found Caspr1 depletion reduced the levels of soluble amyloid protein precursor α (sAPPα) in the supernatant of HBMECs, which could be rescued by expression of full-length Caspr1. Our further results showed that ADAM9, the α-secretase essential for processing of APP to generate sAPPα, was decreased in Caspr1-depleted HBMECs. The reduced sAPPα secretion in Caspr1-depleted HBMECs was recovered by expression of exogenous ADAM9. Then, we identified that Caspr1 specifically regulates the expression of ADAM9, but not ADAM10 and ADAM17, at transcriptional level by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Caspr1 knockout attenuated the activation of NF-κB and prevented the nuclear translocation of p65 in brain endothelial cells, which was reversed by expression of full-length Caspr1. The reduced sAPPα production and ADAM9 expression upon Caspr1 depletion were effectively recovered by NF-κB agonist. The results of luciferase assays indicated that the NF-κB binding sites are located at −859 bp to −571 bp of ADAM9 promoter. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Caspr1 facilitates sAPPα production by transcriptional regulation of α-secretase ADAM9 in brain endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential neurotrophic factors and expression of neurotrophin receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells linked with the antidepressant action of exercise intervention during protracted methamphetamine (METH) abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: A total of 72 male METH addicts, including 47 individuals with depression and 25 individuals without depression, were recruited in this study. Individuals with depression were divided into the depression control group and the depression exercised group. Consequently, 12 weeks of supervised exercise intervention was applied. Depression and anxiety were analyzed; plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neuronal growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), NT-4, and proBDNF levels were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the mRNA expressions of TrkA, TrkB-FL, TrkB-T1, TrkCB, and P75NTR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: NT-4 plasma levels were correlated with depression (r = −0.330, p = 0.005), which remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In addition, the BDNF and NT-3 levels in the plasma were significantly correlated with depression (r = −0.268, p = 0.023; r = −0.259, p = 0.028), but did not reach significance after Bonferroni correction. The BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 plasma levels were significantly different between the depressive control group and the depressive exercise group using pre-exercise values as the covariate. The fold changes in TrkB-FL and TrkB-T1 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between the post-exercise and pre-exercise demonstrated a remarkable decrease (fold change = −11.056 and −39.055).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Exercise intervention can alleviate depression and anxiety during protracted METH abstinence. Decrease in BDNF and the expression of TrkB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occur following the exercise intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The motor system has the flexibility to update motor plans according to systematic changes in the environment or the body. This capacity is studied in the laboratory through sensorimotor adaptation paradigms imposing sustained and predictable motor demands specific to the task at hand. However, these studies are tied to the laboratory setting. Thus, we asked if a portable device could be used to elicit locomotor adaptation outside the laboratory. To this end, we tested the extent to which a pair of motorized shoes could induce similar locomotor adaptation to split-belt walking, which is a well-established sensorimotor adaptation paradigm in locomotion. We specifically compared the adaptation effects (i.e. after-effects) between two groups of young, healthy participants walking with the legs moving at different speeds by either a split-belt treadmill or a pair of motorized shoes. The speeds at which the legs moved in the split-belt group was set by the belt speed under each foot, whereas in the motorized shoes group were set by the combined effect of the actuated shoes and the belts’ moving at the same speed. We found that the adaptation of joint motions and measures of spatial and temporal asymmetry, which are commonly used to quantify sensorimotor adaptation in locomotion, were indistinguishable between groups. We only found small differences in the joint angle kinematics during baseline walking between the groups – potentially due to the weight and height of the motorized shoes. Our results indicate that robust sensorimotor adaptation in walking can be induced with a paired of motorized shoes, opening the exciting possibility to study sensorimotor adaptation during more realistic situations outside the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cocaine use disorder and methamphetamine use disorder are chronic, relapsing disorders with no US Food and Drug Administration-approved interventions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation tool that has been increasingly investigated as a possible therapeutic intervention for substance use disorders. rTMS may have the ability to induce beneficial neuroplasticity in abnormal circuits and networks in individuals with addiction. The aim of this review is to highlight the rationale and potential for rTMS to treat cocaine and methamphetamine dependence: we synthesize the outcomes of studies in healthy humans and animal models to identify and understand the neurobiological mechanisms of rTMS that seem most involved in addiction, focusing on the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. rTMS-induced changes to neurotransmitter systems include alterations to striatal dopamine release and metabolite levels, as well as to glutamate transporter and receptor expression, which may be relevant for ameliorating the aberrant plasticity observed in individuals with substance use disorders. We also discuss the clinical studies that have used rTMS in humans with cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders. Many such studies suggest changes in network connectivity following acute rTMS, which may underpin reduced craving following chronic rTMS. We suggest several possible future directions for research relating to the therapeutic potential of rTMS in addiction that would help fill current gaps in the literature. Such research would apply rTMS to animal models of addiction, developing a translational pipeline that would guide evidence-based rTMS treatment of cocaine and methamphetamine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Successful navigation relies on the flexible and appropriate use of metric representations of space or topological knowledge of the environment. Spatial dimensions (2D vs. 3D), spatial scales (vista-scale vs. large-scale environments) and the abundance of visual landmarks critically affect navigation performance and behavior in healthy human subjects. Virtual reality (VR)-based navigation paradigms in stationary position have given insight into the major navigational strategies, namely egocentric (body-centered) and allocentric (world-centered), and the cerebral control of navigation. However, VR approaches are biased towards optic flow and visual landmark processing. This major limitation can be overcome to some extent by increasingly immersive and realistic VR set-ups (including large-screen projections, eye tracking and use of head-mounted camera systems). However, the highly immersive VR settings are difficult to apply particularly to older subjects and patients with neurological disorders because of cybersickness and difficulties with learning and conducting the tasks. Therefore, a need for the development of novel spatial tasks in real space exists, which allows a synchronous analysis of navigational behavior, strategy, visual explorations and navigation-induced brain activation patterns. This review summarizes recent findings from real space navigation studies in healthy subjects and patients with different cognitive and sensory neurological disorders. Advantages and limitations of real space navigation testing and different VR-based navigation paradigms are discussed in view of potential future applications in clinical neurology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The hippocampal formation plays a vital role in memory formation and takes part in the control of the default neuronal network activity of the brain. It also represents an important structure to analyze drug-induced effects on subregion-specific synchronization of neuronal activity. However, the consequences of an altered functional state of synapses for subregion-specific synchronization of neuronal microcircuits remain to be fully understood. Therefore, we analyzed the direct interaction of neuronal microcircuits utilizing a genetically encoded calcium sensor (GCaMP6s) and local field potential (LFP) recording in acute hippocampal–entorhinal brain slices in response to a modulator of synaptic transmission. We observed that application of the eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) inhibitor A484954, induced a large-scale synchronization of neuronal activity within different regions of the hippocampal formation. This effect was confirmed by the recording of extracellular LFPs. Further, in order to understand if the synchronized activity depended on interconnected hippocampal areas, we lesioned adjacent regions from each other. These experiments identified the origin of A484954-induced synchronized activity in the hippocampal CA3 subfield localized near the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Remarkably, the synchronization of neuronal activity in the hippocampus required an intact connection with the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). In line with this observation, we detected an increase in neuronal activity in the MEC area after application of A484954. In summary, inhibition of eEF2K alters the intrinsic activity of interconnected neuronal microcircuits dominated by the MEC–CA3 afferents.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cerebral ischemia injury can result in neuronal death and/or functional impairment, which leads to further damage and dysfunction after recovery of blood supply. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) often causes irreversible brain damage and neuronal injury and death, which involves many complex pathological processes including oxidative stress, amino acid toxicity, the release of endogenous substances, inflammation and apoptosis. Oxidative stress and inflammation are interactive and play critical roles in ischemia/reperfusion injury in the brain. Oxidative stress is important in the pathological process of ischemic stroke and is critical for the cascade development of ischemic injury. Oxidative stress is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cerebral ischemia and is more likely to lead to cell death and ultimately brain death after reperfusion. During reperfusion especially, superoxide anion free radicals, hydroxyl free radicals, and nitric oxide (NO) are produced, which can cause lipid peroxidation, inflammation and cell apoptosis. Inflammation alters the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in cerebral ischemic injury. Inflammatory factors can therefore stimulate or exacerbate inflammation and aggravate ischemic injury. Neuroprotective therapies for various stages of the cerebral ischemia cascade response have received widespread attention. At present, neuroprotective drugs mainly include free radical scavengers, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-apoptotic agents. However, the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between oxidative stress and inflammation, and their interplay with different types of programmed cell death in ischemia/reperfusion injury are unclear. The development of a suitable method for combination therapy has become a hot topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a class of G-protein-coupled receptors found in mammals. While TAAR1 is expressed in several brain regions, all the other TAARs have been described mainly in the olfactory epithelium and the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and are believed to serve as a new class of olfactory receptors sensing innate odors. However, there is evidence that TAAR5 could play a role also in the central nervous system. In this study, we characterized a mouse line lacking TAAR5 (TAAR5 knockout, TAAR5-KO) expressing beta-galactosidase mapping TAAR5 expression. We found that TAAR5 is expressed not only in the glomerular layer in the olfactory bulb but also in deeper layers projecting to the limbic brain olfactory circuitry with prominent expression in numerous limbic brain regions, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the amygdala, the hippocampus, the piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. TAAR5-KO mice did not show gross developmental abnormalities but demonstrated less anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in several behavioral tests. TAAR5-KO mice also showed significant decreases in the tissue levels of serotonin and its metabolite in several brain areas and were more sensitive to the hypothermic action of serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propilamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). These observations indicate that TAAR5 is not just innate odor-sensing olfactory receptor but also serves to provide olfactory input into limbic brain areas to regulate emotional behaviors likely via modulation of the serotonin system. Thus, anxiolytic and/or antidepressant action of future TAAR5 antagonists could be predicted. In general, “olfactory” TAAR-mediated brain circuitry may represent a previously unappreciated neurotransmitter system involved in the transmission of innate odors into emotional behavioral responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This study presents a computational model of closed-loop control of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson’s disease (PD) to investigate clinically viable control schemes for suppressing pathological beta-band activity. Closed-loop DBS for PD has shown promising results in preliminary clinical studies and offers the potential to achieve better control of patient symptoms and side effects with lower power consumption than conventional open-loop DBS. However, extensive testing of algorithms in patients is difficult. The model presented provides a means to explore a range of control algorithms in silico and optimize control parameters before preclinical testing. The model incorporates (i) the extracellular DBS electric field, (ii) antidromic and orthodromic activation of STN afferent fibers, (iii) the LFP detected at non-stimulating contacts on the DBS electrode and (iv) temporal variation of network beta-band activity within the thalamo-cortico-basal ganglia loop. The performance of on-off and dual-threshold controllers for suppressing beta-band activity by modulating the DBS amplitude were first verified, showing levels of beta suppression and reductions in power consumption comparable with previous clinical studies. Proportional (P) and proportional-integral (PI) closed-loop controllers for amplitude and frequency modulation were then investigated. A simple tuning rule was derived for selecting effective PI controller parameters to target long duration beta bursts while respecting clinical constraints that limit the rate of change of stimulation parameters. Of the controllers tested, PI controllers displayed superior performance for regulating network beta-band activity whilst accounting for clinical considerations. Proportional controllers resulted in undesirable rapid fluctuations of the DBS parameters which may exceed clinically tolerable rate limits. Overall, the PI controller for modulating DBS frequency performed best, reducing the mean error by 83% compared to DBS off and the mean power consumed to 25% of that utilized by open-loop DBS. The network model presented captures sufficient physiological detail to act as a surrogate for preclinical testing of closed-loop DBS algorithms using a clinically accessible biomarker, providing a first step for deriving and testing novel, clinically suitable closed-loop DBS controllers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that assessment of brain connectivity may shed light on the underpinnings of ocular hypertension (OHT), characterized by raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and no typical glaucomatous findings. OHT carries a risk for future glaucoma development, thus representing a model of presymptomatic condition. In previous studies on glaucoma, we showed altered brain connectivity since the early stage and in case of normal IOP. In this pilot study, we used a multimodal MRI approach by modeling voxelwise measures of gray matter volume, anatomical connectivity along white matter(WM) tracts, and large-scale functional connectivity in OHT subjects (n = 18, age: 58.3 ± 9.8 years) and demographically matched normal controls (n = 29). While OHT brain had no structural alterations, it showed significantly decreased functional connectivity in key cognitive networks [default mode network, frontoparietal working memory network (WMN), ventral attention network (VAN), and salience network (SN)] and altered long-range functional connectivity, which was decreased between default mode and SNs and increased between primary and secondary visual networks (VN). Overall, such findings seem to delineate a complex neuroplasticity in the OHT brain, where decreased functional connectivity in non-visual networks may reflect a type of temporarily downregulated functional reserve while increased functional connectivity between VN may be viewed as a very early attempt of adaptive functional reorganization of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The olfactory neuroepithelium is located in the upper vault of the nasal cavity, lying on the olfactory cleft and projecting into the dorsal portion of the superior and middle turbinates beyond the mid-portion of the nasal septum. It is composed of a variety of cell types including olfactory sensory neurons, supporting glial-like cells, microvillar cells, and basal stem cells. The cells of the neuroepithelium are often intermingled with respiratory and metaplastic epithelial cells. Olfactory neurons undergo a constant self-renewal in the timespan of 2–3 months; they are directly exposed to the external environment, and thus they are vulnerable to physical and chemical injuries. The latter might induce metabolic perturbations and ultimately be the cause of cell death. However, the lifespan of olfactory neurons is biologically programmed, and for this reason, these cells have an accelerated metabolic cycle leading to an irreversible apoptosis. These characteristics make these cells suitable for research related to nerve cell degeneration and aging. Recent studies have shown that a non-invasive and painless olfactory brushing procedure allows an efficient sampling from the olfactory neuroepithelium. This approach allows to detect the pathologic prion protein in patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, using the real-time quaking-induced conversion assay. Investigating the expression of all the proteins associated to neurodegeneration in the cells of the olfactory mucosa is a novel approach toward understanding the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to investigate the expression of α-synuclein, β-amyloid, tau, and TDP-43 in the olfactory neurons of normal subjects. We showed that these proteins that are involved in neurodegenerative diseases are expressed in olfactory neurons. These findings raise the question on whether a relationship exists between the mechanisms of protein aggregation that occur in the olfactory bulb during the early stage of the neurodegenerative process and the protein misfolding occurring in the olfactory neuroepithelium.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insufficient sleep has been considered a seizure trigger in people with epilepsy for thousands of years. Here, we reviewed the evidence upon which this axiomatic association might be predicated. After evaluating evidence suggesting insufficient sleep as an EEG activator, we systematically reviewed the literature for longitudinal studies measuring the effect of insufficient sleep on seizure risk. Ultimately, published works designed to prove a causal relationship were of low level of evidence and disagreed with one another. Despite the idea's deep‐seated nature, when considering causal evidence only, no conclusion can be made regarding the relationship between insufficient sleep and seizure risk.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ensemble classifiers have been proven to result in better classification accuracy than that of a single strong learner in many machine learning studies. Although many studies on electroencephalography-brain-computer interface (BCI) used ensemble classifiers to enhance the BCI performance, ensemble classifiers have hardly been employed for near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-BCIs. In addition, since there has not been any systematic and comparative study, the efficacy of ensemble classifiers for NIRS-BCIs remains unknown. In this study, four NIRS-BCI datasets were employed to evaluate the efficacy of linear discriminant analysis ensemble classifiers based on the bootstrap aggregating. From the analysis results, significant (or marginally significant) increases in the bitrate as well as the classification accuracy were found for all four NIRS-BCI datasets employed in this study. Moreover, significant bitrate improvements were found in two of the four datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00073"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress has long been implicated in the pathophysiology and progression of Huntington’s disease (HD). Uric acid (UA) is a naturally occurring antioxidant that is present in the brain and periphery. Growing evidence has implicated UA as a molecular biomarker for several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, we investigated UA levels in clinical samples from HD patients and normal controls (NCs) and assessed potential relationships between UA levels and disease and clinical data. UA levels were measured in plasma (n = 107) and saliva (n = 178) samples from premanifest (pre-HD) and manifest HD patients and control subjects. Gender effects of UA levels were observed in both biofluids, with male patients showing higher UA levels compared to female patients. Comparisons of UA levels across diagnostic groups, separated by gender, revealed that both plasma and salivary UA levels were significantly lower in female pre-HD and manifest HD patients compared to NCs. Salivary levels of UA were also significantly lower in male manifest HD patients versus controls, but not in plasma. Correlations of peripheral UA levels to clinical data also showed differences according to gender. In male HD patients, both plasma and salivary UA levels were significantly negatively correlated with total functional capacity (TFC), while positive correlations were observed with total motor score (TMS). Female HD patients showed a significant positive correlation between plasma UA levels and TMS, while salivary UA levels from female patients were significantly correlated to disease burden. Finally, in a separate cohort, we show that UA levels are decreased in postmortem prefrontal cortical samples (n = 20) from HD subjects compared to matched controls. These findings suggest that decreased levels of UA in the brains of HD patients can be reflected in peripheral fluids, with salivary measures of UA particularly offering significant promise as a potentially relevant, non-invasive biomarker of disease symptoms and burden. Our findings further highlight the impact of sexual dimorphism in HD pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 It is with tremendous sadness that we reflect upon the recent, unexpected death of Ronald Stanton Duman, PhD, beloved husband, father, brother, colleague, and friend. Ron died suddenly on February 2 while hiking in Guilford, Connecticut, one of his favorite pastimes, just 5 days shy of his 66th birthday. Every person who ever met Ron—from members of his laboratory and faculty to countless colleagues around the country who reached out in sympathy to our own children—viewed Ron as a uniquely kind, honest, generous, and thoughtful man.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;How are the complex maps for orientation selectivity (OS) created in the primary visual cortex (V1)? Rodents and rabbits have a random distribution of OS preferences across V1 while in cats, ferrets, and all primates cells with similar OS preferences cluster together into relatively wide cortical columns. Given other clear similarities in the organization of the visual pathways, why is it that maps coding OS preferences are so radically different? Prominent models have been created of cortical OS mapping that incorporate Hebbian plasticity, intracortical interactions, and the properties of growing axons. However, these models suggest that the maps arise primarily through intracortical interactions. Here we focus on several other features of the visual system and brain that may influence V1 structure. These are: eye divergence, the total number of cells in V1, the thalamocortical networks, the topography of the retina and phylogeny. We outline the evidence for and against these factors contributing to map formation. One promising theory is that the central-to-peripheral ratio (CP ratio) of retinal cell density can be used to predict whether or not a species has pinwheel maps. Animals with high CP ratios (&amp;gt;7) have orientation columns while those with low CP ratios (&amp;lt;4) have random OS maps. The CP ratio is related to the total number of cells in cortex, which also appears to be a reasonable contributing factor. However, while these factors correlate with map structure to some extent, there is a gray area where certain species do not fit elegantly into the theory. A problem with the existing literature is that OS maps have been investigated in only a small number of mammals, from a small fraction of the mammalian phylogenetic tree. We suggest four species (agouti, fruit bat, sheep, and wallaby) that have a range of interesting characteristics, which sit at intermediate locations between primates and rodents, that make them good targets for filling in the missing gaps in the literature. We make predictions about the map structures of these species based on the organization of their brains and visual systems and, in doing so, set possible paths for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The propensity to engage in risky behaviors including excessive alcohol consumption may impose increased medical, emotional, and psychosocial burdens. Personality and behavioral traits of individuals may contribute in part to the involvement in risky behaviors, and therefore the classification of one’s traits may help identify those who are at risk for future onset of the addictive disorder and related behavioral issues such as alcohol misuse. Personality and behavioral characteristics including impulsivity, anger, reward sensitivity, and avoidance were assessed in a large sample of healthy young adults (n = 475). Participants also underwent diffusion tensor imaging for the analysis of structural brain networks. A data-driven clustering using personality and behavioral traits of the participants identified four subtypes. As compared with individuals clustered into the neutral type, individuals with a high level of impulsivity (A subtype) and those with high levels of reward sensitivity, impulsivity, anger, and avoidance (B subtype) showed significant associations with problem drinking. In contrast, individuals with high levels of impulsivity, anger, and avoidance but not reward sensitivity (C subtype) showed a pattern of social drinking that was similar to those of the neutral subtype. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis with ridge estimators was applied to demonstrate the neurobiological relevance for the identified subtypes according to distinct patterns of structural brain connectivity within the addiction circuitry [neutral vs. A subtype, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67–0.81; neutral vs. B subtype, AUC = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.66–0.82; neutral vs. C subtype, AUC = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.70–0.84]. The current findings enable the characterization of individuals according to subtypes based on personality and behavioral traits that are also corroborated by neuroimaging data and may provide a platform to better predict individual risks for addictive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex and not fully understood pathogenesis. Besides brain-intrinsic hallmarks such as abnormal deposition of harmful proteins, i.e., amyloid beta in plaques and hyperphosphorylated Tau in neurofibrillary tangles, blood-derived elements, in particular, platelets have been discussed to be involved in AD pathogenesis. The underlying mechanisms, however, are rather unexplored. Here, we investigate a potential role of platelets in an AD transgenic animal model with severe amyloid plaque formation, the APP-PS1 transgenic mice, and analyzed the presence, spatial location and activation status of platelets within the brain. In APP-PS1 mice, a higher number of platelets were located within the brain parenchyma, i.e., outside the cerebral blood vessels compared to WT controls. Such platelets were activated according to the expression of the platelet activation marker CD62P and to morphological hallmarks such as membrane protrusions. In the brain, platelets were in close contact exclusively with astrocytes suggesting an interaction between these two cell types. In the bloodstream, although the percentage of activated platelets did not differ between transgenic and age-matched control animals, APP-PS1 blood-derived platelets showed remarkable ultrastructural peculiarities in platelet-specific organelles such as the open canalicular system (OCS). This work urges for further investigations on platelets and their yet unknown functional roles in the brain, which might go beyond AD pathogenesis and be relevant for various age-related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synchronization of neural activity across brain regions is critical to processes that include perception, learning, and memory. After traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuronal degeneration is one possible effect and can alter communication between neural circuits. Consequently, synchronization between neurons may change and can contribute to both lasting changes in functional brain networks and cognitive impairment in patients. However, fundamental principles relating exactly how TBI at the cellular scale affects synchronization of mesoscale circuits are not well understood. In this work, we use computational networks of Izhikevich integrate-and-fire neurons to study synchronized, oscillatory activity between clusters of neurons, which also adapt according to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We study how the connections within and between these neuronal clusters change as unidirectional connections form between the two neuronal populations. In turn, we examine how neuronal deletion, intended to mimic the temporary or permanent loss of neurons in the mesoscale circuit, affects these dynamics. We determine synchronization of two neuronal circuits requires very modest connectivity between these populations; approximately 10% of neurons projecting from one circuit to another circuit will result in high synchronization. In addition, we find that synchronization level inversely affects the strength of connection between neuronal microcircuits – moderately synchronized microcircuits develop stronger intercluster connections than do highly synchronized circuits. Finally, we find that highly synchronized circuits are largely protected against the effects of neuronal deletion but may display changes in frequency properties across circuits with targeted neuronal loss. Together, our results suggest that strongly and weakly connected regions differ in their inherent resilience to damage and may serve different roles in a larger network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human intelligence is constituted by a multitude of cognitive functions activated either directly or indirectly by external stimuli of various kinds. Computational approaches to the cognitive sciences and to neuroscience are partly premised on the idea that computational simulations of such cognitive functions and brain operations suspected to correspond to them can help to further uncover knowledge about those functions and operations, specifically, how they might work together. These approaches are also partly premised on the idea that empirical neuroscience research, whether following on from such a simulation (as indeed simulation and empirical research are complementary) or otherwise, could help us build better artificially intelligent systems. This is based on the assumption that principles by which the brain seemingly operate, to the extent that it can be understood as computational, should at least be tested as principles for the operation of artificial systems. This paper explores some of the principles of the brain that seem to be responsible for its autonomous, problem-adaptive nature. The brain operating system (BrainOS) explicated here is an introduction to ongoing work aiming to create a robust, integrated model, combining the connectionist paradigm underlying neural networks and the symbolic paradigm underlying much else of AI. BrainOS is an automatic approach that selects the most appropriate model based on the (a) input at hand, (b) prior experience (a history of results of prior problem solving attempts), and (c) world knowledge (represented in the symbolic way and used as a means to explain its approach). It is able to accept diverse and mixed input data types, process histories and objectives, extract knowledge and infer a situational context. BrainOS is designed to be efficient through its ability to not only choose the most suitable learning model but to effectively calibrate it based on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Analog-digital facilitations (ADFs) have been described in local excitatory brain circuits and correspond to a class of phenomena describing how subthreshold variations of the presynaptic membrane potential influence spike-evoked synaptic transmission. In many brain circuits, ADFs rely on the propagation of somatic membrane potential fluctuations to the presynaptic bouton where they modulate ion channels availability, inducing modifications of the presynaptic spike waveform, the spike-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry, and the transmitter release. Therefore, one major requirement for ADFs to occur is the propagation of subthreshold membrane potential variations from the soma to the presynaptic bouton. To date, reported ADFs space constants are relatively short (250–500 μm) which limits their action to proximal synapses. However, ADFs have been studied either in unmyelinated axons or in juvenile animals in which myelination is incomplete. We examined here the potential gain of ADFs spatial extent caused by myelination using a realistic model of L5 pyramidal cell. Myelination of the axon was found to induce a 3-fold increase in the axonal length constant. As a result, the different forms of ADF were found to display a much longer spatial extent (up to 3,000 μm). In addition, while the internodal length displayed a mild effect, the number of myelin wraps ensheathing the internodes was found to play a critical role in the ADFs spatial extents. We conclude that axonal myelination induces an increase in ADFs spatial extent in our model, thus making ADFs plausible in long-distance connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neonatal brain development relies on a combination of critical factors inclusive of genetic predisposition, attachment, and the conditions of the pre and postneonatal environment. The status of the infant’s developing brain in its most vulnerable state and the impact that physiological elements of music, silences and sounds may make in the earliest stages of brain development can enhance vitality. However, little attention has been focused on the integral aspects of the music itself. This article will support research that has hypothesized conditions of music therapeutic applications in an effort to further validate models of neurobehavioral care that have optimized conditions for growth, inclusive of recommendations leading toward the enhancement of self-regulatory behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Robust cross-subject emotion recognition based on multichannel EEG has always been hard work. In this work, we hypothesize that there exist default brain variables across subjects in emotional processes. Hence, the states of the latent variables that relate to emotional processing must contribute to building robust recognition models. Specifically, we propose to utilize an unsupervised deep generative model (e.g., variational autoencoder) to determine the latent factors from the multichannel EEG. Through a sequence modeling method, we examine the emotion recognition performance based on the learnt latent factors. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified on two public datasets (DEAP and SEED) and compared with traditional matrix factorization-based (ICA) and autoencoder-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that autoencoder-like neural networks are suitable for unsupervised EEG modeling, and our proposed emotion recognition framework achieves an inspiring performance. As far as we know, it is the first work that introduces variational autoencoder into multichannel EEG decoding for emotion recognition. We think the approach proposed in this work is not only feasible in emotion recognition but also promising in diagnosing depression, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, etc., whose specific latent processes may be altered or aberrant compared with the normal healthy control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Many in the neuroscience community were surprised and saddened to learn of Bruce McEwen’s sudden passing on January 2, 2020 after a brief illness. Several of us had interacted with Bruce recently, read his recent publications, and saw no signs of his enthusiasm for science or productivity waning despite being close to his 82nd birthday. Given that Bruce had a larger-than-life capacity for generating, storing, and integrating scientific knowledge, and a seemingly never-failing enthusiasm for stress neurobiology and neuroendocrinology in general, it seemed as though he would live forever.</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT‐HD, TRACK‐HD, and IMAGE‐HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease‐affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (&amp;gt;0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of &amp;gt;80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide the first cross‐study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We previously created a prosthetic hand with a tacit learning system (TLS) that automatically supports the control of forearm pronosupination. This myoelectric prosthetic hand enables sensory feedback and flexible motor output, which allows users to move efficiently with minimal burden. In this study, we investigated whether electroencephalography can be used to analyze the influence of the auxiliary function of the TLS on brain function. Three male participants who had sustained below-elbow amputations and were myoelectric prosthesis users performed a series of physical movement trials with the TLS inactivated and activated. Trials were video recorded and a sequence of videos was prepared to represent each individual’s own use while the system was inactivated and activated. In a subsequent motor imagery phase during which electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected, each participant was asked to watch both videos of themself while actively imagining the physical movement depicted. Differences in mean cortical current and amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) values between supplementary motor areas (SMA) and each vertex were calculated. For all participants, there were differences in the mean cortical current generated by the motor imagery tasks when the TLS inactivated and activated conditions were compared. The AEC values were higher during the movement imagery task with TLS activation, although their distribution on the cortex varied between the three individuals. In both S1 and other brain areas, AEC values increased in conditions with the TLS activated. Evidence from this case series indicates that, in addition to motor control, TLS may change sensory stimulus recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cortex is crucial for many behaviors, ranging from sensory-based behaviors to working memory and social behaviors. To gain an in-depth understanding of the contribution to these behaviors, cellular and sub-cellular recordings from both individual and populations of cortical neurons are vital. However, techniques allowing such recordings, such as two-photon imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology, require absolute stability of the head, a requirement not often fulfilled in freely moving animals. Here, we review and compare behavioral paradigms that have been developed and adapted for the head-fixed preparation, which together offer the needed stability for live recordings of neural activity in behaving animals. We also review how the head-fixed preparation has been used to explore the function of primary sensory cortices, posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and anterior lateral motor (ALM) cortex in sensory-based behavioral tasks, while also discussing the considerations of performing such recordings. Overall, this review highlights the head-fixed preparation as allowing in-depth investigation into the neural activity underlying behaviors by providing highly controllable settings for precise stimuli presentation which can be combined with behavioral paradigms ranging from simple sensory detection tasks to complex, cross-modal, memory-guided decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in 1995, our understanding of its role continues to expand as research progresses. In particular, its role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has drawn increasing interest in recent years. TDP-43 may participate in various pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD, such as amyloid β deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Because AD is complex and heterogeneous, and because of the distinct characteristics of TDP-43, mostly seen in the oldest-old and those with more severe clinical phenotype, subcategorization based on specific features or biomarkers may significantly improve diagnosis and treatment. AD-like cognitive dysfunction associated with TDP-43 pathology may therefore be a distinct encephalopathy, referred to as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Several approaches can be used to estimate neural activity. The main differences between them concern the a priori information used and its sensitivity to high noise levels. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been recently applied to electroencephalography EEG-based neural activity reconstruction to provide a priori time-frequency information to improve the estimation of neural activity. EMD has the specific ability to identify independent oscillatory modes in non-stationary signals with multiple oscillatory components. However, attempts to use EMD in EEG analysis have not yet provided optimal reconstructions, due to the intrinsic mode-mixing problem of EMD. Several studies have used single-channel analysis, whereas others have used multiple-channel analysis for other applications. Here, we present the results of multiple-channel analysis using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to reduce the mode-mixing problem and provide useful a priori time-frequency information for the reconstruction of neuronal activity using several low-density EEG electrode montages. The methods were evaluated using real and synthetic EEG data, in which the reconstructions were performed using the multiple sparse priors (MSP) algorithm with EEG electrode montages of 32, 16, and 8 electrodes. The quality of the source reconstruction was assessed using the Wasserstein metric. A comparison of the solutions without pre-processing and those after applying MEMD showed the source reconstructions to be improved using MEMD as a priori information for the low-density montages of 8 and 16 electrodes. The mean source reconstruction error on a real EEG dataset was reduced by 59.42 and 66.04% for the 8 and 16 electrode montages, respectively, and that on a simulated EEG with three active sources, by 87.31 and 31.45% for the same electrode montages.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Current neural prostheses can restore limb movement to tetraplegic patients by translating brain signals coding movements to control a variety of actuators. Fast and accurate somatosensory feedback is essential for normal movement, particularly dexterous tasks, but is currently lacking in motor neural prostheses. Attempts to restore somatosensory feedback have largely focused on cortical stimulation which, thus far, have succeeded in eliciting minimal naturalistic sensations. Yet, a question that deserves more attention is whether the cortex is the best place to activate the central nervous system to restore somatosensation. Here, we propose that the brainstem dorsal column nuclei are an ideal alternative target to restore somatosensation. We review some of the recent literature investigating the dorsal column nuclei functional organization and neurophysiology and highlight some of the advantages and limitations of the dorsal column nuclei as a future neural prosthetic target. Recent evidence supports the dorsal column nuclei as a potential neural prosthetic target, but also identifies several gaps in our knowledge as well as potential limitations which need to be addressed before such a goal can become reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is highly prevalent in older adults. The main clinical feature is the progressive decline of memory function, which eventually leads to the decline of cognitive function. At present, the pathogenesis of AD is unclear. In the disease process, synaptic changes are the key. Recent studies have shown that the dysregulation of RNA methylation is related to many biological processes, including neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification in eukaryotic RNA. In this study, RNA m6A methylation was quantified in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, which is an AD mouse model, and C57BL/6 control mice, and data showed that m6A methylation was elevated in the cortex and the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Next, the alterations of m6A RNA methylation in AD and in C57BL/6 mice were investigated using high-throughput sequencing. Genome-wide maps of m6A mRNA showed that the degrees of m6A methylation were higher in many genes and lower in others in AD mice. Interestingly, the expression of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 was elevated and that of the m6A demethylase FTO was decreased in AD mice. The data were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, and pathways that might be related to synaptic or neuron development and growth were constructed. The related pathways and genes predicted the potential roles of the differentially expressed m6A methylation RNA in AD. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the m6A methylation of RNA promotes the development of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Studies demonstrated that spinal autophagy was impaired in spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rats. However, the relationship of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER-phagy and whether dexmedetomidine (DEX) modulates ER-phagy remain unclear. In this study, male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats and the SNL animal model were used. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), tunicamycin (TM), rapamycin (RAP), and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were intrathecally administered, respectively to demonstrate the relationship of ER stress and ER-phagy. Dexmedetomidine (30 μg/kg) was administered as treatment. Mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) tests were performed to evaluate nociceptive hypersensitivity. Protein expressions were examined by Western blot, and the location of glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) was examined by immunofluorescence staining. SNL induced ER stress and ER-phagy impairment. ER stress was altered in rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM); 4-phenylbutyric acid induced analgesic effect via inhibiting ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways to induce ER-phagy; tunicamycin led to worsening pain through enhancing ER stress and UPR pathways to further impair ER-phagy. Rapamycin provided analgesic effect through enhancing ER-phagy to relieve SNL-induced ER stress and UPR pathway activation; 3-methyladenine deteriorated pain via further impairing ER-phagy to aggravate ER stress. Dexmedetomidine provided analgesic effect through elevating ER-phagy. In conclusion, ER stress led to ER-phagy impairment in the spinal cord of SNL rats and participated in the nociceptive descending system. ER-phagy impairment was both a trigger and an effector of ER stress via UPR pathways in SNL rats. Dexmedetomidine targeted ER-phagy to provide analgesic effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases sharing spasticity in lower limbs as common symptom. There is a large clinical variability in the presentation of patients, partly underlined by the large genetic heterogeneity, with more than 60 genes responsible for HSP. Despite this large heterogeneity, the proteins with known function are supposed to be involved in a limited number of cellular compartments such as shaping of the endoplasmic reticulum or endolysosomal function. Yet, it is difficult to understand why alteration of such different cellular compartments can lead to degeneration of the axons of cortical motor neurons. A common feature that has emerged over the last decade is the alteration of lipid metabolism in this group of pathologies. This was first revealed by the identification of mutations in genes encoding proteins that have or are supposed to have enzymatic activities on lipid substrates. However, it also appears that mutations in genes affecting endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or endolysosome function can lead to changes in lipid distribution or metabolism. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of lipid metabolism alterations in the physiopathology of HSP, to evaluate how such alterations contribute to neurodegenerative phenotypes, and to understand how this knowledge can help develop therapeutic strategy for HSP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;High-fidelity measurements of neural activity can enable advancements in our understanding of the neural basis of complex behaviors such as speech, audition, and language, and are critical for developing neural prostheses that address impairments to these abilities due to disease or injury. We develop a novel high resolution, thin-film micro-electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) array that enables high-fidelity surface measurements of neural activity from songbirds, a well-established animal model for studying speech behavior. With this device, we provide the first demonstration of sensory-evoked modulation of surface-recorded single unit responses. We establish that single unit activity is consistently sensed from micro-ECoG electrodes over the surface of sensorimotor nucleus HVC (used as a proper name) in anesthetized European starlings, and validate responses with correlated firing in single units recorded simultaneously at surface and depth. The results establish a platform for high-fidelity recording from the surface of subcortical structures that will accelerate neurophysiological studies, and development of novel electrode arrays and neural prostheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Automatic alignment of brain anatomy in a standard space is a key step when processing magnetic resonance imaging for group analyses. Such brain registration is prone to failure, and the results are therefore typically reviewed visually to ensure quality. There is however no standard, validated protocol available to perform this visual quality control (QC). We propose here a standardized QC protocol for brain registration, with minimal training overhead and no required knowledge of brain anatomy. We validated the reliability of three-level QC ratings (OK, Maybe, Fail) across different raters. Nine experts each rated N = 100 validation images, and reached moderate to good agreement (kappa from 0.4 to 0.68, average of 0.54 ± 0.08), with the highest agreement for “Fail” images (Dice from 0.67 to 0.93, average of 0.8 ± 0.06). We then recruited volunteers through the Zooniverse crowdsourcing platform, and extracted a consensus panel rating for both the Zooniverse raters (N = 41) and the expert raters. The agreement between expert and Zooniverse panels was high (kappa = 0.76). Overall, our protocol achieved a good reliability when performing a two level assessment (Fail vs. OK/Maybe) by an individual rater, or aggregating multiple three-level ratings (OK, Maybe, Fail) from a panel of experts (3 minimum) or non-experts (15 minimum). Our brain registration QC protocol will help standardize QC practices across laboratories, improve the consistency of reporting of QC in publications, and will open the way for QC assessment of large datasets which could be used to train automated QC systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates local translation in dendrites and spines for synaptic plasticity. In axons, FMRP is implicated in axonal extension and axon guidance. We previously demonstrated the involvement of FMRP in growth cone collapse via a translation-dependent response to Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A), a repulsive axon guidance factor. In the case of attractive axon guidance factors, RNA-binding proteins such as zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) accumulate towards the stimulated side of growth cones for local translation. However, it remains unclear how Sema3A effects FMRP localization in growth cones. Here, we show that levels of FMRP in growth cones of hippocampal neurons decreased after Sema3A stimulation. This decrease in FMRP was suppressed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 enzyme inhibitor PYR-41 and proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in Sema3A-induced FMRP degradation in growth cones. Moreover, the E1 enzyme or proteasome inhibitor suppressed Sema3A-induced increases in microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) in growth cones, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway promotes local translation of MAP1B, whose translation is mediated by FMRP. These inhibitors also blocked the Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. Collectively, our results suggest that Sema3A promotes degradation of FMRP in growth cones through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to growth cone collapse via local translation of MAP1B. These findings reveal a new mechanism of axon guidance regulation: degradation of the translational suppressor FMRP via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The plasticity of the central nervous system (CNS) in response to neuronal activity has been suggested as early as 1894 by Cajal (1894). CNS plasticity has first been studied with a focus on neuronal structures. However, in the last decade, myelin plasticity has been unraveled as an adaptive mechanism of importance, in addition to the previously described processes of myelin repair. Indeed, it is now clear that myelin remodeling occurs along with life and adapts to the activity of neuronal networks. Until now, it has been considered as a two-part dialog between the neuron and the oligodendroglial lineage. However, other glial cell types might be at play in myelin plasticity. In the present review, we first summarize the key structural parameters for myelination, we then describe how neuronal activity modulates myelination and finally discuss how other glial cells could participate in myelinic adaptivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated neuronal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. They are involved in fear behavior, learning, neurodegeneration after ischemic stroke and in pain sensation. ASIC activation has so far been studied only with fast pH changes, although the pH changes associated with many roles of ASICs are slow. It is currently not known whether slow pH changes can open ASICs at all. Here, we investigated to which extent slow pH changes can activate ASIC1a channels and induce action potential signaling. To this end, ASIC1a current amplitudes and charge transport in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, and ASIC-mediated action potential signaling in cultured cortical neurons were measured in response to defined pH ramps of 1–40 s duration from pH 7.4 to pH 6.6 or 6.0. A kinetic model of the ASIC1a current was developed and integrated into the Hodgkin-Huxley action potential model. Interestingly, whereas the ASIC1a current amplitude decreased with slower pH ramps, action potential firing was higher upon intermediate than fast acidification in cortical neurons. Indeed, fast pH changes (&amp;lt;4 s) induced short action potential bursts, while pH changes of intermediate speed (4–10 s) induced longer bursts. Slower pH changes (&amp;gt;10 s) did in many experiments not generate action potentials. Computer simulations corroborated these observations. We provide here the first description of ASIC function in response to defined slow pH changes. Our study shows that ASIC1a currents, and neuronal activity induced by ASIC1a currents, strongly depend on the speed of pH changes. Importantly, with pH changes that take &amp;gt;10 s to complete, ASIC1a activation is inefficient. Therefore, it is likely that currently unknown modulatory mechanisms allow ASIC activity in situations such as ischemia and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by chronic progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system, which brings an enormous burden on patients, their families, and society. It is difficult to make early diagnosis, resulting from the insidious onset and progressive development of neurodegenerative diseases. The drugs on the market cannot cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) effectively, which leads to unfavorable prognosis and less effective treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to develop a novel detection method and therapeutic strategies. Recently, nanomedicine has aroused considerable attention for diagnosis and therapy of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Nanoparticles integrate targeting, imaging, and therapy in one system and facilitate the entry of drug molecules across the blood–brain barrier, offering new hope to patients. In this review, we summarize the application of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We focus on IONPs as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) and drug carriers in AD. What most neurodegenerative diseases have in common is that hall marker lesions are represented by protein aggregates (Soto and Pritzkow, 2018). These diseases are of unknown etiology and unfavorable prognosis, and the treatments toward them are less effective (Soto and Pritzkow, 2018). Such diseases usually develop in aged people, and early clinical manifestations are atypical, resulting in difficulty in early diagnosis. Recently, nanomedicine has aroused considerable attention for therapy and diagnosis of CNS diseases because it integrates targeting, imaging, and therapy in one system (Gupta et al., 2019). In this review article, we first introduce the neurodegenerative diseases and commonly used MRI CAs. Then we review the application of IONPs in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with the purpose of assisting early theranostics (therapy and diagnosis).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the projections the cerebrospinal fluid-contacting (CSF-contacting) nucleus receives from the diencephalon and to speculate on the functional significance of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CB) was injected into the CSF-contacting nucleus in SD rats according to the experimental formula of the stereotaxic coordinates. Animals were perfused 7–10 days after the injection, and the diencephalon was sliced at 40 μm with a freezing microtome. CB-immunofluorescence was performed on all diencephalic sections. The features of CB-positive neuron distribution in the diencephalon were observed with a fluorescence microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The retrograde labeled CB-positive neurons were found in the epithalamus, subthalamus, and hypothalamus. Three functional diencephalic areas including 43 sub-regions revealed projections to the CSF-contacting nucleus. The CB-positive neurons were distributed in different density ranges: sparse, moderate, and dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Based on the connectivity patterns of the CSF-contacting nucleus that receives anatomical inputs from the diencephalon, we preliminarily assume that the CSF-contacting nucleus participates in homeostasis regulation, visceral activity, stress, emotion, pain and addiction, and sleeping and arousal. The present study firstly illustrates the broad projections of the CSF-contacting nucleus from the diencephalon, which implies the complicated functions of the nucleus especially for the unique roles of coordination in neural and body fluids regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Activity and expression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic isoform, PIK3CD/p110δ, is increased in schizophrenia, autism, and intellectual delay and pro-cognitive preclinical efficacy of p110δ-inhibition has been demonstrated in pharmacological, genetic, and developmental rodent models of psychiatric disorders. Although PI3K signaling has been implicated in the development and function of neurons and glia; isoform-specific roles of the individual PI3Ks are less clear and the biological effects of increased p110δ on neuronal development are unknown. Since the pathobiological direction of p110δ changes in neurodevelopmental disorders are increased expression and activity, we hypothesized that overexpression of p110δ would impact measures of neuronal development and maturation relevant to connectivity and synaptic transmission. p110δ overexpression in primary rat hippocampal cultures significantly reduced dendritic morphogenesis and arborization and increased immature and mature dendritic spine densities, without impacting cell viability, soma size, or axon length. Together, our novel findings demonstrate the importance of homeostatic regulation of the p110δ isoform for normative neuronal development and highlight a potential pathophysiological mechanism of association to disorders of neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Stroke is a leading health issue, with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Of all strokes, approximately 80% of cases are ischemic stroke (IS). However, the underlying mechanisms of the occurrence of acute IS remain poorly understood because of heterogeneous and multiple factors. More potential biomarkers are urgently needed to reveal the deeper pathogenesis of IS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We identified potential biomarkers in rat brain tissues of IS using an iTRAQ labeling approach coupled with LC-MS/MS. Furthermore, bioinformatrics analyses including GO, KEGG, DAVID, and Cytoscape were used to present proteomic profiles and to explore the disease mechanisms. Additionally, Western blotting for target proteins was conducted for further verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We identified 4,578 proteins using the iTRAQ-based proteomics method. Of these proteins, 282 differentiated proteins, comprising 73 upregulated and 209 downregulated proteins, were observed. Further bioinformatics analysis suggested that the candidate proteins were mainly involved in energy liberation, intracellular protein transport, and synaptic plasticity regulation during the acute period. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated a series of representative pathological pathways, including energy metabolite, long-term potentiation (LTP), and neurodegenerative disease-related pathways. Moreover, Western blotting confirmed the associated candidate proteins, which refer to oxidative responses and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings highlight the identification of candidate protein biomarkers and provide insight into the biological processes involved in acute IS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Canine adenovirus-2 (CAV) is a canine pathogen that has been used in a variety of applications, from vaccines against more infectious strains of CAV to treatments for neurological disorders. With recent engineering, CAV has become a natural choice for neuroscientists dissecting the connectivity and function of brain circuits. Specifically, as a reliable genetic vector with minimal immunogenic and cytotoxic reactivity, CAV has been used for the retrograde transduction of various types of projection neurons. Consequently, CAV is particularly useful when studying the anatomy and functions of long-range projections. Moreover, combining CAV with conditional expression and transsynaptic tracing results in the ability to study circuits with cell- and/or projection-type specificity. Lastly, with the well-documented knowledge of viral transduction, new innovations have been developed to increase the transduction efficiency of CAV and circumvent its tropism, expanding the potential of CAV for circuit analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Selective attention plays an essential role in information acquisition and utilization from the environment. In the past 50 years, research on selective attention has been a central topic in cognitive science. Compared with unimodal studies, crossmodal studies are more complex but necessary to solve real-world challenges in both human experiments and computational modeling. Although an increasing number of findings on crossmodal selective attention have shed light on humans' behavioral patterns and neural underpinnings, a much better understanding is still necessary to yield the same benefit for intelligent computational agents. This article reviews studies of selective attention in unimodal visual and auditory and crossmodal audiovisual setups from the multidisciplinary perspectives of psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and evaluates different ways to simulate analogous mechanisms in computational models and robotics. We discuss the gaps between these fields in this interdisciplinary review and provide insights about how to use psychological findings and theories in artificial intelligence from different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: The spinal cord’s central pattern generators (CPGs) have been explained by the symmetrical half-center hypothesis, the bursts generator, computational models, and more recently by connectome circuits. Asymmetrical models, at odds with the half-center paradigm, are composed of extensor and flexor CPG modules. Other models include not only flexor and extensor motoneurons but also motoneuron pools controlling biarticular muscles. It is unknown whether a preferred model can explain some particularities that fictive scratching (FS) in the cat presents. The first aim of this study was to investigate FS patterns considering the aiming and the rhythmic periods, and second, to examine the effects of serotonin (5HT) on and segmental inputs to FS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The experiments were carried out first in brain cortex-ablated cats (BCAC), then spinalized (SC), and for the midcollicular (MCC) preparation. Subjects were immobilized and the peripheral nerves were used to elicit the Monosynaptic reflex (MR), to modify the scratching patterns and for electroneurogram recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In BCAC, FS was produced by pinna stimulation and, in some cases, by serotonin. The scratching aiming phase (AP) initiates with the activation of either flexor or extensor motoneurons. Serotonin application during the AP produced simultaneous extensor and flexor bursts. Furthermore, WAY 100635 (5HT1A antagonist) produced a brief burst in the tibialis anterior (TA) nerve, followed by a reduction in its electroneurogram (ENG), while the soleus ENG remained silent. In SC, rhythmic phase (RP) activity was recorded in the soleus motoneurons. Serotonin or WAY produced FS bouts. The electrical stimulation of Ia afferent fibers produced heteronymous MRes waxing and waning during the scratch cycle. In MCC, FS began with flexor activity. Electrical stimulation of either deep peroneus (DP) or superficial peroneus (SP) nerves increased the duration of the TA electroneurogram. Medial gastrocnemius (MG) stretching or MG nerve electrical stimulation produced a reduction in the TA electroneurogram and an initial MG extensor burst. MRes waxed and waned during the scratch cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Descending pathways and segmental afferent fibers, as well as 5-HT and WAY, can change the FS pattern. To our understanding, the half-center hypothesis is the most suitable for explaining the AP in MCC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that astrocytes are not merely supportive cells in the nervous system but may actively participate in the control of neural circuits underlying cognition and behavior. In this study, we examined the role of astrocytes within the motor circuitry of the mammalian spinal cord. Pharmacogenetic manipulation of astrocytic activity in isolated spinal cord preparations obtained from neonatal mice revealed astrocyte-derived, adenosinergic modulation of the frequency of rhythmic output generated by the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) network. Live Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging demonstrated increased activity in astrocytes during locomotor-related output and in response to the direct stimulation of spinal neurons. Finally, astrocytes were found to respond to neuronally-derived glutamate in a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) dependent manner, which in turn drives astrocytic modulation of the locomotor network. Our work identifies bi-directional signaling mechanisms between neurons and astrocytes underlying modulatory feedback control of motor circuits, which may act to constrain network output within optimal ranges for movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) technology, which is amongst the most used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques currently available, has developed rapidly from 2009 to 2018. However, reports on the trends of rTMS using bibliometric analysis are rare. The goal of the present bibliometric analysis is to analyze and visualize the trends of rTMS, including general (publication patterns) and emerging trends (research frontiers), over the last 10 years by using the visual analytic tool CiteSpace V. Publications related to rTMS from 2009 to 2018 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database, including 2,986 peer-reviewed articles/reviews. Active authors, journals, institutions, and countries were identified by WoS and visualized by CiteSpace V, which could also detect burst changes to identify emerging trends. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to analyze the time trend of annual publication outputs. The USA ranked first in this field. Pascual-Leone A (author A), Fitzgerald PB (author B), George MS (author C), Lefaucheur JP (author D), and Fregni F (author E) made great contributions to this field of study. The most prolific institution to publish rTMS-related publications in the last decade was the University of Toronto. The journal Brain Stimulation published most papers. Lefaucheur et al.'s paper in 2014, and the keyword “sham controlled trial” showed the strongest citation bursts by the end of 2018, which indicates increased attention to the underlying work, thereby indicating the research frontiers. This study reveals the publication patterns and emerging trends of rTMS based on the records published from 2009 to 2018. The insights obtained have reference values for the future research and application of rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, our understanding of the mechanism regulating the PGC-1α expression is still limited. We sought to determine whether the epigenetic modification of PPARGC1A (the gene encoding PGC-1α) could account for its diminished expression. We performed a study of PPARGC1A risk-SNP genotypes, methylation level, and the expression in blood from 171 subjects. The mean DNA methylation level of PPARGC1A intron 1 in patients with PD was higher than that in the controls (7.18 ± 1.74 vs. 6.36 ± 1.28, P = 0.007). A detailed comparison of the DNA methylation level at each CpG site showed that CpG_1, CpG_13.14, CpG_17.18, and CpG_20 were significantly hypermethylated in patients with PD. There was a significant negative correlation between PPARGC1A methylation and expression level (R = −0.404, P &amp;lt; 0.001). We found no correlations between the PPARGC1A methylation level and the clinical features, while the CpG_13.14 site methylation level was positively correlated with H&amp;amp;Y stage (R = 0.246, P = 0.020) and was increased in people carrying the rs2970848 AA genotype compared with that in carriers of the AG/GG genotype (7.27 ± 1.86 vs. 6.65 ± 1.92, P = 0.032). Our results support a link between PPARGC1A methylation, gene expression, and variability, which indicated that a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism controlling PPARGC1A expression influences PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy therapy is currently based on anti-seizure drugs that do not modify the course of the disease, i.e., they are not anti-epileptogenic in nature. Previously, we observed that in vivo casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibition with 4,5,6,7-tetrabromotriazole (TBB) had anti-epileptogenic effects in the acute epilepsy slice model.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Here, we pretreated rats with TBB in vivo prior to the establishment of a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in order to analyze the long-term sequelae of such a preventive TBB administration.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that TBB pretreatment delayed onset of seizures after pilocarpine and slowed down disease progression during epileptogenesis. This was accompanied with a reduced proportion of burst firing neurons in the CA1 area. Western blot analyses demonstrated that CA1 tissue from TBB-pretreated epileptic animals contained significantly less CK2 than TBB-pretreated controls. On the transcriptional level, TBB pretreatment led to differential gene expression changes of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2.2, but also of HCN1 and HCN3 channels. Thus, in the presence of the HCN channel blocker ZD7288, pretreatment with TBB rescued the afterhyperpolarizing potential (AHP) as well as spike frequency adaptation in epileptic animals, both of which are prominent functions of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that TBB pretreatment prior to SE slows down disease progression during epileptogenesis involving increased K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 function, probably due to a persistently decreased CK2 protein expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Connections between neurons called synapses are the key components underlying all nervous system functions of animals and humans. However, important genetic information on the formation and plasticity of one type, the electrical (gap junction-mediated) synapse, is understudied in many invertebrates. In the present study, we set forth to identify and characterize the gap junction-encoding gene innexin in the central nervous system (CNS) of the mollusk pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. With PCR, 3′ and 5′ RACE, and BLAST searches, we identified eight innexin genes in the L. stagnalis genome, named Lst Inx1–Lst Inx8. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the L. stagnalis innexin genes originated from a single copy in the common ancestor of molluskan species by multiple gene duplication events and have been maintained in L. stagnalis since they were generated. The paralogous innexin genes demonstrate distinct expression patterns among tissues. In addition, one paralog, Lst Inx1, exhibits heterogeneity in cells and ganglia, suggesting the occurrence of functional diversification after gene duplication. These results introduce possibilities to study an intriguing potential relationship between innexin paralog expression and cell-specific functional outputs such as heterogenic ability to form channels and exhibit synapse plasticity. The L. stagnalis CNS contains large neurons and functionally defined networks for behaviors; with the introduction of L. stagnalis in the gap junction gene field, we are providing novel opportunities to combine genetic research with direct investigations of functional outcomes at the cellular, synaptic, and behavioral levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM 312750), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by regression with loss of spoken language and hand skills, development of characteristic hand stereotypies, and gait dysfunction, is primarily caused by de novo mutations in the X-linked gene Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Currently, treatment options are limited to symptomatic management, however, reversal of disease phenotype is possible in mouse models by restoration of normal MECP2 gene expression. A significant challenge is the lack of biomarkers of disease state, disease severity, or treatment response. Using a non-targeted metabolomic approach we evaluated metabolite profiles in plasma from thirty-four people with RTT compared to thirty-seven unaffected age- and gender-matched siblings. We identified sixty-six significantly altered metabolites that cluster broadly into amino acid, nitrogen handling, and exogenous substance pathways. RTT disease metabolite and metabolic pathways abnormalities point to evidence of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and alterations in gut microflora. These observed changes provide insight into underlying pathological mechanisms and the foundation for biomarker discovery of disease severity biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Selection of the time-window mainly affects the effectiveness of piecewise feature extraction procedures. We present an enhanced bag-of-patterns representation that allows capturing the higher-level structures of brain dynamics within a wide window range. So, we introduce augmented instance representations with extended window lengths for the short-time Common Spatial Pattern algorithm. Based on multiple-instance learning, the relevant bag-of-patterns are selected by a sparse regression to feed a bag classifier. The proposed higher-level structure representation promotes two contributions: (i) accuracy improvement of bi-conditional tasks, (ii) A better understanding of dynamic brain behavior through the learned sparse regression fits. Using a support vector machine classifier, the achieved performance on a public motor imagery dataset (left-hand and right-hand tasks) shows that the proposed framework performs very competitive results, providing robustness to the time variation of electroencephalography recordings and favoring the class separability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Heterogeneity between late-onset Parkinson’s disease (LOPD) and early-onset Parkinson’s disease (EOPD) is mainly reflected in the following aspects including genetics, disease progression, drug response, clinical manifestation, and neuropathological change. Although many studies have investigated these differences in relation to clinical significance, the functional processing circuits and underlying neural mechanisms have not been entirely understood. In this study, regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) maps were used to explore different spontaneous brain activity patterns in EOPD and LOPD patients. Abnormal synchronizations were found in the motor and emotional circuits of the EOPD group, as well as in the motor, emotional, and visual circuits of the LOPD group. EOPD patients showed functional activity change in the visual, emotional and motor circuits, and LOPD patients only showed increased functional activity in the emotional circuits. In summary, the desynchronization process in the LOPD group was relatively strengthened, and the brain areas with changed functional activity in the EOPD group were relatively widespread. The results might point out different impairments in the synchronization and functional activity for EOPD and LOPD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormally large and dysfunctional neuronal axons. Mutations in the GAN gene have been identified as the cause of this disorder. In this report, we performed a detailed phenotypic assessment of a Chinese patient with GAN. An array-based exon capture test and targeted next-generation sequencing were used to detect the suspected mutation sites. Compound heterozygous mutations of p.S79L (c.236C &amp;gt; T) in the BTB domain and p.T489S (c.1466C &amp;gt; G) in the kelch domain were identified in the proband’s genome. S79L was a known mutation, and T489S was reported for the first time. The p.S79L and p.T489S were confirmed in the proband’s mother and father, respectively. Both mutations were located in highly conserved regions and affected the predicted protein crystal structures. The proband’s sural biopsy revealed the classical GAN phenotype of swollen axons filled with closely packed neurofilaments. The combined application of the next-generation sequencing platform and bioinformatics analyses was an effective method for diagnosing GAN. The novel compound mutations of S79L and T489S in the GAN gene were likely the cause of the patient’s GAN symptoms. Our findings enrich the spectrum of mutations associated with this rare type of axonopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Modern machine learning is based on powerful algorithms running on digital computing platforms and there is great interest in accelerating the learning process and making it more energy efficient. In this paper we present a fully autonomous probabilistic circuit for fast and efficient learning that makes no use of digital computing. Specifically we use SPICE simulations to demonstrate a clockless autonomous circuit where the required synaptic weights are read out in the form of analog voltages. This allows us to demonstrate a circuit that can be built with existing technology to emulate the Boltzmann machine learning algorithm based on gradient optimization of the maximum likelihood function. Such autonomous circuits could be particularly of interest as standalone learning devices in the context of mobile and edge computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature brain but has the paradoxical property of depolarizing neurons during early development. Depolarization provided by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission during this early phase regulates neural stem cell proliferation, neural migration, neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and circuit refinement, making GABA a key factor in neural circuit development. Importantly, depending on the context, depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission can either drive neural activity or inhibit it through shunting inhibition. The varying roles of depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission during development, and its ability to both drive and inhibit neural activity, makes it a difficult developmental cue to study. This is particularly true in the later stages of development when the majority of synapses form and GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission switches from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. Here, we addressed the importance of depolarizing but inhibitory (or shunting) GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission in glutamatergic synapse formation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We first showed that the developmental depolarizing-to-hyperpolarizing switch in GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission is recapitulated in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Based on the expression profile of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;−Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; co-transporter 2 (KCC2) and changes in the GABA reversal potential, we pinpointed the timing of the switch from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission in CA1 neurons. We found that blocking depolarizing but shunting GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission increased excitatory synapse number and strength, indicating that depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission can restrain glutamatergic synapse formation. The increase in glutamatergic synapses was activity-dependent but independent of BDNF signaling. Importantly, the elevated number of synapses was stable for more than a week after GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitors were washed out. Together these findings point to the ability of immature GABAergic transmission to restrain glutamatergic synapse formation and suggest an unexpected role for depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission in shaping excitatory connectivity during neural circuit development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) is a member of the Forkhead family of genes with non-redundant roles in brain development, where alteration of this gene’s expression significantly affects the formation and function of the mammalian cerebral cortex. FOXG1 haploinsufficiency in humans is associated with prominent differences in brain size and impaired intellectual development noticeable in early childhood, while homozygous mutations are typically fatal. As such, FOXG1 has been implicated in a wide spectrum of congenital brain disorders, including the congenital variant of Rett syndrome, infantile spasms, microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. Recent technological advances have yielded greater insight into phenotypic variations observed in FOXG1 syndrome, molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of the disease, and multifaceted roles of FOXG1 expression. In this review, we explore the emerging mechanisms of FOXG1 in a range of transcriptional to posttranscriptional events in order to evolve our current view of how a single transcription factor governs the assembly of an elaborate cortical circuit responsible for higher cognitive functions and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Quantitative MRI modalities, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) are sensitive to the neuronal effects of aging of the cerebral white matter (WM), but lack the specificity for myelin content. Myelin water imaging (MWI) is highly specific for myelin and may be more sensitive for the detection of changes in myelin content inside the cerebral WM microstructure. In this multiparametric imaging study, we evaluated the performance of myelin water fraction (MWF) estimates as a marker for myelin alterations during normal-aging. Multiparametric MRI data derived from DTI, MTI and a novel, recently-proposed MWF-map processing and reconstruction algorithm were acquired from 54 healthy subjects (aged 18–79 years) and region-based multivariate regression analysis was performed. MWFs significantly decreased with age in most WM regions (except corticospinal tract) and changes of MWFs were associated with changes of radial diffusivity, indicating either substantial alterations or preservation of myelin content in these regions. Decreases of fractional anisotropy and magnetization transfer ratio were associated with lower MWFs in commissural fiber tracts only. Mean diffusivity had no regional effects on MWF. We conclude that MWF estimates are sensitive for the assessment of age-related myelin alterations in the cerebral WM of normal-aging brains.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Expanding use of immune‐checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) underscores the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely management of neurological immune‐related adverse events (irAE‐N). We evaluate the real‐world frequency, phenotypes, co‐occurring immune‐related adverse events (irAEs), and long‐term outcomes of severe, grade III to V irAE‐N at a tertiary care center over 6 years. We analyze how our experience supports published literature and professional society guidelines. We also discuss these data with regard to common clinical scenarios, such as combination therapy, ICI rechallenge and risk of relapse of irAE‐N, and corticosteroid taper, which are not specifically addressed by current guidelines and/or have limited data. Recommendations for management and future irAE‐N reporting are outlined. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion, cerebral β‐amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction in Lewy body disease (LBD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cross‐sectional study recruited 48 LBD patients (30 with dementia, 18 with mild cognitive impairment) and 15 control subjects from a university‐based hospital. We measured the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and regional β‐amyloid burden using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐(3‐[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoropropyl)‐2β‐carbon ethoxy‐3β‐(4‐iodophenyl) nortropane (FP‐CIT) positron emission tomography (PET) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetaben (FBB) PET, respectively. The relationship between striatal FP‐CIT uptake, regional cortical FBB uptake, and cognitive function scores was evaluated using path analyses. We also investigated the effects of striatal FP‐CIT uptake and cortical FBB uptake on the interval between motor symptom and dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with increased FBB uptake in the posterior cortical regions, most prominently in the occipital cortices. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the anterior putamen was associated with visuospatial dysfunction with mediation of increased occipital FBB uptake. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the posterior putamen and an increased parietal FBB uptake were independently associated with memory dysfunction. Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with attention, language, and frontal/executive dysfunction, independent of amyloid deposition. Increased FBB uptake, especially in the parietal cortex, was associated with earlier onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that occipital β‐amyloid deposition may contribute to the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion and visuospatial dysfunction in LBD patients. Although the effects of reduced DAT activity are more prominent than those of β‐amyloid burden on cognitive dysfunction, the latter affects the onset of cognitive dysfunction.

 Background&lt;p&gt;To compare the efficacies of univariate and radiomics analyses of amide proton transfer weighted (APT&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;) imaging in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation of grade II/III gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-nine grade II/III glioma patients with known IDH1 mutation status were prospectively included (IDH1 wild type, 16; IDH1 mutation, 43). A total of 1044 quantitative radiomics features were extracted from APT&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; images. The efficacies of univariate and radiomics analyses in predicting IDH1 mutation were compared. Feature values were compared between two groups with independent t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to evaluate the predicting efficacy of each feature. Cases were randomly assigned to either the training (n = 49) or test cohort (n = 10) for the radiomics analysis. Support vector machine with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) was adopted to select the optimal feature subset. The adverse impact of the imbalance dataset in the training cohort was solved by synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Subsequently, the performance of SVM model was assessed on both training and test cohort.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;As for univariate analysis, 18 features were significantly different between IDH1 wild-type and mutant groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Among these parameters, High Gray Level Run Emphasis All Direction offset 8 SD achieved the biggest area under the curve (AUC) (0.769) with the accuracy of 0.799. As for radiomics analysis, SVM model was established using 19 features selected with SVM-RFE. The AUC and accuracy for IDH1 mutation on training set were 0.892 and 0.952, while on the testing set were 0.7 and 0.84, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Radiomics strategy based on APT image features is potentially useful for preoperative estimating IDH1 mutation status.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Olfaction is a sense involved in a complex set of tasks, influencing eating behavior, increasing awareness of environmental hazards and affecting social communication. Surprisingly, smell disorders are very frequent, especially in the elderly population. Several recent studies conducted mostly in older subjects have demonstrated a strong association between olfactory impairment and overall mortality risk, with anosmia being even more predictive of 5 years mortality risk than cardiovascular disease. Presently, the underlying pathophysiology linking olfactory impairment to mortality remains unknown and only putative mechanisms are suggested. This review aims to examine the link between olfactory impairment and mortality and to discuss existing ideas on underlying existing mechanisms including, (1) the effect of olfactory loss on nutrition, life-threatening situations and social interactions, (2) associated neurodegenerative diseases, (3) accelerated brain aging, and (4) reflection of general health status being reflected in olfactory function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;The Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and lower limbs (LL) weakness. There is no treatment to cure or halt the disease, except for symptomatic therapy. The use of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is one of the primary treatment for focal spasticity. Physiotherapy (PT) can help in maintaining residual functioning. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the effect of the combined BoNT-A and intensive PT in patients with HSP.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Eighteen adult patients (50% females) with clinical diagnosis of HSP were recruited. Eleven patients had a genetic diagnosis of SPG4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 72. Patients were all autonomously deambulant or needed support. BoNT-A was injected in 36 LL in different spastic muscles under electromyographic guidance and followed by intensive PT sessions. Outcome measures included disease severity, motor functional measures, perceived pain self-report and quality of life. Assessments occurred at baseline, 1 and 3 months after BoNT-A injection.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Most inoculated muscles were hamstrings, rectus femoris and gastrocnemius. We observed an improvement in muscle tone, in the gait velocity and distance length. Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale was significantly reduced after treatment, in addition to improving pain and quality of life. These results were riconfirmed in 3 months time.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study indicates that combined treatment of BoNT-A and PT can lead to improvement of spasticity and quality of life in patients with HSP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Biomedical imaging Is an important source of information in cancer research. Characterizations of cancer morphology at onset, progression, and in response to treatment provide complementary information to that gleaned from genomics and clinical data. Accurate extraction and classification of both visual and latent image features Is an increasingly complex challenge due to the increased complexity and resolution of biomedical image data. In this paper, we present four deep learning-based image analysis methods from the Computational Precision Medicine (CPM) satellite event of the 21st International Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2018) conference. One method Is a segmentation method designed to segment nuclei in whole slide tissue images (WSIs) of adult diffuse glioma cases. It achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.868 with the CPM challenge datasets. Three methods are classification methods developed to categorize adult diffuse glioma cases into oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma classes using radiographic and histologic image data. These methods achieved accuracy values of 0.75, 0.80, and 0.90, measured as the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the number of total cases, with the challenge datasets. The evaluations of the four methods indicate that (1) carefully constructed deep learning algorithms are able to produce high accuracy in the analysis of biomedical image data and (2) the combination of radiographic with histologic image information improves classification performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Advances in computation and neuronal modeling have enabled the study of entire neural tissue systems with an impressive degree of biological realism. These efforts have focused largely on modeling dendrites and somas while largely neglecting axons. The need for biologically realistic explicit axonal models is particularly clear for applications involving clinical and therapeutic electrical stimulation because axons are generally more excitable than other neuroanatomical subunits. While many modeling efforts can rely on existing repositories of reconstructed dendritic/somatic morphologies to study real cells or to estimate parameters for a generative model, such datasets for axons are scarce and incomplete. Those that do exist may still be insufficient to build accurate models because the increased geometric variability of axons demands a proportional increase in data. To address this need, a Ruled-Optimum Ordered Tree System (ROOTS) was developed that extends the capability of neuronal morphology generative methods to include highly branched cortical axon terminal arbors. Further, this study presents and explores a clear use-case for such models in the prediction of cortical tissue response to externally applied electric fields. The results presented herein comprise (i) a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the generative algorithm proposed, (ii) a comparison of generated fibers with those observed in histological studies, (iii) a study of the requisite spatial and morphological complexity of axonal arbors for accurate prediction of neuronal response to extracellular electrical stimulation, and (iv) an extracellular electrical stimulation strength–duration analysis to explore probable thresholds of excitation of the dentate perforant path under controlled conditions. ROOTS demonstrates a superior ability to capture biological realism in model fibers, allowing improved accuracy in predicting the impact that microscale structures and branching patterns have on spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the presence of extracellular electric fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Morphine is a potent analgesic opiate commonly used in treating pain, and it is also a substance of abuse and highly addictive. Hence, it is vital to discover the action sites of morphine in the brain to increase its efficacy of treatment. In the present study, we aimed at identifying comprehensive neuroanatomical locations that are sensitive to morphine in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We performed in situ hybridization to localize the mu opioid receptor (oprm1) gene and to map the morphine sensitive brain areas using neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 4a (npas4a), an early gene marker. Real-time PCR was used to detect changes in mRNA levels of oprm1 and npas4a in control and acute morphine treated fish (2 mg/L; 20 min). Intense positive oprm1 signals were seen in the telencephalon, preoptic area, habenula, hypothalamic area and periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum. Acute morphine exposure significantly increased oprm1 and npas4a mRNA levels in the medial zone of dorsal telencephalon (Dm), ventral region of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), preoptic area, and in the hypothalamus but a decrease in oprm1 and npas4a signals in the dorsal habenula. This study provides a detailed map of oprm1 localization in the brain, which includes previously unreported oprm1 in the habenula of teleost. Presence of oprm1 in multiple brain sites implies multiple action targets of morphine and potential brain functions which could include reward, cognitive and negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain networks of ALS patients (n = 208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that computer‐simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, at both group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore their potential as a prognostic biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Exposure to severe stress has immediate and prolonged neuropsychiatric consequences and increases the risk of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Importantly, PTSD develops in only a subset of individuals after exposure to a traumatic event, with the understanding of this selective vulnerability being very limited. Individuals who go on to develop PTSD after a traumatic experience typically demonstrate sleep disturbances including persistent insomnia and recurrent trauma-related nightmares. We previously established a repeated social defeat paradigm in which rats segregate into either passively or actively coping subpopulations, and we found that this distinction correlates with measures of vulnerability or resilience to stress. In this study, we examined differences between these two behavioral phenotypes in sleep changes resulting from repeated social defeat stress. Our data indicate that, compared to control and actively coping rats, passively coping rats have less slow-wave sleep (SWS) for at least 2 weeks after the end of a series of exposures to social defeat. Furthermore, resilient rats show less exaggerated motor activation at awakenings from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and less fragmentation of REM sleep compared to control and passively coping rats. Together, these data associate a passive coping strategy in response to repeated social defeat stress with persisting sleep disturbances. Conversely, an active coping strategy may be associated with resilience to sleep disturbances. These findings may have both prognostic and therapeutic applications to stress-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, including PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cutaneous sensation is vital to controlling our hands and upper limbs. It helps close the motor control loop by informing adjustments of grasping forces during object manipulations and provides much of the information the brain requires to perceive our limbs as a part of our bodies. This sensory information is absent to upper-limb prosthesis users. Although robotic prostheses are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the absence of feedback imposes a reliance on open-loop control and limits the functional potential as an integrated part of the body. Experimental systems to restore physiologically relevant sensory information to prosthesis users are beginning to emerge. However, the impact of their long-term use on functional abilities, body image, and neural adaptation processes remains unclear. Understanding these effects is essential to transition sensate prostheses from sophisticated assistive tools to integrated replacement limbs. We recruited three participants with high-level upper-limb amputation who previously received targeted reinnervation surgery. Each participant was fit with a neural-machine-interface prosthesis that allowed participants to operate their device by thinking about moving their missing limb. Additionally, we fit a sensory feedback system that allowed participants to experience touch to the prosthesis as touch on their missing limb. All three participants performed a long-term take-home trial. Two participants used their neural-machine-interface systems with touch feedback and one control participant used his prescribed, insensate prosthesis. A series of functional outcome metrics and psychophysical evaluations were performed using sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses before and after the take-home period to capture changes in functional abilities, limb embodiment, and neural adaptation. Our results demonstrated that the relationship between users and sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses is dynamic and changes with long-term use. The presence of touch sensation had a near-immediate impact on how the users operated their prostheses. In the multiple independent measures of users’ functional abilities employed, we observed a spectrum of performance changes following long-term use. Furthermore, after the take-home period, participants more appropriately integrated their prostheses into their body images and psychophysical tests provided strong evidence that neural and cortical adaptation occurred.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This paper presents a wireless distributed Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) architecture. It is based on a set of, potentially heterogeneous, distributed stimulation and measurement units managed by a wearable controller. Through a proof-of-concept application, the characterization of the wireless network performances was assessed to check the adequacy of this solution with open-loop and closed-loop control requirements. We show the guaranteed time performances over the network through the control of quadriceps and hamstrings stimulation parameters based on the monitoring of the knee joint angle. Our solution intends to be a tool for researchers and therapists to develop closed-loop control algorithms and strategies for rehabilitation, allowing the design of wearable systems for a daily use context.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The use of advanced technological solutions (“neurotechnologies”) can improve the clinical outcomes of neurorehabilitation after stroke. Here, Micera et al. propose a paradigm shift that is based on a deep understanding of the basic mechanisms of natural stroke recovery and technology-assisted neurorehabilitation to improve the clinical effectiveness of neurotechnology.</content>

 Confidence in perceptual decisions scales neural responses to violations in reward expectation. In this issue of Neuron, Lak et al. (2020) show that the medial prefrontal cortex in mice computes a confidence-dependent expectation signal that influences how dopamine neurons convey reward prediction errors to guide learning.</content>

 Balance between excitation and inhibition (E-I balance) in neural circuits is believed to be tightly regulated. To the contrary, in this issue of Neuron, Bridi et al. (2020) reveal that inverse oscillations of synaptic inhibition and excitation lead to peaks and valleys in E-I balance across the 24 h day.</content>

 In this issue of Neuron, Ashrafi et al. (2020) identify a feedforward signaling mechanism that couples neuronal activity to the homeostatic maintenance of axonal and synaptic ATP production. This mechanism is achieved via changes in cytoplasmic calcium and activation of brain-specific, mitochondrial MICU3.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a ribonuclear protein regulating many aspects of RNA metabolism. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases with the presence of TDP-43 aggregates in neuronal cells. Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal degradation pathway participating in the proteostasis of several cytosolic proteins including neurodegenerative associated proteins. In addition, protein oligomers or aggregates can affect the status of CMA. In this work, we studied the relationship between CMA and the physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43. First, we found that recombinant TDP-43 was specifically degraded by rat liver’s CMA+ lysosomes and that endogenous TDP-43 is localized in rat brain’s CMA+ lysosomes, indicating that TDP-43 can be a CMA substrate in vivo. Next, by using a previously reported TDP-43 aggregation model, we have shown that wild-type and an aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 are detected in CMA+ lysosomes isolated from cell cultures. In addition, their protein levels increased in cells displaying CMA down-regulation, indicating that these two TDP-43 forms are CMA substrates in vitro. Finally, we observed that the aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 is able to interact with Hsc70, to co-localize with Lamp2A, and to up-regulate the levels of these molecular components of CMA. The latter was followed by an up-regulation of the CMA activity and lysosomal damage. Altogether our data shows that: (i) TDP-43 is a CMA substrate; (ii) CMA can contribute to control the turnover of physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43; and (iii) TDP-43 aggregation can affect CMA performance. Overall, this work contributes to understanding how a dysregulation between CMA and TDP-43 would participate in neuropathological mechanisms associated with TDP-43 aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The specific role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in emotional and behavioral regulation—particularly in relation to automatic processes—has gained increased attention in the sensory modulation literature. This mini-review article summarizes current knowledge about the role of the ANS in sensory modulation, with a focus on the integrated functions of the ANS and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and their measurement. Research from the past decade illustrates that sympathetic and parasympathetic interactions are more complex than previously assumed. Patterns of ANS activation vary across individuals, with distinct physiological response profiles influencing the reactivity underlying automatic behavioral responses. This review article advances a deeper understanding of stress and the complex stress patterns within the ANS and HPA axis that contribute to allostatic load (AL). We argue that using multiple physiological measurements to capture individual ANS response variation is critical for effectively treating children with sensory modulation disorder (SMD) and sensory differences. We consider the relative contributions of automatic vs. deliberately controlled processes across large-scale neural networks in the development of sensorimotor function and their associated links with arousal patterns and sensory over- and under-responsivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Natural exploration of textures involves active sensing, i.e., voluntary movements of tactile sensors (e.g., human fingertips or rodent whiskers) across a target surface. Somatosensory input during moving tactile sensors varies according to both the movement and the surface texture. Combining motor and sensory information, the brain is capable of extracting textural features of the explored surface. Despite the ecological relevance of active sensing, psychophysical studies on active touch are largely missing. One reason for the lack of informative studies investigating active touch is the considerable challenge of assembling an appropriate experimental setup. A possible solution might be in the realm of virtual tactile reality that provides tactile finger stimulation depending on the position of the hand and the simulated texture of a target surface. In addition to rigorous behavioral studies, the investigation of the neuronal mechanisms of active tactile sensing in humans is highly warranted, requiring neurophysiological experiments using electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, current neuroimaging techniques impose specific requirements on the tactile stimulus delivery equipment in terms of compatibility with the neurophysiological methods being used. Here, we present a user-friendly, MEG compatible, tactile virtual reality simulator. The simulator consists of a piezo-electric tactile stimulator capable of independently protruding 16 plastic pistons of 1 mm diameter arranged in a 4 × 4 matrix. The stimulator delivers a spatial pattern of tactile stimuli to the tip of a finger depending on the position of the finger moving across a 2-dimensional plane. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the tactile virtual reality, we determined participants’ detection thresholds in active and passive touch conditions. Thresholds in both conditions were higher than reported in the literature. It could well be that the processing of the piston-related stimulation was masked by the sensory input generated by placing the finger on the scanning probe. More so, the thresholds for both the active and passive tasks did not differ significantly. In further studies, the noise introduced by the stimulator in neuromagnetic recordings was quantified and somatosensory evoked fields for active and passive touch were recorded. Due to the compatibility of the stimulator with neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, and based on the feasibility to record somatosensory-related neuromagnetic brain activity the apparatus has immense potential for the exploration of the neural underpinnings of active tactile perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Captioning is the process of transcribing speech and acoustical information into text to help deaf and hard of hearing people accessing to the auditory track of audiovisual media. In addition to the verbal transcription, it includes information such as sound effects, speaker identification, or music tagging. However, it just takes into account a limited spectrum of the whole acoustic information available in the soundtrack, and hence, an important amount of emotional information is lost when attending just to the normative compliant captions. In this article, it is shown, by means of behavioral and EEG measurements, how emotional information related to sounds and music used by the creator in the audiovisual work is perceived differently by normal hearing group and hearing disabled group when applying standard captioning. Audio and captions activate similar processing areas, respectively, in each group, although not with the same intensity. Moreover, captions require higher activation of voluntary attentional circuits, as well as language-related areas. Captions transcribing musical information increase attentional activity, instead of emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are becoming increasingly popular as a tool to improve the quality of life of patients with disabilities. Recently, time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-fNIRS) based BCIs are gaining traction because of their enhanced depth sensitivity leading to lower signal contamination from the extracerebral layers. This study presents the first account of TR-fNIRS based BCI for “mental communication” on healthy participants. Twenty-one (21) participants were recruited and were repeatedly asked a series of questions where they were instructed to imagine playing tennis for “yes” and to stay relaxed for “no.” The change in the mean time-of-flight of photons was used to calculate the change in concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin since it provides a good compromise between depth sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Features were extracted from the average oxyhemoglobin signals to classify them as “yes” or “no” responses. Linear-discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify the responses using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The overall accuracies achieved for all participants were 75% and 76%, using LDA and SVM, respectively. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference in accuracy between questions. In addition, physiological parameters [heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] were recorded on seven of the 21 participants during motor imagery (MI) and rest to investigate changes in these parameters between conditions. No significant difference in these parameters was found between conditions. These findings suggest that TR-fNIRS could be suitable as a BCI for patients with brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Growing evidence links impairment of brain functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with disruptions of brain functional connectivity. However, whether the AD brain shows similar changes from a dynamic or cross-frequency view remains poorly explored. This paper provides an effective framework to investigate the properties of multiplex brain networks in AD considering inter-frequency and temporal dynamics. Using resting-state EEG signals, two types of multiplex networks were reconstructed separately considering the network interactions between different frequency bands or time points. We further applied multiplex network features to characterize functional integration and segregation of the cross-frequency or time-varying networks. Finally, machine learning methods were employed to evaluate the performance of multiplex-network-based indexes for detection of AD. Results revealed that the brain networks of AD patients are disrupted with reduced segregation particularly in the left occipital area for both cross-frequency and time-varying networks. However, the alteration of integration differs among brain regions and may show an increasing trend in the frontal area of AD brain. By combining the features of integration and segregation in time-varying networks, the best classification performance was achieved with an accuracy of 92.5%. These findings suggest that our multiplex framework can be applied to explore functional integration and segregation of brain networks and characterize the abnormalities of brain function. This may shed new light on the brain network analysis and extend our understanding of brain function in patients with neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Developments of new strategies to restore vision and improving on current strategies by harnessing new advancements in material and electrical sciences, and biological and genetic-based technologies are of upmost health priorities around the world. Federal and private entities are spending billions of dollars on visual prosthetics technologies. This review describes the most current and state-of-the-art bioengineering technologies to restore vision. This includes a thorough description of traditional electrode-based visual prosthetics that have improved substantially since early prototypes. Recent advances in molecular and synthetic biology have transformed vision-assisted technologies; For example, optogenetic technologies that introduce light-responsive proteins offer excellent resolution but cortical applications are restricted by fiber implantation and tissue damage. Other stimulation modalities, such as magnetic fields, have been explored to achieve non-invasive neuromodulation. Miniature magnetic coils are currently being developed to activate select groups of neurons. Magnetically-responsive nanoparticles or exogenous proteins can significantly enhance the coupling between external electromagnetic devices and any neurons affiliated with these modifications. The need to minimize cytotoxic effects for nanoparticle-based therapies will likely restrict the number of usable materials. Nevertheless, advances in identifying and utilizing proteins that respond to magnetic fields may lead to non-invasive, cell-specific stimulation and may overcome many of the limitations that currently exist with other methods. Finally, sensory substitution systems also serve as viable visual prostheses by converting visual input to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. This review also discusses major challenges in the field and offers bioengineering strategies to overcome those.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Natural brains perform miraculously well in learning new tasks from a small number of samples, whereas sample efficient learning is still a major open problem in the field of machine learning. Here, we raise the question, how the neural coding scheme affects sample efficiency, and make first progress on this question by proposing and analyzing a learning algorithm that uses a simple reinforce-type plasticity mechanism and does not require any gradients to learn low dimensional mappings. It harnesses three bio-plausible mechanisms, namely, population codes with bell shaped tuning curves, continous attractor mechanisms and probabilistic synapses, to achieve sample efficient learning. We show both theoretically and by simulations that population codes with broadly tuned neurons lead to high sample efficiency, whereas codes with sharply tuned neurons account for high final precision. Moreover, a dynamic adaptation of the tuning width during learning gives rise to both, high sample efficiency and high final precision. We prove a sample efficiency guarantee for our algorithm that lies within a logarithmic factor from the information theoretical optimum. Our simulations show that for low dimensional mappings, our learning algorithm achieves comparable sample efficiency to multi-layer perceptrons trained by gradient descent, although it does not use any gradients. Furthermore, it achieves competitive sample efficiency in low dimensional reinforcement learning tasks. From a machine learning perspective, these findings may inspire novel approaches to improve sample efficiency. From a neuroscience perspective, these findings suggest sample efficiency as a yet unstudied functional role of adaptive tuning curve width.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurons in many brain regions exhibit spontaneous, intrinsic rhythmic firing activity. This rhythmic firing activity may determine the way in which these neurons respond to extrinsic synaptic inputs. We hypothesized that neurons should be most responsive to inputs at the frequency of the intrinsic oscillation frequency. We addressed this question in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic nucleus in the midbrain. VTA neurons have a unique propensity to exhibit spontaneous intrinsic rhythmic activity in the 1–5 Hz frequency range, which persists in the in-vitro brain slice, and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators. Here, we combine in-vitro simultaneous recording of action potentials from a 60 channel multi-electrode-array with cell-type-specific optogenetic stimulation of the VTA dopamine neurons. We investigated how VTA neurons respond to wide-band stochastic (Poisson input) as well as regular laser pulses. Strong synchrony was induced between the laser input and the spike timing of the neurons, both for regular pulse trains and Poisson pulse trains. For rhythmically pulsed input, the neurons demonstrated resonant behavior with the strongest phase locking at their intrinsic oscillation frequency, but also at half and double the intrinsic oscillation frequency. Stochastic Poisson pulse stimulation provided a more effective stimulation of the entire population, yet we observed resonance at lower frequencies (approximately half the oscillation frequency) than the neurons' intrinsic oscillation frequency. The non-linear filter characteristics of dopamine neurons could allow the VTA to predict precisely timed future rewards based on past sensory inputs, a crucial component of reward prediction error signaling. In addition, these filter characteristics could contribute to a pacemaker role for the VTA in synchronizing activity with other regions like the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with varying degrees of aggressiveness and prognosis. Understanding of tumor biology and intra-tumor heterogeneity is necessary for planning personalized therapy and predicting response to therapy. Accurate tumoral and intra-tumoral segmentation on MRI is the first step toward understanding the tumor biology through computational methods. The purpose of this study was to design a segmentation algorithm and evaluate its performance on pre-treatment brain MRIs obtained from patients with gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: In this study, we have designed a novel 3D U-Net architecture that segments various radiologically identifiable sub-regions like edema, enhancing tumor, and necrosis. Weighted patch extraction scheme from the tumor border regions is proposed to address the problem of class imbalance between tumor and non-tumorous patches. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and the symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. The Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based architecture is trained on 285 patients, validated on 66 patients and tested on 191 patients with Glioma from Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 challenge dataset. Three dimensional patches are extracted from multi-channel BraTS training dataset to train 3D U-Net architecture. The efficacy of the proposed approach is also tested on an independent dataset of 40 patients with High Grade Glioma from our tertiary cancer center. Segmentation results are assessed in terms of Dice Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Hausdorff 95 distance (ITCN intra-tumoral classification network).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Our proposed architecture achieved Dice scores of 0.88, 0.83, and 0.75 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively, on BraTS validation dataset and 0.85, 0.77, 0.67 on test dataset. The results were similar on the independent patients' dataset from our hospital, achieving Dice scores of 0.92, 0.90, and 0.81 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results of this study show the potential of patch-based 3D U-Net for the accurate intra-tumor segmentation. From experiments, it is observed that the weighted patch-based segmentation approach gives comparable performance with the pixel-based approach when there is a thin boundary between tumor subparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 17 February 2020; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0596-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-020-0596-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Postmortem studies have previously suggested that adult olfactory neurogenesis occurs in humans. In new research, Durante and colleagues obtained fresh tissue from healthy adult humans via endoscopic nasal surgery and used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify the entire neurogenic trajectory in the olfactory epithelium, confirming the existence of human olfactory neurogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/JNy1CqnNkJg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>
