                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Inflammation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) alleviates mitochondrial apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells, and to further explore the mechanism involved. Prepared PC-12 cells were treated with IGF-1, Mdivi-1 (DRP1 blocker), LY294002 (PI3K blocker), betulinic acid (NF-κB activator) or their combinations. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation were then measured to assess mitochondrial function. The rate of apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The expression of several apoptosis proteins (i.e. Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and signaling proteins (i.e. p-GSK3β, NF-κB and NLRP3) was measured using western blotting. Compared with the control cells, the LPS-treated cells showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased apoptosis and upregulation of apoptosis proteins, which were significantly alleviated by Mdivi-1. These findings indicate that neuronal apoptosis was activated partly through the mitochondrial pathway. IGF-1 treatment inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-treated cells. The reagent also increased the expression of p-GSK3β and decreased the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. Both LY294002 and betulinic acid reversed the protective effect of IGF-1. In addition, LY294002 affected the expression of the three signaling proteins, while betulinic acid only affected the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. These findings indicated a GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway was existed and was involved in the protective mechanism of IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 alleviated mitochondrial apoptosis through GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The existence of Gram-negative bacteria in the brain, regardless of underlying immune status has been demonstrated by recent studies. The colocalization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1-40/42&lt;/sub&gt; in amyloid plaques supports the hypothesis that brain microbes may be the cause, triggering chronic neuroinflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate the behavioral changes induced by infectious neuroinflammation, we chose the third ventricle as the site of a single LPS injection (20 μg or 80 μg) in male Wistar rats to avoid mechanical injury to forebrain structures while inducing widespread inflammation throughout the brain. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by LPS resulted in depressive-like behaviors and the impairment of spatial learning; however, there was no evidence of the development of pathological hallmarks (e.g., the phosphorylation of tau) for 10 months following LPS injection. The acceleration of cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 and the retardation of cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR were observed in the hippocampus of rats treated with either low-dose or high-dose LPS. The rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol metabolism (CYP46A1) in SH-SY5Y cells and synthesis (HMGCR) in U251 cells were altered by inflammation stimulators, including LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The data suggest that chronic neuroinflammation provoked by the administration of LPS into the third ventricle may induce depressive-like symptoms and that the loss of cholesterol might be a biomarker of chronic neuroinflammation. The lack of pathological hallmarks of AD in our model indicates that Gram-negative bacteria infection might not be a single cause of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twins studies indicate that many individual factors are associated with genetic polymorphisms in tobacco use, dependence vulnerability, and the ability to quit smoking. Opioid receptor delta-type 1 (OPRD1) is one of the most important genes in the opioid pathway. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association of variants located in the intron 1 of the OPRD1 gene, including rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589, with susceptibility to nicotine dependence among northern Iranians. DNA of 426 individuals, including 224 smokers and 202 healthy people, were extracted with the salting-out standard technique, qualified with Agarose gel, then quantified with Nanodrop, and finally genotyped by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR. All statistical analyses were performed by SNPAlyze version 8.1 and SPSS version 20. Results revealed no significant association of all three studied variants with the susceptibility to nicotine dependence in any models of inheritance. However, there were five haplotypes with an overall frequency higher than 0.05; no significant impact of any of them on nicotine dependence was observed. Altogether, rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589 were not associated with nicotine dependence among northern Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To study the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on axon regeneration and secretion change of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) under oxidative stress after spinal cord injury (SCI), and further explore the effect of changes in DRG secretion caused by PBM on the polarization of macrophages. The PBM-DRG model was constructed to perform PBM on neurons under oxidative stress simulated in vitro. And the irradiation conditions were as follows: wavelength, 810 nm; power density, 2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; irradiation area, 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; and irradiation time, 440 s. Then resulted in an energy of 4 J (2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 440 s). About 100 μM H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was added to the culture medium to simulate oxidative stress after SCI. An ROS (reactive oxygen species) assay kit was used to measure ROS contend in the DRG. The survival level of the neurons was measured using the CCK-8 method, and the axon regeneration of neurons was observed by using immunofluorescence. The secretion level of CCL2 from DRG was determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Further culturing macrophages of DRG-conditioned medium culture, the expression level of iNOS and Arg-1 in macrophages was assessed using Western blot analysis. The expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was determined by ELISA. After adding the neutralizing antibody of CCL2 to the DRG neuron-conditioned medium following PBM irradiation to culture macrophages to observe the effects on macrophage polarization and secretion. PBM could reduce ROS levels in neurons, increase neuronal survival under oxidative stress, and promote neuronal axon regeneration. In addition, PBM could also promote CCL2 secretion by DRG under oxidative stress. By constructing a DRG supernatant-M1 macrophage adoptive culture model, we found that the supernatant of DRG after PBM intervention could reduce the expression level of iNOS and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in M1 macrophages; at the same time, it could also up-regulate the expression of Arg-1, one of the markers of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, these effects could be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies of CCL2. PBM could promote survival and axonal regeneration of DRG under SCI oxidative stress, increase the secretion level of CCL2 by DRG, and this change can reduce the polarization of macrophages to M1, further indicating that PBM could promote spinal cord injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Behçet syndrome (BS) is a vasculitis characterized by several clinical manifestations including the rare neurological involvement (neuro-BS, NBS). The aim of our pivotal study was to investigate the mutational status of several inflammation-related genes in a cohort of Italian patients with and without the neurological involvement (20 NBS vs 40 no-NBS patients). The preliminary &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection and primer design were performed by NCBI Primer-Blast tool. Genomic DNA was isolated and amplified using PCR. PCR amplicons were sequenced and bioinformatically analysed. Twelve tagSNPs were selected and genotyped: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187, rs17482078, and rs27044; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL10 rs1800872&lt;/em&gt; and rs1518111, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12A&lt;/em&gt; rs17810546, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12RB2&lt;/em&gt; rs924080, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STAT4&lt;/em&gt; rs7572482, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CCR1&lt;/em&gt; rs7616215, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KLRC4&lt;/em&gt; rs2617170, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;UBAC2&lt;/em&gt; rs3825427.&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt; ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs showed statistically significant higher frequencies in NBS group than no-NBS. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187 AA was more common in no-NBS patients (20.0% NBS vs 47.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while rs17482078 GA frequency was higher in NBS patients (55.0% NBS vs 22.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, OR: 4.21). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018 GG was more frequent in NBS group (65.0% NBS vs 40.0% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), according to a previous finding. No other statistically significant differences were found. In conclusion, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs were found associated with neurological involvement of BS. Additional and larger analyses were required to verify our preliminary findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cypermethrin activates microglia, which is found to be decisive in neurodegeneration in the experimental rats. While the involvement of microglial activation in toxicant-induced neurodegeneration is reported, the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression of inflammatory proteins from the rat primary microglia is not yet properly understood. The study intended to delineate the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression and release of proteins from the microglia. Rat primary microglial cells were treated with cypermethrin to check the expression of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin-treated microglia conditioned media and cells were collected to measure the expression and release of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin augmented the protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and p42/44, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and MMP-9 levels in the cell lysate and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in the microglia conditioned media. Pre-treatment with minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor or rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, notably reduced the release of TNF-α in the conditioned media and expression of iNOS protein in the microglia. Minocycline reduced the expression of PKC-δ, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins in the microglia. While cypermethrin-treated conditioned media induced the toxicity in the rat primary neurons, minocycline or rottlerin reduced the cypermethrin treated microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity. The outcomes of the present study suggest that cypermethrin activates microglia and releases TNF-α and IL-1β as well as up-regulates the expression of PKC-δ, iNOS, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins, which could contribute to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposit in the parenchyma is a major characteristic in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the impaired glymphatic clearance contributes to the Aβ accumulation. It was reported that L-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) showed the potential neuroprotective effect in the rodent models of AD. The effects of NBP on the glymphatic system were explored in this study. In the wild-type mice, both CSF tracer influx and perivascular drainage increased after NBP treatment compared with vehicle treatment. Moreover, NBP promoted the perivascular drainage of Aβ via increased cerebral pulsation, which could be inhibited by propranolol. Then, we studied the potential of 3-month NBP treatment on Aβ deposits in 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice. NBP daily treatments remarkably improved cognitive behavior in &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus internal-ref refid-sec7&quot;&gt;Morris water maze&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, NBP could reduce Aβ deposition and decrease parenchymal Aβ levels. In addition, NBP markedly improved the perivascular AQP4 localization. Our results indicated that NBP could enhance the glymphatic clearance and reduce parenchymal Aβ deposit in the APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that it may have potential in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic event worldwide. Work from the past decade has highlighted the key involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in SCI. Nevertheless, the molecular action of lncRNA H19 in SCI is still not fully understood. The levels of H19, microRNA (miR)-325-3p, and neuronal differentiation 4 (NEUROD4) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell apoptosis. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Targeted relationships among H19, miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), or RNA pull-down assays. Our data showed that H19 level was overexpressed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV2 cells. H19 silencing alleviated LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, H19 in BV2 cells directly targeted miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 was a direct target of miR-325-3p. Moreover, miR-325-3p was a functional target of H19 in regulating cell apoptosis and inflammation induced by LPS. Enforced expression of miR-325-3p relieved LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation through reducing NEUROD4. Furthermore, H19 in BV2 cells regulated NEUROD4 expression through targeting miR-325-3p. Our results identified that the silencing of H19 attenuated LPS-evoked microglia cell apoptosis and inflammation after SCI at least partially through targeting the miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 axis, highlighting a novel approach for SCI management.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Repeated exposure to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reduces responses of monocytes/macrophages to LPS (LPS/endotoxin tolerance). Microglial exposure to Aβ deposits, a TLR4 ligand, may cause “Aβ/LPS tolerance,” leading to decreased Aβ clearance. We demonstrated that microglial activation by LPS is diminished in Aβ deposit-bearing 12-month-old model mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compared with non-AD mice and Aβ deposit-free 2-month-old AD mice. Because miR-146a plays a predominant role in inducing TLR tolerance in macrophages and because miR-146a in extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by inflammatory macrophages increases in circulation, we investigated potential roles of miR-146a and inflammatory EVs in inducing TLR tolerance in microglia and in altering expression of inflammatory AD risk genes. We found that miR-146a upregulation induces TLR tolerance and alters expression of inflammatory AD risk genes in response to LPS treatment in BV2 microglia. LPS brain injection altered expression of the AD risk genes in 12-month-old AD mice but not in non-AD littermates. EVs from inflammatory macrophages polarize BV2 microglia to M1 phenotype and induce TLR tolerance. Microglia exposed to Aβ in the brain show reduced cytokine responses to systemic inflammation due to peripheral LPS injection, indicating TLR/Aβ tolerance in microglia. Our results suggest that increased miR-146a induces microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance and that circulating EVs shed by inflammatory macrophages contribute to microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance, leading to reduced Aβ clearance. Our study also suggests that altered expression of inflammatory AD risk genes may contribute to AD development via the same molecular mechanism underlying LPS tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioma is a prevalent primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used to treat glioma. However, the resistance of TMZ to glioma poses heavy burden to glioma treatment. In this study, the effects of glioma resistance to TMZ and underlying mechanism were revealed. The expression levels of circ-VPS18, microRNA-370 (miR-370) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of RUNX1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and multi-drug resistance gene-1 (MDR1) was determined by western blot. The functional effects of circ-VPS18 knockdown on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression were revealed by cell counting kit-8 proliferation (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell assays. The impacts of circ-VPS18 deletion on TMZ sensitivity in vivo were illustrated by in vivo tumor formation assay. The binding relationship between miR-370 and circ-VPS18 or RUNX1 was predicted by starBase v2.0 online database and identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Circ-VPS18 expression and the mRNA and protein levels of RUNX1 were dramatically upregulated, and miR-370 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma cells, TMZ-resistant glioma tissues, or tissue compared with control groups. Functionally, circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity, induced cell apoptosis, whereas repressed cell viability, migration and invasion in U251/TR and LN229/TR cells, which was reversed by miR-370 inhibitor. Additionally, RUNX1 overexpression hindered the effects of miR-370 on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression. Circ-VPS18 knockdown enhanced TMZ sensitivity in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-VPS18 functioned as a sponge of miR-370 and miR-370 targeted RUNX1. Circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity and repressed glioma progression by sponging miR-370 to downregulate RUNX1 expression, which provided a new insight in further studying glioma resistance to TMZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a significant threat to human life and health. The intraneuronal accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brains of AD patients results in neuronal cell death, which is a key factor that triggers multiple changes in the pathogenesis of AD. The inhibition of Aβ-induced neuronal cell death may potentially help in the intervention and treatment of AD. Our previous study reported that tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) is induced by and promotes Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;25–35&lt;/sub&gt;-induced neurotoxicity in mouse neuronal cells, but the roles and regulatory mechanisms of TNFAIP1 are still largely unknown. In this study, our experimental results show that TNFAIP1 and p-TNFAIP1 (phosphorylation of TNFAIP1 at Ser280) are overexpressed in the neurons of the cortex and hippocampus in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and the transcription factor NF-κB is involved in the Aβ-induced upregulation of TNFAIP1. Moreover, our results suggest that TNFAIP1 contributes to the Aβ-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), and neuronal cell death in human SH-SY5Y cells. We further revealed that Aβ increases the binding of TNFAIP1 to RhoB, and knockdown of RhoB attenuates the TNFAIP1-induced apoptosis of human SH-SY5Y cells. These data suggest that TNFAIP1 is closely associated with AD pathogenesis, and overexpression of TNFAIP1 in the neurons of the brains of AD patients plays a role in apoptosis, at least in part, via RhoB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Migraine is a prevalent disorder in humans and represents one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability. Several genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathobiology of migraine. A number of studies have underscored the role of dysregulated immune reactions. We compared the expression levels &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-17&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IFN-γ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; cytokines in blood specimens of patients with migraine and those of healthy persons to identify any possible dysregulation in their expression and to propose mechanisms for this disorder. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;INF-γ&lt;/em&gt; was suggestively higher in migraine cases than in healthy individuals (posterior beta = 0.35, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.017). In addition, expression of this cytokine was lower in female subjects than in male subjects (posterior beta = −0.712, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.012). Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; was also higher in cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 1.34, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.04; posterior beta = 0.849, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.036; posterior beta = 0.451, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.042, respectively). On the other hand, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt; expression was lower in migraine cases than in controls (posterior beta = −0.78, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.039). Expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-1B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-17&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-2&lt;/em&gt; were not meaningfully different between cases and controls. The current study highlights the dysregulation of cytokine-coding genes in the blood of patients with migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Women with epilepsy are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effect of antiepileptic drugs on sexual function and satisfaction in women with epilepsy. In this cross-sectional study, 80 married women with epilepsy who were under treatment with antiepileptic drugs for at least 1 year were evaluated. Sexual function in patients was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of women was 28.8 (± 5.9) years. The mean (± SD) duration of epilepsy was 8.6 (± 4.1) years. Thirteen women (16.2%) had focal epilepsy and 67 (83.7%) had generalized epilepsy. The mean (± SD) overall sexual performance of patients was 20.5 (± 4.7). Fifteen patients (21.3%) had decreased sexual function and 78.2% had unfavorable sexual performance. Generalized epilepsy, multi-drug regimen, disease duration of more than 10 years, and age &amp;gt; 30 years were associated with sexual dysfunction. Due to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women with epilepsy, special attention should be given to appropriate management of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study presented two Chinese adult female patients who were diagnosed with adult-onset Krabbe disease (KD) and reviewed this disease in Chinese patients. Two young female adults in their 20s were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, including symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and laboratory studies were collected. Sequence alignment and structural modeling were carried out to analyze the pathogenesis of the disease. Both patients were adult-onset and both had a mild clinical course, presented with spastic weakness. The MRI study showed demyelination confined to the corticospinal tracts and parieto-occipital white matter. The β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity was obviously decreased in both patients. Gene test of GALC showed that both patients were compound heterozygotes; proband I was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and p.I250T (c.749 T &amp;gt; C), while proband II was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and a new variant of c.283_284del. Molecular analysis revealed the variants may influence the function of GALC. We provided two Chinese adult-onset KD, and the clinical and genetic characteristics of proband II was especially rare due to asymmetric symptoms, spinal cord involvement, and the identification of a new point mutation c.283_284del in the GALC gene. Variant c.749 T &amp;gt; C can present mild syndromes except for severe cases. c.283_284del is a new variant that may occur in adult-onset type.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies have shown that lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-29b are closely associated with repair of the injured spinal cord. However, the mechanism by which lncRNA NEAT1 promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury by regulating miR-29b has not been reported. To explore this mechanism, we established a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). The experimental rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: the sham, model, si-NEAT1, miR-29b, si-NEAT1 + negative control and si-NEAT1 + si-miR-29b groups. The hind limb motor function of the rats was evaluated on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after modelling using the BBB rating scale. Seven days after the operation, attenuation of pathological changes in injured spinal cord tissues was evaluated by HE staining. Anterior horn neurons and cavities in the injured area were counted by Nissl staining. In addition, the TUNEL assay was employed to study neuronal apoptosis in the anterior horn, and the expression of the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was analysed by western blotting. Finally, the protein expression of GFAP, NCAM, GAP43, and SCG10 was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. BBB scores revealed that decreasing the level of NEAT1 improved the hind limb motor function of the rats by increasing miR-29b expression. H&amp;amp;E and Nissl staining showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated lesions in the spinal cord and decreased the number of cavities in the injured spinal cord by upregulating miR-29b. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting suggested that silencing NEAT1 significantly downregulated GFAP expression and upregulated GAP43, SCG10 and NCAM expression by inducing overexpression of miR-29b. The TUNEL assay and western blotting also showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated neuronal apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It has been suggested that dysregulation of hormones is associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). This study aimed to measure the serum levels of progesterone and testosterone in 125 SCZ patients at different stages of treatment and 96 healthy control (HC) subjects. Our results showed that first-episode drug-free SCZ patients had significantly increased testosterone levels when compared with HC subjects, and chronic medication, but not short-term medication, further increased the serum testosterone levels in the patients. Further analysis suggested that the sex of the patients did not affect testosterone levels. In contrast, serum progesterone levels did not show significant differences between first-episode, drug-free SCZ patients and controls, and the antipsychotics increased progesterone levels in the male SCZ patients, but not female patients. Interestingly, our analyses demonstrated that the serum progesterone levels were negatively correlated with PANSS total score and PNASS positive score, suggesting a correlation between blood hormone levels and disease severity in SCZ patients. Taken together, our data showed differential changes in serum testosterone and progesterone levels in SCZ patients with or without antipsychotics, and our results suggest that increased sex hormone levels may be a defensive response to protect the human body under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most lethal malignancies of the central nervous system characterized by high mortality rate. The complexity of GBM pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis is not fully understood yet. GBM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry several oncogenic elements that facilitate GBM progression. The purpose of this study was to identify systems level molecular signatures from GBM-derived EVs using integrative analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data generated from plasma and serum samples. The dataset contained 19 samples in total, of which 15 samples were from plasma (11 GBM patients and 4 healthy samples) and 4 samples were from serum (2 GBM and 2 healthy samples). We carried out statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs, protein–protein interaction networks, module analysis, transcription factors and target gene regulatory networks analysis, and identification of hub genes. The differential expression of the identified hub genes were validated with the independent TCGA-GBM dataset. We have identified a few crucial genes and pathways associated with GBM prognosis and therapy resistance. The DEGs identified from plasma were associated with inflammatory processes and viral infection. On the other hand, the hub genes identified from the serum samples were significantly associated with protein ubiquitinylation processes and cytokine signaling regulation. The findings indicate that GBM-derived plasma and serum DEGs may be associated with distinct cellular processes and pathways which facilitate GBM progression. The findings will provide better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of GBM pathogenesis and progression. These results can further be utilized for developing and validating minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic molecular biomarkers for GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are commonly used to prevent weight gain and development of metabolic diseases associated with consumption of high-energy diets. Recent studies have demonstrated that these compounds may have unwanted detrimental effects under specific circumstances in vivo. In particular, an association between NNS consumption and changes in signaling pathways involved in the hunger-satiety system in the brain has been reported. Nonetheless, the extent of alterations in brain signaling pathways associated with consumption of these compounds has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of frequent consumption of NNSs on the expression of proteins involved in signaling pathways related to appetite control in the brain in vivo. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were supplemented with sucrose, sucralose, or steviol glycosides in their daily drinking water for 6 weeks. Subsequently, total brain protein extracts were used to analyze the expression of total and phosphorylated JAK2, STAT5, ERK 1/2, JNK, as well as SHP-2 and POMC, by western blot. Serum concentrations of leptin and α-MSH were quantified by ELISA. Results show that consumption of NNSs promotes significant changes in these signaling pathways, reducing the expression of pSTAT5/STAT5, pERK 1/2, SHP-2, and pJNK/JNK in male mice supplemented with steviol glycosides. Furthermore, consumption of steviol glycosides induced a decrease of α-MSH in male mice. In contrast, steviol glycosides induced overexpression of pSTAT5, pERK, and SHP-2 in females. These data suggest that chronic consumption of NNSs promotes sex-specific changes in signaling pathways related to the central hunger-satiety system in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As an important endogenous growth factor, PDGF-BB can effectively promote neurogenesis, thus is considered as a potential agent for Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapy. However, the protective function of PDGF-BB on neuronal cells, especially the molecular mechanism, remains less clear, which is needed to explore before its clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of PDGF-BB against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a widely used cellular tool for PD-related molecular study. Our results indicated that PDGF-BB exerts a prominent protective effect against neurotoxin MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered ROS generation and cellular loss. We further dissected the molecular mechanism involved in this process by using specific pharmacological inhibitors and validated that the distinct signaling pathways PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MEK/ERK are involved in the process against MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity upon PDGF-BB treatment. We also detected that activation of upstream PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MER/ERK signaling pathways contribute to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the downstream effector cyclic response element-binding protein (CREB), a known transcription factor to exhibit neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects. Using genetic approach, we further confirmed that the activation of CREB is involved in PDGF-BB-mediated protection in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these data demonstrated the protective effect of PDGF-BB in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and verified the involved molecular mechanism in PDGF-BB-mediated neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In past years model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has been one of the most
promising approaches in meta-learning. It can be applied to different kinds of
problems, e.g., reinforcement learning, but also shows good results on few-shot
learning tasks. Besides their tremendous success in these tasks, it has still
not been fully revealed yet, why it works so well. Recent work proposes that
MAML rather reuses features than rapidly learns. In this paper, we want to
inspire a deeper understanding of this question by analyzing MAML's
representation. We apply representation similarity analysis (RSA), a
well-established method in neuroscience, to the few-shot learning instantiation
of MAML. Although some part of our analysis supports their general results that
feature reuse is predominant, we also reveal arguments against their
conclusion. The similarity-increase of layers closer to the input layers arises
from the learning task itself and not from the model. In addition, the
representations after inner gradient steps make a broader change to the
representation than the changes during meta-training.

 &lt;p&gt;Image content is a predominant factor in marketing campaigns, websites and
banners. Today, marketers and designers spend considerable time and money in
generating such professional quality content. We take a step towards
simplifying this process using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We
propose a simple and novel conditioning strategy which allows generation of
images conditioned on given semantic attributes using a generator trained for
an unconditional image generation task. Our approach is based on modifying
latent vectors, using directional vectors of relevant semantic attributes in
latent space. Our method is designed to work with both discrete (binary and
multi-class) and continuous image attributes. We show the applicability of our
proposed approach, named Directional GAN, on multiple public datasets, with an
average accuracy of 86.4% across different attributes.

 &lt;p&gt;Scene understanding requires the extraction and representation of scene
components together with their properties and inter-relations. We describe a
model in which meaningful scene structures are extracted from the image by an
iterative process, combining bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) networks,
interacting through a symmetric bi-directional communication between them
(counter-streams structure). The model constructs a scene representation by the
iterative use of three components. The first model component is a BU stream
that extracts selected scene elements, properties and relations. The second
component (cognitive augmentation) augments the extracted visual representation
based on relevant non-visual stored representations. It also provides input to
the third component, the TD stream, in the form of a TD instruction,
instructing the model what task to perform next. The TD stream then guides the
BU visual stream to perform the selected task in the next cycle. During this
process, the visual representations extracted from the image can be combined
with relevant non-visual representations, so that the final scene
representation is based on both visual information extracted from the scene and
relevant stored knowledge of the world. We describe how a sequence of
TD-instructions is used to extract from the scene structures of interest,
including an algorithm to automatically select the next TD-instruction in the
sequence. The extraction process is shown to have favorable properties in terms
of combinatorial generalization, generalizing well to novel scene structures
and new combinations of objects, properties and relations not seen during
training. Finally, we compare the model with relevant aspects of the human
vision, and suggest directions for using the BU-TD scheme for integrating
visual and cognitive components in the process of scene understanding.

 &lt;p&gt;Adder neural network (AdderNet) is a new kind of deep model that replaces the
original massive multiplications in convolutions by additions while preserving
the high performance. Since the hardware complexity of additions is much lower
than that of multiplications, the overall energy consumption is thus reduced
significantly. To further optimize the hardware overhead of using AdderNet,
this paper studies the winograd algorithm, which is a widely used fast
algorithm for accelerating convolution and saving the computational costs.
Unfortunately, the conventional Winograd algorithm cannot be directly applied
to AdderNets since the distributive law in multiplication is not valid for the
l1-norm. Therefore, we replace the element-wise multiplication in the Winograd
equation by additions and then develop a new set of transform matrixes that can
enhance the representation ability of output features to maintain the
performance. Moreover, we propose the l2-to-l1 training strategy to mitigate
the negative impacts caused by formal inconsistency. Experimental results on
both FPGA and benchmarks show that the new method can further reduce the energy
consumption without affecting the accuracy of the original AdderNet.

 &lt;p&gt;This perspective piece came about through the Generative Adversarial
Collaboration (GAC) series of workshops organized by the Computational
Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN) conference in 2020. We brought together a number
of experts from the field of theoretical neuroscience to debate emerging issues
in our understanding of how learning is implemented in biological recurrent
neural networks. Here, we will give a brief review of the common assumptions
about biological learning and the corresponding findings from experimental
neuroscience and contrast them with the efficiency of gradient-based learning
in recurrent neural networks commonly used in artificial intelligence. We will
then outline the key issues discussed in the workshop: synaptic plasticity,
neural circuits, theory-experiment divide, and objective functions. Finally, we
conclude with recommendations for both theoretical and experimental
neuroscientists when designing new studies that could help to bring clarity to
these issues.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is a hereditary disorder characterized by paroxysmal attacks of ataxia, vertigo and nausea, due to mutations in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CACNA1A&lt;/em&gt; gene, which encodes for α1 subunit of the P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (CaV2.1). Other manifestations may be associated to &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CACNA1A&lt;/em&gt; mutations, such as migraine and epilepsy. The correlation between episodic ataxia and epilepsy is often underestimated and misdiagnosed. Clinical presentation of EA2 varies among patients and within the same family, and the same genetic mutation can lead to different clinical phenotypes. We herewith describe an Italian family presenting with typical EA2 and, in two of the family members (patients II.3 and III.1), epileptic seizures. The sequencing revealed a heterozygous deletion of 6 nucleotides in exon 28 of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CACNA1A&lt;/em&gt; gene, present in all affected patients. Evidence suggests that mutations of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CACNA1A&lt;/em&gt;, conferring a loss/reduction of CaV2.1 function, lead to an increase of thalamocortical excitation that contributes to epileptiform discharges. Our description highlights intra-family variability of EA2 phenotype and suggests that mutations in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CACNA1A&lt;/em&gt; gene should be suspected in individuals with focal or generalized epilepsy, associated with a family history of episodic ataxia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation. Genetic forms of FTLD and ALS are caused by pathogenic variants in various genes, such as PGRN (progranulin). To date, depletion of parkin E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a key mitophagy regulator, has been reported in sporadic ALS patients and ALS mice models with TDP-43 proteinopathy. In this work, we show parkin downregulation also in fibroblasts derived from FTLD patients with four different PGRN pathogenic variants. We corroborate this finding in control fibroblasts upon PGRN silencing, demonstrating additionally the decrease of parkin downstream targets, mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). Importantly, we show that TDP-43 overexpression rescues PRKN levels upon transient PGRN silencing, but not in FTLD fibroblasts with PGRN pathogenic variants, despite upregulating PGRN levels in both cases. Further observation of PRKN downregulation upon TDP-43 silencing, suggests that TDP-43 loss-of-function contributes to PRKN decrease. Our results provide further evidence that parkin downregulation might be a common and systemic phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases with TDP- 43 loss-of-function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;A common hypothesis explains autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a neurodevelopmental disorder linked to excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance in neuronal network connectivity. Mutation of genes including Met and downstream signaling components, e.g., PTEN, Tsc2 and, Rheb are involved in the control of synapse formation and stabilization and were all considered as risk genes for ASD. While the impact of Met on glutamatergic synapses was widely appreciated, its contribution to the stability of inhibitory, GABAergic synapses is poorly understood. The stabilization of GABAergic synapses depends on clustering of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin. Here, we show in vivo and in vitro that Met is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of GABAergic synapses via induction of gephyrin clustering. Likewise, we provide evidence for Met-dependent gephyrin clustering via activation of mTOR. Our results support the notion that deficient GABAergic signaling represents a pathomechanism for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are constituted of abnormally phosphorylated tau, is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The oligomeric aggregates of tau in AD brain (AD O-tau) are believed to trigger NFT spreading by seeding normal tau aggregation as toxic seeds, in a prion-like fashion. Here, we revealed the features of AD O-tau by Western blots using antibodies against various epitopes and determined the effect of dephosphorylation on the seeding activity of AD O-tau by capture and seeded aggregation assays. We found that N-terminal truncated and C-terminalhyperphosphorylated tau species were enriched in AD O-tau. Dephosphorylation of AD O-tau by alkaline phosphatasediminished its activity in capturing tau in vitro and ininducing insoluble aggregates in cultured cells. Our resultssuggested that dephosphorylation passivated the seeding activity ofAD O-tau. Inhibition of phosphorylation may be a potentstrategy to prevent the spreading of tau patho3logy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Since each individual subject may present completely different encephalogram (EEG) patterns with respect to other subjects, existing subject-independent emotion classifiers trained on data sampled from cross-subjects or cross-dataset generally fail to achieve sound accuracy. In this scenario, the domain adaptation technique could be employed to address this problem, which has recently got extensive attention due to its effectiveness on cross-distribution learning. Focusing on cross-subject or cross-dataset automated emotion recognition with EEG features, we propose in this article a robust multi-source co-adaptation framework by mining diverse correlation information (MACI) among domains and features with l&lt;sub&gt;2,1&lt;/sub&gt;−norm as well as correlation metric regularization. Specifically, by minimizing the statistical and semantic distribution differences between source and target domains, multiple subject-invariant classifiers can be learned together in a joint framework, which can make MACI use relevant knowledge from multiple sources by exploiting the developed correlation metric function. Comprehensive experimental evidence on DEAP and SEED datasets verifies the better performance of MACI in EEG-based emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Accumulating diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) evidence suggests that white matter abnormalities evaluated by local diffusion homogeneity (LDH) or fractional anisotropy (FA) occur in patients with blepharospasm (BSP), both of which are significantly correlated with disease severity. However, whether the individual severity of BSP can be identified using these DTI metrics remains unknown. We aimed to investigate whether a combination of machine learning techniques and LDH or FA can accurately identify the individual severity of BSP. Forty-one patients with BSP were assessed using the Jankovic Rating Scale and DTI. The patients were assigned to non-functionally and functionally limited groups according to their Jankovic Rating Scale scores. A machine learning scheme consisting of beam search and support vector machines was designed to identify non-functionally versus functionally limited outcomes, with the input features being LDH or FA in 68 white matter regions. The proposed machine learning scheme with LDH or FA yielded an overall accuracy of 88.67 versus 85.19% in identifying non-functionally limited versus functionally limited outcomes. The scheme also identified a sensitivity of 91.40 versus 85.87% in correctly identifying functionally limited outcomes, a specificity of 83.33 versus 83.67% in accurately identifying non-functionally limited outcomes, and an area under the curve of 93.7 versus 91.3%. These findings suggest that a combination of LDH or FA measurements and a sophisticated machine learning scheme can accurately and reliably identify the individual disease severity in patients with BSP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Voltage imaging with fluorescent dyes affords the opportunity to map neuronal activity in both time and space. One limitation to imaging is the inability to image complete neuronal networks: some fraction of cells remains outside of the observation window. Here, we combine voltage imaging, post hoc immunocytochemistry, and patterned microisland hippocampal culture to provide imaging of complete neuronal ensembles. The patterned microislands completely fill the field of view of our high-speed (500 Hz) camera, enabling reconstruction of the spiking patterns of every single neuron in the network. Cultures raised on microislands are similar to neurons grown on coverslips, with parallel developmental trajectories and composition of inhibitory and excitatory cell types (CA1, CA3, and dentate granule cells, or DGC). We calculate the likelihood that action potential firing in one neuron triggers action potential firing in a downstream neuron in a spontaneously active network to construct a functional connection map of these neuronal ensembles. Importantly, this functional map indicates preferential connectivity between DGC and CA3 neurons and between CA3 and CA1 neurons, mimicking the neuronal circuitry of the intact hippocampus. We envision that patterned microislands, in combination with voltage imaging and methods to classify cell types, will be a powerful method for exploring neuronal function in both healthy and disease states. Additionally, because the entire neuronal network is sampled simultaneously, this strategy has the power to go further, revealing all functional connections between all cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The ability to optically record dynamics of neuronal membrane potential promises to revolutionize our understanding of neurobiology. In this study, we show that the far-red voltage sensitive fluorophore, Berkeley Red Sensor of Transmembrane potential-1, or BeRST 1, can be used to monitor neuronal membrane potential changes across dozens of neurons at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. Notably, voltage imaging with BeRST 1 can be implemented with affordable, commercially available illumination sources, optics, and detectors. BeRST 1 is well-tolerated in cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and provides exceptional optical recording fidelity, as judged by dual fluorescence imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology. We developed a semi-automated spike-picking program to reduce user bias when calling action potentials and used this in conjunction with BeRST 1 to develop an optical spike and connectivity analysis (OSCA) for high-throughput dissection of neuronal activity dynamics. The high temporal resolution of BeRST 1 enables dissection of firing rate changes in response to acute, pharmacological interventions with commonly used inhibitors like gabazine and picrotoxin. Over longer periods of time, BeRST 1 also tracks chronic perturbations to neurons exposed to amyloid beta 1–42 (Aβ &lt;sup&gt;1–42&lt;/sup&gt;), revealing modest changes to spiking frequency but profound changes to overall network connectivity. Finally, we use OSCA to track changes in neuronal connectivity during maturation in culture, providing a functional readout of network assembly. We envision that use of BeRST 1 and OSCA described here will be of use to the broad neuroscience community.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Magnetometry based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is a novel technique capable of measuring magnetic fields with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution. With the further advancements of these sensors, they may open up novel approaches for the 2D imaging of neural signals in vitro. In the present study, we investigate the feasibility of NV-based imaging by numerically simulating the magnetic signal from the auditory pathway of a rodent brainstem slice (ventral cochlear nucleus, VCN, to the medial trapezoid body, MNTB) as stimulated by both electric and optic stimulation. The resulting signal from these two stimulation methods are evaluated and compared. A realistic pathway model was created based on published data of the neural morphologies and channel dynamics of the globular bushy cells in the VCN and their axonal projections to the principal cells in the MNTB. The pathway dynamics in response to optic and electric stimulation and the emitted magnetic fields were estimated using the cable equation. For simulating the optic stimulation, the light distribution in brain tissue was numerically estimated and used to model the optogenetic neural excitation based on a four state channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) model. The corresponding heating was also estimated, using the bio-heat equation and was found to be low (&amp;lt;2°C) even at excessively strong optic signals. A peak magnetic field strength of ∼0.5 and ∼0.1 nT was calculated from the auditory brainstem pathway after electrical and optical stimulation, respectively. By increasing the stimulating light intensity four-fold (far exceeding commonly used intensities) the peak magnetic signal strength only increased to 0.2 nT. Thus, while optogenetic stimulation would be favorable to avoid artefacts in the recordings, electric stimulation achieves higher peak fields. The present simulation study predicts that high-resolution magnetic imaging of the action potentials traveling along the auditory brainstem pathway will only be possible for next generation NV sensors. However, the existing sensors already have sufficient sensitivity to support the magnetic sensing of cumulated neural signals sampled from larger parts of the pathway, which might be a promising intermediate step toward further maturing this novel technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), reconstructed results can be critically biased by misinterpreted or missing phase data near the edges of the brain support originating from the non-local relationship between field and susceptibility. These data either have to be excluded or corrected before further processing can take place. To address this, our iterative restoration of the fringe phase (REFRASE) approach simultaneously enhances the accuracy of multi-echo phase data QSM maps and the extent of the area available for evaluation. Data loss caused by strong local phase gradients near the surface of the brain support is recovered within the original phase data using harmonic and dipole-based fields extrapolated from a robust support region toward an extended brain mask. Over several iterations, phase data are rectified prior to the application of further QSM processing steps. The concept is successfully validated on numerical phantoms and brain scans from a cohort of volunteers. The increased extent of the mask and improved numerical stability within the segmented globus pallidus confirm the efficacy of the presented method in comparison to traditional evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A core feature of drug-resistant epilepsy is hyperexcitability in the motor cortex, and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a suitable treatment for seizures. However, the antiepileptic effect causing network reorganization has rarely been studied. Here, we assessed the impact of rTMS on functional network connectivity (FNC) in resting functional networks (RSNs) and their relation to treatment response. Fourteen patients with medically intractable epilepsy received inhibitive rTMS with a figure-of-eight coil over the vertex for 10 days spread across two weeks. We designed a 6-week follow-up phase divided into four time points to investigate FNC and rTMS-induced timing-dependent plasticity, such as seizure frequency and abnormal interictal discharges on electroencephalography (EEG). For psychiatric comorbidities, the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) were applied to measure depression and anxiety before and after rTMS. FNC was also compared to that of a cohort of 17 healthy control subjects. The after-effects of rTMS included all subjects that achieved the significant decrease rate of more than 50% in interictal epileptiform discharges and seizure frequency, 12 (14) patients with the reduction rate above 50% compared to the baseline, as well as emotional improvements in depression and anxiety (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In the analysis of RSNs, we found a higher synchronization between the sensorimotor network (SMN) and posterior default-mode network (pDMN) in epileptic patients than in healthy controls. In contrast to pre-rTMS, the results demonstrated a weaker FNC between the anterior DMN (aDMN) and SMN after rTMS, while the FNC between the aDMN and dorsal attention network (DAN) was greater (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). Importantly, the depressive score was anticorrelated with the FNC of the aDMN-SMN (r = −0.67, p = 0.0022), which was markedly different in the good and bad response groups treated with rTMS (p = 0.0115). Based on the vertex suppression by rTMS, it is possible to achieve temporary clinical efficacy by modulating network reorganization in the DMN and SMN for patients with refractory epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Benzodiazepines have been widely used in clinical practice for over four decades and continue to be one of the most consumed and highly prescribed class of drugs available in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The literature indicates that Benzodiazepine users at a significantly increased risk of Motor Vehicle accidents compared to non-users but the impact on injuries at workplace is not well-defined. We aimed to investigate whether use of benzodiazepine is associated with increased risk of occupational injuries (OI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) among case controls, cross-sectional studies, either questionnaire or laboratory exams based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria, involving 324,168 OI from seven different countries, with an estimated occurrence of benzodiazepine positivity of 2.71% (95% CI 1.45–4.98). A total of 14 estimates were retrieved. Of them, 10 were based on laboratory analyses, three on institutional databases, while one study was based on questionnaires. Regarding the occupational groups, three estimates focused on commercial drivers (0.73%, 95% CI 0.12–4.30), that exhibited a reduced risk ratio for benzodiazepine positivity compared to other occupational groups (RR 0.109, 95% CI 0.063–0.187). Eventually, no increased risk for benzodiazepine positivity was identified, either from case control studies (OR 1.520, 95% CI 0.801–2.885, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 76%), or cross sectional studies, when only laboratory based estimates were taken in account (OR 0.590, 95% CI 0.253–1.377, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 63%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Even though benzodiazepines have the potential to increase injury rates among casual and chronic users, available evidence are insufficient to sustain this hypothesis, particularly when focusing on laboratory-based studies (i.e., studies the characterized the benzodiazepine immediately before the event).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The claustrum is a thin sheet of neurons that is densely connected to many cortical regions and has been implicated in numerous high-order brain functions. Such brain functions arise from brain states that are influenced by neuromodulatory pathways from the cholinergic basal forebrain, dopaminergic substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, and serotonergic raphe. Recent revelations that the claustrum receives dense input from these structures have inspired investigation of state-dependent control of the claustrum. Here, we review neuromodulation in the claustrum—from anatomical connectivity to behavioral manipulations—to inform future analyses of claustral function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Wide-field Optical Imaging of Intrinsic Signals (OI-IS; Grinvald et al., 1986) is a method for imaging functional brain hemodynamic responses, mainly used to image activity from the surface of the cerebral cortex. It localizes small functional modules – such as cortical columns – with great spatial resolution and spatial specificity relative to the site of increases in neuronal activity. OI-IS is capable of imaging responses either through an intact or thinned skull or following a craniotomy. Therefore, it is minimally invasive, which makes it ideal for survival experiments. Here we describe OI-IS-based methods for guiding microinjections of optogenetics viral vectors in proximity to small functional modules (S1 barrels) of the cerebral cortex and for guiding the insertion of electrodes for electrophysiological recording into such modules. We validate our proposed methods by tissue processing of the cerebral barrel field area, revealing the track of the electrode in a predetermined barrel. In addition, we demonstrate the use of optical imaging to visualize the spatial extent of the optogenetics photostimulation, making it possible to estimate one of the two variables that conjointly determine which region of the brain is stimulated. Lastly, we demonstrate the use of OI-IS at high-magnification for imaging the upper recording contacts of a laminar probe, making it possible to estimate the insertion depth of all contacts relative to the surface of the cortex. These methods support the precise positioning of microinjections and recording electrodes, thus overcoming the variability in the spatial position of fine-scale functional modules.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Context: Cognitive impairments are common in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and are heterogeneous in their presentation. The “dual syndrome hypothesis” suggests the existence of two distinct subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD: a frontostriatal subtype with predominant attentional and/or executive deficits and a posterior cortical subtype with predominant visuospatial, memory, and/or language deficits. The latter subtype has been associated with a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The objective of this study was to identify structural modifications in cortical and subcortical regions associated with each PD-MCI subtype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-hundred and fourteen non-demented PD patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment as well as a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scan. Patients were categorized as having no cognitive impairment (n = 41) or as having a frontostriatal (n = 16), posterior cortical (n = 25), or a mixed (n = 32) MCI subtype. Cortical regions were analyzed using a surface-based Cortical thickness (CTh) method. In addition, the volumes, shapes, and textures of the caudate nuclei, hippocampi, and thalami were studied. Tractometric analyses were performed on associative and commissural white matter (WM) tracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There were no between-group differences in volumetric measurements and cortical thickness. Shape analyses revealed more abundant and more extensive deformations fields in the caudate nuclei, hippocampi, and thalami in patients with posterior cortical deficits compared to patients with no cognitive impairment. Decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) were also observed in the superior longitudinal fascicle, the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, the striato-parietal tract, and the anterior and posterior commissural tracts. Texture analyses showed a significant difference in the right hippocampus of patients with a mixed MCI subtype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: PD-MCI patients with posterior cortical deficits have more abundant and more extensive structural alterations independently of age, disease duration, and severity, which may explain why they have an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: In recent years several &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeled amyloid PET (Aβ-PET) tracers have been developed and have obtained clinical approval. There is evidence that Aβ-PET perfusion can provide surrogate information about neuronal injury in neurodegenerative diseases when compared to conventional blood flow and glucose metabolism assessment. However, this paradigm has not yet been tested in neurodegenerative disorders with cortical and subcortical affection. Therefore, we investigated the performance of early acquisition &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flutemetamol Aβ-PET in comparison to &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in corticobasal syndrome (CBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Subjects with clinically possible or probable CBS were recruited within the prospective Activity of Cerebral Networks, Amyloid and Microglia in Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (ActiGliA) observational study and all CBS cases with an available FDG-PET prior to Aβ-PET were selected. Aβ-PET was acquired 0–10 min p.i. (early-phase) and 90–110 min p.i. (late-phase) whereas FDG-PET was recorded statically from 30 to 50 min p.i. Semiquantitative regional values and asymmetry indices (AI) were compared between early-phase Aβ-PET and FDG-PET. Visual assessments of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism were compared between both methods. Late-phase Aβ-PET was evaluated visually for assessment of Aβ-positivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Among 20 evaluated patients with CBS, 5 were Aβ-positive. Early-phase Aβ-PET and FDG-PET SUVr correlated highly in cortical (mean R = 0.86, range 0.77–0.92) and subcortical brain regions (mean R = 0.84, range 0.79–0.90). Strong asymmetry was observed in FDG-PET for the motor cortex (mean |AI| = 2.9%), the parietal cortex (mean |AI| = 2.9%), and the thalamus (mean |AI| = 5.5%), correlating well with AI of early-phase Aβ-PET (mean R = 0.87, range 0.62–0.98). Visual assessments of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism were highly congruent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Early-phase Aβ-PET facilitates assessment of neuronal injury in CBS for cortical and subcortical areas. Known asymmetries in CBS are captured by this method, enabling assessment of Aβ-status and neuronal injury with a single radiation exposure at a single visit.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear why patients with young-onset Parkinson’s disease more often develop levo-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa)-induced dyskinesia (LID) and have a more severe form than patients with old-onset Parkinson’s disease. Previous studies using animal models have failed to show young-onset Parkinson’s disease enhances LID.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the association of age at dopaminergic denervation (onset age) and initiation of L-dopa treatment (treatment age) with LID development in model rats.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We established rat models of young- and old-lesioned Parkinson’s disease (6-hydroxydopamine lesions at 10 and 88 weeks of age, respectively). Dopaminergic denervation was confirmed by the rotational behavior test using apomorphine. Rats in the young-lesioned group were allocated to either L-dopa treatment at a young or old age, or saline treatment. Rats in the old-lesioned group were allocated to either L-dopa treatment or saline group. We evaluated L-dopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements during the 14-day treatment period. We also examined preprodynorphin mRNA expression in the striatum (a neurochemical hallmark of LID) and the volume of the medial globus pallidus (a pathological hallmark of LID).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;LID-like behavior was enhanced in L-dopa-treated young-lesioned rats compared with L-dopa-treated old-lesioned rats. Preprodynorphin mRNA expression was higher in L-dopa-treated young-lesioned rats than in in L-dopa-treated old-lesioned rats. The volume of the medial globus pallidus was greater in L-dopa-treated young-lesioned rats than in L-dopa-treated old-lesioned rats. Treatment age did not affect LID-like behavior or the degree of medial globus pallidus hypertrophy in the young-lesioned model.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both dopaminergic denervation and L-dopa initiation at a young age contributed to the development of LID; however, the former may be a more important factor.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Identification of early modifiable factors is crucial to delay or prevent the development of cognitive impairment and reduce the social and economic burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to examine the longitudinal associations of childhood neighborhood quality (CNQ) with the risk of later-life cognitive dysfunction and the role of body mass index (BMI) in this association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 8,289 community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly population from wave 2011, wave 2013, and wave 2015 of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were included. Cognitive function and CNQ were measured by standardized questionnaires. Multilevel linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of CNQ and cognitive function. The interactions of BMI with CNQ in the progress of cognitive function were also estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The participants with higher CNQ had a significantly low risk of cognitive impairment than those with lower CNQ score (β = 0.067, 95% CI: 0.031, 0.103), and the results remained similar (β = 0.039, 95% CI: 0.004, 0.075) after controlling other confounding variables. Furthermore, there was an interaction between BMI with CNQ score (P &amp;lt; 0.001) for the risk of cognitive impairment. In BMI-stratified analysis, we found that the association of CNQ and cognitive function was not statistically significant in overweight or obese population (β = 0.019, 95% CI: −0.032, 0.070), but was statistically significant in people with lower BMI (β = 0.059, 95% CI: 0.010, 0.107).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Higher CNQ score is significantly associated with the lower risk of cognitive dysfunction in adulthood. BMI may moderate the associations of CNQ with the risk of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Abnormal cholesterol metabolism is common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and causes dementia. Cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) converts cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC) and maintains cholesterol homeostasis in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the roles of 24-OHC and the CYP46A1 (rs754203) polymorphism in patients with T2DM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 193 Chinese patients with T2DM were recruited into two groups according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic and clinical data were collected, and neuropsychological tests were conducted. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Seqnome method were used to detect the concentration of plasma 24-OHC and the CYP46A1 rs754203 genotype, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with 118 healthy cognition participants, patients with MCI (n = 75) displayed a higher plasma level of 24-OHC and total cholesterol concentration (all p = 0.031), while no correlation was found between them. In the overall diabetes population, the plasma level of 24-OHC was negatively correlated with MoCA (r = −0.150, p = 0.039), and it was further proved to be an independent risk factor of diabetic MCI (OR = 1.848, p = 0.001). Additionally, patients with MCI and the CC genotype of CYP46A1 rs754203 showed the highest plasma level of 24-OHC even though the difference was not statistically significant, and they obtained low scores in both the verbal fluency test and Stroop color and word test A (p = 0.008 and p = 0.029, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In patients with T2DM, high plasma level of 24-OHC and the CC genotype carrier of CYP46A1 rs754203 may portend a high risk of developing early cognitive impairment, including attention and executive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Dopamine (DA) is a critical modulator of brain circuits that control voluntary movements, but our understanding of its influence on the activity of target neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains limited. Here, we use two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging to monitor the activity of direct and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs) simultaneously in the striatum of behaving mice during acute and prolonged manipulations of DA signaling. We find that increasing and decreasing DA biases striatal activity towards the direct and indirect pathways, respectively, by changing the overall number of SPNs recruited during behavior in a manner not predicted by existing models of DA function. This modulation is drastically altered in a model of Parkinson's disease. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated population-level influence of DA on striatal output and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Quantifying the relative impact of environmental conditions and host community structure on disease is one of the greatest challenges of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century, as both climate and biodiversity are changing at unprecedented rates. Both increasing temperature and shifting host communities towards more fast-paced life-history strategies are predicted to increase disease, yet their independent and interactive effects on disease in natural communities remains unknown. Here, we address this challenge by surveying foliar disease symptoms in 220, 0.5 meter-diameter herbaceous plant communities along a 1100-meter elevational gradient. We find that increasing temperature associated with lower elevation can increase disease by (1) relaxing constraints on parasite growth and reproduction, (2) determining which host species are present in a given location, and (3) strengthening the positive effect of host community pace-of-life on disease. These results provide the first field evidence, under natural conditions, that environmental gradients can alter how host community structure affects disease.</content>

 We previously used a pulse-based &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;assay to unveil targetable signalling pathways associated with innate cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma (Hastings et al., 2020). Here we advanced this model system and identified a non-genetic mechanism of resistance that drives recovery and regrowth in a subset of cells. Using RNAseq and a suite of biosensors to track single cell fates both &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;in vivo,&lt;/i&gt; we identified that early S phase cells have a greater ability to maintain proliferative capacity, which correlated with reduced DNA damage over multiple generations. In contrast, cells in G1, late S or those treated with PARP/RAD51 inhibitors, maintained higher levels of DNA damage and underwent prolonged S/G2 phase arrest and senescence. Combined with our previous work, these data indicate that there is a non-genetic mechanism of resistance in human lung adenocarcinoma that is dependent on the cell cycle stage at the time of cisplatin exposure.</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;i&gt;ARID1A&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most frequently mutated epigenetic regulators in a wide spectrum of cancers. Recent studies have shown that &lt;i&gt;ARID1A&lt;/i&gt; deficiency induces global changes in the epigenetic landscape of enhancers and promoters. These broad and complex effects make it challenging to identify the driving mechanisms of &lt;i&gt;ARID1A&lt;/i&gt; deficiency in promoting cancer progression. Here, we identified the anti-senescence effect of &lt;i&gt;Arid1a &lt;/i&gt;deficiency in the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) by profiling the transcriptome of individual PanINs in a mouse model. In a human cell line model, we found that &lt;i&gt;ARID1A&lt;/i&gt; deficiency upregulates the expression of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member A1 (&lt;i&gt;ALDH1A1&lt;/i&gt;), which plays an essential role in attenuating the senescence induced by oncogenic KRAS through scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, our ATAC sequencing data showed that &lt;i&gt;ARID1A &lt;/i&gt;deficiency increases the accessibility of the enhancer region of &lt;i&gt;ALDH1A1&lt;/i&gt;. This study provides the first evidence that &lt;i&gt;ARID1A&lt;/i&gt; deficiency promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis by attenuating &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt;-induced senescence through the upregulation of &lt;i&gt;ALDH1A1 &lt;/i&gt;expression.</content>

 Aging is a complex biological process characterized by hallmark features accumulating over the life course, shaping the individual's aging trajectory and subsequent disease risks. There is substantial individual variability in the aging process between men and women. In general, women live longer than men, consistent with lower biological ages as assessed by molecular biomarkers, but there is a paradox. Women are frailer and have worse health at the end of life, while men still perform better in physical function examinations. Moreover, many age-related diseases show sex-specific patterns. In this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on sexual dimorphism in human studies, with support from animal research, on biological aging and illnesses. We also attempt to place it in the context of the theories of aging, as well as discuss the explanations for the sex differences, for example, the sex-chromosome linked mechanisms and hormonally driven differences.</content>

 Beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau proteins, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are believed to spread through connected regions of the brain. Combining diffusion imaging and positron emission tomography, we investigated associations between white matter microstructure specifically in bundles connecting regions where Aβ or tau accumulates and pathology. We focussed on free-water corrected diffusion measures in the anterior cingulum, posterior cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus in cognitively normal older adults at risk of sporadic AD and presymptomatic mutation carriers of autosomal dominant AD. In Aβ-positive or tau-positive groups, lower tissue fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity related to greater Aβ and tau burden in both cohorts. Associations were found in the posterior cingulum and uncinate fasciculus in preclinical sporadic AD, and in the anterior and posterior cingulum in presymptomatic mutation carriers. These results suggest that microstructural alterations accompany pathological accumulation as early as the preclinical stage of both sporadic and autosomal dominant AD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 During clathrin-mediated endocytosis in eukaryotes, actin assembly is required to overcome large membrane tension and turgor pressure. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the actin machinery adapts to varying membrane tension remain unknown. In addition, how cells reduce their membrane tension when they are challenged by hypotonic shocks remains unclear. We used quantitative microscopy to demonstrate that cells rapidly reduce their membrane tension using three parallel mechanisms. In addition to using their cell wall for mechanical protection, yeast cells disassemble eisosomes to buffer moderate changes in membrane tension on a minute time scale. Meanwhile, a temporary reduction of the rate of endocytosis for 2 to 6 minutes, and an increase in the rate of exocytosis for at least 5 minutes allow cells to add large pools of membrane to the plasma membrane. We built on these results to submit the cells to abrupt increases in membrane tension and determine that the endocytic actin machinery of fission yeast cells rapidly adapts to perform clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our study sheds light on the tight connection between membrane tension regulation, endocytosis and exocytosis.</content>

		<content type="html">
 It is shared notion that speech and music processing share some commonalities. Brain bioelectrical activity was recorded in healthy participants listening to music obtained by digitally transforming real speech into melodies played by viola. Sentences were originally pronounced with a positive or negative affective prosody. The research's aim was to investigate if the emotional content of music was extracted similarly to how the affective prosody of speech is processed. EEG was recorded from 128 electrodes in 20 healthy students. Participants had to detect rare neutral piano sounds while ignoring viola melodies. Stimulus negative valence increased the amplitude of frontal P300 and N400 ERP components while a late inferior frontal positivity was enhanced in response to positive melodies. Similar ERP markers were previously found for processing positive and negative music, vocalizations and speech. Source reconstruction applied to N400 showed that negative melodies engaged the right superior temporal gyrus and right anterior cingulate cortex, while positive melodies engaged the left middle and inferior temporal gyrus and the inferior frontal cortex. An integrated model is proposed depicting a possible common circuit for processing the emotional content of music, vocalizations and speech, which might explain some universal and relatively innate brain reaction to music.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Negative bias-a mood-congruent bias in emotion processing-is an important aspect of major depressive disorder (MDD), and such a bias in facial expression recognition has a significant effect on patients' social lives. Neuroscience research shows abnormal activity in emotion-processing systems regarding facial expressions in MDD. However, the neural basis of negative bias in facial expression processing has not been explored directly. Methods: Sixteen patients with MDD and twenty-three healthy controls (HC) who underwent an fMRI scan during an explicit facial emotion task with happy to sad faces were selected. We identified brain areas in which the MDD and HC groups showed different correlations between the behavioral negative bias scores and functional activities. Results: Behavioral data confirmed the existence of a higher negative bias in the MDD group. Regarding the relationship with neural activity, higher activity of happy faces in the posterior cerebellum was related to a higher negative bias in the MDD group, but lower negative bias in the HC group. Limitations: The sample size was small, and the possible effects of medication were not controlled for in this study. Conclusions: We confirmed a negative bias in the recognition of facial expressions in patients with MDD. fMRI data suggest the cerebellum as a moderator of facial emotion processing, which biases the recognition of facial expressions toward their own mood.</content>

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a vital, yet often overlooked role in the living cells through modulation of protein properties, such as localization and affinity towards their interactors, thereby enabling quick adaptation to changing environmental conditions. We have previously benchmarked a computational framework for the prediction of PTMs’ effects on the stability of protein-protein interactions, which has molecular dynamics simulations followed by free energy calculations at its core. In the present work, we apply this framework to publicly available data on &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; protein structures and PTM sites, identified in both normal and stress conditions. We predict proteome-wide effects of acetylations and phosphorylations on protein-protein interactions and find that acetylations more frequently have locally stabilizing roles in protein interactions, while the opposite is true for phosphorylations. However, the overall impact of PTMs on protein-protein interactions is more complex than a simple sum of local changes caused by the introduction of PTMs and adds to our understanding of PTM cross-talk. We further use the obtained data to calculate the conformational changes brought about by PTMs. Finally, conservation of the analyzed PTM residues in orthologues shows that some predictions for yeast proteins will be mirrored to other organisms, including human. This work, therefore, contributes to our overall understanding of the modulation of the cellular protein interaction networks in yeast and beyond.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NDOhPt9osPI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genomic data analysis across multiple cloud platforms is an ongoing challenge, especially when large amounts of data are involved. Here, we present Swarm, a framework for federated computation that promotes minimal data motion and facilitates crosstalk between genomic datasets stored on various cloud platforms. We demonstrate its utility via common inquiries of genomic variants across BigQuery in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Athena in the Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Presto and MySQL. Compared to single-cloud platforms, the Swarm framework significantly reduced computational costs, run-time delays and risks of security breach and privacy violation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D1mtzG98xz8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The dynamics of local cortical networks are irregular, but correlated. Dynamic excitatory–inhibitory balance is a plausible mechanism that generates such irregular activity, but it remains unclear how balance is achieved and maintained in plastic neural networks. In particular, it is not fully understood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in turn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How do the dynamics of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address these questions, we develop a theory of spike–timing dependent plasticity in balanced networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity–induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the initial state of the network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also describe the dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons receive targeted optogenetic input.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E7BoTvQVsEI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The presence of extra centrioles, termed centrosome amplification, is a hallmark of cancer. The distribution of centriole numbers within a cancer cell population appears to be at an equilibrium maintained by centriole overproduction and selection, reminiscent of mutation-selection balance. It is unknown to date if the interaction between centriole overproduction and selection can quantitatively explain the intra- and inter-population heterogeneity in centriole numbers. Here, we define mutation-selection-like models and employ a model selection approach to infer patterns of centriole overproduction and selection in a diverse panel of human cell lines. Surprisingly, we infer strong and uniform selection against any number of extra centrioles in most cell lines. Finally we assess the accuracy and precision of our inference method and find that it increases non-linearly as a function of the number of sampled cells. We discuss the biological implications of our results and how our methodology can inform future experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/THJjMqxeT7s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Perceptual anomalies in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been attributed to an imbalance in weighting incoming sensory evidence with prior knowledge when interpreting sensory information. Here, we show that sensory encoding and how it adapts to changing stimulus statistics during feedback also characteristically differs between neurotypical and ASD groups. In a visual orientation estimation task, we extracted the accuracy of sensory encoding from psychophysical data by using an information theoretic measure. Initially, sensory representations in both groups reflected the statistics of visual orientations in natural scenes, but encoding capacity was overall lower in the ASD group. Exposure to an artificial (i.e., uniform) distribution of visual orientations coupled with performance feedback altered the sensory representations of the neurotypical group toward the novel experimental statistics, while also increasing their total encoding capacity. In contrast, neither total encoding capacity nor its allocation significantly changed in the ASD group. Across both groups, the degree of adaptation was correlated with participants’ initial encoding capacity. These findings highlight substantial deficits in sensory encoding—independent from and potentially in addition to deficits in decoding—in individuals with ASD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6ncwIQm29wk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Melanin, a black-brown pigment found throughout all kingdoms of life, has diverse biological functions including UV protection, thermoregulation, oxidant scavenging, arthropod immunity, and microbial virulence. Given melanin’s broad roles in the biosphere, particularly in insect immune defenses, it is important to understand how exposure to ubiquitous environmental contaminants affects melanization. Glyphosate—the most widely used herbicide globally—inhibits melanin production, which could have wide-ranging implications in the health of many organisms, including insects. Here, we demonstrate that glyphosate has deleterious effects on insect health in 2 evolutionary distant species, &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt; (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and &lt;i&gt;Anopheles gambiae&lt;/i&gt; (Diptera: Culicidae), suggesting a broad effect in insects. Glyphosate reduced survival of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mellonella&lt;/i&gt; caterpillars following infection with the fungus &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt; and decreased the size of melanized nodules formed in hemolymph, which normally help eliminate infection. Glyphosate also increased the burden of the malaria-causing parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gambiae&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes, altered uninfected mosquito survival, and perturbed the microbial composition of adult mosquito midguts. Our results show that glyphosate’s mechanism of melanin inhibition involves antioxidant synergy and disruption of the reaction oxidation–reduction balance. Overall, these findings suggest that glyphosate’s environmental accumulation could render insects more susceptible to microbial pathogens due to melanin inhibition, immune impairment, and perturbations in microbiota composition, potentially contributing to declines in insect populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GZuaIKkRX-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Although visceral adipocytes located within the body’s central core are maintained at approximately 37°C, adipocytes within bone marrow, subcutaneous, and dermal depots are found primarily within the peripheral shell and generally exist at cooler temperatures. Responses of brown and beige/brite adipocytes to cold stress are well studied; however, comparatively little is known about mechanisms by which white adipocytes adapt to temperatures below 37°C. Here, we report that adaptation of cultured adipocytes to 31°C, the temperature at which distal marrow adipose tissues and subcutaneous adipose tissues often reside, increases anabolic and catabolic lipid metabolism, and elevates oxygen consumption. Cool adipocytes rely less on glucose and more on pyruvate, glutamine, and, especially, fatty acids as energy sources. Exposure of cultured adipocytes and gluteal white adipose tissue (WAT) to cool temperatures activates a shared program of gene expression. Cool temperatures induce stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) expression and monounsaturated lipid levels in cultured adipocytes and distal bone marrow adipose tissues (BMATs), and SCD1 activity is required for acquisition of maximal oxygen consumption at 31°C.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HWca-NFdEDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The critical brain hypothesis has emerged as an attractive framework to
understand the functional implications of the variability in brain activity.
However, the mechanisms behind the observed emergent collective neural patterns
remain unclear. Here we propose a modeling framework to reconcile apparent
contrasting results. We show that the presence of scale-free neuronal
avalanches and the associated crackling-noise relation can be explained by the
presence of an extrinsic, stochastic-induced mutual information in the system,
whereas the intrinsic spatial correlation structure shows the typical features
of systems close to their critical point. We test our results on data obtained
from the rat's cortex through state-of-the-art multi-array probes.

 &lt;p&gt;The representation of the natural-density, heterogeneous connectivity of
neuronal network models at relevant spatial scales remains a challenge for
Computational Neuroscience and Neuromorphic Computing. In particular, the
memory demands imposed by the vast number of synapses in brain-scale network
simulations constitutes a major obstacle. Limiting the number resolution of
synaptic weights appears to be a natural strategy to reduce memory and compute
load. In this study, we investigate the effects of a limited synaptic-weight
resolution on the dynamics of recurrent spiking neuronal networks resembling
local cortical circuits, and develop strategies for minimizing deviations from
the dynamics of networks with high-resolution synaptic weights. We mimic the
effect of a limited synaptic weight resolution by replacing normally
distributed synaptic weights by weights drawn from a discrete distribution, and
compare the resulting statistics characterizing firing rates, spike-train
irregularity, and correlation coefficients with the reference solution. We show
that a naive discretization of synaptic weights generally leads to a distortion
of the spike-train statistics. Only if the weights are discretized such that
the mean and the variance of the total synaptic input currents are preserved,
the firing statistics remains unaffected for the types of networks considered
in this study. For networks with sufficiently heterogeneous in-degrees, the
firing statistics can be preserved even if all synaptic weights are replaced by
the mean of the weight distribution. We conclude that even for simple networks
with non-plastic neurons and synapses, a discretization of synaptic weights can
lead to substantial deviations in the firing statistics, unless the
discretization is performed with care and guided by a rigorous validation
process.

 &lt;p&gt;An emerging optimisation problem from the real-world applications, named the
multi-point dynamic aggregation (MPDA) problem, has become one of the active
research topics of the multi-robot system. This paper focuses on a
multi-objective MPDA problem which is to design an execution plan of the robots
to minimise the number of robots and the maximal completion time of all the
tasks. The strongly-coupled relationships among robots and tasks, the
redundancy of the MPDA encoding, and the variable-size decision space of the
MO-MPDA problem posed extra challenges for addressing the problem effectively.
To address the above issues, we develop a hybrid decomposition-based
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (HDMOEA) using $ \varepsilon
$-constraint method. It selects the maximal completion time of all tasks as the
main objective, and converted the other objective into constraints. HDMOEA
decomposes a MO-MPDA problem into a series of scalar constrained optimization
subproblems by assigning each subproblem with an upper bound robot number. All
the subproblems are optimized simultaneously with the transferring knowledge
from other subproblems. Besides, we develop a hybrid population initialisation
mechanism to enhance the quality of initial solutions, and a reproduction
mechanism to transmit effective information and tackle the encoding redundancy.
Experimental results show that the proposed HDMOEA method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of several most-used metrics.

 &lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to
their biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.
As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for
shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination
in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning
algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly
optimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine
the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of
network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning
and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset
so far. Moreover, it reaches a $\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented
0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in
SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep
SNNs. Our codes are available at

 &lt;p&gt;Heuristic optimisation algorithms are in high demand due to the overwhelming
amount of complex optimisation problems that need to be solved. The complexity
of these problems is well beyond the boundaries of applicability of exact
optimisation algorithms and therefore require modern heuristics to find
feasible solutions quickly. These heuristics and their effects are almost
always evaluated and explained by particular problem instances. In previous
works, it has been shown that many such algorithms show structural bias, by
either being attracted to a certain region of the search space or by
consistently avoiding regions of the search space, on a special test function
designed to ensure uniform 'exploration' of the domain. In this paper, we
analyse the emergence of such structural bias for Differential Evolution (DE)
configurations and, specifically, the effect of different mutation, crossover
and correction strategies. We also analyse the emergence of the structural bias
during the run-time of each algorithm. We conclude with recommendations of
which configurations should be avoided in order to run DE unbiased.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The identification of abnormal electrographic activity is important in a wide
range of neurological disorders, including epilepsy for localising
epileptogenic tissue. However, this identification may be challenging during
non-seizure (interictal) periods, especially if abnormalities are subtle
compared to the repertoire of possible healthy brain dynamics. Here, we
investigate if such interictal abnormalities become more salient by
quantitatively accounting for the range of healthy brain dynamics in a
location-specific manner. To this end, we constructed a normative map of brain
dynamics, in terms of relative band power, from interictal intracranial
recordings from 234 subjects (21,598 electrode contacts). We then compared
interictal recordings from 62 patients with epilepsy to the normative map to
identify abnormal regions. We hypothesised that if the most abnormal regions
were spared by surgery, then patients would be more likely to experience
continued seizures post-operatively. We first confirmed that the spatial
variations of band power in the normative map across brain regions were
consistent with healthy variations reported in the literature. Second, when
accounting for the normative variations, regions which were spared by surgery
were more abnormal than those resected only in patients with persistent
post-operative seizures (t=-3.6, p=0.0003), confirming our hypothesis. Third,
we found that this effect discriminated patient outcomes (AUC=0.75 p=0.0003).
Normative mapping is a well-established practice in neuroscientific research.
Our study suggests that this approach is feasible to detect interictal
abnormalities in intracranial EEG, and of potential clinical value to identify
pathological tissue in epilepsy. Finally, we make our normative intracranial
map publicly available to facilitate future investigations in epilepsy and
beyond.

 &lt;p&gt;Standard few-shot experiments involve learning to efficiently match
previously unseen samples by class. We claim that few-shot learning should be
long term, assimilating knowledge for the future, without forgetting previous
concepts. In the mammalian brain, the hippocampus is understood to play a
significant role in this process, by learning rapidly and consolidating
knowledge to the neocortex incrementally over a short period. In this research
we tested whether an artificial hippocampal algorithm (AHA), could be used with
a conventional Machine Learning (ML) model that learns incrementally analogous
to the neocortex, to achieve one-shot learning both short and long term. The
results demonstrated that with the addition of AHA, the system could learn in
one-shot and consolidate the knowledge for the long term without catastrophic
forgetting. This study is one of the first examples of using a CLS model of
hippocampus to consolidate memories, and it constitutes a step toward few-shot
continual learning.

 &lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of computing technology, wearable devices such as
smart phones and wristbands make it easy to get access to people's health
information including activities, sleep, sports, etc. Smart healthcare achieves
great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user
data. However, there are two critical challenges. Firstly, user data often
exists in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform
aggregation without compromising privacy security. Secondly, the models trained
on the cloud fail on personalization. In this paper, we propose FedHealth, the
first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle
these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated
learning, and then builds personalized models by transfer learning. It is able
to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy
and security. Experiments demonstrate that FedHealth produces higher accuracy
(5.3% improvement) for wearable activity recognition when compared to
traditional methods. FedHealth is general and extensible and has the potential
to be used in many healthcare applications.

 &lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 12 May 2021; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22949-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-021-22949-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Islands can provide insights into the evolution of diverse adaptations. The genomes of 34 major lineages of Mediterranean wall lizards reveal a highly reticulated pattern of evolution across the group, characterised by mosaic genomes and showing that hybrid lineages gave rise to several extant endemics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/W_rFo3Irym0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interactions between cerebellum (CB) and primary motor cortex (M1) are critical for effective motor function. Although the associated neurophysiological processes are yet to be fully characterised, a growing body of work using non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques has significantly progressed our current understanding. In particular, recent developments with both transcranial magnetic (TMS) and direct current (tDCS) stimulation suggest that CB modulates the activity of local excitatory interneuronal circuits within M1. These circuits are known to be important both physiologically and functionally, and understanding the nature of their connectivity with CB therefore has the potential to provide important insight for NIBS applications. Consequently, this mini-review provides an overview of the emerging literature that has investigated interactions between CB and the intracortical excitatory circuits of M1.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Uncovering the complex network of the brain is of great interest to the field of neuroimaging. Mining from these rich datasets, scientists try to unveil the fundamental biological mechanisms in the human brain. However, neuroimaging data collected for constructing brain networks is generally costly, and thus extracting useful information from a limited sample size of brain networks is demanding. Currently, there are two common trends in neuroimaging data collection that could be exploited to gain more information: 1) multimodal data, and 2) longitudinal data. It has been shown that these two types of data provide complementary information. Nonetheless, it is challenging to learn brain network representations that can simultaneously capture network properties from multimodal as well as longitudinal datasets. Here we propose a general fusion framework for multi-source learning of brain networks – multimodal brain network fusion with longitudinal coupling (MMLC). In our framework, three layers of information are considered, including cross-sectional similarity, multimodal coupling, and longitudinal consistency. Specifically, we jointly factorize multimodal networks and construct a rotation-based constraint to couple network variance across time. We also adopt the consensus factorization as the group consistent pattern. Using two publicly available brain imaging datasets, we demonstrate that MMLC may better predict psychometric scores than some other state-of-the-art brain network representation learning algorithms. Additionally, the discovered significant brain regions are synergistic with previous literature. Our new approach may boost statistical power and sheds new light on neuroimaging network biomarkers for future psychometric prediction research by integrating longitudinal and multimodal neuroimaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Third-party punishment (TPP) plays an important role in fairness norm enforcement. This study investigated how the economic status of proposers could modulate third parties’ behavioural and neural responses to unfairness. Participants played a TPP game as third parties deciding whether to punish proposers after observing the offers from proposers while behavioural and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded. The proposers were of either high economic status or low economic status, and the recipients were middle class. The behavioural results indicated that participants reported decreased punishment for poor-proposed unfair offers compared to rich-proposed unfair offers, and this effect was stronger for highly unfair offers. Neurally, greater P200, a component involved in empathy processing, was observed in response to highly unfair offers (i.e. 90:10 and 80:20) proposed by the poor, suggesting that when the targets of severe punishments were poor proposers, participants showed greater empathy for poor norm violators in highly unfair trials. Taken together, these findings help to elucidate that the third-parties tend to tolerate the norm-violating behaviours conducted by the poor and provided further neuroscience evidence for the influence of economic status of proposers on TPP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). EAE reflects important histopathological hallmarks, dissemination, and diversity of the disease, but has only moderate reproducibility of clinical and histopathological features. Focal lesions are less frequently observed in EAE than in MS, and can neither be constrained to specific locations nor timed to occur at a pre-specified moment. This renders difficult any experimental assessment of the pathogenesis of lesion evolution, including its inflammatory, degenerative (demyelination and axonal degeneration), and reparatory (remyelination, axonal sprouting, gliosis) component processes. We sought to develop a controlled model of inflammatory, focal brain lesions in EAE using focused ultrasound (FUS). We hypothesized that FUS induced focal blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD) will increase the likelihood of transmigration of effector cells and subsequent lesion occurrence at the sonicated location. Lesion development was monitored with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and further analyzed by histopathological means. EAE was induced in 12 6–8 weeks old female C57BL/6 mice using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide. FUS-induced BBBD was performed 6, 7, and 9 days after immunization in subgroups of four animals and in an additional control group. MRI and MRE were performed on a 7T horizontal bore small animal MRI scanner. Imaging was conducted longitudinally 2 and 3 weeks after disease induction and 1 week after sonication in control animals, respectively. The scan protocol comprised contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences as well as MRE with a vibration frequency of 1 kHz. Animals were sacrificed for histopathology after the last imaging time point. The overall clinical course of EAE was mild. A total of seven EAE animals presented with focal T2w hyperintense signal alterations in the sonicated hemisphere. These were most frequent in the group of animals sonicated 9 days after immunization. Histopathology revealed foci of activated microglia/macrophages in the sonicated right hemisphere of seven EAE animals. Larger cellular infiltrates or apparent demyelination were not seen. Control animals showed no abnormalities on MRI and did not have clusters of activated microglia/macrophages at the sites targeted with FUS. None of the animals had hemorrhages or gross tissue damage as potential side effects of FUS. EAE-animals tended to have lower values of viscoelasticity and elasticity in the sonicated compared to the contralateral parenchyma. This trend was significant when comparing the right sonicated to the left normal hemisphere and specifically the right sonicated compared to the left normal cortex in animals that underwent FUS-BBBD 9 days after immunization (right vs. left hemisphere: mean viscoelasticity 6.1 vs. 7.2 kPa; p = 0.003 and mean elasticity 4.9 vs. 5.7 kPa, p = 0.024; right vs. left cortex: mean viscoelasticity 5.8 vs. 7.5 kPa; p = 0.004 and mean elasticity 5 vs. 6.5 kPa; p = 0.008). A direct comparison of the biomechanical properties of focal T2w hyperintensities with normal appearing brain tissue did not yield significant results. Control animals showed no differences in viscoelasticity between sonicated and contralateral brain parenchyma. We here provide first evidence for a controlled lesion induction model in EAE using FUS-induced BBBD. The observed lesions in EAE are consistent with foci of activated microglia that may be interpreted as targeted initial inflammatory activity and which have been described as pre-active lesions in MS. Such foci can be identified and monitored with MRI. Moreover, the increased inflammatory activity in the sonicated brain parenchyma seems to have an effect on overall tissue matrix structure as reflected by changes of biomechanical parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This mini-review provides a detailed outline of studies that have used multimodal approaches in non-invasive brain stimulation to investigate the pathophysiology of the three common movement disorders, namely, essential tremor, Parkinson’s disease, and dystonia. Using specific search terms and filters in the PubMed&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; database, we finally shortlisted 27 studies in total that were relevant to this review. While two-thirds (Brittain et al., 2013) of these studies were performed on Parkinson’s disease patients, we could find only three studies that were conducted in patients with essential tremor. We clearly show that although multimodal non-invasive brain stimulation holds immense potential in unraveling the physiological mechanisms that are disrupted in movement disorders, the technical challenges and pitfalls of combining these methods may hinder their widespread application by movement disorder specialists. A multidisciplinary team with clinical and technical expertise may be crucial in reaping the fullest benefits from such novel multimodal approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Social dominance hierarchies are a common adaptation to group living and exist across a broad range of the animal kingdom. Social dominance is known to rely on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region that shows a protracted developmental trajectory in mice. However, it is unknown to what extent the social dominance hierarchy is plastic across postnatal development and how it is regulated. Here we identified a sensitive period for experience-dependent social dominance plasticity in adolescent male mice, which is regulated by mechanisms that affect cortical plasticity. We show that social dominance hierarchies in male mice are already formed at weaning and are highly stable into adulthood. However, one experience of forced losing significantly reduces social dominance during the adolescent period but not in adulthood, suggesting adolescence as a sensitive period for experience-dependent social dominance plasticity. Notably, robust adolescent plasticity can be prolonged into adulthood by genetic deletion of Lynx1, a molecular brake that normally limits cortical plasticity through modulation of cortical nicotinic signaling. This plasticity is associated with increased activation of established nodes of the social dominance network including dorsal medial PFC and medial dorsal thalamus evidenced by increased c-Fos. Pharmacologically mediated elevation of cortical plasticity by valproic acid rapidly destabilizes the hierarchy of adult wildtype animals. These findings provide insight into mechanisms through which increased behavioral plasticity may be achieved to improve therapeutic recovery from psychiatric disorders that are associated with social deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Classical Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are members of the Ras small GTPase superfamily and play essential roles in a variety of cellular functions. Rho GTPase signaling can be turned on and off by specific GEFs and GAPs, respectively. These features empower Rho GTPases and their upstream and downstream modulators as targets for scientific research and therapeutic intervention. Specifically, significant therapeutic potential exists for targeting Rho GTPases in neurodegenerative diseases due to their widespread cellular activity and alterations in neural tissues. This study will explore the roles of Rho GTPases in neurodegenerative diseases with focus on the applications of pharmacological modulators in recent discoveries. There have been exciting developments of small molecules, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and natural products and toxins for each classical Rho GTPase category. A brief overview of each category followed by examples in their applications will be provided. The literature on their roles in various diseases [e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Multiple sclerosis (MS)] highlights the unique and broad implications targeting Rho GTPases for potential therapeutic intervention. Clearly, there is increasing knowledge of therapeutic promise from the discovery of pharmacological modulators of Rho GTPases for managing and treating these conditions. The progress is also accompanied by the recognition of complex Rho GTPase modulation where targeting its signaling can improve some aspects of pathogenesis while exacerbating others in the same disease model. Future directions should emphasize the importance of elucidating how different Rho GTPases work in concert and how they produce such widespread yet different cellular responses during neurodegenerative disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Non-coding repeat expansions, such as CGG, GGC, CUG, CCUG, and GGGGCC, have been shown to be involved in many human diseases, particularly neurological disorders. Of the diverse pathogenic mechanisms proposed in these neurodegenerative diseases, dysregulated RNA metabolism has emerged as an important contributor. Expanded repeat RNAs that form particular structures aggregate to form RNA foci, sequestering various RNA binding proteins and consequently altering RNA splicing, transport, and other downstream biological processes. One of these repeat expansion-associated diseases, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5’UTR region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Moreover, recent studies have revealed abnormal GGC repeat expansion within the 5’UTR region of the NOTCH2NLC gene in both essential tremor (ET) and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). These CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases share genetic, pathological, and clinical features. Identification of the similarities at the molecular level could lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms as well as developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we highlight our current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases and discuss potential therapeutic interventions for these neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD)—including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS)—is related to gait impairment. However, the association between the total magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cSVD burden and gait and upper extremity function remains insufficiently investigated. This study aimed to assess the correlation between the total MRI cSVD burden score and gait impairment as well as upper extremity impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A total of 224 participants underwent MRI scans, and the presence of lacunes, WMHs, CMBs, and EPVS was evaluated and recorded as a total MRI cSVD burden score (range 0–4). Gait was assessed by 4-m walkway, Tinetti, Timed Up and Go (TUG), and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) tests. Upper extremity function was assessed by 10-repeat hand pronation-supination time, 10-repeat finger-tapping time, and 10-repeat hand opening and closing time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The mean age of the 224 participants was 60.6 ± 10.5 years, and 64.3% were men. Independent of age, sex, height, and vascular risk factors, multivariable linear regression analyses showed that a higher total MRI cSVD burden score was related to a shorter stride length, wider step width, higher cadence, and poorer performance on the Tinetti, TUG, and SPPB tests and upper extremity tests (all P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Total MRI cSVD burden was associated with gait impairment and upper extremity disturbances, suggesting that total MRI cSVD burden might contribute to motor function decline. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether there is a causal relationship between total MRI cSVD burden and motor function decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) exhibit a high risk of cognitive impairment that might be caused by neurologic deficits and vascular injuries. However, the mechanism remains unknown. In current study, 24 normal controls (NC) and 54 SIVD patients, including 26 SIVD patients with no cognitive impairment (SIVD-NCI) and 28 SIVD patients with mild cognitive impairment (SIVD-MCI) underwent the resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological assessments. We combined regional homogeneity (ReHo) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) by using the global ReHo-CBF correlations coefficient and the ReHo/CBF ratio to detect the inner link between neuronal activity and vascular responses. Correlations between the ReHo/CBF ratio and neuropsychological assessments were explored in patients with SIVD. As a result, we identified significantly decreased global ReHo-CBF coupling in the SIVD-NCI group and SIVD- MCI group with respect to the NC. The SIVD-MCI group showed more serious decoupling of the global ReHo-CBF correlation. We also found a significantly abnormal ReHo/CBF ratio predominantly located in cognitive-related brain regions, including the left insula, right middle temporal gyrus, right precuneus, left precentral gyrus, and left inferior parietal lobule but not the supramarginal and angular gyri. The SIVD-MCI group showed more severe disorders of neurovascular coupling than the other two groups. Moreover, the ReHo/CBF ratio in the left precentral gyrus of the SIVD-NCI group exhibited a positive correlation with the MMSE scores. These findings suggested that patients with SIVD show abnormal neurovascular coupling at the early stage of the disease and during disease development. It might be associated with disease severity and cognitive impairment. Neurovascular decoupling in brain may be a possible neuropathological mechanism of SIVD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Phospholamban (PLN) is a mini-membrane protein that directly controls the cardiac Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-transport response to b-adrenergic stimulation, thus modulating cardiac output during the fight-or-flight response. In the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, PLN binds to the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (SERCA), keeping this enzyme's function within a narrow physiological window. PLN phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A or increase in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration reverses the inhibitory effects through an unknown mechanism. Using oriented-sample solid-state NMR spectroscopy and replica-averaged NMR-restrained structural refinement, we reveal that phosphorylation of PLN;s cytoplasmic regulatory domain signals the disruption of several inhibitory contacts at the transmembrane binding interface of the SERCA-PLN complex that are propagated to the enzyme;s active site, augmenting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. Our findings address long-standing questions about SERCA regulation, epitomizing a signal transduction mechanism operated by posttranslationally modified bitopic membrane proteins.</content>

 The evolution of bipedalism and reduced reliance on arboreality in hominins resulted in larger lower limb joints relative to the joints of the upper limb. The pattern and timing of this transition, however, remains unresolved. Here, we find the limb joint proportions of &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Homo naledi&lt;/i&gt; to resemble those of modern humans, whereas those of &lt;i&gt;A. africanus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus sediba&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus robustus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus boisei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Homo habilis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/i&gt; are more ape-like. The homology of limb joint proportions in &lt;i&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/i&gt; and modern humans can only be explained by a series of evolutionary reversals irrespective of differing phylogenetic hypotheses. Thus, the independent evolution of modern human-like limb joint proportions in &lt;i&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/i&gt; is a more parsimonious explanation. Overall, these results support an emerging perspective in hominin paleobiology that &lt;i&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/i&gt; was the most terrestrially adapted australopith despite the importance of arboreality throughout much of early hominin evolution.</content>

 The model organism &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; mounts transcriptional defense responses against intestinal bacterial infections that elicit overlapping starvation and infection responses, the regulation of which is not well understood. Direct comparison of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; that were starved or infected with &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; revealed a large infection-specific transcriptional signature, which was almost completely abrogated by deletion of transcription factor &lt;i&gt;hlh-30/TFEB&lt;/i&gt;, except for six genes including a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) gene, &lt;i&gt;fmo-2/FMO5&lt;/i&gt;. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;fmo-2/FMO5&lt;/i&gt; severely compromised infection survival, thus identifying the first FMO with innate immunity functions in animals. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;fmo-2/FMO5&lt;/i&gt; induction required the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-49/PPAR-α, which controlled host defense cell non-autonomously. These findings reveal an infection-specific host response to &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;, identify HLH-30/TFEB as its main regulator, reveal FMOs as important innate immunity effectors in animals, and identify the mechanism of FMO regulation through NHR-49/PPAR-α during &lt;i&gt;S. aureus &lt;/i&gt;infection, with implications for host defense and inflammation in higher organisms.</content>

 In everyday life, we group and subdivide time to understand the sensory environment surrounding us. Our perceptual system establishes hierarchical structures by nesting different groups of time intervals. Organizing time in units such as diurnal rhythms, phrases, and beat patterns, is fundamental to everyday behavior, speech, and music. When listening to music, we extract rhythmic regularities to create a hierarchical metrical structure that enables us to predict the timing of the next events. Foot tapping and head bobbing to musical rhythms are observable evidence of this process. In the special case of polyrhythms, at least two metrical structures compete to become the reference for these temporal regularities, rendering several possible beats with which we can synchronize our movements. While there is general agreement that tempo, pitch, and loudness influence beat perception in polyrhythms, we focused on the yet neglected influence of beat subdivisions. In three online experiments, 300 participants listened to a range of polyrhythms and tapped their index fingers in time with the perceived beat. The polyrhythms consisted of two simultaneously presented isochronous pulse trains with different ratios (2:3, 2:5, 3:4, 3:5, 4:5, 5:6) and different tempi. For ratios 2:3 and 3:4, we additionally manipulated the pitch of the pulse trains. Results showed a highly robust influence of subdivision grouping on beat perception manifested as a propensity towards beats that are subdivided into two or four equally spaced units, as opposed to beats with three or more complex groupings of subdivisions. Additionally, lower pitched pulse trains were more likely to be perceived as the beat. Our findings suggest that subdivisions, not beats, are the basic unit of beat perception, and that the principle underlying the binary grouping of subdivisions reflects a propensity towards simplicity. This preference for simple grouping is widely applicable to human perception and cognition of time.</content>

 In mammals, sleep consists in the recurrence of two main stages the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and the slow wave sleep (SWS). The full expression of sleep rhythms requires an intact thalamocortical loop, and its modulation by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine. A high tone of acetylcholine is observed during REM sleep while a low tone of acetylcholine modulates the cortical slow waves during SWS. Brainstem Cholinergic neurons activity correlates with cortical sleep stages but these neurons do not project directly to the cortex. Instead, they could contribute to cortically-recorded sleep stage modulation via a thalamic relay, in particular via the midline thalamic nuclei. Focusing on the brainstem LDTg cholinergic neurons, I investigated how midline thalamic single unit activity and cortical sleep-like stages are modulated during optogenetic-induced activation or silencing of LDTg cholinergic neurons in urethane anesthetized mice. Thalamic neurons were more active during REM-like than SWS-like stages. Bursting activity predominated during SWS-like while tonic firing was prominent during REM-like stage. Optogenetic silencing of the brainstem LDTg cholinergic neurons abolished REM-like stages and reduced tonic spiking of thalamic neurons. Moreover, during SWS-like, silent Down states were prolonged and thalamic tonic spiking during Up states was reduced. Stimulation of the brainstem LDTg cholinergic neurons had a mild effect on thalamic activity even though tonic discharge was increased. Surprisingly, optogenetic stimulation abolished as well REM-like stages maybe through compensatory mechanisms.</content>

 The detection and processing of noxious sensory input depends on the proper growth and function of nociceptor sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system. In Drosophila melanogaster, the class IV (cIV) multidendritic dendritic arborization (md-da) neurons detect noxious stimuli through their highly branched dendrites that innervate the epidermis of the larval body wall. Here, we describe requirements of a previously uncharacterized gene named smoke alarm (smal), a discoidin domain receptor, in cIV md-da dendrite morphogenesis and nociception behavior. We find that smal mutant larvae exhibit thermal hyperalgesia that is fully rescued with a BAC transgene containing smal. Consistent with this phenotype, a smal reporter gene was expressed in nociceptors and other peripheral sensory neurons. Smal::GFP protein localized to punctate structures throughout the cIV md-da neurons. We further show that smal loss-of-function results in reduced nociceptor dendrite branching. Interestingly, mammalian homologues of smal act as collagen receptors, and we find that smal mutant dendrites showed an increase in epidermal cell ensheathment relative to animals that are wild type for smal. Based on this phenotype we propose that Smal protein function is required for attachment of dendrites to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the loss of activity results in thermal hyperalgesia.</content>

 To understand the mechanisms of speech perception in everyday listening environments, it is important to elucidate the relative contributions of different acoustics cues in transmitting phonetic content. Previous studies suggest that the energy envelopes of speech convey most speech content, while the temporal fine structure (TFS) can aid in segregating target speech from background noise. Despite the vast literature on TFS and speech intelligibility, the role of TFS in conveying additional speech content over what envelopes convey in complex acoustic scenes is poorly understood. The present study addresses this question using online psychophysical experiments to measure consonant identification in multi-talker babble for intelligibility-matched intact and 64-channel envelope-vocoded stimuli. Consonant confusion patterns revealed that listeners had a greater tendency in the vocoded (versus intact) condition to be biased towards reporting that they heard an unvoiced consonant, despite envelope and place cues being largely preserved. This result was replicated when babble instances were varied across independent experiments, suggesting that TFS conveys important voicing cues over what envelopes convey in multi-talker babble, a masker that is ubiquitous in everyday environments. This finding has implications for assistive listening devices that do not currently provide TFS cues, such as cochlear implants.</content>

 Functional connectivity within and between Intrinsic Connectivity Networks (ICNs) transforms over development and supports high order cognitive functions. But how variable is this process, and does it diverge with altered cognitive developmental trajectories? We investigated age-related changes in integration and segregation within and between ICNs in neurodevelopmentally at-risk children, identified by practitioners as experiencing cognitive difficulties in attention, learning, language, or memory. In our analysis we used performance on a battery of 10 cognitive tasks, alongside resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in 175 at-risk children and 62 comparison children aged 5-16. We observed significant age-by-group interactions in functional connectivity between two network pairs. Integration between the ventral attention and visual networks and segregation of the limbic and fronto-parietal networks increased with age in our comparison sample, relative to at-risk children. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the ventral attention and visual networks in comparison children significantly mediated age-related improvements in executive function, compared to at-risk children. We conclude that integration between ICNs show divergent neurodevelopmental trends in the broad population of children experiencing cognitive difficulties, and that these differences in functional brain organisation may partly explain the pervasive cognitive difficulties within this group over childhood and adolescence.</content>

 The dynamic repertoire of functional brain networks is constrained by the underlying topology of structural connections: the lack of a direct structural link between two brain regions prevents direct functional interactions. Despite the intrinsic relationship between structural (SC) and functional connectivity (FC), integrative and multimodal approaches to combine the two remain limited, especially for electrophysiological data. In the present work, we propose a new linear adaptive filter for estimating dynamic and directed FC using structural connectivity information as priors. We tested the filter in rat epicranial recordings and human event-related EEG data, using SC priors from a meta-analysis of tracer studies and diffusion tensor imaging metrics, respectively. Our results show that SC priors increase the resilience of FC estimates to noise perturbation while promoting sparser networks under biologically plausible constraints. The proposed filter provides intrinsic protection against SC-related false negatives, as well as robustness against false positives, representing a valuable new method for multimodal imaging and dynamic FC analysis.</content>

 The olfactory system of anuran tadpoles requires substantial restructuring to adapt to the lifestyle of the adult frogs. Xenopus laevis tadpoles have a single main olfactory epithelium in the principal nasal cavity associated with aquatic olfaction. After metamorphosis, this epithelial surface is transformed into the adult air-nose and a new epithelium, the adult water-nose, is present in the middle cavity. Impacts of this massive remodeling on odor processing, behavior and network structure are still unexplored. In the present study, we used neuronal tracings, calcium imaging and a behavioral assay to examine the functional connectivity between the epithelium and the main olfactory bulb during metamorphosis. In tadpoles, olfactory receptor neurons in the principal cavity epithelium project axons to glomeruli in the ventral main olfactory bulb. During metamorphosis, these projections are gradually replaced by receptor neuron axons emerging from the newly forming middle cavity epithelium. Despite this metamorphotic reorganization in the ventral bulb, two spatially and functionally segregated odor processing streams remain undisrupted. In line with this, metamorphotic rewiring does not alter behavioral responses to waterborne odorants. Contemporaneously, newly formed receptor neurons in the remodeling principal cavity epithelium project their axons to the dorsal part of the bulb. The emerging neuronal networks of the dorsal and ventral main olfactory bulb show substantial differences. Glomeruli around the midline of the dorsal bulb are innervated from the left and right nasal epithelia. In addition, postsynaptic projection neurons in the dorsal bulb predominantly have smaller tufts and connect to multiple glomeruli, while more than half of projection neurons in the ventral bulb have a single, bigger tuft. Our results show that during the metamorphotic reconstruction of the olfactory network the water system remains functional. Differences of the neuronal network of the dorsal and ventral olfactory bulb imply that a higher degree of odor integration takes place in the dorsal main olfactory bulb. This is likely connected with the processing of different odorants, airborne vs. waterborne, in these two parts of the olfactory bulb.</content>

 It is well established that sleep deprivation after learning impairs hippocampal memory processes and causes amnesia. It is unknown, however, whether it leads to the actual loss of information or merely suppresses the retrievability of this information stored under suboptimal conditions. Here, we reveal that hippocampal memories formed under sleep deprivation conditions can be successfully retrieved multiple days following training using optogenetic memory engram activation or treatment with the clinically-approved phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor roflumilast. Moreover, when optogenetic memory engram activation and roflumilast treatment were combined two days following training and subsequent sleep deprivation, it resulted in a more persistent memory trace that allowed for natural (i.e., manipulation free) retrieval several days later. Our studies in mice demonstrate that sleep deprivation does not necessarily cause memory loss, but instead leads to the suboptimal storage of information that is difficult to retrieve. We also provide proof of principle that these suboptimally stored memories can be made accessible again far beyond the learning episode and that the clinically-approved PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast may be used to successfully retrieve information thought to be lost.</content>

NMDA receptors promote repolarization in pancreatic beta cells and thereby reduce glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore, NMDA receptors are a potential therapeutic target for diabetes. While the mechanism of NMDA receptor inhibition in beta cells is rather well understood at the molecular level, its possible effects on the collective cellular activity have not been addressed to date, even though proper insulin secretion patterns result from well-synchronized beta cell behavior. The latter is enabled by strong intercellular connectivity, which governs propagating calcium waves across the islets and makes the heterogeneous beta cell population work in synchrony. Since a disrupted collective activity is an important and possibly early contributor to impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance, it is of utmost importance to understand possible effects of NMDA receptor inhibition on beta cell functional connectivity. To address this issue, we combined confocal functional multicellular calcium imaging in mouse tissue slices with network science approaches. Our results revealed that NMDA receptor inhibition increases, synchronizes, and stabilizes beta cell activity without affecting the velocity or size of calcium waves. To explore intercellular interactions more precisely, we made use of the multilayer network formalism by regarding each calcium wave as an individual network layer, with weighted directed connections portraying the intercellular propagation. NMDA receptor inhibition stabilized both the role of wave initiators and the course of waves. The findings obtained with the experimental antagonist of NMDA receptors, MK-801, were additionally validated with dextrorphan, the active metabolite of the approved drug dextromethorphan, as well as with experiments on NMDA receptor KO mice. In sum, our results provide additional and new evidence for a possible role of NMDA receptor inhibition in treatment of type 2 diabetes and introduce the multilayer network paradigm as a general strategy to examine effects of drugs on connectivity in multicellular systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JLqY-naQ8ug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Exaggerated sexually selected traits, often carried by males, are characterized by the evolution of hyperallometry, resulting in their disproportionate growth relative to the rest of the body among individuals of the same population. While the evolution of allometry has attracted much attention for centuries, our understanding of the developmental genetic mechanisms underlying its emergence remains fragmented. Here we conduct comparative transcriptomics of the legs followed by an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that play a role in the hyperallometric growth of the third legs in the males of the water strider &lt;i&gt;Microvelia longipes&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that a broadly expressed growth factor, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 11 (BMP11, also known as Growth Differentiation Factor 11), regulates leg allometries through increasing the allometric slope and mean body size in males. In contrast, &lt;i&gt;BMP11&lt;/i&gt; RNAi reduced mean body size but did not affect slope either in the females of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipes&lt;/i&gt; or in the males and females of other closely related &lt;i&gt;Microvelia&lt;/i&gt; species. Furthermore, our data show that a tissue-specific factor, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), increases intercept without affecting mean body size. This indicates a genetic correlation between mean body size and variation in allometric slope, but not intercept. Strikingly, males treated with &lt;i&gt;BMP11&lt;/i&gt; RNAi exhibited a severe reduction in fighting frequency compared to both controls and &lt;i&gt;Ubx&lt;/i&gt; RNAi-treated males. Therefore, male body size, the exaggerated weapon, and the intense fighting behavior associated with it are genetically correlated in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipes&lt;/i&gt;. Our results support a possible role of pleiotropy in the evolution of allometric slope.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RsDDLm4AxGA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 We highlighted the spatial distribution of the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin, and tachykinin in the brain of Cataglyphis nodus desert ants. We further show behavioral‐stage‐related changes in allatostatin‐A and corazonin expression patterns. The results suggest that these neuropeptides are highly promising candidate modulators for major behavioral transitions of the ants.







Abstract
Age‐related behavioral plasticity is a major prerequisite for the ecological success of insect societies. Although ecological aspects of behavioral flexibility have been targeted in many studies, the underlying intrinsic mechanisms controlling the diverse changes in behavior along the individual life history of social insects are not completely understood. Recently, the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin, and tachykinin have been associated with the regulation of behavioral transitions in social insects. Here, we investigated changes in brain localization and expression of these neuropeptides following major behavioral transitions in Cataglyphis nodus ants. Our immunohistochemical analyses in the brain revealed that the overall branching pattern of neurons immunoreactive (ir) for the three neuropeptides is largely independent of the behavioral stages. Numerous allatostatin‐A‐ and tachykinin‐ir neurons innervate primary sensory neuropils and high‐order integration centers of the brain. In contrast, the number of corazonergic neurons is restricted to only four neurons per brain hemisphere with cell bodies located in the pars lateralis and axons extending to the medial protocerebrum and the retrocerebral complex. Most interestingly, the cell‐body volumes of these neurons are significantly increased in foragers compared to freshly eclosed ants and interior workers. Quantification of mRNA expression levels revealed a stage‐related change in the expression of allatostatin‐A and corazonin mRNA in the brain. Given the presence of the neuropeptides in major control centers of the brain and the neurohemal organs, these mRNA‐changes strongly suggest an important modulatory role of both neuropeptides in the behavioral maturation of Cataglyphis ants.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Unlike robots, humans learn, adapt and perceive their bodies by interacting
with the world. Discovering how the brain represents the body and generates
actions is of major importance for robotics and artificial intelligence. Here
we discuss how neuroscience findings open up opportunities to improve current
estimation and control algorithms in robotics. In particular, how active
inference, a mathematical formulation of how the brain resists a natural
tendency to disorder, provides a unified recipe to potentially solve some of
the major challenges in robotics, such as adaptation, robustness, flexibility,
generalization and safe interaction. This paper summarizes some experiments and
lessons learned from developing such a computational model on real embodied
platforms, i.e., humanoid and industrial robots. Finally, we showcase the
limitations and challenges that we are still facing to give robots human-like
perception

 &lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) specialize in feature extraction rather
than function mapping. In doing so they form complex internal hierarchical
feature representations, the complexity of which gradually increases with a
corresponding increment in neural network depth. In this paper, we examine the
feature extraction capabilities of CNNs using Maximum Entropy (ME) and
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to validate the idea that, CNN models should be
tailored for a given task and complexity of the input data. SNR and ME measures
are used as they can accurately determine in the input dataset, the relative
amount of signal information to the random noise and the maximum amount of
information respectively. We use two well known benchmarking datasets, MNIST
and CIFAR-10 to examine the information extraction and abstraction capabilities
of CNNs. Through our experiments, we examine convolutional feature extraction
and abstraction capabilities in CNNs and show that the classification accuracy
or performance of CNNs is greatly dependent on the amount, complexity and
quality of the signal information present in the input data. Furthermore, we
show the effect of information overflow and underflow on CNN classification
accuracies. Our hypothesis is that the feature extraction and abstraction
capabilities of convolutional layers are limited and therefore, CNN models
should be tailored to the input data by using appropriately sized CNNs based on
the SNR and ME measures of the input dataset.

 &lt;p&gt;Privacy protection has recently attracted the attention of both academics and
industries. Society protects individual data privacy through complex legal
frameworks. This has become a topic of interest with the increasing
applications of data science and artificial intelligence that have created a
higher demand to the ubiquitous application of the data. The privacy protection
of the broad Data-InformationKnowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) landscape, the next
generation of information organization, has not been in the limelight. Next, we
will explore DIKW architecture through the applications of popular swarm
intelligence and differential privacy. As differential privacy proved to be an
effective data privacy approach, we will look at it from a DIKW domain
perspective. Swarm Intelligence could effectively optimize and reduce the
number of items in DIKW used in differential privacy, this way accelerating
both the effectiveness and the efficiency of differential privacy for crossing
multiple modals of conceptual DIKW. The proposed approach is proved through the
application of personalized data that is based on the open-sourse IRIS dataset.
This experiment demonstrates the efficiency of Swarm Intelligence in reducing
computing complexity.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Skrzypulec (2021) raises the question whether motor activation by masked
color primes is based on the same type of color representation as conscious
vision. He postulates that the literature on color processing without awareness
makes an implicit assumption that &quot;conscious&quot; and &quot;unconscious&quot; color
representations have the same properties, in which case priming by masked color
stimuli would indeed indicate that the same complex representation of surface
color can be conscious as well as unconscious. I review some evidence from
response priming by lightness stimuli in the context of a visual illusion that
alters the perceived lightness of the primes (Schmidt et al., 2010). Those
results clearly show that response priming is not driven by color-constant
information but instead by local image contrast, making it unlikely that rapid
response activation by color primes is based on a color-constant representation
of surface color.

 &lt;p&gt;Yang (2020a) recently showed that the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) at
initialization has an infinite-width limit for a large class of architectures
including modern staples such as ResNet and Transformers. However, their
analysis does not apply to training. Here, we show the same neural networks (in
the so-called NTK parametrization) during training follow a kernel gradient
descent dynamics in function space, where the kernel is the infinite-width NTK.
This completes the proof of the *architectural universality* of NTK behavior.
To achieve this result, we apply the Tensor Programs technique: Write the
entire SGD dynamics inside a Tensor Program and analyze it via the Master
Theorem. To facilitate this proof, we develop a graphical notation for Tensor
Programs.

 &lt;p&gt;Over the past decades, more and more methods gain a giant development due to
the development of technology. Evolutionary Algorithms are widely used as a
heuristic method. However, the budget of computation increases exponentially
when the dimensions increase. In this paper, we will use the dimensionality
reduction method Principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension
during the iteration of Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
(CMA-ES), which is a good Evolutionary Algorithm that is presented as the
numeric type and useful for different kinds of problems. We assess the
performance of our new methods in terms of convergence rate on multi-modal
problems from the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) problem set and we
also use the framework COmparing Continuous Optimizers (COCO) to see how the
new method going and compare it to the other algorithms.

 &lt;p&gt;Crossover and mutation are the two main operators that lead to new solutions
in evolutionary approaches. In this article, a new method of performing the
crossover phase is presented. The problem of choice is evolutionary decision
tree construction. The method aims at finding such individuals that together
complement each other. Hence we say that they are diversely specialized. We
propose the way of calculating the so-called complementary fitness. In several
empirical experiments, we evaluate the efficacy of the method proposed in four
variants and compare it to a fitness-rank-based approach. One variant emerges
clearly as the best approach, whereas the remaining ones are below the
baseline.

 &lt;p&gt;Although widely used in machine learning, backpropagation cannot directly be
applied to SNN training and is not feasible on a neuromorphic processor that
emulates biological neuron and synapses. This work presents a spike-based
backpropagation algorithm with biological plausible local update rules and
adapts it to fit the constraint in a neuromorphic hardware. The algorithm is
implemented on Intel Loihi chip enabling low power in-hardware supervised
online learning of multilayered SNNs for mobile applications. We test this
implementation on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and MSTAR datasets with
promising performance and energy-efficiency, and demonstrate a possibility of
incremental online learning with the implementation.

 &lt;p&gt;Intensive computational and theoretical work has led to the development of
mutliple mathematical models for bursting in respiratory neurons in the
pre-B\&quot;otzinger Complex (pre-B\&quot;otC) of the mammalian brainstem. Nonetheless,
these previous models have not captured the pre-inspiratory ramping aspects of
these neurons' activity patterns, in which relatively slow tonic spiking
gradually progresses to faster spiking and a full blown burst, with a
corresponding gradual development of an underlying plateau potential. In this
work, we show that the incorporation of the dynamics of the extracellular
potassium ion concentration into an existing model for pre-B\&quot;otC neuron
bursting, along with some parameter updates, suffices to induce this ramping
behavior. Using fast-slow decomposition, we show that this activity can be
considered as a form of parabolic bursting, but with burst termination at a
homoclinic bifurcation rather than as a SNIC bifurcation. We also investigate
the parameter-dependence of these solutions and show that the proposed model
yields a greater dynamic range of burst frequencies, durations, and duty cycles
than those produced by other models in the literature.

 &lt;p&gt;An important problem in analysis of neural data is to characterize
interactions across brain regions from high-dimensional multiple-electrode
recordings during a behavioral experiment. Lead-lag effects indicate possible
directional flows of neural information, but they are often transient,
appearing during short intervals of time. Such non-stationary interactions can
be difficult to identify, but they can be found by taking advantage of the
replication structure inherent to many neurophysiological experiments. To
describe non-stationary interactions between replicated pairs of
high-dimensional time series, we developed a method of estimating latent,
non-stationary cross-correlation. Our approach begins with an extension of
probabilistic CCA to the time series setting, which provides a model-based
interpretation of multiset CCA. Because the covariance matrix describing
non-stationary dependence is high-dimensional, we assume sparsity of
cross-correlations within a range of possible interesting lead-lag effects. We
show that the method can perform well in realistic settings and we apply it to
192 simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings from prefrontal cortex
(PFC) and visual cortex (area V4) during a visual memory task. We find lead-lag
relationships that are highly plausible, being consistent with related results
in the literature.

 &lt;p&gt;Wide neural networks with random weights and biases are Gaussian processes,
as originally observed by Neal (1995) and more recently by Lee et al. (2018)
and Matthews et al. (2018) for deep fully-connected networks, as well as by
Novak et al. (2019) and Garriga-Alonso et al. (2019) for deep convolutional
networks. We show that this Neural Network-Gaussian Process correspondence
surprisingly extends to all modern feedforward or recurrent neural networks
composed of multilayer perceptron, RNNs (e.g. LSTMs, GRUs), (nD or graph)
convolution, pooling, skip connection, attention, batch normalization, and/or
layer normalization. More generally, we introduce a language for expressing
neural network computations, and our result encompasses all such expressible
neural networks. This work serves as a tutorial on the *tensor programs*
technique formulated in Yang (2019) and elucidates the Gaussian Process results
obtained there. We provide open-source implementations of the Gaussian Process
kernels of simple RNN, GRU, transformer, and batchnorm+ReLU network at
github.com/thegregyang/GP4A.

 &lt;p&gt;Unsupervised neural nets such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines(RBMs) and Deep
Belif Networks(DBNs), are powerful in automatic feature extraction,unsupervised
weight initialization and density estimation. In this paper,we demonstrate that
the parameters of these neural nets can be dramatically reduced without
affecting their performance. We describe a method to reduce the parameters
required by RBM which is the basic building block for deep architectures.
Further we propose an unsupervised sparse deep architectures selection
algorithm to form sparse deep neural networks.Experimental results show that
there is virtually no loss in either generative or discriminative performance.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Exergame trainings might have therapeutic value in ataxic patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exergame training with an exercise program on postural control by comparing it with traditional balance and coordination exercise program. Nineteen patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In the first group, exergame training and an exercise program (EEP) were applied together for the first 8 weeks; after 10 weeks washout, a conventional exercise program (CEP) was applied for the second 8 weeks. In the second group, the CEP was applied first followed by the EEP. Outcome measures were Limits of Stability test (LoS), International Classification Ataxia Ratio Scale (ICARS), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Timed-Up and Go test with a cognitive task (TUG-C), Reactive postural control and sensory orientation subscales of the Mini-BESTest. Seventeen patients (mean age ± SD, 32.53 ± 11.07 years) completed the study. ICARS, BBS scores improved only after EEP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). While there was no change in the RT and MVL parameters of the LoS test after EEP, the MXE, EPE, and DCL parameters improved significantly (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The MXE and MVL parameters of LoS improved after CEP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). There were no significant improvements in the Mini-BESTest’s reactive postural control and sensory orientation subscale scores after both EEP and CEP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). The results of the present study demonstrated that exergame training can be used as a complementary training option in physiotherapy to improve postural control in patients with ataxia.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Amyloid β (Aβ) impairs synaptic function by inhibiting long-term potentiation (LTP), and by facilitating long-term depression (LTD). There is now evidence from AD models that Aβ provokes this shift toward synaptic depression by triggering the access to and accumulation of PTEN in the postsynaptic terminal of hippocampal neurons. Here we quantified the PTEN in 196,138 individual excitatory dentate gyrus synapses from AD patients at different stages of the disease and from controls with no neuropathological findings. We detected a gradual increase of synaptic PTEN in AD brains as the disease progresses, in conjunction with a significant decrease in synaptic density. The synapses that remain in symptomatic AD patients are more likely to be smaller and exhibit fewer AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Hence, a high Aβ load appears to strongly compromise human hippocampal synapses, as reflected by an increase in PTEN, inducing a loss of AMPARs that may eventually provoke synaptic failure and loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Semaphorins, originally discovered as guidance cues for developing axons, are involved in many processes that shape the nervous system during development, from neuronal proliferation and migration to neuritogenesis and synapse formation. Interestingly, the expression of many Semaphorins persists after development. For instance, Semaphorin 3A is a component of perineuronal nets, the extracellular matrix structures enwrapping certain types of neurons in the adult CNS, which contribute to the closure of the critical period for plasticity. Semaphorin 3G and 4C play a crucial role in the control of adult hippocampal connectivity and memory processes, and Semaphorin 5A and 7A regulate adult neurogenesis. This evidence points to a role of Semaphorins in the regulation of adult neuronal plasticity. In this review, we address the distribution of Semaphorins in the adult nervous system and we discuss their function in physiological and pathological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In animals, circadian clocks impose a daily rhythmicity to many behaviors and physiological processes. At the molecular level, circadian rhythms are driven by intracellular transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFL). Interestingly, emerging evidence indicates that they can also be modulated by multiple signaling pathways. Among these, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling plays a key role in regulating the molecular rhythms of clock genes and of the resulting circadian behavior. In addition, the application of in vivo imaging approaches has revealed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is fundamental to the synchronization of the neuronal networks that make up circadian pacemakers. Conversely, the activity of circadian clocks may influence Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. For instance, several genes that encode Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding proteins display a rhythmic expression, and a disruption of this cycling affects circadian function, underscoring their reciprocal relationship. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling both modulates and is modulated by circadian clocks, focusing on the regulatory mechanisms described in Drosophila and mice. In particular, we examine findings related to the oscillations in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels in circadian pacemakers and how they are regulated by canonical clock genes, neuropeptides, and light stimuli. In addition, we discuss how Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rhythms and their associated signaling pathways modulate clock gene expression at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. We also review evidence based on transcriptomic analyzes that suggests that mammalian Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and transporters (e.g., ryanodine receptor, ip3r, serca, L- and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels) as well as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding proteins (e.g., camk, cask, and calcineurin) show rhythmic expression in the central brain clock and in peripheral tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscles. Finally, we discuss how the discovery that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling is regulated by the circadian clock could influence the efficacy of pharmacotherapy and the outcomes of clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia play an important role in neurodegenerative disease [i.e., Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. These diseases share some similar pathological changes and several microglia-associated processes, including immune response, neuroinflammation, phagocytosis, elimination of synapses et al. Microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) has been described as having both destructive and protective effects in neurological disorders. Besides, considerable evidence also indicates that microglia play a significant role in neurogenesis, neuronal cell death, and synaptic interactions. The communication between microglia and neurons is of vital role in regulating complex functions which are key to appropriate the activity of the brain. Accumulating studies have also demonstrated that exosomes with sizes ranging from 40–100 nm, released by microglia, could serve as key mediators in intercellular signaling. These exosomes, identified in terms of cellular origin in many kinds of biological fluids, exert their effects by delivering specific cargos such as proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs. It was shown that microglial exosomes could transport to and be uptake by neurons, which may either be beneficial or instead, detrimental to CNS diseases. The focus of this review is to summarize the involvement of microglial exosomes in critical pathologies associated with neurodegenerative disease and how they contribute to these disorders, including PD, AD, and ALS. We also review the application of microglia exosomes as potential biomarkers in monitoring disease progression, as well as focusing on their roles as drug delivery vehicles in treating neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Identifying patients with intractable epilepsy who would benefit from therapeutic chronic vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) preoperatively remains a major clinical challenge. We have developed a statistical model for predicting VNS efficacy using only routine preimplantation electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded with the TruScan EEG device (Brazdil et al., 2019). It remains to be seen, however, if this model can be applied in different clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To validate our model using EEG data acquired with a different recording system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We identified a validation cohort of eight patients implanted with VNS, whose preimplantation EEG was recorded on the BrainScope device and who underwent the EEG recording according to the protocol. The classifier developed in our earlier work, named Pre-X-Stim, was then employed to classify these patients as predicted responders or non-responders based on the dynamics in EEG power spectra. Predicted and real-world outcomes were compared to establish the applicability of this classifier. In total, two validation experiments were performed using two different validation approaches (single classifier or classifier voting).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The classifier achieved 75% accuracy, 67% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. Only two patients, both real-life responders, were classified incorrectly in both validation experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We have validated the Pre-X-Stim model on EEGs from a different recording system, which indicates its application under different technical conditions. Our approach, based on preoperative EEG, is easily applied and financially undemanding and presents great potential for real-world clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;After acquiring knowledge of the neuroscience of learning, memory, stress and emotions, teachers incorporate more cognitive engagement and student-centered practices into their lessons. However, the role understanding neuroscience plays in teachers own affective and motivational competencies has not yet been investigated. The goal of this study was to investigate how learning neuroscience effected teachers’ self-efficacy, beliefs in their ability to teach effectively, self-responsibility and other components of teacher motivation. A pilot training-of-trainers program was designed and delivered in Liberia combining basic neuroscience with information on social, emotional, behavioral and mental health issues faced by students. Tier I of the professional development was a 2 weeks workshop led by a visiting neuroscientist. A subset of the 24 Tier I secondary science teachers formed a Leadership Team who adapted the content to the Liberian context and subsequently led additional workshops and follow-up sessions for the Tier II secondary science teachers. Science teachers in both tiers completed the affective-motivational scales from the internationally vetted, multiscale Innovative Teaching for Effective Learning Teacher Knowledge Survey from the OECD. Tier II teachers completed the survey in a pre-post-delayed post design. Tier I teachers completed the survey after the workshop with their attitudes at that time and separately with retrospective projections of their pre-workshop attitudes. Ten of the 92 Tier II teachers participated in structured interviews at follow-up. Statistical analysis of survey data demonstrated improved teacher self-efficacy, self-responsibility for student outcomes, and motivation to teach. Qualitatively, teachers expressed more confidence in their ability to motivate students, engage them through active learning, and manage the class through positive rather than negative reinforcement. Teachers’ own self-regulation improved as they made efforts to build supporting relationships with students. Together, these results demonstrated that (i) teacher affective-motivational attitudes can be altered with professional development, (ii) basic neuroscience, as knowledge of how students learn, can improve teacher competency, and (iii) a training-of-trainers model can be effective in a low and middle income country for disseminating neuroscience knowledge, increasing teachers’ knowledge of students’ social and emotional needs, and promoting educational improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;How deeply does action influence perception? Does action performance affect the perception of object features directly related to action only? Or does it concern also object features such as colors, which are not held to directly afford action? The present study aimed at answering these questions. We asked participants to repeatedly grasp a handled mug hidden from their view before judging whether a visually presented mug was blue rather than cyan. The motor training impacted on their perceptual judgments, by speeding participants’ responses, when the handle of the presented mug was spatially aligned with the trained hand. The priming effect did not occur when participants were trained to merely touch the mug with their hand closed in a fist. This indicates that action performance may shape the perceptual judgment on object features, even when these features are colors and do not afford any action. How we act on surrounding objects is therefore not without consequence for how we experience them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance is a distinctive pathological mechanism for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which mediates the lipidation of apolipoprotein E, plays a critical role in Aβ clearance. As an environmental factor for AD, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) can decrease ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression and disrupt Aβ clearance. Liver X receptor α (LXRα) is an autoregulatory transcription factor for ABCA1 and a target of some environmental pollutants, such as organophosphate pesticides. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether DDT could affect Aβ clearance by targeting LXRα. The DDT-pretreated H4 human neuroglioma cells and immortalized astrocytes were incubated with exogenous Aβ to evaluate Aβ consumption. Meanwhile, cytotoxicity and LXRα expression were determined in the DDT-treated cells. Subsequently, the antagonism of DDT on LXRα agonist T0901317 was determined in vitro. The interaction between DDT and LXRα was predicted by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation technology. We observed that DDT could inhibit Aβ clearance and decrease the levels of LXRα mRNA and LXRα protein. Moreover, DDT is supposed to strongly bind to LXRα and exert antagonistic effects on LXRα. In conclusion, this study firstly presented that DDT could inhibit LXRα expression, which would contribute to Aβ clearance decline in vitro. It provides an experimental basis to search for potential therapeutic targets of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the value of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)-based histogram analysis in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and to investigate the regions of the most important discriminative features and their contribution to classification discrimination. Patients with PD (n = 59) and healthy controls (HCs; n = 41) were identified and divided into a primary set (80 cases, including 48 patients with PD and 32 HCs) and a validation set (20 cases, including 11 patients with PD and nine HCs). The Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) 116 atlas was used to extract the histogram features of the regions of interest in the brain. Machine learning methods were used in the primary set for data dimensionality reduction, feature selection, model construction, and model performance evaluation. The model performance was further validated in the validation set. After feature data dimension reduction and feature selection, 23 of a total of 1,276 features were entered in the model. The brain regions of the selected features included the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and limbic lobes, as well as the cerebellum and the thalamus. In the primary set, the area under the curve (AUC) of the model was 0.974, the sensitivity was 93.8%, the specificity was 90.6%, and the accuracy was 93.8%. In the validation set, the AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.980, 90.9%, 88.9%, and 90.0%, respectively. ALFF-based histogram analysis can be used to classify patients with PD and HCs and to effectively identify abnormal brain function regions in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Increasing extracellular [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) strongly decreases intrinsic excitability in neurons but the mechanism is unclear. By one hypothesis, [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; screens surface charge, reducing voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activation and by another [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; activates Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) closing the sodium-leak channel (NALCN). Here we report that neocortical neurons from CaSR-deficient (&lt;i&gt;Casr&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) mice had more negative resting potentials and did not fire spontaneously in reduced divalent-containing solution (T&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;) compared to wild-type (WT). However, after setting membrane potential to -70 mV, T&lt;sub&gt;0.2 &lt;/sub&gt;application similarly depolarized and increased action potential firing in &lt;i&gt;Casr&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and WT neurons. Enhanced activation of VGSCs was the dominant contributor to the depolarization and increase in excitability by T&lt;sub&gt;0.2 &lt;/sub&gt;and occurred due to hyperpolarizing shifts in VGSC window currents. CaSR deletion depolarized VGSC window currents but did not affect NALCN activation. Regulation of VGSC gating by external divalents is the key mechanism mediating divalent-dependent changes in neocortical neuron excitability.</content>

 The mechanisms specifying neuronal diversity are well-characterized, yet it remains unclear how or if these mechanisms regulate neural circuit assembly. To address this, we mapped the developmental origin of 160 interneurons from seven bilateral neural progenitors (neuroblasts), and identify them in a synapse-scale TEM reconstruction of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larval CNS. We find that lineages concurrently build the sensory and motor neuropils by generating sensory and motor hemilineages in a Notch-dependent manner. Neurons in a hemilineage share common synaptic targeting within the neuropil, which is further refined based on neuronal temporal identity. Connectome analysis shows that hemilineage-temporal cohorts share common connectivity. Finally, we show that proximity alone cannot explain the observed connectivity structure, suggesting hemilineage/temporal identity confers an added layer of specificity. Thus, we demonstrate that the mechanisms specifying neuronal diversity also govern circuit formation and function, and that these principles are broadly applicable throughout the nervous system.</content>

 Myocardial infarction (MI) promotes a range of systemic effects, many of which are unknown. Here, we investigated the alterations associated with MI progression in heart and other metabolically active tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose) in a mouse model of MI (induced by ligating the left ascending coronary artery) and sham-operated mice. We performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis on tissue samples obtained 6- and 24-hours post MI or sham operation. By generating tissue-specific biological networks, we observed: (1) dysregulation in multiple biological processes (including immune system, mitochondrial dysfunction, fatty-acid beta-oxidation, and RNA and protein processing) across multiple tissues post MI; and (2) tissue-specific dysregulation in biological processes in liver and heart post MI. Finally, we validated our findings in two independent MI cohorts. Overall, our integrative analysis highlighted both common and specific biological responses to MI across a range of metabolically active tissues.</content>

 Sigma 1 receptor (S1R) is a 223-amino-acid-long transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein. S1R modulates activity of multiple effector proteins and is a well-established drug target. However, signaling functions of S1R in cells are poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that biological activity of S1R in cells can be explained by its ability to interact with cholesterol and to form cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the ER membrane. By performing experiments in reduced reconstitution systems, we demonstrate direct effects of cholesterol on S1R clustering. We identify a novel cholesterol-binding motif in the transmembrane region of human S1R. Mutations of this motif impair association of recombinant S1R with cholesterol beads, affect S1R clustering in vitro and disrupt S1R subcellular localization. We demonstrate that S1R-induced membrane microdomains have increased local membrane thickness and that increased local cholesterol concentration and/or membrane thickness in these microdomains can modulate signaling of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α in the ER. Further, S1R agonists cause disruption of S1R clusters, suggesting that biological activity of S1R agonists is linked to remodeling of ER membrane microdomains. Our results provide novel insights into S1R-mediated signaling mechanisms in cells.</content>

 Cytochromes c are ubiquitous heme proteins in mitochondria and bacteria, all possessing a CXXCH (CysXxxXxxCysHis) motif with covalently attached heme. We describe the first in vitro reconstitution of cytochrome c biogenesis using purified mitochondrial (HCCS) and bacterial (CcsBA) cytochrome c synthases. We employ apocytochrome c and peptide analogs containing CXXCH as substrates, examining recognition determinants, thioether attachment, and subsequent release and folding of cytochrome c. Peptide analogs reveal very different recognition requirements between HCCS and CcsBA. For HCCS, a minimal 16-mer peptide is required, comprised of CXXCH and adjacent alpha helix 1, yet neither thiol is critical for recognition. For bacterial CcsBA, both thiols and histidine are required, but not alpha helix 1. Heme attached peptide analogs are not released from the HCCS active site; thus, folding is important in the release mechanism. Peptide analogs behave as inhibitors of cytochrome c biogenesis, paving the way for targeted control.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Plaque rupture occurs if stress within coronary lesions exceeds the protection exerted by the fibrous cap overlying the necrotic lipid core. However, very little is known about the biomechanical stress exerting this disrupting force. Employing optical coherence tomography (OCT), we generated plaque models and performed finite-element analysis to simulate stress distributions within the vessel wall in 10 ruptured and 10 non-ruptured lesions. In ruptured lesions, maximal stress within fibrous cap (peak cap stress [PCS]: 174 ± 67 vs. 52 ± 42 kPa, p&amp;lt;0.001) and vessel wall (maximal plaque stress [MPS]: 399 ± 233 vs. 90 ± 95 kPa, p=0.001) were significantly higher compared to non-ruptured plaques. Ruptures arose in the immediate proximity of maximal stress concentrations (angular distances: 21.8 ± 30.3° for PCS vs. 20.7 ± 23.7° for MPS); stress concentrations excellently predicted plaque rupture (area under the curve: 0.940 for PCS, 0.950 for MPS). This prediction of plaque rupture was superior to established vulnerability features such as fibrous cap thickness or macrophage infiltration. In conclusion, OCT-based finite-element analysis effectively assesses plaque biomechanics, which in turn predicts plaque rupture in patients. This highlights the importance of morpho-mechanic analysis assessing the disrupting effects of plaque stress.</content>

 Distinct populations of Purkinje cells (PCs) with unique molecular and connectivity features are at the core of the modular organization of the cerebellum. Previously, we showed that firing activity of Purkinje cells differs between ZebrinII-positive (Z+) and -negative (Z−) cerebellar modules (Zhou et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019). Here, we investigate the timing and extent of PC differentiation during development in mice. We found that several features of PCs, including activity levels, dendritic arborisation, axonal shape and climbing fiber input, develop differentially between nodular and anterior PC populations. Although all PCs show a particularly rapid development in the second postnatal week, anterior PCs typically have a prolonged physiological and dendritic maturation. In line herewith, younger mice exhibit attenuated anterior-dependent eyeblink conditioning, but faster nodular-dependent compensatory eye movement adaptation. Our results indicate that specific cerebellar regions have unique developmental timelines which match with their related, specific forms of cerebellum-dependent behaviors.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Choices rely on a transformation of sensory inputs into motor responses. Using invasive single neuron recordings, the evolution of a choice process has been tracked by projecting population neural responses into state spaces. Here we develop an approach that allows us to recover similar trajectories on a millisecond timescale in non-invasive human recordings. We selectively suppress activity related to three task-axes, relevant and irrelevant sensory inputs and response direction in magnetoencephalography data acquired during context-dependent choices. Recordings from premotor cortex show a progression from processing sensory input to processing the response. In contrast to previous macaque recordings, information related to choice-irrelevant features is represented more weakly than choice-relevant sensory information. To test whether this mechanistic difference between species is caused by extensive overtraining common in non-human primate studies, we trained humans on &amp;gt;20,000 trials of the task. Choice-irrelevant features were still weaker than relevant features in premotor cortex after overtraining.</content>

 The male germ cells must adopt the correct morphology at each differentiation stage for proper spermatogenesis. The spermatogonia regulates its differentiation state by its own migration. The male germ cells differentiate and mature with the formation of syncytia, failure of forming the appropriate syncytia results in the arrest at the spermatocyte stage. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of male germ cell morphological regulation are unknown. Here, we found that EXOC1, a member of the Exocyst complex, is important for the pseudopod formation of spermatogonia and spermatocyte syncytia in mice. EXOC1 contributes to the pseudopod formation of spermatogonia by inactivating the Rho family small GTPase Rac1 and also functions in the spermatocyte syncytia with the SNARE proteins STX2 and SNAP23. Since EXOC1 is known to bind to several cell morphogenesis factors, this study is expected to be the starting point for the discovery of many morphological regulators of male germ cells.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Metastasis suppression by high-dose, multi-drug targeting is unsuccessful due to network heterogeneity and compensatory network activation. Here we show that targeting driver network signaling capacity by limited inhibition of core pathways is a more effective anti-metastatic strategy. This principle underlies the action of a physiological metastasis suppressor, Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP), that moderately decreases stress-regulated MAP kinase network activity, reducing output to transcription factors such as pro-metastastic BACH1 and motility-related target genes. We developed a low-dose four-drug mimic that blocks metastatic colonization in mouse breast cancer models and increases survival. Experiments and network flow modeling show limited inhibition of multiple pathways is required to overcome variation in MAPK network topology and suppress signaling output across heterogeneous tumor cells. Restricting inhibition of individual kinases dissipates surplus signal, preventing threshold activation of compensatory kinase networks. This low-dose multi-drug approach to decrease signaling capacity of driver networks represents a transformative, clinically-relevant strategy for anti-metastatic treatment.</content>

 One aspect of natural language comprehension is understanding how many of what or whom a speaker is referring to. While previous work has documented the neural correlates of general number comprehension and quantity comparison, we investigate semantic number from a cross-linguistic perspective with the goal of identifying cortical regions involved in distinguishing plural from singular nouns. We use three fMRI datasets in which Chinese, French, and English native speakers listen to an audiobook of a children's story in their native language. We select these three languages because they differ in their number semantics. While Chinese lacks nominal pluralization, French and English nouns are overtly marked for number. We find a number of known semantic processing regions in common, including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the pars orbitalis, in which cortical activation is greater for plural than singular nouns and posit a cross-linguistic role for number in semantic comprehension.</content>

 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as novel regulators of several biological processes, in part via the transfer of EV content such as microRNA; small non-coding RNAs that regulate protein production, between cells. However, how neuronal EVs contribute to trans-neuronal signaling is largely elusive. We examined the role of neuron-derived EVs in neuronal morphogenesis downstream signaling induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We found that EVs perpetuated BDNF induction of dendrite complexity and synapse maturation in naive hippocampal neurons, which was dependent on the activity of three microRNAs, miR-132-5p, miR-218 and miR-690. These microRNAs were up-regulated in BDNF-stimulated EVs. Moreover, supplementation with BDNF-EVs rescued the block of BDNF-induced phenotypes upon inhibition of miRNA activity. Our data therefore suggest a major role for EVs in BDNF-dependent morphogenesis, and provide new evidence for the functional transfer of microRNAs between neurons. This is not only an important step towards understanding the function of EVs in inter-neuronal signaling, but is also relevant for many disorders characterized by decreased BDNF signaling, such as major depression or cognitive impairment.</content>

 Neuronal networks derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have been exploited widely for modelling neuronal circuits, neurological diseases and drug screening. As these networks require extended culturing periods to functionally mature in vitro, most studies are based on immature networks. To obtain insights on long-term functional features of human networks, we improved a long-term glia-co-culture culturing protocol directly on multi-electrode arrays (MEA), facilitating long-term assessment of electrical features at weekly intervals. We applied optogenetic stimulation to induce neuronal activity, which resulted in accelerated neuronal responses during network development. Using holographic stimulation with single-cell-resolution, propagating evoked activities of 400 individually stimulated neurons per MEA were traceable, and precise network functional connectivity motifs were revealed. Our integrated holographic optogenetic stimulation platform on MEAs facilitates studying long-term functional dynamics of human neuronal networks in vitro. This is an important step towards establishing hiPSC-derived neurons as profound functional testbeds for basic and biomedical research.

 Normative modeling, a group of methods used to quantify an individual's deviation from some expected trajectory relative to observed variability around that trajectory, has been used to characterize subject heterogeneity. Gaussian Processes Regression includes an estimate of variable uncertainty across the input domain, which at face value makes it an attractive method to normalize the cohort heterogeneity where the deviation between predicted value and true observation is divided by the derived uncertainty directly from Gaussian Processes Regression. However, we show that the uncertainty directly from Gaussian Processes Regression is irrelevant to the cohort heterogeneity in general.</content>

 Projection neurons are the commonest neuronal type in the mammalian forebrain and their individual characterization is a crucial step to understand how neural circuitry operates. These cells have an axon whose arborizations extend over long distances, branching in complex patterns and/or in multiple brain regions. Axon length is a principal estimate of the functional impact of the neuron, as it directly correlates with the number of synapses formed by the axon in its target regions; however, its measurement by direct 3D axonal tracing is a slow and labor-intensive method. On the contrary, axon length estimations have been recently proposed as an effective and accessible alternative, allowing a fast approach to the functional significance of the single neuron. Here, we analyze the accuracy and efficiency of the most used length estimation tools - design-based stereology by virtual planes or spheres, and mathematical correction of the 2D projected-axon length - in contrast with direct measurement, to quantify individual axon length. To this end, we computationally simulated each tool, applied them over a dataset of 951 3D-reconstructed axons (from NeuroMorpho.org), and compared the generated length values with their 3D reconstruction counterparts. Additionally, the computational results were compared with estimated and direct measurements of individual axon lengths performed on actual brain tissue sections, to analyze the practical difficulties and biases arising in real cases. The evaluated reliability of each axon length estimation method is then balanced with the required human effort, experience and know-how, and economic affordability. This work, therefore, aims to provide a constructive benchmark to help guide the selection of the most efficient method for measuring specific axonal morphologies according to the particular circumstances of the conducted research.</content>

We found that dysbindin-1 (Dys1) hypofunction increases the activity of as-trocytes, which express only the isoform Dys1A that is reduced in the caudate of patients with schizophrenia. Astrocytic Dys1A disruption resulted in avolition and sensorimotor gating deficits, increased astrocytic dopamine D2 receptors and decreased dopaminergic tone within basal gan-glia. Notably, astrocytic Dys1A hypofunction disrupted dopamine dynamics linked to reward ex-pectancy and interconnected with astrocytes Ca2+ responses mainly in the globus pallidus externus (GPe). Finally, we proved these phenotypes were mediated by D2 receptors in astrocytes as their selective deletion in astrocytes either in GPe or SNc/VTA enhanced motivation and sensorimotor gating abilities as well as dopaminergic release in the GPe. Therefore, astrocytes control motivational and sensorimotor gating processes through Dys1A/D2-dependent mechanisms within the basal ganglia.</content>

 A high degree of cell and circuit-specific regulation has complicated efforts to precisely define roles for synaptic adhesion proteins in establishing circuit connectivity. Here, we take advantage of the strengths of C. elegans for cell-specific analyses to investigate molecular coordination of pre- and postsynaptic development. We show that developing dendritic spines emerge from the dendrites of wild type GABAergic motor neurons following the localization of active zone proteins and the formation of immature synaptic vesicle assemblies in presynaptic terminals. Similarly, clusters of postsynaptic receptors and F-actin are visible in GABAergic dendrites prior to spine outgrowth. Surprisingly, these developmental processes occur without a requirement for synaptic activity. Likewise, the initial stages of spine outgrowth and receptor clustering are not altered by deletion of the C. elegans ortholog of the transsynaptic adhesion protein, neurexin/NRX-1. Over time, however, dendritic spines and postsynaptic receptor clusters are destabilized in the absence of presynaptic NRX-1/neurexin and collapse prior to adulthood. The kinesin-3 family member, UNC-104, delivers NRX-1 to presynaptic terminals and ongoing UNC-104 delivery is required into adulthood for the maintenance of postsynaptic structure. Our findings provide novel insights into the temporal order of synapse formation events in vivo and demonstrate a requirement for transsynaptic adhesion in stabilizing mature circuit connectivity.

 An important goal of human brain mapping is to define a set of distinct regions that can be linked to unique functions. Numerous brain parcellations have been proposed, using cytoarchitectonic data, structural or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The intrinsic smoothness of the brain data, however, poses a problem for current methods seeking to compare different parcellations to each other. For example, criteria that simply compare within-parcel to between-parcel similarity provide even random parcellations with a high value. Furthermore, the evaluation is biased by the spatial scale of the parcellation. To address this problem, we propose the Distance Controlled Boundary Coefficient (DCBC), an unbiased criterion to evaluate discrete parcellations. We employ this new criterion to evaluate whether existing parcellations of the human neocortex can predict functional boundaries on a rich multi-domain task battery. We find that common anatomical parcellations do not perform better than chance, suggesting that task-based functional boundaries do not align well with sulcal landmarks. Parcellations based on resting-state fMRI data perform well; in some cases, as well as a parcellation defined on the evaluation data itself. Finally, multi-modal parcellations that combine functional and anatomical criteria perform substantially worse than those based on functional data alone, indicating that functionally homogeneous regions often span major anatomical landmarks. Overall, the DCBC advances the field of functional brain mapping by providing an unbiased metric that compares the predictive ability of different brain parcellations to define functionally and anatomically homogeneous brain regions.</content>

 The intercellular transmission of -synuclein is proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease (PD)1. Supporting this transmission hypothesis, -synuclein has been identified to act as a prion2 and has been found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and saliva3. However, the mechanism required to initiate the pathogenic spread of -synuclein in the body that results in PD remains unclear. Here we identify a mechanism for the loading of -synuclein into exosomes, resulting in prion-like transmission that is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase activator, Ndfip1. Risk factors associated with PD, including metal toxicity, lysosome dysfunction and pesticide exposure,4 stimulate the upregulation of Ndfip1 and increase the loading of -synuclein into exosomes. We used this pathway to promote the loading of endogenous -synuclein into exosomes, that when intranasally delivered to either wild type or M83 transgenic mice, resulted in Parkinsons-like pathology including motor impairments and brain amyloids. Recipient cells require -synuclein for pathogenesis, as delivery of exosomes containing -synuclein to Snca knockout mice did not generate brain amyloids or Parkinsons-like motor impairments. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism to initiate the prion-like spread of -synuclein in exosomes, following exposure to risk factors for PD.</content>

 Anonymous web-based experiments are increasingly and successfully used in many domains of behavioral research. However, online studies of auditory perception, especially of psychoacoustic phenomena pertaining to low-level sensory processing, are challenging because of limited available control of the acoustics, and the unknown hearing status of participants. Here, we outline our approach to mitigate these challenges and validate our procedures by comparing web-based measurements to labbased data on a range of classic psychoacoustic tasks. Individual tasks were created using jsPsych, an open-source javascript front-end library. Dynamic sequences of psychoacoustic tasks were implemented using Django, an open-source library for web applications, and combined with consent pages, questionnaires, and debriefing pages. Subjects were recruited via Prolific, a web-based human-subject marketplace. Guided by a meta-analysis of normative data, we developed and validated a screening procedure to select participants for (putative) normal-hearing status; this procedure combined thresholding of scores in a suprathreshold cocktail-party task with filtering based on survey responses. Headphone use was standardized by supplementing procedures from prior literature with a binaural hearing task. Individuals meeting all criteria were re-invited to complete a range of classic psychoacoustic tasks. Performance trends observed in re-invited participants were in excellent agreement with lab-based data for fundamental frequency discrimination, gap detection, sensitivity to interaural time delay and level difference, comodulation masking release, word identification, and consonant confusions. Our results suggest that web-based psychoacoustics is a viable complement to lab-based research. Source code for our infrastructure is also provided.</content>

 Animals constantly respond to changes in their environment and internal states via neuromodulation. Neuropeptide genes modulate neural circuits by encoding either multiple copies of the same neuropeptide or different neuropeptides. This architectural complexity makes it difficult to determine the function of discrete and active neuropeptides. Here, we present a novel genetic tool that facilitates functional analysis of individual peptides. We engineered Escherichia coli bacteria to express active peptides and fed loss-of-function Caenorhabditis elegans to rescue gene activity. Using this approach, we rescued the activity of different neuropeptide genes with varying lengths and functions: trh-1, ins-6, and pdf-1. While some peptides are functionally redundant, others exhibited unique and previously uncharacterized functions. The mechanism of peptide uptake is reminiscent of RNA interference, suggesting convergent mechanisms of gene regulation in organisms. Our rescue-by-feeding paradigm provides a high-throughput screening strategy to elucidate the functional landscape of neuropeptide genes regulating different behavioral and physiological processes.</content>

 Decades of research attempting to slow the onset of Alzheimers disease (AD) indicates that a better understanding of memory will be key to the discovery of effective therapeutic approaches. Here, we ask whether prodromal neural network dysfunction might occur in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit by using 5IA as a selective negative modulator of extrasynaptic 5GABA-A receptors in TgF344-AD transgenic rats, a model for early onset AD. The results demonstrate that orally bioavailable 5IA, an established memory enhancer, increases CA1 pyramidal cell mean firing rates and peak CA1 ripple amplitude during wakeful immobility in wild type F344 rats resting in a familiar environment. We show that TgF344-AD rats, which express human amyloid-beta precursor protein (with the Swedish mutation) and human presenilin-1 (with a {Delta} exon 9 mutation), exhibit high serum A{beta}42 and A{beta}40 levels by 3 months of age. By 9 months of age, CA1 ripples in young adult TgF344-AD rats are nonresponsive to 5IA indicating network dysfunction prior to the onset of AD pathology and memory dysfunction. These results demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence for prodromal 5GABA-A receptor dysfunction in the AD hippocampal trisynaptic circuit. Moreover, as 5GABA-A receptors are located extrasynaptically and subserve the function of tonic inhibition we posit that an early stage of memory dysfunction involves the disruption of tonic inhibition in the hippocampus.</content>

 Homozygous mutations in the gene encoding the scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme, DcpS, have been shown to underlie developmental delay and intellectual disability. Intellectual disability is associated with both abnormal neocortical development and mRNA metabolism. However, the role of DcpS and its scavenger decapping activity in neuronal development is unknown. Here, we show that human neurons derived from patients with a DcpS mutation have compromised differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Moreover, in the developing mouse neocortex, DcpS is required for the radial migration, polarity, neurite outgrowth and identity of developing glutamatergic neurons. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the scavenger mRNA decapping activity contributes to multiple pivotal roles in neural development, and further corroborate that mRNA metabolism and neocortical pathologies are associated with intellectual disability.</content>

 Recent studies have demonstrated that neuroimaging data can be used to predict brain age, as it captures information about the neuroanatomical and functional changes the brain undergoes during development and the aging process. However, researchers often have limited access to neuroimaging data because of its challenging and expensive acquisition process, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the predictive model. Decentralized models provide a way to build more accurate and generalizable prediction models, bypassing the traditional data-sharing methodology. In this work, we propose a decentralized method for brain age estimation and evaluate it on three different feature sets, including both volumetric and voxelwise structural MRI data as well as resting functional MRI data. The results demonstrate that a decentralized brain age model can achieve similar performance compared to the models trained with all the data in one location.</content>

 In MEG and EEG brain imaging research two popular approaches are often used for spatial localization of focal task- or stimuli-related brain activations. One is a so called MUSIC approach applied in the form of RAP or TRAP MUSIC algorithms. Another one is the beamformer approach, specifically multiple constrained minimum variance (MCMV) beamformer when dealing with significantly correlated activations. Either method is using its own source localizer functions. Considering simplicity, accuracy and computational efficiency both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. In this study we introduce a novel set of so called Subspace MCMV (or SMCMV) beamformers whose localizer functions combine MUSIC and MCMV localizers. We show that in ideal situations where forward modeling, data recording and noise measurements are error-free, SMCMV localizers allow precise identification of n arbitrarily correlated sources irrespective to their strength in just n scans of the brain volume using RAP MUSIC type algorithm. We also demonstrate by extensive computer simulations that with respect to source localization errors and the total number of identified sources SMCMV outperforms both the TRAP MUSIC and MIA MCMV (which is the most accurate MCMV algorithm to our knowledge) in non-ideal practical situations, specifically when the noise covariance cannot be estimated precisely, signal to noise ratios are small, source correlations are significant and larger numbers of sources are involved.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Recent evidence suggests that alteration of axon initial segment (AIS) geometry (i.e., length or position along the axon) contributes to CNS dysfunction in neurological diseases. For example, AIS length is shorter in the prefrontal cortex of type 2 diabetic mice with cognitive impairment. The key type 2 diabetes-related factor that alters AIS geometry is unknown. Here, we tested whether modifying the levels of insulin, glucose, or methylglyoxal, a reactive carbonyl species that is a metabolite of glucose, changes AIS geometry in mature cultures of dissociated postnatal mouse cortex using immunofluorescent imaging of the AIS proteins AnkyrinG and {beta}IV spectrin. Neither insulin nor glucose modification appreciably altered AIS length. Elevation of methylglyoxal produced reversible AIS shortening without cell death. Multi-electrode array recordings revealed a biphasic effect of methylglyoxal on neuronal network activity: an immediate, transient [~]300% increase in spiking and bursting rates was followed by a [~]20% reduction from baseline at 3 h. AIS length was unchanged at 0.5 h or 3 h after adding methylglyoxal, whereas development of AIS shortening at 24 h was associated with restoration of spiking to baseline levels. Immunostaining for the excitatory neuron marker Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha revealed AIS shortening in both excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations. This suggests that complex mechanisms maintain neuronal network operation after acute exposure to the disease metabolite methylglyoxal. Importantly, our results indicate that methylglyoxal could be a key mediator of AIS shortening during type 2 diabetes.

Significance StatementSmall changes in the structure of the axon initial segment affect neuronal function and may be a key mediator of neurological complications in various disease states. However, the specific disease factors that mediate structural changes at the axon initial segment are relatively unknown. This is the first study to show that increase of methylglyoxal is sufficient to reduce axon initial segment length and modulate neuronal network function. Methylglyoxal is a disease factor implicated in a wide variety of conditions including type 2 diabetes, Alzheimers disease, and aging. Thus, these findings could significantly impact the understanding of neurological complications in several disease states and are of broad pathophysiological relevance.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Mind-blanking (MB) is the inability to report mental contents, challenging the view of a constantly thought-oriented mind during wakefulness. Using fMRI experience-sampling we show that MB is reported scarcely, fast, and has low transitional dynamics, pointing to its role as a transient mental relay. MBs cerebral profile is linked to an overall positive connectivity pattern, bearing great resemblance to neural configurations observed in local sleeps, possibly reflecting neuronal silencing during wakefulness. We also find less efficient information flow between the default mode (DMN) and other networks before reporting MB. The DMN-salience network segregation was further able to classify MB from other reports in fewer steps, suggestive of an early saliency evaluation of contentless phenomenology along the neurocognitive hierarchy. Collectively, MBs unique neurofunctional profile among thought-oriented reports supports the view of instantaneous mental absences happening during wakefuless, paving the way for more mechanistic investigations of this particular phenomenology during ongoing mentation.</content>

 Retinal damage promoted by constant illumination of low intensity resulted in a diminution in classical photoreceptors cells. Glial cells exert profound effects on neurons, vasculature and other glial cells. Macroglia and microglia with specific morphological, physiological, and antigenic characteristics may play an essential role in both the maintenance and control of retinal homeostasis, or to exert mechanisms that promote cell death. The role of glial cells and immune function in the pathogenesis promoted by low light is poorly understood. We performed glial cells characterization along the time-course of retinal degeneration induced by chronic exposure to low intensity of light in Wistar rats. We exposed the animals at constant light from 2 to 8 days and assessed the retinal glia. After 6 days of light exposure, retinas presented increased levels of GFAP, a macroglia marker and microglia markers Iba1 and CD68 displayed increased mRNA levels after 6 days. The number of Iba1 positive cells increased in the outer nuclear layer, showing ameboid morphology with thicker processes characteristic of microglial activated cells. The expression levels of immune mediators TNF-{square} and IL-6 were also significantly increased after 6 days. Finally, chemokines analysis showed that CX3CR1 and CCL2 expression levels were significantly elevated after 6 days. Hence, all the events of glial activation occurred after 5-6 days of constant light exposure, when the number of cells of the outer nuclear layer has already decreased significantly. Herein we demonstrated that glial and immune activation are secondary to neurodegeneration; in this scenario, our results suggest that photoreceptor death is an early event that may be induced by phototransduction-dependent mechanisms.</content>

 It has generally been presumed that sensory information encoded by a nervous system should be as accurate as its biological limitations allow. However, perhaps counter intuitively, accurate representations of sensory signals do not necessarily maximize the organisms chances of survival. To test this hypothesis, we developed a unified normative framework for fitness-maximizing encoding by combining theoretical insights from neuroscience, computer science, and economics. Initially, we applied predictions of this model to neural responses from large monopolar cells (LMCs) in the blowfly retina. We found that neural codes that maximize reward expectation--and not accurate sensory representations--account for retinal LMC activity. We also conducted experiments in humans and find that early sensory areas flexibly adopt neural codes that promote fitness maximization in a retinotopically-specific manner, which impacted decision behavior. Thus, our results provide evidence that fitness-maximizing rules imposed by the environment are applied at the earliest stages of sensory processing.</content>

 Chronic stress and elevated glucocorticoids (GCs), the major stress hormones, are risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD) and promote AD pathomechanisms, including overproduction of toxic amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides and intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. The latter is linked to downregulation of the small GTPase Rab35, which mediates Tau degradation via the endolysosomal pathway. Whether Rab35 is also involved in A{beta} overproduction remains an open question. Here, we find that hippocampal Rab35 levels are decreased not only by stress/GC but also by aging, another AD risk factor. Moreover, Rab35 negatively regulates A{beta} production by sorting amyloid precursor protein (APP) and {beta}-secretase (BACE1) out of the endosomal network, where they interact to produce A{beta}. Interestingly, Rab35 coordinates distinct intracellular trafficking events for BACE1 and APP, mediated by its effectors OCRL and ACAP2, respectively. Finally, we show that Rab35 overexpression prevents the amyloidogenic trafficking of APP and BACE1 induced by high GC levels. These studies identify Rab35 as a key regulator of APP processing and suggest that its downregulation may contribute to stress- and AD-related amyloidogenesis.</content>

 The orientation of radial glia in the dorsal telencephalon of teleost fish follows a morphogenetic process called eversion. We studied the radial glia in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni and found that glial processes get increasingly displaced by central pallial areas during growth. New cells are added to the growing brain subventricularly consistent with a stacking growth pattern (Cell Addition I). In addition, our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating astroglial cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions (Cell Addition II).







Abstract
In the brain of teleost fish, radial glial cells are the main astroglial cell type. To understand how radial glia structures are adapting to continuous growth of the brain, we studied the astroglial cells in the telencephalon of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni in small fry to large specimens. These animals grow to a standard length of 10–12 cm in this fish species, corresponding to a more than 100‐fold increase in brain volume. Focusing on the telencephalon where glial cells are arranged radially in the everted (dorsal) pallium, immunocytochemistry for glial markers revealed an aberrant pattern of radial glial fibers in the central division of the dorsal pallium (DC, i.e., DC4 and DC5). The main glial processes curved around these nuclei, especially in the posterior part of the telencephalon. This was verified in tissue‐cleared brains stained for glial markers. We further analyzed the growth of radial glia by immunocytochemically applied stem cell (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA], Sox2) and differentiation marker (doublecortin) and found that these markers were expressed at the ventricular surface consistent with a stacking growth pattern. In addition, we detected doublecortin and Sox2 positive cells in deeper nuclei of DC areas. Our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions. This results in expansion of the central pallial areas and displacement of existing radial glial. In summary, we show that radial glial cells can adapt to morphological growth processes in the adult fish brain and contribute to this growth.</content>

 A domain for combined forelimb and hindlimb movements in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos was identified. This domain had dense intrinsic connections within PPC and reciprocal connections with frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas of the ipsilateral cortex. It also had connections with the homotopic region of the contralateral cortex.







Abstract
Previous studies in prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnetti) have demonstrated that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into several functionally distinct domains, each of which mediates a specific type of complex movements (e.g., reaching, grasping, hand‐to‐mouth) and has a different pattern of cortical connections. Here we identified a medially located domain in PPC where combined forelimb and hindlimb movements, as if climbing or running, were evoked by long‐train intracortical microstimulation. We injected anatomical tracers in this climbing/running domain of PPC to reveal its cortical connections. Our results showed the PPC climbing domain had dense intrinsic connections within rostral PPC and reciprocal connections with forelimb and hindlimb region in primary motor cortex (M1) of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Fewer connections were with dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA), and cingulate motor (CMA) areas, as well as somatosensory cortex including areas 3a, 3b, and 1–2, secondary somatosensory (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and retroinsular (Ri) areas. The rostral portion of the climbing domain had more connections with primary somatosensory cortex than the caudal portion. Cortical projections were found in functionally matched domains in M1 and premotor cortex (PMC). Similar patterns of connections with fewer labeled neurons and terminals were seen in the contralateral hemisphere. These connection patterns are consistent with the proposed role of the climbing/running domain as part of a parietal‐frontal network for combined use of the limbs in locomotion as in climbing and running. The cortical connections identify this action‐specific domain in PPC as a more somatosensory driven domain.</content>

 Calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) and the purinergic receptor P2X3 (P2X3R) label relatively distinct populations of nociceptors in the rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG). These two unique populations, known as the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic nociceptors, innervate different lamina of the rodent spinal dorsal horn. However, contrary to previous reports in rodent, we find that CGRP and P2X3R are highly co‐expressed in the human DRG and terminate in the same laminae (laminae 1–2) of the spinal dorsal horn. Additionally, we find that other markers such as TrpV1 and Nav1.7 are more widely expressed in human and innervate laminae 1–2 of the spinal dorsal horn. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that sensory neurons and their central projections are different between mice and humans.







Abstract
Peripheral sensory neurons are characterized by their size, molecular profiles, and physiological responses to specific stimuli. In mouse, the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic subsets of nociceptors are distinct and innervate different lamina of the spinal dorsal horn. The unique molecular signature and neuroanatomical organization of these neurons supports a labeled line theory for certain types of nociceptive stimuli. However, long‐standing evidence supports the polymodal nature of nociceptors in many species. We have recently shown that the peptidergic marker, CGRP, and the non‐peptidergic marker, P2X3R, show largely overlapping expression at the mRNA level in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Herein, our aim was to assess the protein distribution of nociceptor markers, including their central projections, in the human DRG and spinal cord. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors, we observed that CGRP and P2X3R were co‐expressed by approximately 33% of human DRG neurons and TrpV1 was expressed in ~60% of human DRG neurons. In the dorsal spinal cord, CGRP, P2X3R, TrpV1, and Nav1.7 proteins stained the entirety of lamina 1–2, with only P2XR3 showing a gradient of expression. This was confirmed by measuring the size of the substantia gelatinosa using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of adjacent sections. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that the central projection patterns of nociceptors are different between mice and humans. Elucidating how human nociceptors connect to subsets of dorsal horn neurons will be important for understanding the physiological consequences of these species differences.</content>

 In neonatal piglets with encephalopathy from excitotoxic brain injury, fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging correlates with swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1) and normal neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations in the striatum.







Abstract
The specific cytopathology that causes abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) after neonatal hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) is not completely understood. The panoply of cell types in the brain might contribute differentially to changes in DTI metrics. Because glia are the predominant cell type in brain, we hypothesized that changes in FA and MD would signify perturbations in glial microstructure. Using a 3‐Tesla clinical scanner, we conducted in vivo DTI MRI in nine neonatal piglets at 20–96 h after excitotoxic brain injury from striatal quinolinic acid injection or global HI. FA and MD from putamen, caudate, and internal capsule in toto were correlated with astrocyte swelling, neuronal excitotoxicity, and white matter injury. Low FA correlated with more swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1). Low FA was also related to the loss of neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations, large myelin swellings, lower myelin density, and oligodendrocyte cell death identified by 2′,3′‐cyclic nucleotide 3′‐phosphodiesterase, bridging integrator‐1, and nuclear morphology. MD correlated with degenerating oligodendrocytes and depletion of normal GFAP+ astrocytes but not with astrocyte or myelin swelling. We conclude that FA is associated with cytotoxic edema in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte processes as well as myelin injury at the cellular level. MD can detect glial cell death and loss, but it may not discern subtle pathology in swollen astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or myelin. This study provides a cytopathologic basis for interpreting DTI in the neonatal brain after HI.</content>

 Morphology of Satb2 expressing ganglion cells in macaque, human, and marmoset retinas. The study shows that Satb2 expression in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World and New World primate species.







Abstract
In primates, the retinal ganglion cells contributing to high acuity spatial vision (midget cells and parasol cells), and blue‐yellow color vision (small bistratified cells) are well understood. Many other ganglion cell types with large dendritic fields (named wide‐field ganglion cells) have been identified, but their spatial density and distribution are largely unknown. Here we took advantage of the recently established molecular diversity of ganglion cells to study wide‐field ganglion cell populations in three primate species. We used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT‐rich binding protein 2 (Satb2) to explore its expression in macaque (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina), human and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) retinas. In all three species, Satb2 cells make up a low proportion (1.5–4%) of the ganglion cell population, with a slight increase from central to peripheral retina. Intracellular dye injections revealed that in macaque and human retinas, the large majority (over 80%) of Satb2 cells are inner and outer stratifying large sparse cells. By contrast, in marmoset retina the majority (over 60%) of Satb2 expressing cells were broad thorny cells, with smaller proportions of recursive bistratified (putative direction‐selective), large bistratified, and outer stratifying narrow thorny cells. Our findings imply that Satb2 expression has undergone rapid species specific adaptations during primate evolution, because expression is not conserved across Old World (macaque, human) and New World (marmoset) suborders.</content>

 Retrograde tracers were utilized to examine projections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), a critical component of the head direction cell circuitry, and the abducens nucleus, an oculomotor structure. We found that the medial vestibular nucleus contains individual neurons that project to both the DTN and abducens nucleus. In contrast, neurons in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi project to either the DTN or abducens nucleus, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. Additionally, we describe interhemispheric connections between the left and right DTN, and projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN.







Abstract
Specialized circuitry in the brain processes spatial information to provide a sense of direction used for navigation. The dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) is a core component of this circuitry and utilizes vestibular inputs to generate neural activity encoding the animal's directional heading. Projections arising from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH) and the medial vestibular nucleus (MVe) are thought to transmit critical vestibular signals to the DTN and other brain areas, including the abducens nucleus (ABN), a component of eye movement circuitry. Here, we utilized a dual retrograde tracer approach in rats to investigate whether overlapping or distinct populations of neurons project from the NPH or MVe to the DTN and ABN. We report that individual MVe neurons project to both the DTN and ABN. In contrast, we observed individual NPH neurons that project to either the DTN or ABN, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. We also examined labeling patterns in other structures located in the brainstem and posterior cortex and observed (1) complex patterns of interhemispheric connectivity between the left and right DTN, (2) projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN, (3) projections from the lateral superior olive to the ABN, and (4) a unique population of cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Collectively, our experiments provide valuable new information that extends our understanding of the anatomical organization of the brain's spatial processing circuitry.</content>

 Astrocytes are essential cells of the CNS with several functions relating to neuronal and overall homeostasis. As a result, astrocytic dysfunction can cause widespread detrimental effects. There still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is only beginning to be explored. Accordingly, we will detail the role of astrocytes in over 40+ rare neurological conditions through the lens of function and morphology and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.







Abstract
Astrocytes are a population of central nervous system (CNS) cells with distinctive morphological and functional characteristics that differ within specific areas of the brain and are widely distributed throughout the CNS. There are mainly two types of astrocytes, protoplasmic and fibrous, which differ in morphologic appearance and location. Astrocytes are important cells of the CNS that not only provide structural support, but also modulate synaptic activity, regulate neuroinflammatory responses, maintain the blood–brain barrier, and supply energy to neurons. As a result, astrocytic disruption can lead to widespread detrimental effects and can contribute to the pathophysiology of several neurological conditions. The characteristics of astrocytes in more common neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease have significantly been described and continue to be widely studied. However, there still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is unknown and needs to be explored. Accordingly, this review will summarize functional and morphological changes of astrocytes in various rare neurological conditions based on current knowledge thus far and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.</content>

 Wei et al. characterized morpho‐physiological properties and connectivity of VIP+ interneurons in the mouse dentate gyrus. VIP+ interneurons comprise four morphologically distinct subtypes with variable physiological properties and preferentially innervate GABAergic interneurons over glutamatergic principal cells.







Abstract
The hippocampus is a key brain structure for cognitive and emotional functions. Among the hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) is the first station that receives multimodal sensory information from the cortex. Local‐circuit inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (INs) regulate the excitation–inhibition balance in the DG principal neurons (PNs) and therefore are critical for information processing. Similar to PNs, GABAergic INs also receive distinct inhibitory inputs. Among various classes of INs, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide‐expressing (VIP+) INs preferentially target other INs in several brain regions and thereby directly modulate the GABAergic system. However, the morpho‐physiological characteristics and postsynaptic targets of VIP+ INs in the DG are poorly understood. Here, we report that VIP+ INs in the mouse DG are highly heterogeneous based on their morpho‐physiological characteristics. In approximately two‐thirds of morphologically reconstructed cells, their axons ramify in the hilus. The remaining cells project their axons exclusively to the molecular layer (15%), to both the molecular layer and hilus (10%), or throughout the entire DG layers (8%). Generally, VIP+ INs display variable intrinsic properties and discharge patterns without clear correlation with their morphologies. Finally, VIP+ INs are recruited with a long latency in response to theta‐band cortical inputs and preferentially innervate GABAergic INs over glutamatergic PNs. In summary, VIP+ INs in the DG are composed of highly diverse subpopulations and control the DG output via disinhibition.</content>

Abstract
Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus, which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope in situ hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (∼2.5 months old ) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed PENK and PDYN; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed PENK. OPRD1 and OPRM1 were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. OPRK1‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. There were few baseline sex differences: US females compared to US males had more PENK‐expressing and fewer OPRD1‐expressing granule cells and more OPRM1‐expressing CA3b interneurons. Several expression differences emerged after CIS. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: (1) PENK‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; (2) OPRD1 probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and (3) OPRK1‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: (1) PDYN expression in granule cells; (2) OPRD1 probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; (3) OPRM1 in granule cells; and (4) OPRK1 interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.</content>

 The diabetic retinopathy in the diurnal rodent Psammomys obesus is manifested by a functional and structural dysfunction. The functional alteration detected by the decrease in the amplitude of the ERG components over time following the diabetic induction. Whereas the structural dysfunction is evinced by the disruption of retinal architecture and the appearance of exudates at an advanced stage of the disease progression as well as the decrease of the retinal thinness.







Abstract
To investigate the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a new diurnal animal model, we monitored clinically the DR in Psammomys obesus (P. obesus) during 7 months using electroretinography (ERG) and imaging techniques. After the onset of DR, all ERG components decreased progressively. In scotopic conditions, by 3‐months of disease progression, the diabetic P. obesus displayed a significant decrease in amplitude of b‐max, b‐wave responses, and mixed b‐waves. While mixed a‐wave decreased between 4 and 7 months. Significant differences of OP2 appeared following 1 month of disease. In photopic conditions, we noticed a decrease in the a‐wave at 2 months, while it took more than 5 months in b‐wave amplitude. The photopic negative response (PhNR) and the i‐wave amplitudes decreased following 4 and 5 months. OP1 and OP2 were the first to be altered and a significant decrease in the amplitude started after 3 months. Finally, 30 Hz‐flicker and photopic S‐cone were impaired after 2 and 3 months, respectively. The assessment of the eye fundus of the retina revealed an abnormal vascular architecture appeared at Months 6 and 7. In addition, we noticed exudates in the superior periphery of the retina at the same stage. The retina thickness showed a significant reduction at Month 7. Our results indicate that the clinical correlates of human DR are present in diabetic P. obesus. The depressed of ERGs, disruption of retinal architecture, and the appearance of exudates may reflect vascular and neuronal damage throughout the retina as are seen in the advanced stages of human DR.</content>

 Expression patterns of all CRH/UCN family genes have not been thoroughly described in any fish species. In a highly social cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, we used in situ hybridization to map mRNA expression patterns of crhb, uts1, ucn2, and ucn3. Phylogenetic analyses revealed evolutionary relationships and novel urocortin orthologs.







Abstract
The corticotropin‐releasing hormone and urocortin family of peptides consists of five members in many vertebrates: CRH (crha/crhb in teleosts), CRH2, UCN/UTS1, UCN2, and UCN3. These genes differ in expression pattern, as well as receptor affinity, allowing them to serve a wide range of functions in a variety of species. To better understand the roles of these genes in a single species, we examined their expression patterns in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. In situ hybridization to map mRNA expression patterns of crhb, uts1, ucn2, and ucn3 in the brain revealed conserved and distinct spatial features of expression. crhb‐ and uts1‐expressing cells were the most broadly distributed, with several areas of co‐regionalization. ucn3 was less abundant but was found in discrete regions throughout the extent of the brain, with high expression in the cerebellum, while ucn2 was restricted to only a few areas. RT‐PCR showed that while crhb, uts1, and ucn3 are found in several body tissues and widespread throughout the brain, ucn2 is quite restricted in the brain, and crha is only expressed in the eye. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses identified detailed relationships and novel orthologs in the urocortin family. We found evidence for a UCN2 gene loss in some reptiles. Our detailed description of the complete family of genes in the central nervous system of a model organism will inform future studies on the function of these genes in A. burtoni and provides a foundation for comparative studies with teleosts and other vertebrates.</content>

 The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best explored neuroethological model systems. The study presents a histological investigation of the nuclei of the extended song system of the carrion crow (Corvus corone), a songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience.







Abstract
The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best studied neuroethological model systems. So far, it has been treated as a relatively constrained sensorimotor system. Songbirds such as crows, however, are also known for their capability to cognitively control their audio‐vocal system. Yet, the neuroanatomy of the corvid song system has never been explored systematically. We aim to close this scientific gap by presenting a stereotactic investigation of the extended song system of the carrion crow (Corvus corone), an oscine songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience. In order to identify and delineate the song nuclei, the ascending auditory nuclei, and the descending vocal‐motor nuclei, four stains were applied. In addition to the classical Nissl‐, myelin‐, and a combination of Nissl‐and‐myelin staining, staining for tyrosine hydroxylase was used to reveal the distribution of catecholaminergic neurons (dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adrenergic) in the song system. We show that the crow brain contains the important song‐related nuclei, including auditory input and motor output structures, and map them throughout the brain. Fiber‐stained sections reveal putative connection patterns between the crow's song nuclei comparable to other songbirds.</content>

 The synaptic circuitry of primary sensory thalamic nuclei has been well characterized and shows striking similarities both in terminal morphology and chemical characteristics. The exception to this is the taste thalamus, the VPMP. A past study of synaptic circuitry in the rat taste thalamus (VPMpc) revealed marked differences from other nuclei like the LGN and MGN. Our data demonstrate that the tree shrew VPMP shares synaptic characteristics common to primary sensory thalamic nuclei including presynaptic interneuron dendrites, large VGluT2 positive terminals, and triadic arrangements in glomeruli.







Abstract
Ventroposterior medialis parvocellularis (VPMP) nucleus of the primate thalamus receives direct input from the nucleus of the solitary tract, whereas the homologous thalamic structure in the rodent does not. To reveal whether the synaptic circuitries in these nuclei lend evidence for conservation of design principles in the taste thalamus across species or across sensory thalamus in general, we characterized the ultrastructural and molecular properties of the VPMP in a close relative of primates, the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), and compared these to known properties of the taste thalamus in rodent, and the visual thalamus in mammals. Electron microscopy analysis to categorize the synaptic inputs in the VPMP revealed that the largest‐size terminals contained many vesicles and formed large synaptic zones with thick postsynaptic density on multiple, medium‐caliber dendrite segments. Some formed triads within glomerular arrangements. Smaller‐sized terminals contained dark mitochondria; most formed a single asymmetric or symmetric synapse on small‐diameter dendrites. Immuno‐EM experiments revealed that the large‐size terminals contained VGLUT2, whereas the small‐size terminal populations contained VGLUT1 or ChAT. These findings provide evidence that the morphological and molecular characteristics of synaptic circuitry in the tree shrew VPMP are similar to that in nonchemical sensory thalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the results indicate that all primary sensory nuclei of the thalamus in higher mammals share a structural template for processing thalamocortical sensory information. In contrast, substantial morphological and molecular differences in rodent versus tree shrew taste nuclei suggest a fundamental divergence in cellular processing mechanisms of taste input in these two species.</content>

 We used immunohistochemistry to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the nuclear androgen receptor (AR) in the brain of the Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina).







Abstract
Because of their roles in courtship and intrasexual competition, sexual displays are often sexually dimorphic, but we know little about the mechanisms that produce such dimorphism. Among mammals, one example is the vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina), which consists of a series of rapidly repeated, frequency‐modulated notes. The rate and duration of songs is sexually dimorphic and androgen responsive. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism, we map the sites of androgen sensitivity throughout the brain, focusing analysis along a pathway that spans from limbic structures to vocal motor regions. We find widespread expression of AR immunoreactivity (AR‐ir) throughout limbic structures important for social behavior and vocalization, including the lateral septum, extended amygdala, preoptic area and hypothalamus. We also find extensive AR staining along previously documented vocal motor pathways, including the periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus ambiguus, the last of which innervates intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Lastly, AR‐ir is also evident in sensory areas such as the medial geniculate, inferior, and superior colliculi. A quantitative analysis revealed that males exhibited more AR‐ir than females, a pattern that was most pronounced in the hypothalamus. Despite the elaboration of vocalization in singing mice, comparison with prior literature suggests that the broad pattern of AR‐ir may be conserved across a wide range of rodents. Together these data identify brain nuclei well positioned to shape the sexually dimorphic vocalization of S. teguina and suggest that such androgen modulation of vocalization is evolutionary conserved among rodents.</content>

 We describe a novel method to culture the intact spinal cord of the chicken embryo for live imaging of axon guidance at the midline. The stability of this ex vivo method allowed us to characterize key aspects of midline crossing, such as axonal growth, timing of crossing, dynamic morphological changes of the growth cones, and growth cone‐floor plate cell interactions.







Abstract
During neural circuit formation, axons navigate several choice points to reach their final target. At each one of these intermediate targets, growth cones need to switch responsiveness from attraction to repulsion in order to move on. Molecular mechanisms that allow for the precise timing of surface expression of a new set of receptors that support the switch in responsiveness are difficult to study in vivo. Mostly, mechanisms are inferred from the observation of snapshots of many different growth cones analyzed in different preparations of tissue harvested at distinct time points. However, to really understand the behavior of growth cones at choice points, a single growth cone should be followed arriving at and leaving the intermediate target. Existing ex vivo preparations, like cultures of an “open‐book” preparation of the spinal cord have been successfully used to study floor plate entry and exit, but artifacts prevent the analysis of growth cone behavior at the floor plate exit site. Here, we describe a novel spinal cord preparation that allows for live imaging of individual axons during navigation in their intact environment. When comparing growth cone behavior in our ex vivo system with snapshots from in vivo navigation, we do not see any differences. The possibility to observe the dynamics of single growth cones navigating their intermediate target allows for measuring growth speed, changes in morphology, or aberrant behavior, like stalling and wrong turning. Moreover, observation of the intermediate target—the floor plate—revealed its active participation and interaction with commissural axons during midline crossing.</content>

 Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple tissue (Tmt) opsins are putative blue‐light‐sensitive photoreceptor protein found in animals. The distributions of mRNA of opn3/tmt‐opsins in the retina and brain of medaka were investigated by in situ hybridization. These opsins are differentially expressed in the multiple retinal and brain regions.

Abstract
The photoreceptor protein, opsin, is one of the major components for vision and photoreceptive function in animals. Although many opsins have been discovered from animal genomes, only a few nonimage‐forming functions mediated by opsins have been identified. Understanding the mRNA distribution of photoreceptor proteins is one crucial step in uncovering their photoreceptive function in animals. Here, we focus on the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple opsin (Tmt) system, which constitutes a separate phylogenetic group, having putative blue light photoreceptors for nonimage‐forming functions. In medaka, there is one opn3 and five tmt‐opsin orthologs. The expression pattern of the opn3/tmt‐opsins in the retina and brain was investigated by in situ hybridization. mRNAs for opn3/tmt‐opsins were distributed in the retinal ganglion cells as well as interneurons and specific brain nuclei. Specifically, hybridization signals were observed in the glutamate decarboxylase 1 (gad1)‐expressing amacrine cells for opn3, tmt1a, tmt1b, and tmt2, in the caudal lobe of the cerebellum for tmt1b and tmt2, in the cranial nerve nuclei for opn3, tmt1a, tmt1b, tmt2, and in the rostral pars distalis (adenohypophysis) for opn3. These expression patterns suggest that blue light sensing in the fish retina and brain may be involved in the integration of visual inputs, vestibular function, somatosensation, motor outputs, and pituitary endocrine regulation.</content>

 Traditional image analysis techniques fail to determine the morphological changes astrocytes undergo following inflammation. Developing an automated segmentation workflow allowed us to extract morphological data of GFAP or ALDH1L1 positive objects. Using principal component analysis and random forests, we were able to determine the features most important for identifying whether an astrocyte was baseline or reactive. To further determine the changes, different segmented cellular astrocyte components underwent (i.e., the body or process), we performed k‐means clustering. Multiple, well‐validated machine learning approaches allowed us to determine astrocytes undergo a region‐specific heterogenous morphological change following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).







Abstract
Evaluation of reactive astrogliosis by neuroanatomical assays represents a common experimental outcome for neuroanatomists. The literature demonstrates several conflicting results as to the accuracy of such measures. We posited that the diverging results within the neuroanatomy literature were due to suboptimal analytical workflows in addition to astrocyte regional heterogeneity. We therefore generated an automated segmentation workflow to extract features of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, member L1 (ALDH1L1) labeled astrocytes with and without neuroinflammation. We achieved this by capturing multiplexed immunofluorescent confocal images of mouse brains treated with either vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by implementation of our workflows. Using classical image analysis techniques focused on pixel intensity only, we were unable to identify differences between vehicle‐treated and LPS‐treated animals. However, when utilizing machine learning–based algorithms, we were able to (1) accurately predict which objects were derived from GFAP or ALDH1L1‐stained images indicating that GFAP and ALDH1L1 highlight distinct morphological aspects of astrocytes, (2) we could predict which neuroanatomical region the segmented GFAP or ALDH1L1 object had been derived from, indicating that morphological features of astrocytes change as a function of neuroanatomical location. (3) We discovered a statistically significant, albeit not highly accurate, prediction of which objects had come from LPS versus vehicle‐treated animals, indicating that although features exist capable of distinguishing LPS‐treated versus vehicle‐treated GFAP and ALDH1L1‐segmented objects, that significant overlap between morphologies exists. We further determined that for most classification scenarios, nonlinear models were required for improved treatment class designations. We propose that unbiased automated image analysis techniques coupled with well‐validated machine learning tools represent highly useful models capable of providing insights into neuroanatomical assays.</content>

 Using antibodies to calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) as a marker for pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the monkey basolateral amygdala (BNC) it was shown that virtually all PNs in the BNC express type 1 muscarinic receptors (m1Rs). Additional studies indicated that one‐third of inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and 60% of parvalbumin immunoreactive INs (PV) were also m1R+. These results indicate that expression of m1Rs in BNC INs is greater in the monkey versus the rat.







Abstract
The basolateral nuclear complex (BNC) of the amygdala plays an important role in the generation of emotional/motivational behavior and the consolidation of emotional memories. Activation of M1 cholinergic receptors (M1Rs) in the BNC is critical for memory consolidation. Previous receptor binding studies in the monkey amygdala demonstrated that the BNC has a high density of M1Rs, but did not have sufficient resolution to identify which neurons in the BNC expressed them. This was accomplished in the present immunohistochemical investigation using an antibody for the m1 receptor (m1R). Analysis of m1Rs in the monkey BNC using immunoperoxidase techniques revealed that their expression was very dense in the BNC, and suggested that virtually all of the pyramidal projection neurons (PNs) in all of the BNC nuclei were m1R‐immunoreactive (m1R+). This was confirmed with dual‐labeling immunofluorescence using staining for calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) as a marker for BNC PNs. However, additional dual‐labeling studies indicated that one‐third of inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were also m1R+. Moreover, the finding that 60% of parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactive neurons were m1R+ indicated that this IN subpopulation was the main GAD+ subpopulation exhibiting m1R expression. The cholinergic innervation of the amygdala is greatly reduced in Alzheimer's disease and there is currently considerable interest in developing selective M1R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) to treat the symptoms. The results of the present study indicate that M1Rs in both PNs and INs in the primate BNC would be targeted by M1R PAMs.</content>

 This study shows that most glutamatergic neurons of the mouse medial extended amygdala originate in a novel telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior.

Abstract
Deficits in social cognition and behavior are a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders. The medial extended amygdala, including the medial amygdala and the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, is a key component of functional networks involved in sociality. However, this nuclear complex is highly heterogeneous and contains numerous GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron subpopulations. Deciphering the connections of different neurons is essential in order to understand how this structure regulates different aspects of sociality, and it is necessary to evaluate their differential implication in distinct mental disorders. Developmental studies in different vertebrates are offering new venues to understand neuronal diversity of the medial extended amygdala and are helping to establish a relation between the embryonic origin and molecular signature of distinct neurons with the functional subcircuits in which they are engaged. These studies have provided many details on the distinct GABAergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala, but information on the glutamatergic neurons is still scarce. Using an Otp‐eGFP transgenic mouse and multiple fluorescent labeling, we show that most glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala originate in a distinct telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), located at the transition between telencephalon and hypothalamus, which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 but not Nkx2.1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons of the medial amygdala, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of this neuron subtype in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.</content>

 Serial section immuno‐electron microscopy of gamma protocadherins (Pcdh‐γs), a subset of clustered protocadherins, at synapses in CA1. We characterized synaptic diameter and perforation status for synapses labeled with antibodies to Pcdh‐γs and found that they were larger with more frequent perforations. Results were confirmed by light level imaging of immunolabeled synapses. The results suggest that clustered protocadherins may mediate a late event in synaptic development. Bar = 500 nm.







Abstract
Clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a family of ~60 cadherin‐like proteins (divided into subclasses α, β, and γ) that regulate dendrite morphology and neural connectivity. Their expression is controlled through epigenetic regulation at a gene cluster encoding the molecules. During neural development, Pcdhs mediate dendrite self‐avoidance in some neuronal types through an uncharacterized anti‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs are also important for dendritic complexity in cortical neurons likely through a pro‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs have also been postulated to participate in synaptogenesis and connectivity. Some synaptic defects were noted in knockout animals, including synaptic number and physiology, but the role of these molecules in synaptic development is not understood. The effect of Pcdh knockout on dendritic patterning may present a confound to studying synaptogenesis. We showed previously that Pcdh‐γs are highly enriched in intracellular compartments in dendrites and spines with localization at only a few synaptic clefts. To gain insight into how Pcdh‐γs might affect synapses, we compared synapses that harbored Pcdh‐γs versus those that did not for parameters of synaptic maturation including pre‐ and postsynaptic size, postsynaptic perforations, and spine morphology by light microscopy in cultured hippocampal neurons and by serial section immuno‐electron microscopy in hippocampal CA1. In mature neurons, synapses immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs were larger in diameter with more frequent perforations. Analysis of spines in cultured neurons revealed that mushroom spines were more frequently immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs at their tips than thin spines. These results suggest that Pcdh‐γ function at the synapse may be related to promotion of synaptic maturation and stabilization.</content>

The 5’ untranslated region plays a key role in regulating mRNA translation and consequently protein abundance. Therefore, accurate modeling of 5’UTR regulatory sequences shall provide insights into translational control mechanisms and help interpret genetic variants. Recently, a model was trained on a massively parallel reporter assay to predict mean ribosome load (MRL)—a proxy for translation rate—directly from 5’UTR sequence with a high degree of accuracy. However, this model is restricted to sequence lengths investigated in the reporter assay and therefore cannot be applied to the majority of human sequences without a substantial loss of information. Here, we introduced frame pooling, a novel neural network operation that enabled the development of an MRL prediction model for 5’UTRs of any length. Our model shows state-of-the-art performance on fixed length randomized sequences, while offering better generalization performance on longer sequences and on a variety of translation-related genome-wide datasets. Variant interpretation is demonstrated on a 5’UTR variant of the gene HBB associated with beta-thalassemia. Frame pooling could find applications in other bioinformatics predictive tasks. Moreover, our model, released open source, could help pinpoint pathogenic genetic variants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S7Wpt5o3RpI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Animals utilize a variety of active sensing mechanisms to perceive the world around them. Echolocating bats are an excellent model for the study of active auditory localization. The big brown bat (&lt;i&gt;Eptesicus fuscus&lt;/i&gt;), for instance, employs active head roll movements during sonar prey tracking. The function of head rolls in sound source localization is not well understood. Here, we propose an echolocation model with multi-axis head rotation to investigate the effect of active head roll movements on sound localization performance. The model autonomously learns to align the bat’s head direction towards the target. We show that a model with active head roll movements better localizes targets than a model without head rolls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active head rolls also reduce the time required for localization in elevation. Finally, our model offers key insights to sound localization cues used by echolocating bats employing active head movements during echolocation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UuufKDeAocI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A major factor contributing to the etiology of depression is a neurochemical imbalance of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, which is caused by persistently high levels of circulating stress hormones. Here, a computational model is proposed to investigate the interplay between dopaminergic and serotonergic-kynurenine metabolism under cortisolemia and its consequences for the onset of depression. The model was formulated as a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations represented with power-law functions. Parameter values were obtained from experimental data reported in the literature, biological databases, and other general information, and subsequently fine-tuned through optimization. Model simulations predict that changes in the kynurenine pathway, caused by elevated levels of cortisol, can increase the risk of neurotoxicity and lead to increased levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylaceltahyde (DOPAL) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAL). These aldehydes contribute to alpha-synuclein aggregation and may cause mitochondrial fragmentation. Further model analysis demonstrated that the inhibition of both serotonin transport and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase decreased the levels of DOPAL and 5-HIAL and the neurotoxic risk often associated with depression. The mathematical model was also able to predict a novel role of the dopamine and serotonin metabolites DOPAL and 5-HIAL in the ethiology of depression, which is facilitated through increased cortisol levels. Finally, the model analysis suggests treatment with a combination of inhibitors of serotonin transport and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase as a potentially effective pharmacological strategy to revert the slow-down in monoamine neurotransmission that is often triggered by inflammation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YN2jFOWgSHo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Adaptive behavior requires balancing approach and avoidance based on the rewarding and aversive consequences of actions. Imbalances in this evaluation are thought to characterize mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). We present a novel application of the drift diffusion model (DDM) suited to quantify how offers of reward and aversiveness, and neural correlates thereof, are dynamically integrated to form decisions, and how such processes are altered in MDD. Hierarchical parameter estimation from the DDM demonstrated that the MDD group differed in three distinct reward-related parameters driving approach-based decision making. First, MDD was associated with reduced reward sensitivity, measured as the impact of offered reward on evidence accumulation. Notably, this effect was replicated in a follow-up study. Second, the MDD group showed lower starting point bias towards approaching offers. Third, this starting point was influenced in opposite directions by Pavlovian effects and by nucleus accumbens activity across the groups: greater accumbens activity was related to approach bias in controls but avoid bias in MDD. Cross-validation revealed that the combination of these computational biomarkers were diagnostic of patient status, with accumbens influences being particularly diagnostic. Finally, within the MDD group, reward sensitivity and nucleus accumbens parameters were differentially related to symptoms of perceived stress and depression. Collectively, these findings establish the promise of computational psychiatry approaches to dissecting approach-avoidance decision dynamics relevant for affective disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DKXfzqVazzc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Skeletal muscle possesses a remarkable capacity for repair and regeneration following a variety of injuries. When successful, this highly orchestrated regenerative process requires the contribution of several muscle resident cell populations including satellite stem cells (SSCs), fibroblasts, macrophages and vascular cells. However, volumetric muscle loss injuries (VML) involve simultaneous destruction of multiple tissue components (e.g., as a result of battlefield injuries or vehicular accidents) and are so extensive that they exceed the intrinsic capability for scarless wound healing and result in permanent cosmetic and functional deficits. In this scenario, the regenerative process fails and is dominated by an unproductive inflammatory response and accompanying fibrosis. The failure of current regenerative therapeutics to completely restore functional muscle tissue is not surprising considering the incomplete understanding of the cellular mechanisms that drive the regeneration response in the setting of VML injury. To begin to address this profound knowledge gap, we developed an agent-based model to predict the tissue remodeling response following surgical creation of a VML injury. Once the model was able to recapitulate key aspects of the tissue remodeling response in the absence of repair, we validated the model by simulating the tissue remodeling response to VML injury following implantation of either a decellularized extracellular matrix scaffold or a minced muscle graft. The model suggested that the SSC microenvironment and absence of pro-differentiation SSC signals were the most important aspects of failed muscle regeneration in VML injuries. The major implication of this work is that agent-based models may provide a much-needed predictive tool to optimize the design of new therapies, and thereby, accelerate the clinical translation of regenerative therapeutics for VML injuries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D01OdBMIsW8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In this work, we describe the CRIMSON (CardiovasculaR Integrated Modelling and SimulatiON) software environment. CRIMSON provides a powerful, customizable and user-friendly system for performing three-dimensional and reduced-order computational haemodynamics studies via a pipeline which involves: 1) segmenting vascular structures from medical images; 2) constructing analytic arterial and venous geometric models; 3) performing finite element mesh generation; 4) designing, and 5) applying boundary conditions; 6) running incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations of blood flow with fluid-structure interaction capabilities; and 7) post-processing and visualizing the results, including velocity, pressure and wall shear stress fields. A key aim of CRIMSON is to create a software environment that makes powerful computational haemodynamics tools accessible to a wide audience, including clinicians and students, both within our research laboratories and throughout the community. The overall philosophy is to leverage best-in-class open source standards for medical image processing, parallel flow computation, geometric solid modelling, data assimilation, and mesh generation. It is actively used by researchers in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Australia. It has been applied to numerous clinical problems; we illustrate applications of CRIMSON to real-world problems using examples ranging from pre-operative surgical planning to medical device design optimization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K8iPIqRDqYc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

How cells control the numbers of its subcellular components is a fundamental question in biology. Given that biosynthetic processes are fundamentally stochastic it is utterly puzzling that some structures display no copy number variation within a cell population. Centriole biogenesis, with each centriole being duplicated once and only once per cell cycle, stands out due to its remarkable fidelity. This is a highly controlled process, which depends on low-abundance rate-limiting factors. How can exactly one centriole copy be produced given the variation in the concentration of these key factors? Hitherto, tentative explanations of this control evoked lateral inhibition- or phase separation-like mechanisms emerging from the dynamics of these rate-limiting factors but how strict centriole number is regulated remains unsolved. Here, a novel solution to centriole copy number control is proposed based on the assembly of a centriolar scaffold, the cartwheel. We assume that cartwheel building blocks accumulate around the mother centriole at supercritical concentrations, sufficient to assemble one or more cartwheels. Our key postulate is that once the first cartwheel is formed it continues to elongate by stacking the intermediate building blocks that would otherwise form supernumerary cartwheels. Using stochastic models and simulations, we show that this mechanism may ensure formation of one and only one cartwheel robustly over a wide range of parameter values. By comparison to alternative models, we conclude that the distinctive signatures of this novel mechanism are an increasing assembly time with cartwheel numbers and the translation of stochasticity in building block concentrations into variation in cartwheel numbers or length.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dLG8mK6ZcyM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Sex/gender differences in the human brain attract attention far beyond the neuroscience community. Given the interest of nonspecialists, it is important that researchers studying human female–male brain difference assume greater responsibility for the accurate communication of their findings.

Mind your language! This Perspective article points out that the source of misreporting in the field of sex/gender differences can often be found in the unjustified overstatements used by researchers themselves in reporting their findings; caution is needed when addressing differences between human beings, and hype and hyperbole should be avoided.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ou624Zw8-Jk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The biogenic amine octopamine (OA) and its precursor tyramine (TA) are involved in controlling a plethora of different physiological and behavioral processes. The &lt;i&gt;tyramine-&lt;/i&gt;ß-&lt;i&gt;hydroxylase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;ß&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;) gene encodes the enzyme catalyzing the last synthesis step from TA to OA. Here, we report differential dominance (from recessive to overdominant) of the putative null &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;ß&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;nM18&lt;/sup&gt; allele in 2 behavioral measures in Buridan’s paradigm (walking speed and stripe deviation) and in proboscis extension (sugar sensitivity) in the fruit fly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. The behavioral analysis of transgenic &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;ß&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; expression experiments in mutant and wild-type flies as well as of OA and TA receptor mutants revealed a complex interaction of both aminergic systems. Our analysis suggests that the different neuronal networks responsible for the 3 phenotypes show differential sensitivity to &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;ß&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; gene expression levels. The evidence suggests that this sensitivity is brought about by a TA/OA opponent system modulating the involved neuronal circuits. This conclusion has important implications for standard transgenic techniques commonly used in functional genetics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zdxXDNHBaiU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Lentivirally packaged clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) library is transduced into glioblastoma cells (1,000 cells transduced/single guide RNA after drug selection), with transduced cells injected into the mouse cortex, and resected under fluorescence guidance after 2‐week growth. Fluorescence‐activated cell sorting isolates viable, transduced cells, and sequencing of tagged cells identifies specific gene knockdowns associated with in vivo growth.

Abstract
CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)‐based genetic screens offer unbiased and powerful tools for systematic and specific evaluation of phenotypes associated with specific target genes. CRISPR screens have been utilized heavily in vitro to identify functional coding and noncoding genes in a large number of cell types, including glioblastoma (GB), though no prior study has described the evaluation of CRISPR screening in GB in vivo. Here, we describe a protocol for targeting and transcriptionally repressing GB‐specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system in vivo, with tumor growth in the mouse cerebral cortex. Given the target‐specific parameters of each individual screen, we list general steps involved in transducing guide RNA libraries into GB tumor lines, maintaining sufficient coverage, as well as cortically injecting and subsequently isolating transduced screen tumor cell populations for analysis. Finally, in order to demonstrate the use of this technique to discern an essential lncRNA, HOTAIR, from a nonessential lncRNA, we injected a 1:1 (HOTAIR:control nonessential lncRNA knockdown) mixture of fluorescently tagged U87 GB cells into the cortex of eight mice, evaluating selective depletion of HOTAIR‐tagged cells at 2 weeks of growth. Fluorescently tagged populations were analyzed via flow cytometry for hiBFP (control knockdown) and green fluorescent protein (HOTAIR knockdown), revealing 17% (p = 0.007) decrease in fluorescence associated with HOTAIR knockdown relative to control. The described in vivo CRISPR screening methodology thus appears to be an effective option for identifying noncoding (and coding) genes affecting GB growth within the mouse cortex.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Quantification of neuronal correlations in neuron populations helps us to
understand neural coding rules. Such quantification could also reveal how
neurons encode information in normal and disease conditions like Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's. While neurons communicate with each other by transmitting
spikes, there would be a change in calcium concentration within the neurons
inherently. Accordingly, there would be correlations in calcium spike trains
and they could have heterogeneous memory structures. In this context,
estimation of mutual information rate in calcium spike trains assumes primary
significance. However, such estimation is difficult with available methods
which would consider longer blocks for convergence without noticing that
neuronal information changes in short time windows. Against this backdrop, we
propose a faster method that exploits the memory structures in pair of calcium
spike trains to quantify mutual information shared between them. Our method has
shown superior performance with example Markov processes as well as
experimental spike trains. Such mutual information rate analysis could be used
to identify signatures of neuronal behavior in large populations in normal and
abnormal conditions.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Jump functions are the most studied non-unimodal benchmark in the theory of
randomized search heuristics, in particular, evolutionary algorithms (EAs).
They have significantly improved our understanding of how EAs escape from local
optima. However, their particular structure -- to leave the local optimum one
can only jump directly to the global optimum -- raises the question of how
representative such results are.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we propose an extended class $\textsc{Jump}_{k,\delta}$ of
jump functions that contain a valley of low fitness of width $\delta$ starting
at distance $k$ from the global optimum. We prove that several previous results
extend to this more general class: for all $k = o(n^{1/3})$ and $\delta &amp;lt; k$,
the optimal mutation rate for the $(1+1)$~EA is $\frac{\delta}{n}$, and the
fast $(1+1)$~EA runs faster than the classical $(1+1)$~EA by a factor
super-exponential in $\delta$. However, we also observe that some known results
do not generalize: the randomized local search algorithm with stagnation
detection, which is faster than the fast $(1+1)$~EA by a factor polynomial in
$k$ on $\textsc{Jump}_k$, is slower by a factor polynomial in $n$ on some
$\textsc{Jump}_{k,\delta}$ instances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computationally, the new class allows experiments with wider fitness valleys,
especially when they lie further away from the global optimum.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02953"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The presented compact algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits of the
MNIST database, created on the LogNNet reservoir neural network, reaches the
recognition accuracy of 82%. The algorithm was tested on a low-memory Arduino
board with 2 Kb static RAM low-power microcontroller. The dependences of the
accuracy and time of image recognition on the number of neurons in the
reservoir have been investigated. The memory allocation demonstrates that the
algorithm stores all the necessary information in RAM without using additional
data storage, and operates with original images without preliminary processing.
The simple structure of the algorithm, with appropriate training, can be
adapted for wide practical application, for example, for creating mobile
biosensors for early diagnosis of adverse events in medicine. The study results
are important for the implementation of artificial intelligence on peripheral
constrained IoT devices and for edge computing.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Semantics has become a key topic of research in Genetic Programming (GP).
Semantics refers to the outputs (behaviour) of a GP individual when this is run
on a data set. The majority of works that focus on semantic diversity in
single-objective GP indicates that it is highly beneficial in evolutionary
search. Surprisingly, there is minuscule research conducted in semantics in
Multi-objective GP (MOGP). In this work we make a leap beyond our understanding
of semantics in MOGP and propose SDO: Semantic-based Distance as an additional
criteriOn. This naturally encourages semantic diversity in MOGP. To do so, we
find a pivot in the less dense region of the first Pareto front (most promising
front). This is then used to compute a distance between the pivot and every
individual in the population. The resulting distance is then used as an
additional criterion to be optimised to favour semantic diversity. We also use
two other semantic-based methods as baselines, called Semantic Similarity-based
Crossover and Semantic-based Crowding Distance. Furthermore, we also use the
NSGA-II and the SPEA2 for comparison too. We use highly unbalanced binary
classification problems and consistently show how our proposed SDO approach
produces more non-dominated solutions and better diversity, leading to better
statistically significant results, using the hypervolume results as evaluation
measure, compared to the rest of the other four methods.

 &lt;p&gt;Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized extracellular matrix structures that surround specific neurons in the brain and spinal cord, appear during critical periods of development, and restrict plasticity during adulthood. Removal of PNNs can reinstate juvenile-like plasticity or, in cases of PNN removal during early developmental stages, PNN removal extends the critical plasticity period. PNNs surround mainly parvalbumin (PV)-containing, fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons in several brain regions. These inhibitory interneurons profoundly inhibit the network of surrounding neurons via their elaborate contacts with local pyramidal neurons, and they are key contributors to gamma oscillations generated across several brain regions. Among other functions, these gamma oscillations regulate plasticity associated with learning, decision making, attention, cognitive flexibility, and working memory. The detailed mechanisms by which PNN removal increases plasticity are only beginning to be understood. Here, we review the impact of PNN removal on several electrophysiological features of their underlying PV interneurons and nearby pyramidal neurons, including changes in intrinsic and synaptic membrane properties, brain oscillations, and how these changes may alter the integration of memory-related information. Additionally, we review how PNN removal affects plasticity-associated phenomena such as long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and paired-pulse ratio (PPR). The results are discussed in the context of the role of PV interneurons in circuit function and how PNN removal alters this function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). The two current treatments [hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)], are insufficiently effective in addressing neurologic disease, in part due to the inability of lysosomal enzyme to cross the blood brain barrier. With a goal to more effectively treat neurologic disease, we have investigated the effectiveness of AAV-mediated IDUA gene delivery to the brain using several different routes of administration. Animals were treated by either direct intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection, by intrathecal (IT) infusion into the cerebrospinal fluid, or by intranasal (IN) instillation of AAV9-IDUA vector. AAV9-IDUA was administered to IDUA-deficient mice that were either immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (CP), or immunotolerized at birth by weekly injections of human iduronidase. In animals treated by ICV or IT administration, levels of IDUA enzyme ranged from 3- to 1000-fold that of wild type levels in all parts of the microdissected brain. In animals administered vector intranasally, enzyme levels were 100-fold that of wild type in the olfactory bulb, but enzyme expression was close to wild type levels in other parts of the brain. Glycosaminoglycan levels were reduced to normal in ICV and IT treated mice, and in IN treated mice they were normalized in the olfactory bulb, or reduced in other parts of the brain. Immunohistochemical analysis showed extensive IDUA expression in all parts of the brain of ICV treated mice, while IT treated animals showed transduction that was primarily restricted to the hind brain with some sporadic labeling seen in the mid- and fore brain. At 6 months of age, animals were tested for spatial navigation, memory, and neurocognitive function in the Barnes maze; all treated animals were indistinguishable from normal heterozygous control animals, while untreated IDUA deficient animals exhibited significant learning and spatial navigation deficits. We conclude that IT and IN routes are acceptable and alternate routes of administration, respectively, of AAV vector delivery to the brain with effective IDUA expression, while all three routes of administration prevent the emergence of neurocognitive deficiency in a mouse MPS I model.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The Affect-tag solution measures physiological signals to deliver indicators derived from cognitive science. To provide the most accurate and effective results, a database of electrodermal activity (EDA) signals acquired using the Affect-tag A1 band was created. An experimental paradigm was designed to measure action-taking, autonomic regulation, cognitive load (CL), emotions, and stress, affects, and social stress. The Affect-tag emotional power (EP), emotional density (ED), and CL affective and cognitive indicators were refined based on the physiological responses of 48 participants during these tasks. Statistical significance was obtained for all indicators in tasks they were designed to measure, resulting in a total accuracy score of 89% for the combined indicators. Data obtained during this study will be further analyzed to define emotional and affective states.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A theoretical framework for the reinforcement learning of aesthetic biases was recently proposed based on brain circuitries revealed by neuroimaging. A model grounded on that framework accounted for interesting features of human aesthetic biases. These features included individuality, cultural predispositions, stochastic dynamics of learning and aesthetic biases, and the peak-shift effect. However, despite the success in explaining these features, a potential weakness was the linearity of the value function used to predict reward. This linearity meant that the learning process employed a value function that assumed a linear relationship between reward and sensory stimuli. Linearity is common in reinforcement learning in neuroscience. However, linearity can be problematic because neural mechanisms and the dependence of reward on sensory stimuli were typically nonlinear. Here, we analyze the learning performance with models including optimal nonlinear value functions. We also compare updating the free parameters of the value functions with the delta rule, which neuroscience models use frequently, vs. updating with a new Phi rule that considers the structure of the nonlinearities. Our computer simulations showed that optimal nonlinear value functions resulted in improvements of learning errors when the reward models were nonlinear. Similarly, the new Phi rule led to improvements in these errors. These improvements were accompanied by the straightening of the trajectories of the vector of free parameters in its phase space. This straightening meant that the process became more efficient in learning the prediction of reward. Surprisingly, however, this improved efficiency had a complex relationship with the rate of learning. Finally, the stochasticity arising from the probabilistic sampling of sensory stimuli, rewards, and motivations helped the learning process narrow the range of free parameters to nearly optimal outcomes. Therefore, we suggest that value functions and update rules optimized for social and ecological constraints are ideal for learning aesthetic biases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Muscle synergies reflect the presence of a common neural input to multiple muscles. Steering small sets of synergies is commonly believed to simplify the control of complex motor tasks like walking and running. When these locomotor patterns emerge, it is likely that synergies emerge as well. We hence hypothesized that in children learning to run the number of accompanying synergies increases and that some of the synergies’ activities display a temporal shift related to a reduced stance phase as observed in adults. We investigated the development of locomotion in 23 children aged 2–9 years of age and compared them with seven young adults. Muscle activity of 15 bilateral leg, trunk, and arm muscles, ground reaction forces, and kinematics were recorded during comfortable treadmill walking and running, followed by a muscle synergy analysis. We found that toddlers (2–3.5 years) and preschoolers (3.5–6.5 years) utilize a “walk-run strategy” when learning to run: they managed the fastest speeds on the treadmill by combining double support (DS) and flight phases (FPs). In particular the activity duration of the medial gastrocnemius muscle was weakly correlated with age. The number of synergies across groups and conditions needed to cover sufficient data variation ranged between four and eight. The number of synergies tended to be smaller in toddlers than it did in preschoolers and school-age children but the adults had the lowest number for both conditions. Against our expectations, the age groups did not differ significantly in the timing or duration of synergies. We believe that the increase in the number of muscle synergies in older children relates to motor learning and exploration. The ability to run with a FP is clearly associated with an increase in the number of muscle synergies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates neurotransmission by transporting serotonin from the synapse into the pre-synaptic nerve terminal. Altered SERT function leads to several neurological diseases including depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). Accordingly SERT is the target for their pharmacological treatments, but also targeted by multiple drugs of abuse. Transport of serotonin by SERT is energized by the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of sodium. We used extensive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the process of sodium binding to SERT, which is the first step in the transport cycle that leads to serotonin uptake. Comparing data from 51 independent simulations, we find a remarkably well-defined path for sodium entry and could identify two transient binding sites, while observing binding kinetics that are comparable to experimental data. Importantly, the structure and dynamics of the sodium binding sites indicate that sodium binding is accompanied by an induced-fit mechanism that leads to new conformations and reduces local dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebral ischemia is a devastating disease that affects many people worldwide every year. The neurodegenerative damage as a consequence of oxygen and energy deprivation, to date, has no known effective treatment. The ischemic insult is followed by an inflammatory response that involves a complex interaction between inflammatory cells and molecules which play a role in the progression towards cell death. However, there is presently a matter of controversy over whether inflammation could either be involved in brain damage or be a necessary part of brain repair. The inflammatory response is triggered by inflammasomes, key multiprotein complexes that promote secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. An early event in post-ischemic brain tissue is the release of certain molecules and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from injured neurons which induce the expression of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), a transcription factor involved in the activation of the inflammasome. There are conflicting observations related to the role of NF-κB. While some observe that NF-κB plays a damaging role, others suggest it to be neuroprotective in the context of cerebral ischemia, indicating the need for additional investigation. Here we discuss the dual role of the major inflammatory signaling pathways and provide a review of the latest research aiming to clarify the relationship between NF-κB mediated inflammation and neuronal death in cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Pio del Rio-Hortega was not only the discoverer of the microglia and oligodendroglia but also possibly the most prolific mentor of all Santiago Ramon y Cajal’s disciples (Nobel awardee in Physiology or Medicine 1906 and considered as the father of modern Neuroscience). Among Río-Hortega’s mentees, three exceptional women are frequently forgotten, chronologically: Pio’s niece Asunción Amo del Río who worked with Río-Hortega at Madrid, Paris, and Oxford; the distinguished British neuropathologist Dorothy Russell who also worked with Don Pío at Oxford; and Amanda Pellegrino de Iraldi, the last mentee in his career. Our present work analyzes the figures of these three women who were in contact and collaborated with Don Pío del Río-Hortega, describing the influences received and the impact on their careers and the History of Neuroscience. The present work completes the contribution of women neuroscientists who worked with Cajal and his main disciples of the Spanish Neurological School both in Spain (previous work) and in other countries (present work).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration and axonal injury result in an increasing release of neurofilament light chain (NfL) into bodily fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Numerous studies have shown that NfL levels in CSF and blood are increased in neurodegenerative disorders and monitor neurodegeneration. Saliva is an easily accessible biofluid that could be utilized as a biofluid measurement of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers. In this study, for the first time, salivary NfL was measured and compared to plasma NfL in a consecutive cohort of patients referred to cognitive assessments. In two mixed memory clinic cohorts, saliva samples were taken from 152 patients, AD (n = 49), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 47), non-AD (n = 56), and also 17 healthy controls. In addition, 135 also had a matching plasma sample. All saliva and plasma samples were analyzed for NfL, and the association between saliva and plasma NfL and CSF levels of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and beta amyloid 1–42 (Aβ42) were investigated. In total, 162/169 had quantifiable levels of salivary NfL by single molecule array (Simoa). No statistically significant differences were found in salivary NfL concentration across the diagnostic groups, but as expected, significant increases were found for plasma NfL in dementia cases (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). There was no association between saliva and plasma NfL levels. Furthermore, saliva NfL did not correlate with CSF Aβ42, p-tau, or tau concentrations. In conclusion, NfL is detectable in saliva but does not reflect neurodegeneration in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered a transcriptional process that induces a switch in cells from a polarized state to a migratory phenotype. Here we show that KSR1 and ERK promote EMT-like phenotype through the preferential translation of Epithelial-Stromal Interaction 1 (EPSTI1), which is required to induce the switch from E- to N-cadherin and coordinate migratory and invasive behavior. EPSTI1 is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Disruption of KSR1 or EPSTI1 significantly impairs cell migration and invasion &lt;i&gt;in &lt;/i&gt;vitro, and reverses EMT-like phenotype, in part, by decreasing the expression of N-cadherin and the transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin expression, ZEB1 and Slug. In CRC cells lacking KSR1, ectopic EPSTI1 expression restored the E- to N-cadherin switch, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. KSR1-dependent induction of EMT-like phenotype via selective translation of mRNAs reveals its underappreciated role in remodeling the translational landscape of CRC cells to promote their migratory and invasive behavior.</content>

 In eukaryotes, histone variant distribution within the genome is the key epigenetic feature. To understand how each histone variant is targeted to the genome, we developed a new method, the RhIP (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;econstituted &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;istone complex &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;ncorporation into chromatin of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;ermeabilized cell) assay, in which epitope-tagged histone complexes are introduced into permeabilized cells and incorporated into their chromatin. Using this method, we found that H3.1 and H3.3 were incorporated into chromatin in replication-dependent and -independent manners, respectively. We further found that the incorporation of histones H2A and H2A.Z mainly occurred at less condensed chromatin (open), suggesting that condensed chromatin (closed) is a barrier for histone incorporation. To overcome this barrier, H2A, but not H2A.Z, uses a replication-coupled deposition mechanism. Our study revealed that the combination of chromatin structure and DNA replication dictates the differential histone deposition to maintain the epigenetic chromatin states.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is an abundant and ubiquitous organosulfur molecule in marine environments with important roles in global sulfur and nutrient cycling. Diverse DMSP lyases in some algae, bacteria and fungi cleave DMSP to yield gaseous dimethyl sulfide (DMS), an infochemical with important roles in atmospheric chemistry. Here we identified a novel ATP-dependent DMSP lyase, DddX. DddX belongs to the acyl-CoA synthetase superfamily and is distinct from the eight other known DMSP lyases. DddX catalyses the conversion of DMSP to DMS via a two-step reaction: the ligation of DMSP with CoA to form the intermediate DMSP-CoA, which is then cleaved to DMS and acryloyl-CoA. The novel catalytic mechanism was elucidated by structural and biochemical analyses. DddX is found in several Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes, suggesting that this new DMSP lyase may play an overlooked role in DMSP/DMS cycles.</content>

 Understanding how the brain recovers from unconsciousness can inform neurobiological theories of consciousness and guide clinical investigation. To address this question, we conducted a multicenter study of 60 healthy humans, half of whom received general anesthesia for three hours and half of whom served as awake controls. We administered a battery of neurocognitive tests and recorded electroencephalography to assess cortical dynamics. We hypothesized that recovery of consciousness and cognition is an extended process, with differential recovery of cognitive functions that would commence with return of responsiveness and end with return of executive function, mediated by prefrontal cortex. We found that, just prior to the recovery of consciousness, frontal-parietal dynamics returned to baseline. Consistent with our hypothesis, cognitive reconstitution after anesthesia evolved over time. Contrary to our hypothesis, executive function returned first. Early engagement of prefrontal cortex in recovery of consciousness and cognition is consistent with global neuronal workspace theory.</content>

 Abstract
Learning about general aspects, or content details, of space results in differentiated neuronal information encoding within the proximodistal axis of the hippocampus. These processes are tightly linked to long‐term potentiation (LTP) and long‐term depression (LTD). Here, we explored the precise sites of encoding of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus that are mediated by information throughput from the perforant path. We assessed nuclear Homer1a‐expression that was triggered by electrophysiological induction of short and long forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and compared it to Homer1a‐expression that was triggered by LTP and LTD enabled by different forms of spatial learning. Plasticity responses were induced by patterned stimulation of the perforant path and were recorded in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving rats. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect experience‐dependent nuclear encoding of Homer1a in proximodistal hippocampal subfields. Induction of neither STP nor STD resulted in immediate early gene (IEG) encoding. Electrophysiological induction of robust LTP, or LTD, resulted in highly significant and widespread induction of nuclear Homer1a in all hippocampal subfields. LTP that was facilitated by novel spatial exploration triggered similar widespread Homer1a‐expression. The coupling of synaptic depression with the exploration of a novel configuration of landmarks resulted in localized IEG expression in the proximal CA3 region and the lower (infrapyramidal) blade of the DG. Our findings support that synaptic plasticity induction via perforant path inputs promotes widespread hippocampal information encoding. Furthermore, novel spatial exploration promotes the selection of a hippocampal neuronal network by means of LTP that is distributed in an experience‐dependent manner across all hippocampus subfields. This network may be modified during spatial content learning by LTD in specific hippocampal subfields. Thus, long‐term plasticity‐inducing events result in IEG expression that supports establishment and/or restructuring of neuronal networks that are necessary for long‐term information storage.</content>

 Objective
This multilanguage study used simple speech recording and high‐end pattern analysis to provide sensitive and reliable noninvasive biomarkers of prodromal versus manifest α‐synucleinopathy in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and early‐stage Parkinson disease (PD).


Methods
We performed a multicenter study across the Czech, English, German, French, and Italian languages at 7 centers in Europe and North America. A total of 448 participants (337 males), including 150 with iRBD (mean duration of iRBD across language groups 0.5–3.4 years), 149 with PD (mean duration of disease across language groups 1.7–2.5 years), and 149 healthy controls were recorded; 350 of the participants completed the 12‐month follow‐up. We developed a fully automated acoustic quantitative assessment approach for the 7 distinctive patterns of hypokinetic dysarthria.


Results
No differences in language that impacted clinical parkinsonian phenotypes were found. Compared with the controls, we found significant abnormalities of an overall acoustic speech severity measure via composite dysarthria index for both iRBD (p = 0.002) and PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, only PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was perceptually distinct in a blinded subjective analysis. We found significant group differences between PD and controls for monopitch (p &amp;lt; 0.001), prolonged pauses (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and imprecise consonants (p = 0.03); only monopitch was able to differentiate iRBD patients from controls (p = 0.004). At the 12‐month follow‐up, a slight progression of overall acoustic speech impairment was noted for the iRBD (p = 0.04) and PD (p = 0.03) groups.


Interpretation
Automated speech analysis might provide a useful additional biomarker of parkinsonism for the assessment of disease progression and therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

Marine nitrogen-fixing microorganisms are an important source of fixed nitrogen in oceanic ecosystems. The colonial cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; and diatom symbionts were thought to be the primary contributors to oceanic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation until the discovery of the unusual uncultivated symbiotic cyanobacterium UCYN-A (&lt;i&gt;Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa&lt;/i&gt;). UCYN-A has atypical metabolic characteristics lacking the oxygen-evolving photosystem II, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the carbon-fixation enzyme RuBisCo and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthetic pathways for a number of amino acids and nucleotides. Therefore, it is obligately symbiotic with its single-celled haptophyte algal host. UCYN-A receives fixed carbon from its host and returns fixed nitrogen, but further insights into this symbiosis are precluded by both UCYN-A and its host being uncultured. In order to investigate how this syntrophy is coordinated, we reconstructed bottom-up genome-scale metabolic models of UCYN-A and its algal partner to explore possible trophic scenarios, focusing on nitrogen fixation and biomass synthesis. Since both partners are uncultivated and only the genome sequence of UCYN-A is available, we used the phylogenetically related &lt;i&gt;Chrysochromulina tobin&lt;/i&gt; as a proxy for the host. Through the use of flux balance analysis (FBA), we determined the minimal set of metabolites and biochemical functions that must be shared between the two organisms to ensure viability and growth. We quantitatively investigated the metabolic characteristics that facilitate daytime N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation in UCYN-A and possible oxygen-scavenging mechanisms needed to create an anaerobic environment to allow nitrogenase to function. This is the first application of an FBA framework to examine the tight metabolic coupling between uncultivated microbes in marine symbiotic communities and provides a roadmap for future efforts focusing on such specialized systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y-NMG9Z_ThA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Metagenomics facilitates the study of the genetic information from uncultured microbes and complex microbial communities. Assembling complete genomes from metagenomics data is difficult because most samples have high organismal complexity and strain diversity. Some studies have attempted to extract complete bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes and often focus on species with circular genomes so they can help confirm completeness with circularity. However, less than 100 circularized bacterial and archaeal genomes have been assembled and published from metagenomics data despite the thousands of datasets that are available. Circularized genomes are important for (1) building a reference collection as scaffolds for future assemblies, (2) providing complete gene content of a genome, (3) confirming little or no contamination of a genome, (4) studying the genomic context and synteny of genes, and (5) linking protein coding genes to ribosomal RNA genes to aid metabolic inference in 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. We developed a semi-automated method called Jorg to help circularize small bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes using iterative assembly, binning, and read mapping. In addition, this method exposes potential misassemblies from k-mer based assemblies. We chose species of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) to focus our initial efforts because they have small genomes and are only known to have one ribosomal RNA operon. In addition to 34 circular CPR genomes, we present one circular Margulisbacteria genome, one circular Chloroflexi genome, and two circular megaphage genomes from 19 public and published datasets. We demonstrate findings that would likely be difficult without circularizing genomes, including that ribosomal genes are likely not operonic in the majority of CPR, and that some CPR harbor diverged forms of RNase P RNA. Code and a tutorial for this method is available at https://github.com/lmlui/Jorg and is available on the DOE Systems Biology KnowledgeBase as a beta app.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_G9M9PLYt1w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

With the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that may increase transmissibility and/or cause escape from immune responses, there is an urgent need for the targeted surveillance of circulating lineages. It was found that the B.1.1.7 (also 501Y.V1) variant, first detected in the United Kingdom, could be serendipitously detected by the Thermo Fisher TaqPath Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR assay because a key deletion in these viruses, spike Δ69–70, would cause a “spike gene target failure” (SGTF) result. However, a SGTF result is not definitive for B.1.1.7, and this assay cannot detect other variants of concern (VOC) that lack spike Δ69–70, such as B.1.351 (also 501Y.V2), detected in South Africa, and P.1 (also 501Y.V3), recently detected in Brazil. We identified a deletion in the ORF1a gene (ORF1a Δ3675–3677) in all 3 variants, which has not yet been widely detected in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Using ORF1a Δ3675–3677 as the primary target and spike Δ69–70 to differentiate, we designed and validated an open-source PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 VOC. Our assay can be rapidly deployed in laboratories around the world to enhance surveillance for the local emergence and spread of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UWIlwO-TkQI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens global public health and economy unprecedentedly, requiring accelerating development of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Molecular understanding of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) would greatly help advance the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, as well as the design of next generation recombinant vaccines. Here, we applied H2L2 transgenic mice encoding the human immunoglobulin variable regions, together with a state-of-the-art antibody discovery platform to immunize and isolate NAbs. From a large panel of isolated antibodies, 25 antibodies showed potent neutralizing activities at sub-nanomolar levels by engaging the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). Importantly, one human NAb, termed PR1077, from the H2L2 platform and 2 humanized NAb, including PR953 and PR961, were further characterized and subjected for subsequent structural analysis. High-resolution X-ray crystallography structures unveiled novel epitopes on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) for PR1077 and PR953, which directly compete with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding, and a novel non-blocking epitope on the neighboring site near RBM for PR961. Moreover, we further tested the antiviral efficiency of PR1077 in the Ad5-hACE2 transduction mouse model of COVID-19. A single injection provided potent protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in either prophylactic or treatment groups. Taken together, these results shed light on the development of mAb-related therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-hk1OfkxHpc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Dual‐labeling immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing were used to characterize neurons in the basolateral amygdala that express SMI‐32+ non‐phosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs). Most of the neurons with strong somatic and dendritic expression of NNFs were parvalbumin+ (PV+) interneurons, as well as nonpyramidal neurons that project to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. The graphical abstract shows six SMI‐32+ neurons (diffuse brown staining); five are also stained for PV (blue particulate staining), and one is PV‐negative (arrow).  Studies in the cortex suggest that the SMI‐32+ neurons identified in this study may be especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) containing non‐phosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs) localized with the SMI‐32 monoclonal antibody have been shown to be especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present investigation is the first to study the expression of SMI‐32+ NNFs in neurons of the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala (BNC), which contains cortex‐like PNs and nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs). We observed that PNs in the rat basolateral nucleus (BL), but not in the lateral (LAT) or basomedial (BM) nuclei, have significant levels of SMI‐32‐ir in their somata with antibody diluents that did not contain Triton X‐100, but staining in these cells was greatly attenuated when the antibody diluent contained 0.3% Triton. Using Triton‐containing diluents we found that all SMI‐32+ neurons in all three of the BNC nuclei were NPNs. Using a dual‐labeling immunoperoxidase technique we demonstrated that most of these SMI‐32+ NPNs were parvalbumin‐positive (PV+) or somatostatin‐positive NPNs, but not vasoactive intestinal peptide‐positive or neuropeptide Y‐positive NPNs. Using a technique that combines retrograde tracing with SMI‐32 immunohistochemistry using intermediate levels of Triton in the diluent we found that all BNC neurons projecting to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) were large NPNs, and most were SMI‐32+. In contrast, BNC neurons projecting to the ventral striatum or cerebral cortex were PNs that expressed low levels of SMI‐32 immunoreactivity (SMI‐32‐ir) in the BL, and no SMI‐32‐ir in the LAT or BM. These data suggest that the main neuronal subpopulations in the BNC that degenerate in AD may be PV+ and MD‐projecting NPNs.

 Summary of the main results of the study.

Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition, which leads to a permanent loss of functions below the injury site. The events which take place after SCI are characterized by cellular death, release of inhibitory factors, and inflammation. Many therapies have been studied to cure SCI, among them magnetic stimulation aims to reduce the secondary damages in particular by decreasing apoptosis, while, cellular transplantation promotes neuroregeneration by enhancing axonal regrowth. In the present study, we compared individually primary olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation and repetitive trans‐spinal magnetic stimulation (rTSMS) and then, we combined these two therapeutic approaches on tissue repair and functional recovery after SCI. To do so, SCIs were performed at Th10 level on female C57BL/6 mice, which were randomized into four groups: SCI, SCI + primary bOECs, SCI + STM, SCI + primary bulbar olfactory ensheathing cells (bOECs) + stimulation (STM). On these animals bioluminescence, immunohistological, and behavioral experiments were performed after SCI. Our results show that rTSMS has beneficial effect on the modulation of spinal scar by reducing fibrosis, demyelination, and microglial cell activation and by increasing the astroglial component of the scar, while, primary bOEC transplantation decreases microglial reactivity. At the opposite, locotronic experiments show that both treatments induce functional recovery. We did not observed any additional effect by combining the two therapeutic approaches. Taken together, the present study indicates that primary bOEC transplantation and rTSMS treatment act through different mechanisms after SCI to induce functional recovery. In our experimental paradigm, the combination of the two therapies does not induce any additional benefit.</content>

 In 2013, our group examined the expression profiles of 50 genes to develop the continuum hypothesis of avian brain organization. It states that the subdivisions of the dorsal pallium develop continuously with those of the ventral pallium, resulting in a “partial mirror image” organization around the vestigial ventricle divide. However, these claims were challenged due to the small number of genes profiled. The present study uses RNA sequencing to profile the whole transcriptome (~20,000 genes) of the principal subdivisions of the avian telencephalon and confirms the remarkable molecularly similarities between the dorsal and ventral pallium. We recommend adopting a hierarchal nomenclature to reflect these robust molecular similarities.







Abstract
Over the last two decades, beginning with the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum in 2000, major revisions have been made to our understanding of the organization and nomenclature of the avian brain. However, there are still unresolved questions on avian pallial organization, particularly whether the cells above the vestigial ventricle represent distinct populations to those below it or similar populations. To test these two hypotheses, we profiled the transcriptomes of the major avian pallial subdivisions dorsal and ventral to the vestigial ventricle boundary using RNA sequencing and a new zebra finch genome assembly containing about 22,000 annotated, complete genes. We found that the transcriptomes of neural populations above and below the ventricle were remarkably similar. Each subdivision in dorsal pallium (Wulst) had a corresponding molecular counterpart in the ventral pallium (dorsal ventricular ridge). In turn, each corresponding subdivision exhibited shared gene co‐expression modules that contained gene sets enriched in functional specializations, such as anatomical structure development, synaptic transmission, signaling, and neurogenesis. These findings are more in line with the continuum hypothesis of avian brain subdivision organization above and below the vestigial ventricle space, with the pallium as a whole consisting of four major cell populations (intercalated pallium, mesopallium, hyper‐nidopallium, and arcopallium) instead of seven (hyperpallium apicale, interstitial hyperpallium apicale, intercalated hyperpallium, hyperpallium densocellare, mesopallium, nidopallium, and arcopallium). We suggest adopting a more streamlined hierarchical naming system that reflects the robust similarities in gene expression, neural connectivity motifs, and function. These findings have important implications for our understanding of overall vertebrate brain evolution.</content>

 Abstract
Neuron‐restrictive silencing factor (NRSF) is a zinc‐finger transcription factor that regulates expression of a diverse set of genes. However, NRSF function in brain development still remains elusive. In the present study, we generated NRSF‐conditional knockout (NRSF‐cKO) mice by hGFAP‐Cre/loxp system to study the effect of NRSF deficiency on brain development. Results showed that NRSF conditional knockout caused a smaller hippocampus and a thinner granule cell layer (GCL) in mice. Moreover, the reduction and disarrangement of GFAP+ cells in subgranular zone (SGZ) of NRSF‐cKO mice was accompanied with the decreased number of premature neurons, neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), as well as compromising the majority of mitotically active cells. The analysis of postnatal development of hippocampus indicated the existence of an abnormality at postnatal day (P) 8, rather than at P1, in NRSF‐cKO mice, although the densities of Ki67+ cells with mitotic ability in dentate gyrus were relatively unaffected at P1 and P8. Meanwhile, NRSF deficiency led to abnormal organization of SGZ at P8 during postnatal development. RNA‐Seq analysis revealed 79 deregulated genes in hippocampus of NRSF‐cKO mice at P8, which were involved in p53 signal transduction, neuron migration and negative regulation of cell proliferation, etc. The deregulation of p53 pathway in NRSF‐cKO mice at P1 and P8 was evidenced, of which p21/Cdkn1a was accumulated in a portion of NSCs and NPCs in hippocampus during postnatal development. Together, these results, for the first time, revealed that NRSF could significantly influence the postnatal development of hippocampus, especially the formation of SGZ.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The regulation of microRNA (miRNA) is closely related to methamphetamine (METH) addiction. Past studies have reported that miR-181a is associated with METH addiction, but the mechanism pathways remain elusive. On the basis of our past studies, which reported the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) mediated ubiquitin protein degradation of GABAAα1, which was involved in METH addiction. The present study, using qRT-PCR and bioinformatics analysis, further revealed that miR-181a may be indirectly responsible for the METH addiction and downregulation of GABAAα1 through the regulation of ERAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Tissue pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS) is highly complex, requiring multi-dimensional analysis. In this study, our goal was to test the feasibility of obtaining high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) metrics through single-shell modeling of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and investigate how advanced measures from single-shell HARDI and DTI tractography perform relative to classical DTI metrics in assessing MS pathology. We examined 52 relapsing-remitting MS patients who had 3T anatomical brain MRI and DTI. Single-shell HARDI modeling yielded 5 sub-voxel-based metrics, totalling 11 diffusion measures including 4 DTI and 2 tractography metrics. Based on machine learning of 3-dimensional regions of interest, we evaluated the importance of the measures through several tissue classification tasks. These included two within-subject comparisons: lesion versus normal appearing white matter (NAWM); and lesion core versus shell. Further, by stratifying patients as having high (above 75%&lt;sup&gt;ile&lt;/sup&gt;) and low (below 25%&lt;sup&gt;ile&lt;/sup&gt;) number of MS lesions, we also performed 2 classifications between subjects for lesions and NAWM respectively. Results showed that in lesion-NAWM analysis, HARDI orientation distribution function (ODF) energy, DTI fractional anisotropy (FA), and HARDI orientation dispersion index were the top three metrics, which together achieved 65.2% accuracy and 0.71 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). In core-shell analysis, DTI mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity, and FA were the top three metrics, and MD dominated the classification, which achieved 59.3% accuracy and 0.59 AUROC alone. Between patients, FA was the leading feature in lesion comparisons, while ODF energy was the best in NAWM separation. Collectively, single-shell modeling of common diffusion data can provide robust orientation measures of lesion and NAWM pathology, and DTI metrics are most sensitive to intra-lesion abnormality. Combined analysis of both advanced and classical diffusion measures may be critical for improved understanding of MS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.642766"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the recognition of emotions in people with sensory disabilities still represents a challenge due to the difficulty of generalizing and modeling the set of brain signals. In recent years, the technology that has been used to study a person’s behavior and emotions based on brain signals is the brain–computer interface (BCI). Although previous works have already proposed the classification of emotions in people with sensory disabilities using machine learning techniques, a model of recognition of emotions in people with visual disabilities has not yet been evaluated. Consequently, in this work, the authors present a twofold framework focused on people with visual disabilities. Firstly, auditory stimuli have been used, and a component of acquisition and extraction of brain signals has been defined. Secondly, analysis techniques for the modeling of emotions have been developed, and machine learning models for the classification of emotions have been defined. Based on the results, the algorithm with the best performance in the validation is random forest (RF), with an accuracy of 85 and 88% in the classification for negative and positive emotions, respectively. According to the results, the framework is able to classify positive and negative emotions, but the experimentation performed also shows that the framework performance depends on the number of features in the dataset and the quality of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a determining factor.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hyperscanning studies using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been performed to understand the neural mechanisms underlying human-human interactions. In this study, we propose a novel methodological approach that is developed for fNIRS multi-brain analysis. Our method uses support vector regression (SVR) to predict one brain activity time series using another as the predictor. We applied the proposed methodology to explore the teacher-student interaction, which plays a critical role in the formal learning process. In an illustrative application, we collected fNIRS data of the teacher and preschoolers’ dyads performing an interaction task. The teacher explained to the child how to add two numbers in the context of a game. The Prefrontal cortex and temporal-parietal junction of both teacher and student were recorded. A multivariate regression model was built for each channel in each dyad, with the student’s signal as the response variable and the teacher’s ones as the predictors. We compared the predictions of SVR with the conventional ordinary least square (OLS) predictor. The results predicted by the SVR model were statistically significantly correlated with the actual test data at least one channel-pair for all dyads. Overall, 29/90 channel-pairs across the five dyads (18 channels 5 dyads = 90 channel-pairs) presented significant signal predictions withthe SVR approach. The conventional OLS resulted in only 4 out of 90 valid predictions. These results demonstrated that the SVR could be used to perform channel-wise predictions across individuals, and the teachers’ cortical activity can be used to predict the student brain hemodynamic response.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synapses and circuits rely on homeostatic forms of regulation in order to transmit meaningful information. The Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a well-studied synapse that shows robust homeostatic control of function. Most prior studies of homeostatic plasticity at the NMJ have centered on presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). PHP happens when postsynaptic muscle neurotransmitter receptors are impaired, triggering retrograde signaling that causes an increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. As a result, normal levels of evoked excitation are maintained. The counterpart to PHP at the NMJ is presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD). Overexpression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut) causes an increase in the amplitude of spontaneous events. PHD happens when the synapse responds to the challenge by decreasing quantal content (QC) during evoked neurotransmission—again, resulting in normal levels of postsynaptic excitation. We hypothesized that there may exist a class of molecules that affects both PHP and PHD. Impairment of any such molecule could hurt a synapse’s ability to respond to any significant homeostatic challenge. We conducted an electrophysiology-based screen for blocks of PHD. We did not observe a block of PHD in the genetic conditions screened, but we found loss-of-function conditions that led to a substantial deficit in evoked amplitude when combined with VGlut overexpression. The conditions causing this phenotype included a double heterozygous loss-of-function condition for genes encoding the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R —itpr) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and RyRs gate calcium release from intracellular stores. Pharmacological agents targeting IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R and RyR recapitulated the genetic losses of these factors, as did lowering calcium levels from other sources. Our data are consistent with the idea that the homeostatic signaling process underlying PHD is especially sensitive to levels of calcium at the presynapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive impairment of motor and non-motor functions in aging people. Overwhelming evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central factor in PD pathophysiology, which impairs energy metabolism. While, several other studies have shown probiotic supplementations to improve host energy metabolism, alleviate the disease progression, prevent gut microbiota dysbiosis and alter commensal bacterial metabolites. But, whether probiotic and/or prebiotic supplementation can affect energy metabolism and cause the impediment of PD progression remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated 8-weeks supplementation effects of probiotic [Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 (AP-32)], residual medium (RM) obtained from the AP-32 culture medium, and combination of AP-32 and RM (A-RM) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. We found that AP-32, RM and A-RM supplementation induced neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons along with improved motor functions in PD rats. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in mitochondrial activities in the brain and muscle, antioxidative enzymes level in serum, and altered SCFAs profile in fecal samples. Importantly, the AP-32 supplement restored muscle mass along with improved motor function in PD rats, and produced the best results among the supplements. Our results demonstrate that probiotic AP-32 and A-RM supplementations can recover energy metabolism via increasing SCFAs producing and mitochondria function. This restoring of mitochondrial function in the brain and muscles with improved energy metabolism might additionally be potentiated by ROS suppression by the elevated generation of antioxidants, and which finally leads to facilitated recovery of 6-OHDA-induced motor deficit. Taken together, this work demonstrates that probiotic AP-32 supplementation could be a potential candidate for alternate treatment strategy to avert PD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 In multicellular organisms, sexual reproduction requires the separation of the germline from the soma. In flowering plants, the female germline precursor differentiates as a single spore mother cell (SMC) as the ovule primordium forms. Here, we explored how organ growth contributes to SMC differentiation. We generated 92 annotated 3D images at cellular resolution in Arabidopsis. We identified the spatio-temporal pattern of cell division that acts in a domain-specific manner as the primordium forms. Tissue growth models uncovered plausible morphogenetic principles involving a spatially confined growth signal, differential mechanical properties, and cell growth anisotropy. Our analysis revealed that SMC characteristics first arise in more than one cell but SMC fate becomes progressively restricted to a single cell during organ growth. Altered primordium geometry coincided with a delay in the fate restriction process in &lt;i&gt;katanin&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Altogether, our study suggests that tissue geometry channels reproductive cell fate in the Arabidopsis ovule primordium.</content>

 Epidemiological evidence suggests that social interactions and especially bonding between couples influence tumorigenesis, yet whether this is due to lifestyle changes, homogamy (likelihood of individuals to marry people of similar health), or directly associated with host-induced effects in tumors remains debatable. In the present study, we explored if tumorigenesis is associated with the bonding experience in monogamous rodents at which disruption of pair bonds is linked to anxiety and stress. Comparison of lung cancer cell spheroids that formed in the presence of sera from bonded and bond-disrupted deer mice showed that in monogamous &lt;i&gt;Peromyscus polionotus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Peromyscus californicus&lt;/i&gt;, but not in polygamous &lt;i&gt;Peromyscus maniculatus&lt;/i&gt;, the disruption of pair bonds altered the size and morphology of spheroids in a manner that is consistent with the acquisition of increased oncogenic potential. In vivo, consecutive transplantation of human lung cancer cells between &lt;i&gt;P. californicus&lt;/i&gt;, differing in bonding experiences (n = 9 for bonded and n = 7 for bond-disrupted), and nude mice showed that bonding suppressed tumorigenicity in nude mice (p&amp;lt;0.05), suggesting that the protective effects of pair bonds persisted even after bonding ceased. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering indicated that the transcriptomes of lung cancer cells clustered according to the serum donors’ bonding history while differential gene expression analysis pointed to changes in cell adhesion and migration. The results highlight the pro-oncogenic effects of pair-bond disruption, point to the acquisition of expression signatures in cancer cells that are relevant to the bonding experiences of serum donors, and question the ability of conventional mouse models to capture the whole spectrum of the impact of the host in tumorigenesis.</content>

 Levels of alertness are closely linked with human behavior and cognition. However, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for investigating whole-brain dynamics during behavior and task engagement, concurrent measures of alertness (such as EEG or pupillometry) are often unavailable. Here, we extract a continuous, time-resolved marker of alertness from fMRI data alone. We demonstrate that this fMRI alertness marker, calculated in a short pre-stimulus interval, captures trial-to-trial behavioral responses to incoming sensory stimuli. In addition, we find that the prediction of both EEG and behavioral responses during the task may be accomplished using only a small fraction of fMRI voxels. Furthermore, we observe that accounting for alertness appears to increase the statistical detection of task-activated brain areas. These findings have broad implications for augmenting a large body of existing datasets with information about ongoing arousal states, enriching fMRI studies of neural variability in health and disease.</content>

 Incision causes neuronal sensitization and acute postoperative pain. After injury resolves, endogenous µ‐opioid receptor (MOR) signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) suppresses latent pain sensitization. Inhibiting MOR signaling, either systemically or within the CeA, unmasks latent sensitization, leading to reinstatement of hypersensitivity.
​

Abstract
Tissue injury induces a long‐lasting latent sensitization (LS) of spinal nociceptive signaling that is kept in remission by an opposing µ‐opioid receptor (MOR) constitutive activity. To test the hypothesis that supraspinal sites become engaged, we induced hindpaw inflammation, waited 3 weeks for mechanical hypersensitivity to resolve, and then injected the opioid receptor inhibitors naltrexone, CTOP or β‐funaltrexamine subcutaneously, and/or into the cerebral ventricles. Intracerebroventricular injection of each inhibitor reinstated hypersensitivity and produced somatic signs of withdrawal, indicative of LS and endogenous opioid dependence, respectively. In naïve or sham controls, systemic naloxone (3 mg/kg) produced conditioned place aversion, and systemic naltrexone (3 mg/kg) increased Fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In LS animals tested 3 weeks after plantar incision, systemic naltrexone reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity and produced an even greater increase in Fos than in sham controls, particularly in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA. One third of Fos+ profiles co‐expressed protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), and 35% of PKCδ neurons co‐expressed tdTomato+ in Oprm1Cre::tdTomato transgenic mice. CeA microinjection of naltrexone (1 µg) reinstated mechanical hypersensitivity only in male mice and did not produce signs of somatic withdrawal. Intra‐CeA injection of the MOR‐selective inhibitor CTAP (300 ng) reinstated hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. We conclude that MORs in the capsular subdivision of the right CeA prevent the transition from acute to chronic postoperative pain.</content>

In the past few years, a wealth of sample-specific network construction methods and structural network control methods has been proposed to identify sample-specific driver nodes for supporting the Sample-Specific network Control (SSC) analysis of biological networked systems. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation for these state-of-the-art methods. Here, we conducted a performance assessment for 16 SSC analysis workflows by using the combination of 4 sample-specific network reconstruction methods and 4 representative structural control methods. This study includes simulation evaluation of representative biological networks, personalized driver genes prioritization on multiple cancer bulk expression datasets with matched patient samples from TCGA, and cell marker genes and key time point identification related to cell differentiation on single-cell RNA-seq datasets. By widely comparing analysis of existing SSC analysis workflows, we provided the following recommendations and banchmarking workflows. (i) The performance of a network control method is strongly dependent on the up-stream sample-specific network method, and Cell-Specific Network construction (CSN) method and Single-Sample Network (SSN) method are the preferred sample-specific network construction methods. (ii) After constructing the sample-specific networks, the undirected network-based control methods are more effective than the directed network-based control methods. In addition, these data and evaluation pipeline are freely available on https://github.com/WilfongGuo/Benchmark_control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YjYKAypUMRk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In the year 2020, there were 105 different statutory insurance companies in Germany with heterogeneous regional coverage. Obtaining data from all insurance companies is challenging, so that it is likely that projects will have to rely on data not covering the whole population. Consequently, the study of epidemic spread in hospital referral networks using data-driven models may be biased. We studied this bias using data from three German regional insurance companies covering four federal states: AOK (historically “general local health insurance company”, but currently only the abbreviation is used) Lower Saxony (in Federal State of Lower Saxony), AOK Bavaria (in Bavaria), and AOK PLUS (in Thuringia and Saxony). To understand how incomplete data influence network characteristics and related epidemic simulations, we created sampled datasets by randomly dropping a proportion of patients from the full datasets and replacing them with random copies of the remaining patients to obtain scale-up datasets to the original size. For the sampled and scale-up datasets, we calculated several commonly used network measures, and compared them to those derived from the original data. We found that the network measures (degree, strength and closeness) were rather sensitive to incompleteness. Infection prevalence as an outcome from the applied susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model was fairly robust against incompleteness. At incompleteness levels as high as 90% of the original datasets the prevalence estimation bias was below 5% in scale-up datasets. Consequently, a coverage as low as 10% of the local population of the federal state population was sufficient to maintain the relative bias in prevalence below 10% for a wide range of transmission parameters as encountered in clinical settings. Our findings are reassuring that despite incomplete coverage of the population, German health insurance data can be used to study effects of patient traffic between institutions on the spread of pathogens within healthcare networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dPDd2pL_oQw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The relationship between regional variabilities in airflow (ventilation) and blood flow (perfusion) is a critical determinant of gas exchange efficiency in the lungs. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is understood to be the primary active regulator of ventilation-perfusion matching, where upstream arterioles constrict to direct blood flow away from areas that have low oxygen supply. However, it is not understood how the integrated action of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction affects oxygen transport at the system level. In this study we develop, and make functional predictions with a multi-scale multi-physics model of ventilation-perfusion matching governed by the mechanism of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Our model consists of (a) morphometrically realistic 2D pulmonary vascular networks to the level of large arterioles and venules; (b) a tileable lumped-parameter model of vascular fluid and wall mechanics that accounts for the influence of alveolar pressure; (c) oxygen transport accounting for oxygen bound to hemoglobin and dissolved in plasma; and (d) a novel empirical model of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Our model simulations predict that under the artificial test condition of a uniform ventilation distribution (1) hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction matches perfusion to ventilation; (2) hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction homogenizes regional alveolar-capillary oxygen flux; and (3) hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction increases whole-lobe oxygen uptake by improving ventilation-perfusion matching.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zk2hOAYLl-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted our vulnerability to novel infections.
Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission—successfully reducing the reproductive number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial further outbreak. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and may be sufficient to stem the epidemic if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iLQxZVEzKNg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Understanding brain operation demands linking basic behavioral traits to cell-type specific dynamics of different brain-wide subcircuits. This requires a system to classify the basic operational modes of neurons and circuits. Single-cell phenotyping of firing behavior during ongoing oscillations in vivo has provided a large body of evidence on entorhinal–hippocampal function, but data are dispersed and diverse. Here, we mined literature to search for information regarding the phase-timing dynamics of over 100 hippocampal/entorhinal neuron types defined in Hippocampome.org. We identified missing and unresolved pieces of knowledge (e.g., the preferred theta phase for a specific neuron type) and complemented the dataset with our own new data. By confronting the effect of brain state and recording methods, we highlight the equivalences and differences across conditions and offer a number of novel observations. We show how a heuristic approach based on oscillatory features of morphologically identified neurons can aid in classifying extracellular recordings of single cells and discuss future opportunities and challenges towards integrating single-cell phenotypes with circuit function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6XJULtpQ37M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (L6 CThNs) in primary somatosensory cortex of the rodent are morphologically diverse. This study shows that one class of L6 CThNs receives more widespread presynaptic inputs than the other and projects to different regions of the thalamic reticular nucleus, suggesting that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in somatosensory cortex.







Abstract
Although corticothalamic neurons (CThNs) represent the largest source of synaptic input to thalamic neurons, their role in regulating thalamocortical interactions remains incompletely understood. CThNs in sensory cortex have historically been divided into two types, those with cell bodies in Layer 6 (L6) that project back to primary sensory thalamic nuclei and those with cell bodies in Layer 5 (L5) that project to higher‐order thalamic nuclei and subcortical structures. Recently, diversity among L6 CThNs has increasingly been appreciated. In the rodent somatosensory cortex, two major classes of L6 CThNs have been identified: one projecting to the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM‐only L6 CThNs) and one projecting to both VPM and the posterior medial nucleus (VPM/POm L6 CThNs). Using rabies‐based tracing methods in mice, we asked whether these L6 CThN populations integrate similar synaptic inputs. We found that both types of L6 CThNs received local input from somatosensory cortex and thalamic input from VPM and POm. However, VPM/POm L6 CThNs received significantly more input from a number of additional cortical areas, higher order thalamic nuclei, and subcortical structures. We also found that the two types of L6 CThNs target different functional regions within the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Together, our results indicate that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in the somatosensory cortex and suggest that VPM‐only L6 CThNs regulate, via their more restricted circuits, sensory responses related to a cortical column while VPM/POm L6 CThNs, which are integrated into more widespread POm‐related circuits, relay contextual information.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cancer and cancer pain processes a major clinical challenge and the underlined mechanisms of pathogenesis remain elusive. We examined the specific changes in the transcriptomic profiles in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of rats with bone cancer and bone cancer pain (BCP) using RNA sequencing technology. The bone cancer and BCP was induced by tumor cells implantation (TCI) into the tibia bone cavity in adult female rats. One week after treatment, TCI caused up- and down-regulation of thousands of genes in DRG. These genes were mainly involved in the immune process, inflammatory response, and intracellular signaling transduction of carbohydrate and cytokine. The cAMP and calcium signaling pathways were the major processes in the initial responses. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis further showed that the genes for ion channels increased during day 1-7, while the genes for cytokine signaling pathways sustainedly increased during day 7-14 after TCI. The time courses of gene expression for ion channels and cytokines support their distinct roles in the early induction and late maintenance of BCP development. In addition, among the top 500 up- and down-regulated genes, 80-90% were unique for bone cancer pain as well as neuropathic and inflammatory pain, while less than 2% were shared among the three different forms of pain. This study reveals the uniqueness of mechanisms underlying bone cancer with pain, which is, to a large extent, differently from pain after acute inflammatory and nerve injury and provides novel potential targets of DEGs for bone cancer with pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The brain is the central nervous system that governs human activities. However, in modern society, more and more diseases threaten the health of the brain and nerves and spinal cord, making the human brain unable to conduct normal information interaction with the outside world. The rehabilitation training of the brain-computer interface can promote the nerve repair of the sensorimotor cortex in patients with brain diseases. Therefore, the research of brain-computer interface for motor imaging is of great significance for patients with brain diseases to restore motor function. Due to the characteristics of non-stationary, nonlinear, and individual differences of EEG signals, there are still many difficulties in the analysis and classification of EEG signals at this stage. In this study, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model was used to classify motor-imaging EEG signals, identify the user’s intention, and control external devices. Considering that single-modal features cannot represent the core information, this study uses a fusion feature that combines temporal and spatial features as the final feature data. The fusion features are input to the trained ELM classifier, and the final classification result is obtained. Two sets of BCI competition data in the BCI competition public database are used to verify the validity of the model. The experimental results show that the ELM model has achieved a classification accuracy of 0.7832 in the classification task of Data Sets IIb, which is higher than other comparison algorithms, and shows universal applicability among different subjects. In addition, the average recognition rate of this model in the Data Sets IIIa classification task reaches 0.8347, which has obvious advantages compared with the comparative classification algorithm. The classification effect is smaller than the classification effect obtained by the champion algorithm of the same project, which has certain reference value.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited neurodegenerative conditions that share a characteristic feature of degeneration of the longest axons within the corticospinal tract, which leads to progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. Mutations of over 70 genes produce defects in various biological pathways: axonal transport, lipid metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shaping, mitochondrial function, and endosomal trafficking. HSPs suffer from an adequate therapeutic plan. Currently the treatments foreseen for patients affected by this pathology are physiotherapy, to maintain the outgoing tone, and muscle relaxant therapies for spasticity. Very few clinical studies have been conducted, and it’s urgent to implement preclinical animal studies devoted to pharmacological test and screening, to expand the rose of compounds potentially attractive for clinical trials. Small animal models, such as Drosophila melanogaster and zebrafish, have been generated, analyzed, and used as preclinical model for screening of compounds and their effects. In this work, we briefly described the role of HSP-linked proteins in the organization of ER endomembrane system and in the regulation of ER homeostasis and stress as a common pathological mechanism for these HSP forms. We then focused our attention on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features of some recently identified molecules with antioxidant property, such as salubrinal, guanabenz, N-acetyl cysteine, methylene blue, rapamycin, and naringenin, and on their potential use in future clinical studies. Expanding the models and the pharmacological screening for HSP disease is necessary to give an opportunity to patients and clinicians to test new molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Connectivity within the human connectome occurs between multiple neuronal systems—at small to very large spatial scales. Independent component analysis (ICA) is potentially a powerful tool to facilitate multi-scale analyses. However, ICA has yet to be fully evaluated at very low (10 or fewer) and ultra-high dimensionalities (200 or greater). The current investigation used data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to determine the following: (1) if larger networks, or meta-networks, are present at low dimensionality, (2) if nuisance sources increase with dimensionality, and (3) if ICA is prone to overfitting. Using bootstrap ICA, results suggested that, at very low dimensionality, ICA spatial maps consisted of Visual/Attention and Default/Control meta-networks. At fewer than 10 components, well-known networks such as the Somatomotor Network were absent from results. At high dimensionality, nuisance sources were present even in denoised high-quality data but were identifiable by correlation with tissue probability maps. Artifactual overfitting occurred to a minor degree at high dimensionalities. Basic summary statistics on spatial maps (maximum cluster size, maximum component weight, and average weight outside of maximum cluster) quickly and easily separated artifacts from gray matter sources. Lastly, by using weighted averages of bootstrap stability, even ultra-high dimensional ICA resulted in highly reproducible spatial maps. These results demonstrate how ICA can be applied in multi-scale analyses, reliably and accurately reproducing the hierarchy of meta-networks, large-scale networks, and subnetworks, thereby characterizing cortical connectivity across multiple spatial scales.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Complex natural tasks likely recruit many different functional brain networks, but it is difficult to predict how such tasks will be represented across cortical areas and networks. Previous electrophysiology studies suggest that task variables are represented in a low-dimensional subspace within the activity space of neural populations. Here we develop a voxel-based state space modeling method for recovering task-related state spaces from human fMRI data. We apply this method to data acquired in a controlled visual attention task and a video game task. We find that each task induces distinct brain states that can be embedded in a low-dimensional state space that reflects task parameters, and that attention increases state separation in the task-related subspace. Our results demonstrate that the state space framework offers a powerful approach for modeling human brain activity elicited by complex natural tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Biological neurons can be modeled with different levels of biophysical/biochemical details. The accuracy with which a model reflects the actual physiological processes and ultimately the information function of a neuron, can range from very detailed to a schematic phenomenological representation. This range exists due to the common problem: one needs to find an optimal trade-off between the level of details needed to capture the necessary information processing in a neuron and the computational load needed to compute 1 s of model time. An increase in modeled network size or model-time, for which the solution should be obtained, makes this trade-off pivotal in model development. Numerical simulations become incredibly challenging when an extensive network with a detailed representation of each neuron needs to be modeled over a long time interval to study slow evolving processes, e.g., development of the thalamocortical circuits. Here we suggest a simple, powerful and flexible approach in which we approximate the right-hand sides of differential equations by combinations of functions from three families: Polynomial, piecewise-Linear, Step (PLS). To obtain a single coherent framework, we provide four core principles in which PLS functions should be combined. We show the rationale behind each of the core principles. Two examples illustrate how to build a conductance-based or phenomenological model using the PLS-framework. We use the first example as a benchmark on three different computational platforms: CPU, GPU, and mobile system-on-chip devices. We show that the PLS-framework speeds up computations without increasing the memory footprint and maintains high model fidelity comparable to the fully-computed model or with lookup-table approximation. We are convinced that the full range of neuron models: from biophysical to phenomenological and even to abstract models, may benefit from using the PLS-framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The activity of the left and right central pattern generators (CPGs) is efficiently coordinated during locomotion. To achieve this coordination, the interplay between the CPG controlling one leg and that controlling another must be present. Previous findings in aquatic vertebrates and mammalians suggest that the alternate activation of the left and right CPGs is mediated by the commissural interneurons crossing the midline of the spinal cord. Especially, V0 commissural interneurons mediate crossed inhibition during the alternative activity of the left and right CPGs. Even in humans, phase-dependent modulation of the crossed afferent inhibition during gait has been reported. Based on those previous findings, crossed inhibition of the CPG in one leg side caused by the activation of the contralateral CPG is a possible mechanism underlying the coordination of the anti-phase rhythmic movement of the legs. It has been hypothesized that the activity of the flexor half center in the CPG inhibits the contralateral flexor half center, but crossed inhibition of the extensor half center is not present because of the existence of the double limb support during gait. Nevertheless, previous findings on the phase-dependent crossed inhibition during anti-phase bilateral movement of the legs are not in line with this hypothesis. For example, extensor activity caused crossed inhibition of the flexor half center during bilateral cycling of the legs. In another study, the ankle extensor was inhibited at the period switching from extension to flexion during anti-phase rhythmic movement of the ankles. In this review article, I provide a critical discussion about crossed inhibition mediating the coordination of the anti-phase bilateral rhythmic movement of the legs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Several previous studies have reported atypicality in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet the relatively small effect sizes prevent us from using these characteristics for diagnostic purposes. Here, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and hierarchical clustering were used to partition the high-functioning ASD group (i.e., the ASD discovery group) into subgroups. A support vector machine (SVM) model was trained through the 10-fold strategy to predict Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scores within the ASD discovery group (r = 0.30, P &amp;lt; 0.001, n = 260), which was further validated in an independent sample (i.e., the ASD validation group) (r = 0.35, P = 0.031, n = 29). The neuroimage-based partition derived two subgroups representing severe versus mild autistic patients. We identified FCs that show graded changes in strength from ASD-severe, through ASD-mild, to controls, while the same pattern cannot be observed in partitions based on ADOS score. We also identified FCs that are specific for ASD-mild, similar to a partition based on ADOS score. The current study provided multiple pieces of evidence with replication to show that resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) FCs could serve as neural biomarkers in partitioning high-functioning autistic individuals based on their symptom severity and showing advantages over traditional partition based on ADOS score. Our results also indicate a compensatory role for a frontocortical network in patients with mild ASD, indicating potential targets for future clinical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Kinarm Standard Tests (KSTs) is a suite of upper limb tasks to assess sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, which produces granular performance data that reflect spatial and temporal aspects of behavior (&amp;gt;100 variables per individual). We have previously used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data using the Kinarm End-Point Lab (EP). Here, we performed PCA using data from the Kinarm Exoskeleton Lab (EXO), and determined agreement of PCA results across EP and EXO platforms in healthy participants. We additionally examined whether further dimensionality reduction was possible by using PCA across behavioral tasks.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Healthy participants were assessed using the Kinarm EXO (N = 469) and EP (N = 170–200). Four behavioral tasks (six assessments in total) were performed that quantified arm sensory and motor function, including position sense [Arm Position Matching (APM)] and three motor tasks [Visually Guided Reaching (VGR), Object Hit (OH), and Object Hit and Avoid (OHA)]. The number of components to include per task was determined from scree plots and parallel analysis, and rotation type (orthogonal vs. oblique) was decided on a per-task basis. To assess agreement, we compared principal components (PCs) across platforms using distance correlation. We additionally considered inter-task interactions in EXO data by performing PCA across all six behavioral assessments.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;By applying PCA on a per task basis to data collected using the EXO, the number of behavioral parameters were substantially reduced by 58–75% while accounting for 76–87% of the variance. These results compared well to the EP analysis, and we found good-to-excellent agreement values (0.75–0.99) between PCs from the EXO and those from the EP. Finally, we were able to reduce the dimensionality of the EXO data across tasks down to 16 components out of a total of 76 behavioral parameters, which represents a reduction of 79% while accounting for 73% of the total variance.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;PCA of Kinarm robotic assessment appears to capture similar relationships between kinematic features in healthy individuals and is agnostic to the robotic platform used for collection. Further work is needed to investigate the use of PCA-based data reduction for the characterization of neurological deficits in clinical populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Validated self-report measures of post-stroke fatigue are lacking. The Dutch Multifactor Fatigue Scale (DMFS) was translated into Danish, and response process evidence of validity was evaluated. DMFS consists of 38 Likert-rated items distributed on five subscales: Impact of fatigue (11 items), Signs and direct consequences of fatigue (9), Mental fatigue (7), Physical fatigue (6), and Coping with fatigue (5). Response processes to DMFS were investigated using a Three-Step Test-Interview (TSTI) protocol, and data were analyzed using Framework Analysis. Response processes were indexed on the following categories: (i) “congruent,” response processes were related to the subscale construct; (ii) “incongruent,” response processes were not related to the subscale construct; (iii) “ambiguous,” response processes were both congruent and incongruent or insufficient to evaluate congruency; and (iv) “confused,” participants did not understand the item. Nine adults were recruited consecutively 10–34 months post-stroke (median = 26.5) at an outpatient brain injury rehabilitation center in 2019 [five females, mean age = 55 years (SD = 6.3)]. Problematic items were defined as &amp;lt;50% of response processes being congruent with the intended construct. Of the 38 items, five problematic items were identified, including four items of Physical fatigue and one of Mental fatigue. In addition, seven items posed various response difficulties to some participants due to syntactic complexity, vague terms, a presupposition, and a double-barrelled statement. In conclusion, findings elucidate the interpretative processes involved in responding to DMFS post-stroke, strengthen the evidence base of validity, and guide revisions to mitigate potential problems in item performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Similarities in morphology, physiological function, and neurophysiological findings between median and ulnar nerves are not unequivocal. Our previous study confirmed differences in motor fiber parameters between these nerves in healthy persons. We made an attempt to assess and compare the physiological parameters of different sensation modalities (temperature, pain, and vibration) in median and ulnar nerves.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study was performed in 31 healthy, right-handed volunteers: 17 women, 14 men, mean age 44.8 ± 15.5 years. Standard sensory conduction tests in the median and ulnar nerves were performed together with the estimation of vibratory, temperature, and warm- and cold-induced pain thresholds in the C7 and C8 dermatomes on the palm, using quantitative sensory testing.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were no statistically significant differences in the standard sensory conduction test in the median and ulnar nerves across the whole group: between right and left hands, and between women and men. We revealed differences in the temperature and pain thresholds between these nerves, mainly in low temperature perception. There were no differences in estimated thresholds between sides or in female and male groups. The vibratory limits did not differ significantly between nerves, and subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The study confirmed the differences in the physiological sensory perception between the median and ulnar nerves. The median nerve is more sensitive to temperature stimulation than the ulnar nerve, but simultaneously less sensitive to pain-inducing temperature stimuli. These findings should be considered during the examination of hand nerve pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Glutamate transporters typically remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft. In addition, all glutamate transporters have a chloride channel, which is opened upon glutamate binding to the transporter. There are five types of glutamate transporter (EAATs 1–5, excitatory amino acid transporters), which have distinct chloride conductances. Some EAATs that have low chloride conductances, remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft most effectively (e.g., EAAT1). By contrast, EAATs that have high chloride conductances, remove glutamate less effectively (e.g., EAAT5). We have studied EAAT5 in the retina. In the retina, light activates a chloride current, mediated by the glutamate activation of EAAT5. EAAT5 is not a significant contributor to lateral inhibition in the retina. Instead, it is the main source of autoinhibition to rod bipolar cells (RBCs). EAAT5-mediated inhibition has a substantial effect on synaptic transmission from RBCs to downstream retinal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Rod and cone pathways are segregated in the first stage of the retina: cones synapse with both ON- and OFF-cone bipolar cells while rods contact only rod bipolar cells. However, there is an exception to this specific wiring in that rods also contact certain OFF cone bipolar cells, providing a tertiary rod pathway. Recently, it has been proposed that there is even more crossover between rod and cone pathways. Physiological recordings suggested that rod bipolar cells receive input from cones, and ON cone bipolar cells can receive input from rods, in addition to the established pathways. To image their rod and cone contacts, we have dye-filled individual rod bipolar cells in the rabbit retina. We report that approximately half the rod bipolar cells receive one or two cone contacts. Dye-filling AII amacrine cells, combined with subtractive labeling, revealed most of the ON cone bipolar cells to which they were coupled, including the occasional blue cone bipolar cell, identified by its contacts with blue cones. Imaging the AII-coupled ON cone bipolar dendrites in this way showed that they contact cones exclusively. We conclude that there is some limited cone input to rod bipolar cells, but we could find no evidence for rod contacts with ON cone bipolar cells. The tertiary rod OFF pathway operates via direct contacts between rods and OFF cone bipolar cells. In contrast, our results do not support the presence of a tertiary rod ON pathway in the rabbit retina.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dysfunction in the neurovascular unit (NVU) is a key component in the progressive deterioration of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is critical in vascular dementia. Recent studies have shown that inflammation plays early and perhaps causal roles in the pathogenesis of AD related to NVU damage, possibly in part by overactivating the aspartic acid protease activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which until now has almost solely been studied in the context of the β-amyloid cascade. In this study, we analyzed the relationship of BACE1 with astrocytes and blood vessels in human brains with sporadic and familial dementia [Autosomal dominant cerebral arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD), and familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD)] and how BACE1 inhibition affects astrocytes and endothelial cells under conditions of glutamate toxicity. Our results show increased BACE1, PHF (Paired helical filaments)-tau and GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein) immunoreactivity (IR) in the CA1 hippocampal regions of FAD and SAD brains. Furthermore, BACE1 immunoprecipitated with GFAP in tissue samples from all study cases, but their immunofluorescence close to (10 μm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or overlapping blood vessels was only increased in FAD and SAD brains, and PHF-tau was present around the vessels mainly in FAD brains. Interestingly, the increased BACE1 levels were associated with reactive astrocytes, characterized by morphological changes and upregulation of GFAP under pathological and stressful conditions, and endothelial disruption by glutamate excitotoxicity, and these effects were reversed by BACE1 inhibition; further, BACE1-inhibited astrocytes protected endothelial cell integrity by preserving zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) distribution and decreasing the expression of inflammatory markers. Taken together, these findings suggest that BACE1 dysregulation in astrocytes may have a role in the alterations in NVU integrity implicated in neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve explains why subjects with more years of education, professional achievement, or participation in recreational activities show less cognitive decline with aging. We hypothesize that levels of recreational travel, education, occupation, systemic health, physical performance, and current cognitive activity levels affect the trajectory of cognitive function in older, healthy people in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Healthy, older people (N = 205) were examined and followed-up at 2 years. Participants completed physical and cognitive function assessments: including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and its two subtests Delayed Recall (DR) and Verbal Fluency (VF), and Trail Making Test Part B (TMT B). Factors associated with cognitive functioning were also examined.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The MMSE result significantly decreased over 2 years. No significant decrease in other cognitive tests was noted. However, the trajectory of cognitive tests results varied between individual participants. Percentage of variance of change was explained by the following predictors: 21 in MMSE, 24 in MoCA, 8 in DR, 25 in VF, and 24 in TMT B. Age and the presence of varicose veins were significantly linked to negative changes in MMSE and MoCA scores, while working in a professional occupational status associated with a higher score. The subgroup with varicose veins did worse on the Delayed Recall subtest of MoCA.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve could be extended by proxies of reserve that are related to systemic health and travel activity. The latter is a combination of social, physical, and cognitive activity and potentially might serve as an intervention to improve cognitive function in older people. However, due to the limitations of this study, results should be interpreted with caution and needs to be replicated in the further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly based on medical observations and assessment of clinical signs, including the characterization of a variety of motor symptoms. However, traditional diagnostic approaches may suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are sometimes subtle to human eyes and therefore difficult to classify, leading to possible misclassification. In the meantime, early non-motor symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions. Therefore, these symptoms are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging. To address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes). To provide a comprehensive overview of data modalities and machine learning methods that have been used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD, in this study, we conducted a literature review of studies published until February 14, 2020, using the PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases. A total of 209 studies were included, extracted for relevant information and presented in this review, with an investigation of their aims, sources of data, types of data, machine learning methods and associated outcomes. These studies demonstrate a high potential for adaptation of machine learning methods and novel biomarkers in clinical decision making, leading to increasingly systematic, informed diagnosis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives&lt;p&gt;Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) commonly occurs in older age. However, few studies of a possible link between age-related CAPD and diet in an older population have been conducted. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between eating habits and age-related CAPD in a population &amp;gt;65 years, using cross-sectional and retrospective data obtained in the same population-based study about 12 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We selected 734 participants (403 men) from a large population-based study. For age-related CAPD assessment, we used the Synthetic Sentence Identification with Ipsilateral Competitive Message test. Dietary habits were assessed by a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Associations between age-related CAPD and food groups/macro-and micronutrients were explored using adjusted logistic regression models.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Age-related CAPD subjects consumed more dairy (111 vs. 98 g/d), olives and vegetable oil (63 vs. 52 g/d) and spirits (2 vs.1 g/d), and less fruits (536 vs. 651 g/d) in the cross-sectional analysis. Age-related CAPD subjects had a lower intake of potassium, vitamin C, and a higher fat intake. Further analyses identified dietary fiber as being inversely related to age-related CAPD.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The present study provided evidence that the dietary hypotheses proposed for explaining the development of cognitive disorders in older age might also hold for age-related CAPD. Further data from other large and prospective population-based studies are needed for confirming these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;With the advent of the aging society, how to grow old healthily has become an important issue for the whole of society. Effective intervention strategies for healthy aging are most desired, due to the complexity and diversity of genetic information, it is a pressing concern to find a single drug or treatment to improve longevity. In this study, long-term administration of triterpenoids of Ganoderma lucidum (TGL) can mitigate brain physiological decline in normal aging mice. In addition, the age-associated pathological features, including cataract formation, hair loss, and skin relaxation, brown adipose tissue accumulation, the β-galactosidase staining degree of kidney, the iron death of spleen, and liver functions exhibit improvement. We used the APP/PS1 mice and 3 × Tg-AD mice model of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) to further verify the improvement of brain function by TGL and found that Ganoderic acid A might be the effective constituent of TGL for anti-aging of the brain in the 3 × Tg-AD mice. A potential mechanism of action may involve the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism, prolonging of telomere length, and enhance autophagy, which allows for the removal of pathological metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the leading cause of senile dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide and exerting tremendous socioeconomic burden on all societies. Although definitive diagnosis of AD is often made in the presence of clinical manifestations in late stages, it is now universally believed that AD is a continuum of disease commencing from the preclinical stage with typical neuropathological alterations appearing decades prior to its first symptom, to the prodromal stage with slight symptoms of amnesia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI), and then to the terminal stage with extensive loss of basic cognitive functions, i.e., AD-dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers have been developed in a search to meet the increasing clinical need of early detection and treatment monitoring for AD, with reference to the pathophysiological targets in Alzheimer's brain. These include the pathological aggregations of misfolded proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ) plagues and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), impaired neurotransmitter system, neuroinflammation, as well as deficient synaptic vesicles and glucose utilization. In this article we survey the various PET radiotracers available for AD imaging and discuss their clinical applications especially in terms of early detection and cognitive relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are markers for cerebrovascular pathology, which are frequently seen in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Verbal fluency is often impaired especially in AD, but little research has been conducted concerning the specific effects of WMH on verbal fluency in MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;Our aim was to examine the relationship between WMH and verbal fluency in healthy old age and pathological aging (MCI/AD) using quantified MRI data.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Measures for semantic and phonemic fluency as well as quantified MRI imaging data from a sample of 42 cognitively healthy older adults and 44 patients with MCI/AD (total n = 86) were utilized. Analyses were performed both using the total sample that contained seven left-handed/ambidextrous participants, as well with a sample containing only right-handed participants (n = 79) in order to guard against possible confounding effects regarding language lateralization.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After controlling for age and education and adjusting for multiple correction, WMH in the bilateral frontal and parieto-occipital areas as well as the right temporal area were associated with semantic fluency in cognitively healthy and MCI/AD patients but only in the models containing solely right-handed participants.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that white matter pathology in both frontal and parieto-occipital cerebral areas may have associations with impaired semantic fluency in right-handed older adults. However, elevated levels of WMH do not seem to be associated with cumulative effects on verbal fluency impairment in patients with MCI or AD. Further studies on the subject are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes the tumor suppressor p53 which is functionally inactivated in many human cancers. Numerous studies suggested that 3′UTR-mediated p53 expression regulation plays a role in tumorigenesis and could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. However, these studies did not investigate post-transcriptional regulation of the native &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; gene. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the human and mouse &lt;i&gt;TP53/Trp53&lt;/i&gt; 3′UTRs while preserving endogenous mRNA processing. This revealed that the endogenous 3′UTR is not involved in regulating p53 mRNA or protein expression neither in steady state nor after genotoxic stress. Using reporter assays, we confirmed the previously observed repressive effects of the isolated 3′UTR. However, addition of the &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; coding region to the reporter had a dominant negative impact on expression as its repressive effect was stronger and abrogated the contribution of the 3′UTR. Our data highlight the importance of genetic models in the validation of post-transcriptional gene regulatory effects.</content>

 Animals must balance needs to approach threats for risk-assessment and to avoid danger. The dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) controls defensive behaviors, but it is unknown how it represents states associated with threat approach and avoidance. We identified a dPAG threat-avoidance ensemble in mice that showed higher activity far from threats such as the open arms of the elevated plus maze and a live predator. These cells were also more active during threat-avoidance behaviors such as escape and freezing, even though these behaviors have antagonistic motor output. Conversely, the threat-approach ensemble was more active during risk-assessment behaviors and near threats. Furthermore, unsupervised methods showed that avoidance/approach states were encoded with shared activity patterns across threats. Lastly, the relative number of cells in each ensemble predicted threat-avoidance across mice. Thus, dPAG ensembles dynamically encode threat approach and avoidance states, providing a flexible mechanism to balance risk-assessment and danger avoidance.</content>

 Adult female and male C57BL/6N mice voluntarily consumed either a 10‐day course of antimicrobials or a control (tap water). Results showed that the antimicrobials exerted sex‐specific effects on gut microbiome structure, open field behavior, cued aversive learning, and amygdala dendritic spine density (Figure created in https://biorender.com/).

Abstract
Gut microbiota influence numerous aspects of host biology, including brain structure and function. Growing evidence implicates gut microbiota in aversive conditioning and anxiety‐related behaviors, but research has focused almost exclusively on males. To investigate whether effects of gut dysbiosis on aversive learning and memory differ by sex, adult female and male C57BL/6N mice were orally administered a moderate dose of nonabsorbable antimicrobial medications (ATMs: neomycin, bacitracin, and pimaricin) or a control over 10 days. Changes in gut microbiome composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Open field behavior, cued aversive learning, context recall, and cued recall were assessed. Following behavioral testing, the morphology of basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal neuron dendrites and spines was characterized. Results revealed that ATMs induced gut dysbiosis in both sexes, with stronger effects in females. ATMs also exerted sex‐specific effects on behavior and neuroanatomy. Males were more susceptible than females to microbial modulation of locomotor activity and anxiety‐like behavior. Females were more susceptible than males to ATM‐induced impairments in aversive learning and cued recall. Context recall remained intact, as did dendritic structure of BLA principal neurons. However, ATMs exerted a sex‐specific effect on spine density. A second experiment was conducted to isolate the effects of gut perturbation to cued recall. Extinction was also examined. Results revealed no effect of ATMs on cued recall or extinction, suggesting that gut dysbiosis preferentially impacts aversive learning. These data shed new light on how gut microbiota interact with sex to influence aversive conditioning, open field behavior, and BLA dendritic spine architecture.</content>

 Haverkamp et al. use various cell markers to study the buzzard, pigeon, and marmoset retina. They compare marker expression, cell densities, and the cellular organization of foveae.







Abstract
In the vertebrate retina, amacrine and ganglion cells represent the most diverse cell classes. They can be classified into different cell types by several features, such as morphology, light responses, and gene expression profile. Although birds possess high visual acuity (similar to primates that we used here for comparison) and tetrachromatic color vision, data on the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells of birds are largely missing. In this study, we tested various transcription factors, known to label subpopulations of cells in mammalian retinae, in two avian species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), a raptor with exceptional acuity, and the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), a good navigator and widely used model for visual cognition. Staining for the transcription factors Foxp2, Satb1 and Satb2 labeled most ganglion cells in the avian ganglion cell layer. CtBP2 was established as marker for displaced amacrine cells, which allowed us to reliably distinguish ganglion cells from displaced amacrine cells and assess their densities in buzzard and pigeon. When we additionally compared the temporal and central fovea of the buzzard with the fovea of primates, we found that the cellular organization in the pits was different in primates and raptors. In summary, we demonstrate that the expression of transcription factors is a defining feature of cell types not only in the retina of mammals but also in the retina of birds. The markers, which we have established, may provide useful tools for more detailed studies on the retinal circuitry of these highly visual animals.</content>

Abstract
Attention promotes the selection of behaviorally relevant sensory signals from the barrage of sensory information available. Visual attention modulates the gain of neuronal activity in all visual brain areas examined, although magnitudes of gain modulations vary across areas. For example, attention gain magnitudes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) vary tremendously across fMRI measurements in humans and electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys. We sought to determine whether these discrepancies are due simply to differences in species or measurement, or more nuanced properties unique to each visual brain area. We also explored whether robust and consistent attention effects, comparable to those measured in humans with fMRI, are observable in the LGN or V1 of monkeys. We measured attentional modulation of multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys engaged in a contrast change detection task requiring shifts in covert visual spatial attention. Rigorous analyses of LGN and V1 multiunit activity revealed robust and consistent attentional facilitation throughout V1, with magnitudes comparable to those observed with fMRI. Interestingly, attentional modulation in the LGN was consistently negligible. These findings demonstrate that discrepancies in attention effects are not simply due to species or measurement differences. We also examined whether attention effects correlated with the feature selectivity of recorded multiunits. Distinct relationships suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity depends upon the unique structure and function of visual brain areas.

 We analyzed the expression of the perineuronal nets (PNNs) in mouse and marmoset brain. We found that in both species, its expression is present in many subcortical regions and it is strongly associated with the reproductive circuit. We showed that males show higher level of PNNs than females and in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala (MeApd) the PNN is surrounding cells positive for the estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1). These data suggest a new role pf PNN in controlling innate behavior circuits and sexual dimorphism.






Abstract
Perineuronal nets are extracellular glycoprotein structures that have been found on some neurons in the central nervous system and that have been shown to regulate their structural plasticity. Until now work on perineuronal nets has been focused on their role in cortical structures where they are selectively expressed on parvalbumin‐positive neurons and are reported to restrict the experience‐dependent plasticity of inhibitory afferents. Here we examined the expression of perineuronal nets subcortically, showing that they are expressed in several discrete structures, including nuclei that comprise the brain network controlling reproductive behaviors (e.g. mounting, lordosis, aggression, and social defense). In particular, perineuronal nets were found in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala, the medial preoptic nucleus, the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus and adjacent tuberal nucleus, and the ventral premammillary nucleus in both the mouse and primate brain. Comparison of perineuronal nets in male and female mice revealed a significant sexually dimorphic expression, with expression found prominently on estrogen receptor expressing neurons in the medial amygdala. These findings suggest that perineuronal nets may be involved in regulating neural plasticity in the mammalian reproductive system.

The genome is packed into the cell nucleus in the form of chromatin. Biochemical approaches have revealed that chromatin is packed within domains, which group into larger domains, and so forth. Such hierarchical packing is equally visible in super-resolution microscopy images of large-scale chromatin organization. While previous work has suggested that chromatin is partitioned into distinct domains via microphase separation, it is unclear how these domains organize into this hierarchical packing. A particular challenge is to find an image analysis approach that fully incorporates such hierarchical packing, so that hypothetical governing mechanisms of euchromatin packing can be compared against the results of such an analysis. Here, we obtain 3D STED super-resolution images from pluripotent zebrafish embryos labeled with improved DNA fluorescence stains, and demonstrate how the hierarchical packing of euchromatin in these images can be described as multiplicative cascades. Multiplicative cascades are an established theoretical concept to describe the placement of ever-smaller structures within bigger structures. Importantly, these cascades can generate artificial image data by applying a single rule again and again, and can be fully specified using only four parameters. Here, we show how the typical patterns of euchromatin organization are reflected in the values of these four parameters. Specifically, we can pinpoint the values required to mimic a microphase-separated state of euchromatin. We suggest that the concept of multiplicative cascades can also be applied to images of other types of chromatin. Here, cascade parameters could serve as test quantities to assess whether microphase separation or other theoretical models accurately reproduce the hierarchical packing of chromatin.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jqXxaaW7n1o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The study of unconscious processing requires a measure of conscious awareness. Awareness measures can be either subjective (based on participant’s report) or objective (based on perceptual performance). The preferred awareness measure depends on the theoretical position about consciousness and may influence conclusions about the extent of unconscious processing and about the neural correlates of consciousness. We obtained functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements from 43 subjects while they viewed masked faces and houses that were either subjectively or objectively invisible. Even for objectively invisible (perceptually indiscriminable) stimuli, we found significant category information in both early, lower-level visual areas and in higher-level visual cortex, although representations in anterior, category-selective ventrotemporal areas were less robust. For subjectively invisible stimuli, similar to visible stimuli, there was a clear posterior-to-anterior gradient in visual cortex, with stronger category information in ventrotemporal cortex than in early visual cortex. For objectively invisible stimuli, however, category information remained virtually unchanged from early visual cortex to object- and category-selective visual areas. These results demonstrate that although both objectively and subjectively invisible stimuli are represented in visual cortex, the extent of unconscious information processing is influenced by the measurement approach. Furthermore, our data show that subjective and objective approaches are associated with different neural correlates of consciousness and thus have implications for neural theories of consciousness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vSJuhJb1srA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In an effort to better utilize published evidence obtained from animal experiments, systematic reviews of preclinical studies are increasingly more common—along with the methods and tools to appraise them (e.g., SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation [SYRCLE’s] risk of bias tool). We performed a cross-sectional study of a sample of recent preclinical systematic reviews (2015–2018) and examined a range of epidemiological characteristics and used a 46-item checklist to assess reporting details. We identified 442 reviews published across 43 countries in 23 different disease domains that used 26 animal species. Reporting of key details to ensure transparency and reproducibility was inconsistent across reviews and within article sections. Items were most completely reported in the title, introduction, and results sections of the reviews, while least reported in the methods and discussion sections. Less than half of reviews reported that a risk of bias assessment for internal and external validity was undertaken, and none reported methods for evaluating construct validity. Our results demonstrate that a considerable number of preclinical systematic reviews investigating diverse topics have been conducted; however, their quality of reporting is inconsistent. Our study provides the justification and evidence to inform the development of guidelines for conducting and reporting preclinical systematic reviews.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VYEOpxi7m5U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
In one species of shore crab (Brachyura, Varunidae), a center that supports long‐term visual habituation and that matches the reniform body's morphology has been claimed as a homolog of the insect mushroom body despite lacking traits that define it as such. The discovery in a related species of shore crab of a mushroom body possessing those defining traits renders that interpretation unsound. Two phenotypically distinct, coexisting centers cannot both be homologs of the insect mushroom body. The present commentary outlines the history of research leading to misidentification of the reniform body as a mushroom body. One conclusion is that if both centers support learning and memory, this would be viewed as a novel and fascinating attribute of the pancrustacean brain.</content>

 Objective
To report the identification of antibodies against the glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2‐abs) in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and describe the clinical‐immunological features and antibody effects.


Methods
Two sera from 8 patients with similar rat brain immunostaining were used to precipitate the antigen from neuronal cultures. A cell‐based assay (CBA) with GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells was used to assess 596 patients with different neurological disorders, and 23 healthy controls. GluK2‐ab effects were determined by confocal microscopy in cultured neurons and electrophysiology in GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells.


Results
Patients’ antibodies precipitated GluK2. GluK2 antibody‐specificity was confirmed by CBA, immunoprecipitation, GluK2‐immunoabsorption, and GluK2 knockout brain immunohistochemistry. In 2/8 samples, antibodies reacted with additional GluK2 epitopes present in GluK1 or GluK3; in both the reactivity was abrogated after GluK2 immunoabsorption. Six of 8 patients developed acute encephalitis and clinical or MRI features of predominant cerebellar involvement (4 presenting as cerebellitis which in 2 caused obstructive hydrocephalus), and 2 had other syndromes (1 with cerebellar symptoms). One of the samples showed mild reactivity with non‐kainate receptors (AMPAR and NMDAR) leading to identify 6 additional cases with GluK2‐abs among patients with anti‐AMPAR (5/71) or anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (1/73). GluK2‐abs internalized GluK2 in HEK293 cells and neurons; these antibody‐effects were reversible in neurons. A significant reduction of GluK2‐mediated currents was observed in cells treated with patients’ GluK2 serum following the time frame of antibody‐mediated GluK2 internalization.


Interpretation
GluK2‐abs associate with an encephalitis with prominent clinico‐radiological cerebellar involvement. The antibody effects are predominantly mediated by internalization of GluK2.

 &lt;p&gt;The development and function of the central nervous system rely on the microtubule (MT) and actin cytoskeletons and their respective effectors. Although the structural role of the cytoskeleton has long been acknowledged in neuronal morphology and activity, it was recently recognized to play the role of a signaling platform. Following this recognition, research into Microtubule Associated Proteins (MAPs) diversified. Indeed, historically, structural MAPs—including MAP1B, MAP2, Tau, and MAP6 (also known as STOP);—were identified and described as MT-binding and -stabilizing proteins. Extensive data obtained over the last 20 years indicated that these structural MAPs could also contribute to a variety of other molecular roles. Among multi-role MAPs, MAP6 provides a striking example illustrating the diverse molecular and cellular properties of MAPs and showing how their functional versatility contributes to the central nervous system. In this review, in addition to MAP6’s effect on microtubules, we describe its impact on the actin cytoskeleton, on neuroreceptor homeostasis, and its involvement in signaling pathways governing neuron development and maturation. We also discuss its roles in synaptic plasticity, brain connectivity, and cognitive abilities, as well as the potential relationships between the integrated brain functions of MAP6 and its molecular activities. In parallel, the Collapsin Response Mediator Proteins (CRMPs) are presented as examples of how other proteins, not initially identified as MAPs, fall into the broader MAP family. These proteins bind MTs as well as exhibiting molecular and cellular properties very similar to MAP6. Finally, we briefly summarize the multiple similarities between other classical structural MAPs and MAP6 or CRMPs.In summary, this review revisits the molecular properties and the cellular and neuronal roles of the classical MAPs, broadening our definition of what constitutes a MAP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In early development, the environment triggers mnemonic epigenomic programs resulting in memory and learning experiences to confer cognitive phenotypes into adulthood. To uncover how environmental stimulation impacts the epigenome and genome organization, we used the paradigm of environmental enrichment (EE) in young mice constantly receiving novel stimulation. We profiled epigenome and chromatin architecture in whole cortex and sorted neurons by deep-sequencing techniques. Specifically, we studied chromatin accessibility, gene and protein regulation, and 3D genome conformation, combined with predicted enhancer and chromatin interactions. We identified increased chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding including CTCF-mediated insulation, differential occupancy of H3K36me3 and H3K79me2, and changes in transcriptional programs required for neuronal development. EE stimuli led to local genome re-organization by inducing increased contacts between chromosomes 7 and 17 (inter-chromosomal). Our findings support the notion that EE-induced learning and memory processes are directly associated with the epigenome and genome organization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an essential role in nervous system formation and functioning, including metabolism. Present only in humans, the “Val66Met” polymorphism of the BDNF gene (BDNF) is suggested to have a negative influence on the etiology of neurological diseases. However, this polymorphism has only been addressed, at the molecular level, in nonhuman models. Knowledge about Val66- and Met66-variant differences, to date, has been achieved at the protein level using either cell culture or animal models. Thus, the purpose of our study was to analyze the impact of the Val66Met polymorphism on BDNF expression in healthy humans and compare the allele-specific responses to metabolic stress. Muscle biopsies from 13 male recreational athletes (34 ± 9 years, 1.80 ± 0.08 m, 76.4 ± 10.5 kg) were obtained before and immediately following a VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max test. Allele-specific BDNF mRNA concentrations were quantified by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in heterozygous and homozygous subjects. The results indicated that BDNF expression levels were influenced by the genotype according to the presence of the polymorphism. BDNF expression from the Met66-coding alleles, in heterozygotes, was 1.3-fold lower than that from the Val66-coding alleles. Total BDNF mRNA levels in these heterozygotes remained below the whole sample’s mean. A partial dominance was detected for the Val66-coding variant on the Met66-coding’s. BDNF expression levels decreased by an average of 1.8-fold following the VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max test, independent of the individual’s genotype. The results of this study indicate that metabolic stress downregulates BDNF expression but not plasma BDNF concentrations. No correlation between expression level and plasma BDNF concentrations was found.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhage imaging is one of the most common applications of magnetic induction tomography (MIT). Depth and the mass of stroke stimulated (MSS) are the most important issues that need to be solved for this application. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique belonging to the deep brain stimulation (DBS) field, which aims at overcoming human diseases such as depression. TMS coils, namely, circular, figure-8, and H-coils, play an important role in TMS. Among these, H-coils individually focus on the issues of achieving effective stimulation of deep region. MIT and TMS mechanisms are similar. Herein, for the first time, improved TMS coils, including figure-8 and H-coils, are applied as MIT excitation coils to study the possibility of achieving the mass of stroke stimulated and deep detection through MIT. In addition, the configurations of the detection coils are varied to analyze their influence and determine the optimal coils array. Finally, MIT is used to detect haemorrhagic stroke occurring in humans, and the application of deep MIT to the haemorrhagic stroke problem is computationally explored. Results show that among the various coils, the improved H-coils have MSS and depth characteristics that enable the detection of deep strokes through MIT. Although the detecting depth of the figure-8 coil is weaker, its surface signal is good. The deep MIT technique can be applied to haemorrhagic detection, providing a critical base for deeper research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurological disorders dramatically impact patients of any age population, their families, and societies. Pediatrics are among vulnerable age populations who differently experience the devastating consequences of neurological conditions, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), cerebral palsy, concussion, and epilepsy. System-level understanding of these neurological disorders, particularly from the brain networks' dynamic perspective, has led to the significant trend of recent scientific investigations. While a dramatic maturation in the network science application domain is evident, leading to a better understanding of neurological disorders, such rapid utilization for studying pediatric neurological disorders falls behind that of the adult population. Aside from the specific technological needs and constraints in studying neurological disorders in children, the concept of development introduces uncertainty and further complexity topping the existing neurologically driven processes caused by disorders. To unravel these complexities, indebted to the availability of high-dimensional data and computing capabilities, approaches based on machine learning have rapidly emerged a new trend to understand pathways better, accurately diagnose, and better manage the disorders. Deep learning has recently gained an ever-increasing role in the era of health and medical investigations. Thanks to its relatively more minor dependency on feature exploration and engineering, deep learning may overcome the challenges mentioned earlier in studying neurological disorders in children. The current scoping review aims to explore challenges concerning pediatric brain development studies under the constraints of neurological disorders and offer an insight into the potential role of deep learning methodology on such a task with varying and uncertain nature. Along with pinpointing recent advancements, possible research directions are highlighted where deep learning approaches can assist in computationally targeting neurological disorder-related processes and translating them into windows of opportunities for interventions in diagnosis, treatment, and management of neurological disorders in children.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cumulative knowledge of retina development has been instrumental in the generation of retinal organoid systems from pluripotent stem cells; and these three-dimensional organoid models, in turn, have provided unprecedented opportunities for retinal research and translational applications, including the ability to model disease in a human setting and to apply these models to the development and validation of therapeutic drugs. In this review article, we examine how retinal organoids can also contribute to our understanding of retinal developmental mechanisms, how this knowledge can be applied to modeling developmental abnormalities, and highlight some of the avenues that remain to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Low-dose atropine helps to control myopia progression with few side effects. However, the impact of atropine, a non-selective muscarinic Acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antagonist, on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) remains unclear. After immersing the cornea and adjacent conjunctiva of enucleated eyes in 0.05% (approximately 800 μM) atropine solution for 30 min, the atropine concentration reached in the retina was below 2 μM. After direct superfusion of the retina with 1 μM atropine (considering that the clinical application of 0.05% atropine eye drops will be diluted over time due to tear flow for 30 min), no noticeable changes in the morphology of ON and OFF alpha RGCs (αRGCs) were observed. Atropine affected the light-evoked responses of ON and OFF αRGCs in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Direct application of less than 100 μM atropine on the retina did not affect light-evoked responses. The time latency of light-induced responses of ON or OFF αRGCs did not change after the application of 0.05–100 μM atropine for 5 min. However, 50 μM atropine extended the threshold of joint inter-spike interval (ISI) distribution of the RGCs. These results indicated that low-dose atropine (&amp;lt;0.5 μM; equal to 1% atropine topical application) did not interfere with spike frequency, the pattern of synchronized firing between OFF αRGCs, or the threshold of joint ISI distribution of αRGCs. The application of atropine unmasked inhibition to induce ON responses from certain OFF RGCs, possibly via the GABAergic pathway, potentially affecting visual information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a non-coding CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. This mutation generates a toxic CUG RNA that interferes with the RNA processing of target genes in multiple tissues. Despite debilitating neurological impairment, the pathophysiological cascade of molecular and cellular events in the central nervous system (CNS) has been less extensively characterized than the molecular pathogenesis of muscle/cardiac dysfunction. Particularly, the contribution of different cell types to DM1 brain disease is not clearly understood. We first used transcriptomics to compare the impact of expanded CUG RNA on the transcriptome of primary neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes derived from DMSXL mice, a transgenic model of DM1. RNA sequencing revealed more frequent expression and splicing changes in glia than neuronal cells. In particular, primary DMSXL oligodendrocytes showed the highest number of transcripts differentially expressed, while DMSXL astrocytes displayed the most severe splicing dysregulation. Interestingly, the expression and splicing defects of DMSXL glia recreated molecular signatures suggestive of impaired cell differentiation: while DMSXL oligodendrocytes failed to upregulate a subset of genes that are naturally activated during the oligodendroglia differentiation, a significant proportion of missplicing events in DMSXL oligodendrocytes and astrocytes increased the expression of RNA isoforms typical of precursor cell stages. Together these data suggest that expanded CUG RNA in glial cells affects preferentially differentiation-regulated molecular events. This hypothesis was corroborated by gene ontology (GO) analyses, which revealed an enrichment for biological processes and cellular components with critical roles during cell differentiation. Finally, we combined exon ontology with phosphoproteomics and cell imaging to explore the functional impact of CUG-associated spliceopathy on downstream protein metabolism. Changes in phosphorylation, protein isoform expression and intracellular localization in DMSXL astrocytes demonstrate the far-reaching impact of the DM1 repeat expansion on cell metabolism. Our multi-omics approaches provide insight into the mechanisms of CUG RNA toxicity in the CNS with cell type resolution, and support the priority for future research on non-neuronal mechanisms and proteomic changes in DM1 brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;When the non-coding repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene was discovered to be the most frequent cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2011, this gene and its derived protein, C9ORF72, were completely unknown. The mutation appeared to produce both haploinsufficiency and gain-of-function effects in the form of aggregating expanded RNAs and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). An unprecedented effort was then unleashed to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms and the functions of C9ORF72 in order to design therapies. A decade later, while the toxicity of accumulating gain-of-function products has been established and therapeutic strategies are being developed to target it, the contribution of the loss of function starts to appear more clearly. This article reviews the current knowledge about the C9ORF72 protein, how it is affected by the repeat expansion in models and patients, and what could be the contribution of its haploinsufficiency to the disease in light of the most recent findings. We suggest that these elements should be taken into consideration to refine future therapeutic strategies, compensating for the decrease of C9ORF72 or at least preventing a further reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The vertebrate retina, like most other brain regions, undergoes relatively slow alterations in neural signaling in response to gradual changes in physiological conditions (e.g., activity changes to rest), or in response to gradual changes in environmental conditions (e.g., day changes into night). As occurs elsewhere in the brain, the modulatory processes that mediate slow adaptation in the retina are driven by extrinsic signals (e.g., changes in ambient light level) and/or by intrinsic signals such as those of the circadian (24-h) clock in the retina. This review article describes and discusses the extrinsic and intrinsic modulatory processes that enable neural circuits in the retina to optimize their visual performance throughout day and night as the ambient light level changes by ~10 billion-fold. In the first synaptic layer of the retina, cone photoreceptor cells form gap junctions with rods and signal cone-bipolar and horizontal cells (HCs). Distinct extrinsic and intrinsic modulatory processes in this synaptic layer are mediated by long-range feedback of the neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine is released by dopaminergic cells, interneurons whose cell bodies are located in the second synaptic layer of the retina. Distinct actions of dopamine modulate chemical and electrical synapses in day and night. The retinal circadian clock increases dopamine release in the day compared to night, activating high-affinity dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on cones. This clock effect controls electrical synapses between rods and cones so that rod-cone electrical coupling is minimal in the day and robust at night. The increase in rod-cone coupling at night improves the signal-to-noise ratio and the reliability of very dim multi-photon light responses, thereby enhancing detection of large dim objects on moonless nights.Conversely, maintained (30 min) bright illumination in the day compared to maintained darkness releases sufficient dopamine to activate low-affinity dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on cone-bipolar cell dendrites. This non-circadian light/dark adaptive process regulates the function of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on ON-cone-bipolar cell dendrites so that the receptive field (RF) surround of the cells is strong following maintained bright illumination but minimal following maintained darkness. The increase in surround strength in the day following maintained bright illumination enhances the detection of edges and fine spatial details.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the spatial processing center of the brain and structurally is an interface between the three layered paleocortex and six layered neocortex, known as the periarchicortex. Limited studies indicate peculiarities in the formation of the EC such as early emergence of cells in layers (L) II and late deposition of LIII, as well as divergence in the timing of maturation of cell types in the superficial layers. In this study, we examine developmental events in the entorhinal cortex using an understudied model in neuroanatomy and development, the pig and supplement the research with BrdU labeling in the developing mouse EC. We determine the pig serves as an excellent anatomical model for studying human neurogenesis, given its long gestational length, presence of a moderate sized outer subventricular zone and early cessation of neurogenesis during gestation. Immunohistochemistry identified prominent clusters of OLIG2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligoprogenitor-like cells in the superficial layers of the lateral EC (LEC) that are sparser in the medial EC (MEC). These are first detected in the subplate during the early second trimester. MRI analyses reveal an acceleration of EC growth at the end of the second trimester. BrdU labeling of the developing MEC, shows the deeper layers form first and prior to the superficial layers, but the LV/VI emerges in parallel and the LII/III emerges later, but also in parallel. We coin this lamination pattern parallel lamination. The early born Reln&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stellate cells in the superficial layers express the classic LV marker, Bcl11b (Ctip2) and arise from a common progenitor that forms the late deep layer LV neurons. In summary, we characterize the developing EC in a novel animal model and outline in detail the formation of the EC. We further provide insight into how the periarchicortex forms in the brain, which differs remarkably to the inside-out lamination of the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cholinergic system has been shown to be the primary neurotransmitter system which is responsible for the cognitive symptoms associated with dementia; its role in healthy non-demented older adults remains a gap in the literature. Understanding the effects of age-related functional changes on the nicotinic system will address this knowledge gap. As the older adult population grows and hence the importance of understanding cognitive changes that impact functional abilities and everyday life. In this article we examine the benefits of using nicotine as a method for improving cognition in non-demented healthy older adults which may have the potential for slowing neurodegeneration in aging. Furthermore, we discuss how nicotine can play a crucial role in maintaining cognitive abilities throughout normal cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Virtual reality (VR) intervention is an innovative and efficient rehabilitative tool for patients affected by stroke, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological disorders. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of VR intervention on cognition and motor function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seven databases were systematically searched for relevant articles published from inception to April 2020. Randomized controlled trials examining VR intervention in adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia aged &amp;gt;60 years were included. The primary outcome of the study was cognitive function, including overall cognition, global cognition, attention, executive function, memory, and visuospatial ability. The secondary outcome was motor function, consisting of overall motor function, balance, and gait. A subgroup analysis was also performed based on study characteristics to identify the potential factors for heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eleven studies including 359 participants were included for final analysis. Primary analysis showed a significant moderate positive effect size (ES) of VR on overall cognition (g = 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31–0.59; P &amp;lt; 0.001), attention/execution (g = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.26–0.72; P &amp;lt; 0.001), memory (g = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.29–0.85; P &amp;lt; 0.001), and global cognition (g = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.06–0.58; P = 0.02). Secondary analysis showed a significant small positive ES on overall motor function (g = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.05–0.51; P = 0.018). The ES on balance (g = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.06–0.80; P = 0.02) was significant and moderate. The ES on visuospatial ability and gait was not significant. In the subgroup analysis, heterogeneity was detected in type of immersion and population diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: VR intervention is a beneficial non-pharmacological approach to improve cognitive and motor function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, especially in attention/execution, memory, global cognition, and balance. VR intervention does not show superiority on visuospatial ability and gait performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
The hippocampal formation plays established roles in learning, memory, and related cognitive functions. Recent findings also suggest that the hippocampus integrates sensory feedback from self‐generated movements to modulate ongoing motor responses in a changing environment. Such findings support the view of Bland and Oddie (Behavioural Brain Research, 2001, 127, 119–136) that the hippocampus is a site of sensorimotor integration. In further support of this view, we review neurophysiological evidence in developing rats that hippocampal function is built on a sensorimotor foundation and that this foundation is especially evident early in development. Moreover, at those ages when the hippocampus is first establishing functional connectivity with distant sensory and motor structures, that connectivity is preferentially expressed during periods of active (or REM) sleep. These findings reinforce the notion that sleep, as the predominant state of early infancy, provides a critical context for sensorimotor development, including development of the hippocampus and its associated network.</content>

Analyses of gene set differential coexpression may shed light on molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypes and diseases. However, differential coexpression analyses of conceptually similar individual studies are often inconsistent and underpowered to provide definitive results. Researchers can greatly benefit from an open-source application facilitating the aggregation of evidence of differential coexpression across studies and the estimation of more robust common effects. We developed Meta Gene Set Coexpression Analysis (MetaGSCA), an analytical tool to systematically assess differential coexpression of an &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; defined gene set by aggregating evidence across studies to provide a definitive result. In the kernel, a nonparametric approach that accounts for the gene-gene correlation structure is used to test whether the gene set is differentially coexpressed between two comparative conditions, from which a permutation test &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-statistic is computed for each individual study. A meta-analysis is then performed to combine individual study results with one of two options: a random-intercept logistic regression model or the inverse variance method. We demonstrated MetaGSCA in case studies investigating two human diseases and identified pathways highly relevant to each disease across studies. We further applied MetaGSCA in a pan-cancer analysis with hundreds of major cellular pathways in 11 cancer types. The results indicated that a majority of the pathways identified were dysregulated in the pan-cancer scenario, many of which have been previously reported in the cancer literature. Our analysis with randomly generated gene sets showed excellent specificity, indicating that the significant pathways/gene sets identified by MetaGSCA are unlikely false positives. MetaGSCA is a user-friendly tool implemented in both forms of a Web-based application and an R package “MetaGSCA”. It enables comprehensive meta-analyses of gene set differential coexpression data, with an optional module of &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; pathway crosstalk network analysis to identify and visualize pathways having similar coexpression profiles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u-lEGlXyicI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Phosphorylation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can produce changes in structural and dynamical properties and thereby mediate critical biological functions. How phosphorylation effects intrinsically disordered proteins has been studied for an increasing number of IDPs, but a systematic understanding is still lacking. Here, we compare the collapse propensity of four disordered proteins, Ash1, the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase (CTD2’), the cytosolic domain of E-Cadherin, and a fragment of the p130Cas, in unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms using extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We find all proteins to show V-shape changes in their collapse propensity upon multi-site phosphorylation according to their initial net charge: phosphorylation expands neutral or overall negatively charged IDPs and shrinks positively charged IDPs. However, force fields including those tailored towards and commonly used for IDPs overestimate these changes. We find quantitative agreement of MD results with SAXS and NMR data for Ash1 and CTD2’ only when attenuating protein electrostatic interactions by using a higher salt concentration (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. 350 mM), highlighting the overstabilization of salt bridges in current force fields. We show that phosphorylation of IDPs also has a strong impact on the solvation of the protein, a factor that in addition to the actual collapse or expansion of the IDP should be considered when analyzing SAXS data. Compared to the overall mild change in global IDP dimension, the exposure of active sites can change significantly phosphorylation, underlining the large susceptibility of IDP ensembles to regulation through post-translational modifications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7lGq_FhEXJs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Specialised metabolites from microbial sources are well-known for their wide range of biomedical applications, particularly as antibiotics. When mining paired genomic and metabolomic data sets for novel specialised metabolites, establishing links between Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) and metabolites represents a promising way of finding such novel chemistry. However, due to the lack of detailed biosynthetic knowledge for the majority of predicted BGCs, and the large number of possible combinations, this is not a simple task. This problem is becoming ever more pressing with the increased availability of paired omics data sets. Current tools are not effective at identifying valid links automatically, and manual verification is a considerable bottleneck in natural product research. We demonstrate that using multiple link-scoring functions together makes it easier to prioritise true links relative to others. Based on standardising a commonly used score, we introduce a new, more effective score, and introduce a novel score using an Input-Output Kernel Regression approach. Finally, we present NPLinker, a software framework to link genomic and metabolomic data. Results are verified using publicly available data sets that include validated links.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kgeo4jnNTzw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Does rhythmic neural activity merely echo the rhythmic features of the environment, or does it reflect a fundamental computational mechanism of the brain? This debate has generated a series of clever experimental studies attempting to find an answer. Here, we argue that the field has been obstructed by predictions of oscillators that are based more on intuition rather than biophysical models compatible with the observed phenomena. What follows is a series of cautionary examples that serve as reminders to ground our hypotheses in well-developed theories of oscillatory behavior put forth by theoretical study of dynamical systems. Ultimately, our hope is that this exercise will push the field to concern itself less with the vague question of “oscillation or not” and more with specific biophysical models that can be readily tested.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AU6fNvPQe4k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Obesity-related renal lipotoxicity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are prevalent pathologies with complex aetiologies. One hallmark of renal lipotoxicity is the ectopic accumulation of lipid droplets in kidney podocytes and in proximal tubule cells. Renal lipid droplets are observed in human CKD patients and in high-fat diet (HFD) rodent models, but their precise role remains unclear. Here, we establish a HFD model in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; that recapitulates renal lipid droplets and several other aspects of mammalian CKD. Cell type–specific genetic manipulations show that lipid can overflow from adipose tissue and is taken up by renal cells called nephrocytes. A HFD drives nephrocyte lipid uptake via the multiligand receptor Cubilin (Cubn), leading to the ectopic accumulation of lipid droplets. These nephrocyte lipid droplets correlate with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial deficits, as well as with impaired macromolecular endocytosis, a key conserved function of renal cells. Nephrocyte knockdown of diglyceride acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), overexpression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and epistasis tests together reveal that fatty acid flux through the lipid droplet triglyceride compartment protects the ER, mitochondria, and endocytosis of renal cells. Strikingly, boosting nephrocyte expression of the lipid droplet resident enzyme ATGL is sufficient to rescue HFD-induced defects in renal endocytosis. Moreover, endocytic rescue requires a conserved mitochondrial regulator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC1α). This study demonstrates that lipid droplet lipolysis counteracts the harmful effects of a HFD via a mitochondrial pathway that protects renal endocytosis. It also provides a genetic strategy for determining whether lipid droplets in different biological contexts function primarily to release beneficial or to sequester toxic lipids.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/NsTPWN-exQQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented view of cellular diversity of biological systems. However, across the thousands of publications and datasets generated using this technology, we estimate that only a minority (&amp;lt;25%) of studies provide cell-level metadata information containing identified cell types and related findings of the published dataset. Metadata omission hinders reproduction, exploration, validation, and knowledge transfer and is a common problem across journals, data repositories, and publication dates. We encourage investigators, reviewers, journals, and data repositories to improve their standards and ensure proper documentation of these valuable datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YCrBMF-ACq0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 The central complex is an insect brain area controlling spatial orientation. Immunolabeling in 20 species ranging from firebrats to flies shows that the cellular distribution of the dopamine‐synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the central complex is largely conserved but reveals additional novel cell types in flies and water striders.







Abstract
Dopamine acts as a neurohormone and neurotransmitter in the insect nervous system and controls a variety of physiological processes. Dopaminergic neurons also innervate the central complex (CX), a multisensory center of the insect brain involved in sky compass navigation, goal‐directed locomotion and sleep control. To infer a possible influence of evolutionary history and lifestyle on the neurochemical architecture of the CX, we have studied the distribution of neurons immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate‐limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis. Analysis of representatives from 12 insect orders ranging from firebrats to flies revealed high conservation of immunolabeled neurons. One type of TH‐immunoreactive neuron was found in all species studied. The neurons have somata in the pars intercerebralis, arborizations in the lateral accessory lobes, and axonal ramifications in the central body and noduli. In all pterygote species, a second type of tangential neuron of the upper division of the central body was TH‐immunoreactive. The neurons have cell bodies near the calyces and arborizations in the superior protocerebrum. Both types of neuron showed species‐specific variations in cell number and in the innervated areas outside and inside the CX. Additional neurons were found in only two taxa: one type of columnar neuron showed TH immunostaining in the water strider Gerris lacustris, but not in other Heteroptera, and a tritocerebral neuron innervating the protocerebral bridge was immunolabeled in Diptera. The data show largely taxon‐specific variations of a common ground pattern of putatively dopaminergic neurons that may be commonly involved in state‐dependent modulation of CX function.</content>

 Objective
The aim was to demonstrate that continuous s.c. infusion of a soluble levodopa (LD)/carbidopa (CD) phosphate prodrug combination effectively delivers stable LD exposure via a minimally invasive and convenient mode and has the potential to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are not well controlled on oral medication.


Methods
Foslevodopa and foscarbidopa were prepared and the equilibrium solubility and chemical stability examined in aqueous media with different values of pH. Solutions of foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (ratios ranging from 4:1 to 20:1) were prepared by dissolving pH‐adjusted lyophilized materials in water and infused s.c. in healthy volunteers for ≤72 hours. Frequent blood samples were collected to measure LD and CD exposure, and safety was monitored throughout the study.


Results
Foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (ABBV‐951) demonstrates high water solubility and excellent chemical stability near physiological pH, enabling continuous s.c. infusion therapy. After s.c. infusion, a stable LD pharmacokinetic (PK) profile was maintained for ≤72 hours, and the infusion was well tolerated.


Interpretation
Preparation of foslevodopa and foscarbidopa enables preclinical and clinical PK, safety, and tolerability studies in support of their advancement for the treatment of PD. In phase 1 clinical trials, foslevodopa/foscarbidopa demonstrates consistent and stable LD plasma exposure, supporting further studies of this treatment as a potentially transformational option for those suffering from PD.

 In 2016, Puelles et al. sought to determine the relationship of avian and mammalian pallial regions using the expression profile of the NR4A2 nuclear orphan receptor, concluding that the lateral avian mesopallium was most like the mammalian claustrum, not layer 2 of the cortex as found by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783). However, we found that the NR4A2 expression patterns were characteristic of an activity‐dependent gene. Looking at different behavioral contexts in the zebra finch, we found induced expression of NR4A2 in regions across the pallium associated with visual, somatosensory, and motor activity, confounding and contradicting previous findings. Accordingly, we do not believe NR4A2 is a suitable gene for assessing homologous brain anatomy without understanding the animal's behavioral state.







Abstract
The genetic profile of vertebrate pallia has long driven debate on homology across distantly related clades. Based on an expression profile of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 in mouse and chicken brains, Puelles et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2016, 524, 665–703) concluded that the avian lateral mesopallium is homologous to the mammalian claustrum, and the medial mesopallium homologous to the insula cortex. They argued that their findings contradict conclusions by Jarvis et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3614–3665) and Chen et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3666–3701) that the hyperpallium densocellare is instead a mesopallium cell population, and by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783) that the avian mesopallium is homologous to mammalian cortical layers 2/3. Here, we find that NR4A2 is an activity‐dependent gene and cannot be used to determine brain organization or species relationships without considering behavioral state. Activity‐dependent NR4A2 expression has been previously demonstrated in the rodent brain, with the highest induction occurring within the claustrum, amygdala, deep and superficial cortical layers, and hippocampus. In the zebra finch, we find that NR4A2 is constitutively expressed in the arcopallium, but induced in parts of the mesopallium, and in sparse cells within the hyperpallium, depending on animal stimulus or behavioral state. Basal and induced NR4A2 expression patterns do not discount the previously named avian hyperpallium densocellare as dorsal mesopallium and conflict with proposed homology between the avian mesopallium and mammalian claustrum/insula at the exclusion of other brain regions. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for behavioral state and neural activity to genetically define brain cell population relationships within and across species.</content>

 Abstract
Episodic memory requires information about objects to be integrated into a spatial framework. Place cells in the hippocampus encode spatial representations of objects that could be generated through signaling from the entorhinal cortex. Projections from lateral (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to the hippocampus terminate in distal and proximal CA1, respectively. We recorded place cells in distal and proximal CA1 as rats explored an environment that contained objects. Place cells in distal CA1 demonstrated higher measures of spatial tuning, stability, and closer proximity of place fields to objects. Furthermore, remapping to object displacement was modulated by place field proximity to objects in distal, but not proximal CA1. Finally, representations of previous object locations were closer to those locations in distal CA1 than proximal CA1. Our data suggest that in cue‐rich environments, LEC inputs to the hippocampus support spatial representations with higher spatial tuning, closer proximity to objects, and greater stability than those receiving inputs from MEC. This is consistent with functional segregation in the entorhinal–hippocampal circuits underlying object‐place memory.</content>

 We have developed a method for the longitudinal intravital observation of changes in peripheral nerve fibers. This method provides a high‐resolution approach for investigating epidermal and dermal nerve terminals as well as nerve plexuses and were extremely stable for at least 28 days. Using the SNI model, we found that the degeneration of the peripheral nerve terminals and plexuses over 2–3 days was aligned closely with the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, we obtained clear images of sprouting in the lateral part of the paw, which may be related to the maintenance of neuropathic pain symptoms.

Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Both degenerating injured nerves and neighboring sprouting nerves can contribute to neuropathic pain. However, the mesoscale changes in cutaneous nerve fibers over time after the loss of the parent nerve has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we followed the changes in nerve fibers longitudinally in the toe tips of mice that had undergone spared nerve injury (SNI). Nav1.8‐tdTomato, Thy1‐GFP and MrgD‐GFP mice were used to observe the small and large cutaneous nerve fibers. We found that peripheral nerve plexuses degenerated within 3 days of nerve injury, and free nerve endings in the epidermis degenerated within 2 days. The timing of degeneration paralleled the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. We also found that some of the Nav1.8‐positive nerve plexuses and free nerve endings in the fifth toe survived, and sprouting occurred mostly from 7 to 28 days. The timing of the sprouting of nerve fibers in the fifth toe paralleled the maintenance phase of mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results support the hypotheses that both injured and intact nerve fibers participate in neuropathic pain, and that, specifically, nerve degeneration is related to the initiation of evoked pain and nerve sprouting is related to the maintenance of evoked pain.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The nervous system uses oscillations to convey information efficiently. Inter-muscular coherence in the 15–35 Hz range is thought to represent common cortical drive to muscles, but is also in the frequency band in which electrical stimulation is applied to restore movement following neurological disease or injury. We wished to determine if, when stimulation is applied at the peak frequency of the coherence spectra it was still possible to determine voluntary effort. Using healthy human subjects we stimulated muscles in the arms and legs, separate experiments, while recording EMG activity from pairs of muscles including the stimulated muscles. Offline coherence analysis was performed. When stimulation is greater than motor threshold, and applied at the peak of the coherence spectra a new peak appears in the spectra, presumably representing a new frequency of oscillation within the nervous system. This does not appear at lower stimulation levels, or with lower frequencies. The nervous system is capable of switching oscillatory frequencies to account for noise in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders show that most of them can be categorized as synaptopathies—or damage of synaptic function and plasticity. Synaptic formation and maintenance are orchestrated by protein complexes that are in turn regulated in space and time during neuronal development allowing synaptic plasticity. However, the exact mechanisms by which these processes are managed remain unknown. Large-scale genomic and proteomic projects led to the discovery of new molecules and their associated variants as disease risk factors. Neuronal glycoprotein M6a, encoded by the GPM6A gene is emerging as one of these molecules. M6a has been involved in neuron development and synapse formation and plasticity, and was also recently proposed as a gene-target in various neuropsychiatric disorders where it could also be used as a biomarker. In this review, we provide an overview of the structure and molecular mechanisms by which glycoprotein M6a participates in synapse formation and maintenance. We also review evidence collected from patients carrying mutations in the GPM6A gene; animal models, and in vitro studies that together emphasize the relevance of M6a, particularly in synapses and in neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To study the dynamic nature of brain activity, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is useful including some temporal dependencies between the corresponding neural activity estimates. Recent studies have shown that the functional connectivity (FC) varies according to time and location which should be incorporated into the model. Modeling this dynamic FC (DFC) requires time-varying measures of spatial region of interest (ROI) sets. To know about the DFC, change-point detection in FC is of particular interest. In this paper, we propose a method of detecting a change-point based on the maximum of eigenvalues via random matrix theory (RMT). From covariance matrices for FC of all ROI's, the temporal change-point of FC is decided by an RMT approach. Simulation results show that our proposed method can detect meaningful FC change-points. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our FC detection approach by applying our method to epilepsy data where change-points detected are explained by the changes in memory capacity. Our study shows the possibility of RMT based approach in DFC change-point problem and in studying the complex dynamic pattern of functional brain interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Perturbations in metabolism results in the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides, which is a pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the rate limiting enzyme responsible for beta-amyloid production. Obesogenic diets increase BACE1 while exercise reduces BACE1 activity, although the mechanisms are unknown. Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is an exercise inducible neurotrophic factor, however, it is unknown if BDNF is related to the effects of exercise on BACE1. The purpose of this study was to determine the direct effect of BDNF on BACE1 activity and to examine neuronal pathways induced by exercise. C57BL/6J male mice were assigned to either a low (n = 36) or high fat diet (n = 36) for 10 weeks. To determine the direct effect of BDNF on BACE1, a subset of mice (low fat diet = 12 and high fat diet n = 12) were used for an explant experiment where the brain tissue was directly treated with BDNF (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. To examine neuronal pathways activated with exercise, mice remained sedentary (n = 12) or underwent an acute bout of treadmill running at 15 m/min with a 5% incline for 120 min (n = 12). The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were collected 2-h post-exercise. Direct treatment with BDNF resulted in reductions in BACE1 activity in the prefrontal cortex (p &amp;lt; 0.05), but not the hippocampus. The high fat diet reduced BDNF content in the hippocampus; however, the acute bout of exercise increased BDNF in the prefrontal cortex (p &amp;lt; 0.05). These novel findings demonstrate the region specific differences in exercise induced BDNF in lean and obese mice and show that BDNF can reduce BACE1 activity, independent of other exercise-induced alterations. This work demonstrates a previously unknown link between BDNF and BACE1 regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a clinical entity, classified as an atypical Parkinsonism, characterized by both motor and higher cortical dysfunctions. The clinical manifestation of CBS is associated with several pathologies, among which corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is the most common. The aim of our study was to elaborate on the possible vascular pathogenesis of CBS and consider types of vascular lesions in these cases. Several cases of vascular CBS are described in the literature. The majority of presented patients were affected by internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and ischemic strokes; few cases were associated with vascular malformations or autoimmune diseases. Vascular CBS is preceded by an abrupt onset. The clinical manifestation does not significantly differ with non-vascular CBS. Patients with vascular CBS are usually elderly; often with coexistent hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus. Inferring from our observations, cerebral hypoperfusion can play a significant role in neuropathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases. To the best of our knowledge paper is the first comprehensive review of vascular CBS and we are positive that our observations show that further research concerning the vascular pathogenesis of tauopathy atypical Parkinsonism is required.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Preeclampsia is emerging as a sex-specific risk factor for cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and dementia, but the reason is unknown. We assessed the relationship of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), a marker of placental SVD, with cognition and cerebral SVD in women with and without preeclampsia. We hypothesized women with both preeclampsia and MVM would perform worst on information processing speed and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Women (n = 45; mean 10.5 years post-delivery; mean age: 41 years; 42.2% Black) were classified as preeclampsia-/MVM-, preeclampsia+/MVM-, or preeclampsia+/MVM+. Information processing speed, executive function, and memory were assessed. In a pilot sub-study of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR; n = 22), cerebral blood flow during room-air breathing and breath-hold induced hypercapnia were obtained via arterial spin labeling MRI. Non-parametric tests and regression models were used to test associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Between-group cognitive differences were significant for information processing speed (p = 0.02); preeclampsia+/MVM+ had the lowest scores. Cerebral blood flow increased from room-air to breath-hold, globally and in all regions in the three groups, except the preeclampsia+/MVM+ parietal region (p = 0.12). Lower parietal CVR (less change from room-air breathing to breath-holding) was correlated with poorer information processing speed (partial ρ = 0.63, p = 0.005) and executive function (ρ = 0.50, p = 0.03) independent of preeclampsia/MVM status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Compared to women without preeclampsia and MVM, midlife women with both preeclampsia and MVM have worse information processing speed and may have blunted parietal CVR, an area important for information processing speed and executive function. MVM in women with preeclampsia is a promising sex-specific indicator of cerebrovascular integrity in midlife.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The diagnostic criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) incorporate two speech-language disturbances (SLDs), non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia and progressive apraxia of speech, but overlook the inclusion of other SLDs, including dynamic aphasia (DA). Thus, there is a need to reappraise the broad spectrum of SLDs in PSP to include other presenting phenotypes. Here we report findings from the study of two elderly patients with PSP presenting with DA and irrepressible echolalia. Both patients had markedly impoverished verbal production, but their performance in other tasks (repetition and naming) and auditory comprehension were preserved or only mildly impaired. Experimental tests of DA revealed impaired word and sentence generation in response to verbal and non-verbal stimuli. Additional language and cognitive testing revealed different types of echolalia (mitigated, automatic, and echoing approval) as well as impaired inhibitory control and social cognition (mentalizing). Both patients had negative neuropsychiatric alterations (i.e., apathy, aspontaneity, and indifference/emotional flatness). Brain magnetic resonance imaging in both patients showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum and superior medial frontal cortex suggestive of PSP, yet further evaluation of the neural correlates using multimodal neuroimaging and neuropathological data was not performed. However, based on the already known neural basis of DA and echolalia in PSP and stroke, we suggest that, in the present cases, neurodegeneration in the midbrain tegmentum, superior medial frontal lobe, and caudate nucleus was responsible for DA and that decreased activity in these regions may play a permissive role for eliciting verbal echoing via disinhibition of the perisylvian speech-language network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Patterns of cancer incidence, viewed over extended time periods, reveal important aspects of multistage carcinogenesis. Here we show how a multistage clonal expansion (MSCE) model for cancer can be harnessed to identify biological processes that shape the surprisingly dynamic and disparate incidence patterns of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the US population. While the dramatic rise in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in the US has been largely attributed to reflux related increases in the prevalence of Barrett’s esophagus (BE), the premalignant field in which most EAC are thought to arise, only scant evidence exists for field cancerization contributing to ESCC. Our analyses of incidence patterns suggest that ESCC is associated with a premalignant field that may develop very early in life. Although the risk of ESCC, which is substantially higher in Blacks than Whites, is generally assumed to be associated with late-childhood and adult exposures to carcinogens, such as from tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and various industrial exposures, the temporal trends we identify for ESCC suggest an onset distribution of field-defects before age 10, most strongly among Blacks. These trends differ significantly in shape and strength from field-defect trends that we estimate for US Whites. Moreover, the rates of ESCC-predisposing field-defects predicted by the model for cohorts of black children are decreasing for more recent birth cohorts (for Blacks born after 1940). These results point to a potential etiologic role of factors acting early in life, perhaps related to nutritional deficiencies, in the development of ESCC and its predisposing field-defect. Such factors may explain some of the striking racial differences seen in ESCC incidence patterns over time in the US.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1yCAqdjtwYU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A wide variety of 1) parametric regression models and 2) co-expression networks have been developed for finding gene-by-gene interactions underlying complex traits from expression data. While both methodological schemes have their own well-known benefits, little is known about their synergistic potential. Our study introduces their methodological fusion that cross-exploits the strengths of individual approaches via a built-in information-sharing mechanism. This fusion is theoretically based on certain trait-conditioned dependency patterns between two genes depending on their role in the underlying parametric model. Resulting trait-specific co-expression network estimation method 1) serves to enhance the interpretation of biological networks in a parametric sense, and 2) exploits the underlying parametric model itself in the estimation process. To also account for the substantial amount of intrinsic noise and collinearities, often entailed by expression data, a tailored co-expression measure is introduced along with this framework to alleviate related computational problems. A remarkable advance over the reference methods in simulated scenarios substantiate the method’s high-efficiency. As proof-of-concept, this synergistic approach is successfully applied in survival analysis, with acute myeloid leukemia data, further highlighting the framework’s versatility and broad practical relevance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8PyA9qV1dkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Motivation &lt;p&gt;Protein structure prediction has been greatly improved by deep learning, but most efforts are devoted to template-free modeling. But very few deep learning methods are developed for TBM (template-based modeling), a popular technique for protein structure prediction. TBM has been studied extensively in the past, but its accuracy is not satisfactory when highly similar templates are not available.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;This paper presents a new method NDThreader (New Deep-learning Threader) to address the challenges of TBM. NDThreader first employs DRNF (deep convolutional residual neural fields), which is an integration of deep ResNet (convolutional residue neural networks) and CRF (conditional random fields), to align a query protein to templates without using any distance information. Then NDThreader uses ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) and DRNF to further improve sequence-template alignments by making use of predicted distance potential. Finally, NDThreader builds 3D models from a sequence-template alignment by feeding it and sequence coevolution information into a deep ResNet to predict inter-atom distance distribution, which is then fed into PyRosetta for 3D model construction. Our experimental results show that NDThreader greatly outperforms existing methods such as CNFpred, HHpred, DeepThreader and CEthreader. NDThreader was blindly tested in CASP14 as a part of RaptorX server, which obtained the best average GDT score among all CASP14 servers on the 58 TBM targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7uRTn7xk6HI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The islets of Langerhans exist as multicellular networks that regulate blood glucose levels. The majority of cells in the islet are excitable, insulin-producing β-cells that are electrically coupled via gap junction channels. β-cells are known to display heterogeneous functionality. However, due to gap junction coupling, β-cells show coordinated [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] oscillations when stimulated with glucose, and global quiescence when unstimulated. Small subpopulations of highly functional β-cells have been suggested to control [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] dynamics across the islet. When these populations were targeted by optogenetic silencing or photoablation, [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] dynamics across the islet were largely disrupted. In this study, we investigated the theoretical basis of these experiments and how small populations can disproportionality control islet [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] dynamics. Using a multicellular islet model, we generated normal, skewed or bimodal distributions of β-cell heterogeneity. We examined how islet [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] dynamics were disrupted when cells were targeted via hyperpolarization or populations were removed; to mimic optogenetic silencing or photoablation, respectively. Targeted cell populations were chosen based on characteristics linked to functional subpopulation, including metabolic rate of glucose oxidation or [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] oscillation frequency. Islets were susceptible to marked suppression of [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] when ~10% of cells with high metabolic activity were hyperpolarized; where hyperpolarizing cells with normal metabolic activity had little effect. However, when highly metabolic cells were removed from the model, [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] oscillations remained. Similarly, when ~10% of cells with either the highest frequency or earliest elevations in [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] were removed from the islet, the [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] oscillation frequency remained largely unchanged. Overall, these results indicate small populations of β-cells with either increased metabolic activity or increased frequency are unable to disproportionately control islet-wide [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] via gap junction coupling. Therefore, we need to reconsider the physiological basis for such small β-cell populations or the mechanism by which they may be acting to control normal islet function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/emRrVcUZvHQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Cognitive brain imaging is accumulating datasets about the neural substrate of many different mental processes. Yet, most studies are based on few subjects and have low statistical power. Analyzing data across studies could bring more statistical power; yet the current brain-imaging analytic framework cannot be used at scale as it requires casting all cognitive tasks in a unified theoretical framework. We introduce a new methodology to analyze brain responses across tasks without a joint model of the psychological processes. The method boosts statistical power in small studies with specific cognitive focus by analyzing them jointly with large studies that probe less focal mental processes. Our approach improves decoding performance for 80% of 35 widely-different functional-imaging studies. It finds commonalities across tasks in a data-driven way, via common brain representations that predict mental processes. These are brain networks tuned to psychological manipulations. They outline interpretable and plausible brain structures. The extracted networks have been made available; they can be readily reused in new neuro-imaging studies. We provide a multi-study decoding tool to adapt to new data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g4xGhNzQqwM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The interior of a eukaryotic cell is a highly complex composite material which consists of water, structural scaffoldings, organelles, and various biomolecular solutes. All these components serve as obstacles that impede the motion of vesicles. Hence, it is hypothesized that any alteration of the cytoskeletal network may directly impact or even disrupt the vesicle transport. A disruption of the vesicle-mediate cell transport is thought to contribute to several severe diseases and disorders, such as diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, emphasizing the clinical relevance. To address the outlined objective, a multiscale finite element model of the diffusive vesicle transport is proposed on the basis of the concept of homogenization, owed to the complexity of the cytoskeletal network. In order to study the microscopic effects of specific nanoscopic actin filament network alterations onto the vesicle transport, a parametrized three-dimensional geometrical model of the actin filament network was generated on the basis of experimentally observed filament densities and network geometries in an adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell. Numerical analyzes of the obtained effective diffusion properties within two-dimensional sampling domains of the whole cell model revealed that the computed homogenized diffusion coefficients can be predicted statistically accurate by a simple two-parameter power law as soon as the inaccessible area fraction, due to the obstacle geometries and the finite size of the vesicles, is known. This relationship, in turn, leads to a massive reduction in computation time and allows to study the impact of a variety of different cytoskeletal alterations onto the vesicle transport. Hence, the numerical simulations predicted a 35% increase in transport time due to a uniformly distributed four-fold increase of the total filament amount. On the other hand, a hypothetically reduced expression of filament cross-linking proteins led to sparser filament networks and, thus, a speed up of the vesicle transport.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GwtP18KnWcw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) can be used to infer a temporal ordering of cellular states. Current methods for the inference of cellular trajectories rely on unbiased dimensionality reduction techniques. However, such biologically agnostic ordering can prove difficult for modeling complex developmental or differentiation processes. The cellular heterogeneity of dynamic biological compartments can result in sparse sampling of key intermediate cell states. To overcome these limitations, we develop a supervised machine learning framework, called Pseudocell Tracer, which infers trajectories in pseudospace rather than in pseudotime. The method uses a supervised encoder, trained with adjacent biological information, to project scRNAseq data into a low-dimensional manifold that maps the transcriptional states a cell can occupy. Then a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to simulate pesudocells at regular intervals along a virtual cell-state axis. We demonstrate the utility of Pseudocell Tracer by modeling B cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) during a prototypic antigen-induced antibody response. Our results revealed an ordering of key transcription factors regulating CSR to the IgG1 isotype, including the concomitant expression of &lt;i&gt;Nfkb1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Stat6&lt;/i&gt; prior to the upregulation of &lt;i&gt;Bach2&lt;/i&gt; expression. Furthermore, the expression dynamics of genes encoding cytokine receptors suggest a poised IL-4 signaling state that preceeds CSR to the IgG1 isotype.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v7gDjRWKf9w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genomic research led the way in open science, a tradition continued by genome-wide association studies (GWAS)—through the sharing of materials, results, and data. Coordinated quality control procedures also contributed to robust findings. However, recent years have seen declines in GWAS transparency. Here, we assess some shifts away from open science practices with the aim of stimulating a discussion of these issues.

New technologies make it possible to measure activity from many neurons simultaneously. One approach is to analyze simultaneously recorded neurons individually, then group together neurons which increase their activity during similar behaviors into an “ensemble.” However, this notion of an ensemble ignores the ability of neurons to act collectively and encode and transmit information in ways that are not reflected by their individual activity levels. We used microendoscopic GCaMP imaging to measure prefrontal activity while mice were either alone or engaged in social interaction. We developed an approach that combines a neural network classifier and surrogate (shuffled) datasets to characterize how neurons synergistically transmit information about social behavior. Notably, unlike optimal linear classifiers, a neural network classifier with a single linear hidden layer can discriminate network states which differ solely in patterns of coactivity, and not in the activity levels of individual neurons. Using this approach, we found that surrogate datasets which preserve behaviorally specific patterns of coactivity (correlations) outperform those which preserve behaviorally driven changes in activity levels but not correlated activity. Thus, social behavior elicits increases in correlated activity that are not explained simply by the activity levels of the underlying neurons, and prefrontal neurons act collectively to transmit information about socialization via these correlations. Notably, this ability of correlated activity to enhance the information transmitted by neuronal ensembles is diminished in mice lacking the autism-associated gene &lt;i&gt;Shank3&lt;/i&gt;. These results show that synergy is an important concept for the coding of social behavior which can be disrupted in disease states, reveal a specific mechanism underlying this synergy (social behavior increases correlated activity within specific ensembles), and outline methods for studying how neurons within an ensemble can work together to encode information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CwNTYJ59YnQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Premature termination codons (PTC) cause over 10% of genetic disease cases. Some aminoglycosides that bind to the ribosome decoding center can induce PTC readthrough and restore low levels of full-length functional proteins. However, concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis limits the extent of PTC readthrough that can be achieved by aminoglycosides like G418. Using a cell-based screen, we identified a small molecule, the phenylpyrazoleanilide Y-320, that potently enhances &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt;, and C&lt;i&gt;OL17A1&lt;/i&gt; PTC readthrough by G418. Unexpectedly, Y-320 increased cellular protein levels and protein synthesis, measured by SYPRO Ruby protein staining and puromycin labeling, as well as ribosome biogenesis measured using antibodies to rRNA and ribosomal protein S6. Y-320 did not increase the rate of translation elongation and it exerted its effects independently of mTOR signaling. At the single cell level, exposure to Y-320 and G418 increased ribosome content and protein synthesis which correlated strongly with PTC readthrough. As a single agent, Y-320 did not affect translation fidelity measured using a luciferase reporter gene but it enhanced misincorporation by G418. RNA-seq data showed that Y-320 up-regulated the expression of CXC chemokines CXCL10, CXCL8, CXCL2, CXCL11, CXCL3, CXCL1, and CXCL16. Several of these chemokines exert their cellular effects through the receptor CXCR2 and the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 reduced cellular protein levels and PTC readthrough in cells exposed to Y-320 and G418. These data show that the self-limiting nature of PTC readthrough by G418 can be compensated by Y-320, a potent enhancer of PTC readthrough that increases ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. They also support a model whereby increased PTC readthrough is enabled by increased protein synthesis mediated by an autocrine chemokine signaling pathway. The findings also raise the possibility that inflammatory processes affect cellular propensity to readthrough agents and that immunomodulatory drugs like Y-320 might find application in PTC readthrough therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gUGm93WnZCs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Objectives
Brain‐injured patients who are unresponsive at the bedside (i.e., vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome – VS/UWS) may present brain activity similar to patients in minimally conscious state (MCS). This peculiar condition has been termed “non‐behavioural MCS” or “MCS*”. In the present study we aimed to investigate the proportion and underlying brain characteristics of patients in MCS*.


Methods
Brain 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG‐PET) was acquired on 135 brain‐injured patients diagnosed in prolonged VS/UWS (n = 48) or MCS (n = 87). From an existing database, relative metabolic preservation in the fronto‐parietal network (measured with standardized uptake value) was visually inspected by 3 experts. Patients with hypometabolism of the fronto‐parietal network were labelled “VS/UWS”, while its (partial) preservation either confirmed the behavioural diagnosis of “MCS” or, in absence of behavioural signs of consciousness, suggested a diagnosis of “MCS*”. Clinical outcome at 1‐year follow‐up, functional connectivity, grey matter atrophy, and regional brain metabolic patterns were investigated in the three groups (VS/UWS, MCS* and MCS).


Results
67% of behavioural VS/UWS presented a partial preservation of brain metabolism (i.e., MCS*). Compared to VS/UWS patients, MCS* patients demonstrated a better outcome, global functional connectivity and grey matter preservation more compatible with the diagnosis of MCS. MCS* patients presented lower brain metabolism mostly in the posterior regions compared to MCS patients.


Interpretation
MCS* is a frequent phenomenon that is associated with better outcome and better brain preservation than the diagnosis of VS/UWS. Complementary exams should be provided to all unresponsive patients before taking medical decisions.

 Objective
The aim of this study was to search for genes/variants that modify the effect of LRRK2 mutations in terms of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease.


Methods
We performed the first genome‐wide association study of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease in LRRK2 mutation carriers (776 cases and 1,103 non‐cases at their last evaluation). Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models were used to identify modifiers of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of LRRK2 mutations, respectively. We also investigated whether a polygenic risk score derived from a published genome‐wide association study of Parkinson's disease was able to explain variability in penetrance and age‐at‐onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers.


Results
A variant located in the intronic region of CORO1C on chromosome 12 (rs77395454; P‐value = 2.5E‐08, beta = 1.27, SE = 0.23, risk allele: C) met genome‐wide significance for the penetrance model. Co‐immunoprecipitation analyses of LRRK2 and CORO1C supported an interaction between these two proteins. A region on chromosome 3, within a previously reported linkage peak for Parkinson's disease susceptibility, showed suggestive associations in both models (penetrance top variant: P‐value = 1.1E‐07; age‐at‐onset top variant: P‐value = 9.3E‐07). A polygenic risk score derived from publicly available Parkinson's disease summary statistics was a significant predictor of penetrance, but not of age‐at‐onset.


Interpretation
This study suggests that variants within or near CORO1C may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, common Parkinson's disease associated variants collectively increase the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations.

 &lt;p&gt;Eating behavior is not only influenced by the current energy balance, but also by the behavioral characteristics of eating. One of the recognized eating behavior constructs is ‘disinhibited eating,’ which refers to the tendency to overeat in response to negative emotional states or the presence of highly palatable foods. Food-related disinhibition is involved in binge eating, weight gain, and obesity and is also associated with the trait of impulsivity, which in turn, is linked to weight gain or maladaptive eating. However, the relationships among food-related disinhibition, the trait of impulsivity, and the neural substrates of eating behaviors in adolescence remain unclear. Therefore, we designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to examine the associations between brain responses to palatable liquid consumption and disinhibited eating behavior or impulsivity in healthy adolescents. Thirty-four adolescents (mean age ± standard deviation = 17.12 ± 1.91 years, age range = 14–19 years, boys = 15, girls = 19) participated in this study. Disinhibited eating was assessed with the disinhibition subscale of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, while impulsivity was assessed using the Barratt impulsiveness scale. Participants received two fMRI sessions−a palatable liquid consumption fMRI and a resting-state fMRI. The fMRI experiment showed that increased disinhibited eating was positively associated with a greater insular response to palatable liquid consumption, while increased impulsivity was positively correlated with a greater amygdala response. The resting-state fMRI experiment showed that increased disinhibited eating was positively correlated with strengthened intrinsic functional connectivity between the insula and the amygdala, adjusting for sex (estimates of the beta coefficients = 0.146, standard error = 0.068, p = 0.040). Given that the amygdala and insular cortex are structurally and functionally connected and involved in trait impulsivity and ingestive behavior, our findings suggest that increased disinhibited eating would be associated with impulsivity via strengthened intrinsic functional connectivity between the insula and amygdala and linked to maladaptive eating.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to the phenomenon that a person is slower to respond to targets at a previously cued location. The present study aimed to explore whether target-reward association is subject to IOR, using event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the underlying neural mechanism. Each participant performed a localization task and a color discrimination task in an exogenous cueing paradigm, with the targets presented in colors (green/red) previously associated with high- or low-reward probability. The results of both tasks revealed that the N1, Nd, and P3 components exhibited differential amplitudes between cued and uncued trials (i.e., IOR) under low reward, with the N1 and Nd amplitudes being enhanced for uncued trials compared to cued trials, and the P3 amplitude being enhanced for cued trials vs. uncued trials. Under high reward, however, no difference was found between the amplitudes on cued and uncued trials for any of the components. These findings demonstrate that targets that were previously associated with high reward can be resistant to IOR and the current results enrich the evidence for interactions between reward-association and attentional orientation in the cueing paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The collective electrophysiological dynamics of the brain as a result of sleep-related biological drives in Drosophila are investigated in this paper. Based on the Huber-Braun thermoreceptor model, the conductance-based neurons model is extended to a coupled neural network to analyze the local field potential (LFP). The LFP is calculated by using two different metrics: the mean value and the distance-dependent LFP. The distribution of neurons around the electrodes is assumed to have a circular or grid distribution on a two-dimensional plane. Regardless of which method is used, qualitatively similar results are obtained that are roughly consistent with the experimental data. During wake, the LFP has an irregular or a regular spike. However, the LFP becomes regular bursting during sleep. To further analyze the results, wavelet analysis and raster plots are used to examine how the LFP frequencies changed. The synchronization of neurons under different network structures is also studied. The results demonstrate that there are obvious oscillations at approximately 8 Hz during sleep that are absent during wake. Different time series of the LFP can be obtained under different network structures and the density of the network will also affect the magnitude of the potential. As the number of coupled neurons increases, the neural network becomes easier to synchronize, but the sleep and wake time described by the LFP spectrogram do not change. Moreover, the parameters that affect the durations of sleep and wake are analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective
To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF) as markers of future phenoconversion to multiple system atrophy (MSA).


Methods
Well‐characterized patients with PAF (n = 32) were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2019 at Mayo Clinic Rochester and followed prospectively with annual visits to determine future phenoconversion to MSA, Parkinson's disease (PD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). ELISA was utilized to measure NfL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF collected at baseline.


Results
Patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years. Five patients converted to MSA, 2 to PD, and 2 to DLB. NfL at baseline was elevated only in patients who later developed MSA, perfectly separating those from future PD and DLB converters as well as non‐converters. ASyn‐PMCA was positive in all but two cases (94%). The PMCA reaction was markedly different in five samples with maximum fluorescence and reaction kinetics previously described in MSA patients; all of these patients later developed MSA.


Interpretation
αSyn‐PMCA is almost invariably positive in the CSF of patients with PAF establishing this condition as α‐synucleinopathy. Both NfL and the magnitude and reaction kinetics of αSyn PMCA faithfully predict which PAF patients will eventually phenoconvert to MSA. This finding has important implications not only for prognostication, but also for future trials of disease modifying therapies, allowing for differentiation of MSA from Lewy body synucleinopathies before motor symptoms develop.

Cortical networks show a large heterogeneity of neuronal properties. However, traditional coding models have focused on homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Here, we analytically derive a class of recurrent networks of spiking neurons that close to optimally track a continuously varying input online, based on two assumptions: 1) every spike is decoded linearly and 2) the network aims to reduce the mean-squared error between the input and the estimate. From this we derive a class of predictive coding networks, that unifies encoding and decoding and in which we can investigate the difference between homogeneous networks and heterogeneous networks, in which each neurons represents different features and has different spike-generating properties. We find that in this framework, ‘type 1’ and ‘type 2’ neurons arise naturally and networks consisting of a heterogeneous population of different neuron types are both more efficient and more robust against correlated noise. We make two experimental predictions: 1) we predict that integrators show strong correlations with other integrators and resonators are correlated with resonators, whereas the correlations are much weaker between neurons with different coding properties and 2) that ‘type 2’ neurons are more coherent with the overall network activity than ‘type 1’ neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6BuYyKmf5kI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate the gut microbiome in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and how it relates to clinical disease.


Methods
We sequenced the microbiota from healthy controls and relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS patients and correlated the levels of bacteria with clinical features of disease, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), quality of life, and brain magnetic resonance imaging lesions/atrophy. We colonized mice with MS‐derived Akkermansia and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).


Results
Microbiota β‐diversity differed between MS patients and controls but did not differ between RRMS and progressive MS or differ based on disease‐modifying therapies. Disease status had the greatest effect on the microbiome β‐diversity, followed by body mass index, race, and sex. In both progressive MS and RRMS, we found increased Clostridium bolteae, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, and Akkermansia and decreased Blautia wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, and Erysipelotrichaceae CCMM. Unique to progressive MS, we found elevated Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium g24 FCEY and decreased Blautia and Agathobaculum. Several Clostridium species were associated with higher EDSS and fatigue scores. Contrary to the view that elevated Akkermansia in MS has a detrimental role, we found that Akkermansia was linked to lower disability, suggesting a beneficial role. Consistent with this, we found that Akkermansia isolated from MS patients ameliorated EAE, which was linked to a reduction in RORγt+ and IL‐17–producing γδ T cells.


Interpretation
Whereas some microbiota alterations are shared in relapsing and progressive MS, we identified unique bacteria associated with progressive MS and clinical measures of disease. Furthermore, elevated Akkermansia in MS may be a compensatory beneficial response in the MS microbiome. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 There is an accumulating volume of research into neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). However, inconsistent study designs, inadequate controls, poorly validated tests, and differing settings, interventions, and cultural norms weaken study quality and comparability, hence the understanding of the spectrum, burden, and pathophysiology of these complications. Therefore, a global COVID‐19 Neuro Research Coalition, together with the World Health Organization, has reviewed reports of COVID‐19 neurological complications and harmonized clinical measures for future research. This will facilitate well‐designed studies using precise, consistent case definitions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and neurological complications, with standardized forms for pooled data analyses that nonspecialists can use, including those in low‐income settings.

 &lt;p&gt;Streams of action potentials or long depolarizations evoke a massive exocytosis of transmitters and peptides from the surface of dendrites, axons and cell bodies of different neuron types. Such mode of exocytosis is known as extrasynaptic for occurring without utilization of synaptic structures. Most transmitters and all peptides can be released extrasynaptically. Neurons may discharge their contents with relative independence from the axon, soma and dendrites. Extrasynaptic exocytosis takes fractions of a second in varicosities or minutes in the soma or dendrites, but its effects last from seconds to hours. Unlike synaptic exocytosis, which is well localized, extrasynaptic exocytosis is diffuse and affects neuronal circuits, glia and blood vessels. Molecules that are liberated may reach extrasynaptic receptors microns away. The coupling between excitation and exocytosis follows a multistep mechanism, different from that at synapses, but similar to that for the release of hormones. The steps from excitation to exocytosis have been studied step by step for the vital transmitter serotonin in leech Retzius neurons. The events leading to serotonin exocytosis occur similarly for the release of other transmitters and peptides in central and peripheral neurons. Extrasynaptic exocytosis occurs commonly onto glial cells, which react by releasing the same or other transmitters. In the last section, we discuss how illumination of the retina evokes extrasynaptic release of dopamine and ATP. Dopamine contributes to light-adaptation; ATP activates glia, which mediates an increase in blood flow and oxygenation. A proper understanding of the workings of the nervous system requires the understanding of extrasynaptic communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a severely debilitating neurodegenerative disease, affecting the motor system, leading to resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, walking and gait difficulties, and postural instability. The severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta causes striatal dopamine deficiency and the presence of Lewy bodies indicates a pathological hallmark of PD. Although the current treatment of PD aims to preserve dopaminergic neurons or to replace dopamine depletion in the brain, it is notable that complete recovery from the disease is yet to be achieved. Given the complexity and multisystem effects of PD, the underlying mechanisms of PD pathogenesis are yet to be elucidated. The advancement of medical technologies has given some insights in understanding the mechanism and potential treatment of PD with a special interest in the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) to unravel the pathophysiology of PD. In PD patients, it was found that striatal brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra demonstrated dysregulated miRNAs expression profiles. Hence, dysregulation of miRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD through modulation of PD-associated gene and protein expression. This review will discuss recent findings on PD-associated miRNAs dysregulation, from the regulation of PD-associated genes, dopaminergic neuron survival, α-synuclein-induced inflammation and circulating miRNAs. The next section of this review also provides an update on the potential uses of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic tools for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;To explore the effect of combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and conventional rehabilitation on the recovery of consciousness in patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 48 patients in a PVS were randomly divided into a treatment and control group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with rTMS to stimulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and patients in the control group were treated with false stimulation. All patients were evaluated using scales and neuroelectrophysiological assessment before treatment, after 30 days of treatment, and following 60 days of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Based on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and electroencephalogram (EEG) grading indexes, the treatment group was significantly higher than those of the control group after 30 and 60 days of treatment. The average difference in the three measurements between the two groups before treatment, at 30 days, and 60 days was 0.04, 1.54, and 2.09 for CRS-R and 0.08, −0.83, and −0.62 for EEG indexes, respectively. The latency periods of each wave of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in the treatment group were shorter than those in the control group after 30 and 60 days of treatment. In both groups, the BAEP scores after 30 days of treatment were significantly higher than the scores before treatment, and the scores after 60 days of treatment were higher than the scores after 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In patients in a PVS, rTMS assists in the recovery of consciousness function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Studies on Parkinson disease (PD) have mostly focused on the central nervous system—specifically, on the loss of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons and associated motor dysfunction. However, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is gaining prominence in PD research, with increasing clinical attention being paid to non-motor symptoms. Researchers found abnormal deposition of α-synuclein and neuroinflammation in the PNS. Attempts have been made to use these pathological changes during the clinical diagnosis of PD. Animal studies demonstrated that combined transplantation of autologous peripheral nerves and cells with tyrosine hydroxylase activity can reduce dopaminergic neuronal damage, and similar effects were observed in some clinical trials. In this review, we will systematically explain PNS performance in PD pathology and its clinical diagnostic research, describe PNS experimental results [especially Schwann cell (SC) transplantation in the treatment of PD animal models] and the results of clinical trials, and discuss future directions. The mechanism by which SCs produce such a therapeutic effect and the safety of transplantation therapy are briefly described.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A passive brain–computer interface (BCI) based upon functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain signals is used for earlier detection of human drowsiness during driving tasks. This BCI modality acquired hemodynamic signals of 13 healthy subjects from the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DPFC) of the brain. Drowsiness activity is recorded using a continuous-wave fNIRS system and eight channels over the right DPFC. During the experiment, sleep-deprived subjects drove a vehicle in a driving simulator while their cerebral oxygen regulation (CORE) state was continuously measured. Vector phase analysis (VPA) was used as a classifier to detect drowsiness state along with sleep stage-based threshold criteria. Extensive training and testing with various feature sets and classifiers are done to justify the adaptation of threshold criteria for any subject without requiring recalibration. Three statistical features (mean oxyhemoglobin, signal peak, and the sum of peaks) along with six VPA features (trajectory slopes of VPA indices) were used. The average accuracies for the five classifiers are 90.9% for discriminant analysis, 92.5% for support vector machines, 92.3% for nearest neighbors, 92.4% for both decision trees, and ensembles over all subjects’ data. Trajectory slopes of CORE vector magnitude and angle: m(|R|) and m(∠R) are the best-performing features, along with ensemble classifier with the highest accuracy of 95.3% and minimum computation time of 40 ms. The statistical significance of the results is validated with a p-value of less than 0.05. The proposed passive BCI scheme demonstrates a promising technique for online drowsiness detection using VPA along with sleep stage classification.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The quality of arm movements typically improves in the sub-acute phase of stroke affecting the upper extremity. Here, we used whole arm kinematic analysis during reaching movements to distinguish whether these improvements are due to true recovery or to compensation. Fifty-three participants with post-acute stroke performed ∼80 reaching movement tests during 4 weeks of training with the ArmeoSpring exoskeleton. All participants showed improvements in end-effector performance, as measured by movement smoothness. Four ArmeoSpring angles, shoulder horizontal (SH) rotation, shoulder elevation (SE), elbow rotation, and forearm rotation, were recorded and analyzed. We first characterized healthy joint coordination patterns by performing a sparse principal component analysis on these four joint velocities recorded during reaching tests performed by young control participants. We found that two dominant joint correlations [SH with elbow rotation and SE with forearm rotation] explained over 95% of variance of joint velocity data. We identified two clusters of stroke participants by comparing the evolution of these two correlations in all tests. In the “Recoverer” cluster (N = 19), both joint correlations converged toward the respective correlations for control participants. Thus, Recoverers relearned how to generate smooth end-effector movements while developing joint movement patterns similar to those of control participants. In the “Compensator” cluster (N = 34), at least one of the two joint correlations diverged from the corresponding correlation of control participants. Compensators relearned how to generate smooth end-effector movements by discovering various new compensatory movement patterns dissimilar to those of control participants. New compensatory patterns included atypical decoupling of the SE and forearm joints, and atypical coupling of the SH rotation and elbow joints. There was no difference in clinical impairment level between the two groups either at the onset or at the end of training as assessed with the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer scale. However, at the start of training, the Recoverers showed significantly faster improvements in end-effector movement smoothness than the Compensators. Our analysis can be used to inform neurorehabilitation clinicians on how to provide movement feedback during practice and suggest avenues for refining exoskeleton robot therapy to reduce compensatory patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Meditation is an umbrella term for a number of mental training practices designed to improve the monitoring and regulation of attention and emotion. Some forms of meditation are now being used for clinical intervention. To accompany the increased clinical interest in meditation, research investigating the neural basis of these practices is needed. A central hypothesis of contemplative neuroscience is that meditative states, which are unique on a phenomenological level, differ on a neurophysiological level. To identify the electrophysiological correlates of meditation practice, the electrical brain activity of highly skilled meditators engaging in one of six meditation styles (shamatha, vipassana, zazen, dzogchen, tonglen, and visualization) was recorded. A mind-wandering task served as a control. Lempel–Ziv complexity showed differences in nonlinear brain dynamics (entropy) during meditation compared with mind wandering, suggesting that meditation, regardless of practice, affects neural complexity. In contrast, there were no differences in power spectra at six different frequency bands, likely due to the fact that participants engaged in different meditation practices. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest neurological differences among meditation practices. These findings highlight the importance of studying the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of different meditative practices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: Pathological tremor is the most common motor disorder in adults and characterized by involuntary, rhythmic muscular contraction leading to shaking movements in one or more parts of the body. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and biomechanical loading using wearable orthoses have emerged as effective and non-invasive methods for tremor suppression. A variety of upper-limb orthoses for tremor suppression have been introduced; however, a systematic review of the mechanical design, algorithms for tremor extraction, and the experimental design is still missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: To address this gap, we applied a standard systematic review methodology to conduct a literature search in the PubMed and PMC databases. Inclusion criteria and full-text access eligibility were used to filter the studies from the search results. Subsequently, we extracted relevant information, such as suppression mechanism, system weights, degrees of freedom (DOF), algorithms for tremor estimation, experimental settings, and the efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The results show that the majority of tremor-suppression orthoses are active with 47% prevalence. Active orthoses are also the heaviest with an average weight of 561 ± 467 g, followed by semi-active 486 ± 395 g, and passive orthoses 191 ± 137 g. Most of the orthoses only support one DOF (54.5%). Two-DOF and three-DOF orthoses account for 33 and 18%, respectively. The average efficacy of tremor suppression using wearable orthoses is 83 ± 13%. Active orthoses are the most efficient with an average efficacy of 83 ± 8%, following by the semi-active 77 ± 19%, and passive orthoses 75 ± 12%. Among different experimental setups, bench testing shows the highest efficacy at 95 ± 5%, this value dropped to 86 ± 8% when evaluating with tremor-affected subjects. The majority of the orthoses (92%) measured voluntary and/or tremorous motions using biomechanical sensors (e.g., IMU, force sensor). Only one system was found to utilize EMG for tremor extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our review showed an improvement in efficacy of using robotic orthoses in tremor suppression. However, significant challenges for the translations of these systems into clinical or home use remain unsolved. Future challenges include improving the wearability of the orthoses (e.g., lightweight, aesthetic, and soft structure), and user control interfaces (i.e., neural machine interface). We also suggest addressing non-technical challenges (e.g., regulatory compliance, insurance reimbursement) to make the technology more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
