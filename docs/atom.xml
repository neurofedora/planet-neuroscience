 &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It has come to our notice that there was an inadvertent misupload of Fig. 2 (c, d) in the loading control (GAPDH) for ASIC1a and NLRP1 blots. We would like to replace the same with the correct image. This change anyhow does not affect the conclusion of the study. However, the use of GAPDH as a loading control for stroke studies sometimes is debatable (Zhai et al. 2014; Kang et al. 2018). Hence, we repeated our experiments to check the expression of ASIC1a and NLRP1 at different time points following stroke, using beta actin as a loading control. We found that at 24 h post stroke, maximal and significant expression of both ASIC1a and NLRP1 was observed (Fig. 2 e, f). The expression at 48 and 72 h post stroke were not significantly different as compared to that of sham. The expression results obtained using beta actin as a loading control were concurrent with the previous results published with GAPDH as a loading control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;G9a is essential for dendritic plasticity and is associated with neurological disorders. The possible relationship between age-related hearing loss and G9a expression in the auditory cortex has not been fully explored. This study aimed to understand the expression patterns of G9a-mediated histone methylations in the auditory cortex during aging. Using immunofluorescence and western blotting, we demonstrated that a significant reduction in G9a expression observed in the auditory cortex of 24-month-old rats compared to 3-month-old rats, was associated with remarkable hearing threshold elevation and hair cell loss. Correspondingly, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) mono- and dimethylation (marked by H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, respectively), which were regulated by G9a activity, also evidently decreased during aging. These findings, which merit further investigation, suggest a possible association between G9a-mediated histone methylations and central age-related hearing disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Genetic factors play a major role in the etiopathogenesis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CDH13&lt;/em&gt; (rs6565113, rs11150556) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; (rs6551665, rs6858066, rs1947274, rs2345039) gene polymorphisms and ADHD. We also sought to examine possible relationships between these polymorphisms and the clinical course and treatment response in ADHD. A total of 120 patients (79% boys), aged 6 to 18 years, newly diagnosed (medication-naïve) with ADHD according to the DSM-5 and a group of 126 controls (74% girls) were enrolled in the study. We examined the association between the aforementioned polymorphisms and ADHD. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate factors influencing the treatment response of ADHD. A significant difference was found between ADHD and control groups in terms of genotype distribution of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 and rs1947274 polymorphisms. The results also showed that having the GG genotype of rs6551665 and CC genotype of rs1947274 of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; gene was associated with risk for ADHD, and this relationship was more prominent in male participants. In the multivariate logistic regression model established with variables shown to have a significant relationship with treatment response, the presence of the GG genotype of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 polymorphism and high severity of ADHD assessed by CGI-S were associated with poor response to treatment. This study is the first study to investigate the relationship between ADHD and these polymorphisms among Turkish adolescents. Our results imply that the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 and rs1947274 polymorphisms have a significant effect on ADHD in a Turkish population, and support previous observations that the presence of the GG genotype of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 polymorphism may be associated with poor response to treatment in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The pharmacological inhibition of glial activation is one of the new approaches for combating neuropathic pain in which the role of glia in the modulation of neuropathic pain has attracted significant interest and attention. Neuron-glial crosstalk is achieved with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-methyl-D-aspartate-2B receptor (NMDAR-2B) activation. This study aims to determine the effect of ifenprodil, a potent noncompetitive NMDAR-2B antagonist, on activated microglia, brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) protein expression in the spinal cord of streptozotocin-induced painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) rats following formalin injection. In this experimentation, 48 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly selected and divided into four groups: (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 12): control, PDN, and ifenprodil-treated PDN rats at 0.5 μg or 1.0 μg for 7 days. Type I diabetes mellitus was then induced by injecting streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, i.p.) into the rats which were then over a 2-week period allowed to progress into the early phase of PDN. Ifenprodil was administered in PDN rats while saline was administered intrathecally in the control group. A formalin test was conducted during the fourth week to induce inflammatory nerve injury, in which the rats were sacrificed at 72 h post-formalin injection. The lumbar enlargement region (L4–L5) of the spinal cord was dissected for immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. The results demonstrated a significant increase in formalin-induced flinching and licking behavior with an increased spinal expression of activated microglia, BDNF and DREAM proteins. It was also shown that the ifenprodil-treated rats following both doses reduced the extent of their flinching and duration of licking in PDN in a dose-dependent manner. As such, ifenprodil successfully demonstrated inhibition against microglia activation and suppressed the expression of BDNF and DREAM proteins in the spinal cord of PDN rats. In conclusion, ifenprodil may alleviate PDN by suppressing spinal microglia activation, BDNF and DREAM proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a crucial role in multiple disorders, while the role of it in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is still unclear. Here, the increased lncRNA NEAT1 was discovered in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Then, we proved that NEAT1 decreasing suppressed MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced neuronal apoptosis, upregulation of α-syn and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Rescue experiments shown that the inhibition of NEAT1 decreasing to MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent neuronal apoptosis can be reversed by overexpressed α-syn. Subsequently, we indicated the interaction between NEAT1 and miR-1301-3p, as well as between NEAT1 and miR-5047. Interesting, we found that NEAT1 decreasing repressed the expression of GJB1, a downstream target of miR-1301-3p and miR-5047, through promoting miR-1301-3p rather than miR-5047 expression. Finally, we transfected miR-1301-3p inhibitor to MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced SH-SY5Y cells following si-NEAT1, and found that downregulation of NEAT1 repressed α-syn-mediated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through regulating miR-1301-3p/GJB1 signaling pathway. Overall, our data demonstrated that NEAT1 decreasing effectively suppressed MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced neuronal apoptosis. Mechanismly, downregulation of NEAT1 repressed α-syn-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via inhibiting the expression of GJB1 by targeting miR-1301-3p. Our study supported a new and reliable evidence for lncRNA NEAT1 as a potential target for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder involving multiple genes that occurs in early childhood, and a number of risk genes have been reported in previous studies. However, the molecular mechanism of the polygenic regulation leading to pathological changes in ASD remains unclear. First, we identified 8 dysregulated gene coexpression modules by analyzing blood transcriptome data from 96 children with ASD and 42 controls. These modules are rich in ASD risk genes and function related to metabolism, immunity, neurodevelopment, and signaling. The regulatory factors of each module including microRNA (miRNA) and transcription factors (TFs) were subsequently predicted based on transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. We identified a set of miRNAs that regulate metabolic and immune modules, as well as transcription factors that cause dysregulation of the modules, and we constructed a coregulatory network between the regulatory factors and modules. Our work reveals dysfunctional modules in children with ASD, elucidates the role of miRNA and transcription factor dysregulation in the pathophysiology of ASD, and helps us to further understand the underlying molecular mechanism of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Musculoskeletal pain is a widespread complex regional pain syndrome associated with altered emotional and cognitive functioning along with heightened physical disability that has become a global health concern. Effective management of this disorder and associated disabilities includes accurate diagnosis of its biomarkers and instituting mechanism–based therapeutic interventions. Herein, we explored the role of heraclin, a plant-derived molecule, in musculoskeletal pain and its underlying mechanistic approaches in an experimental mouse model. Reserpine (0.5 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days evoked hyperalgesia, motor incoordination, lack of exploratory behavior, anxiety, and cognition lapse in mice. Reserpine-challenged mice displayed higher serum cytokine level, altered brain neurotransmitter content, elevated brain and muscle oxidative stress, and upregulated brain nerve growth factor receptor expression. Treatment with heraclin (10 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days) exerted analgesic effect and improved motor coordination and memory deficits in mice. Heraclin arrested serum cytokine rise, normalized brain neurotransmitter content, reduced tissue oxidative stress, and downregulated the nerve growth factor receptor expression. Therefore, it may be suggested that heraclin exerts beneficial effects against reserpine-induced musculoskeletal pain disorder possibly through the attenuation of NGFR-mediated pain and inflammatory signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To report the phenomenology of movement disorder (MD) in neurological Wilson disease (NWD), and correlate these with MRI, and biomarkers of oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Eighty-two patients were included, and their phenomenology of MD was categorized. The severity of dystonia was assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden score, and chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, and tremor on a 0–4 scale. The MRI changes were noted. Serum glutamate, cytokines, and oxidative stress markers were measured. Movement disorders were noted in 78/82 (95.1%) patients and included dystonia in 69 (84.1%), chorea in 31 (37.8%), tremor in 24 (29.3%), parkinsonism in 19 (23.2%), athetosis in 13 (15.9%), and myoclonus in 9 (11.0%) patients. Dystonia was more frequently observed in the patients with thalamic (76.8 vs 23.2%), globus pallidus (72.0 vs 28.0%), putamen (69.5 vs 30.5%), caudate (68.3 vs 31.7%) and brainstem (61.0 vs 39.0%) involvement, and tremor with cerebellar involvement (37.5 vs 5.2%). The median age of onset of neurological symptoms was 12 (5–50) years. WD patients had higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutamate, and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα) and lower levels of glutathione and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared with the controls. Serum glutamate, IL-6, IL-8, and plasma MDA levels were increased with increasing neurological severity, while glutathione and TAC levels decreased. The severity of dystonia related to the number of MRI lesions. MD is the commonest neurological symptoms in WD. Oxidative stress, glutamate, and cytokine levels are increased in WD and correlate with neurological severity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Isolated dystonia is a common movement disorder often caused by genetic mutations, although it is predominantly sporadic in nature. Common variants of dystonia-related genes were reported to be risk factors for idiopathic isolated dystonia. In this study, we aimed to analyse the roles of previously reported GTP cyclohydrolase (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GCH1&lt;/em&gt;) and Torsin family 1 member A (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TOR1A&lt;/em&gt;) polymorphisms in an Indian isolated dystonia case-control group. A total of 292 sporadic isolated dystonia patients and 316 control individuals were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GCH1&lt;/em&gt; (rs3759664:G &amp;gt; A, rs12147422:A &amp;gt; G and rs10483639:C &amp;gt; G) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TOR1A&lt;/em&gt; (rs13300897:G &amp;gt; A, rs1801968:G &amp;gt; C, rs1182:G &amp;gt; T and rs3842225:G &amp;gt; Δ) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. The statistical significance of allelic, genotypic and haplotypic associations of all of the SNPs were evaluated using the two-tailed Fisher exact test. The minor allele (A) of rs3759664 is significantly associated with isolated limb dystonia as a risk factor (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005). The minor allele (C) of rs1801968 is strongly associated with isolated dystonia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and most of its subtypes. The major allele of rs3842225 (G) may act as a significant risk factor for Writer’s cramp (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03). Four different haplogroups comprising of either rs1182 or rs3842225 or in combination with rs1801968 and rs13300897 were found to be significantly associated with isolated dystonia. No other allelic, genotypic or haplotypic association was found to be significant with isolated dystonia cohort or its endophenotype stratified groups. Our study suggests that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TOR1A&lt;/em&gt; common variants have a significant role in isolated dystonia pathogenesis in the Indian population, whereas SNPs in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GCH1&lt;/em&gt; gene may have a limited role.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;By measuring the cerebral infarction rate and neurological behavioral score of rats in a sham operation group, an MCAO model control group and an &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection treatment group, we explored the therapeutic effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection on brain tissue and neuroethological injury in rats. Plasma samples were collected at 18 time points after intravenous injection of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt;. The levels of scutellarin, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid B in rat plasma at the various time points were determined by an HPLC method, and drug concentration versus time plots were constructed to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. Finally, a PK-PD combined model was used to analyze the relationship between the blood concentration, time and therapeutic effects of the seven active components. The results of the pharmacodynamics studies showed that the cerebral infarction rate of rats in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection group decreased significantly at 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 6 h, 8 h, 18 h, 24 h, 32 h, 40 h and 48 h after cerebral ischemia. Abnormal neurological behavior scores were significantly reduced after 4 h of cerebral ischemia. The pharmacokinetics results showed that the seven chemical constituents in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection reached their highest detection value after 5 min of cerebral ischemia. The lowest detection values of scutellarin and isochlorogenic acid B appeared after 6 h of cerebral ischemia but could not be detected after 8 h. The lowest detection values of 5-caffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid were found in the third hour of cerebral ischemia but not after 4 h. The lowest detection values of 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid were found during the second hour of cerebral ischemia but not at the third hour. However, at 18 h, 24 h, 32 h and 40 h of cerebral ischemia, the cerebral infarction rates of rats in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection group were significantly reduced, with decreased values of 6.22%, 11.71%, 6.92% and 4.96%, respectively, and the effects were stronger than those after 5–20 min of cerebral ischemia. The decreased values reached their highest value after 24 h of cerebral ischemia. Our results show that the effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection on reducing the cerebral infarct rate in MCAO model rats are characterized by a fast onset and long maintenance time. The 5-min blood concentration in cerebral ischemia was the highest test value, and after this time, the cerebral infarction rate of MCAO rats began to decrease. However, the peak value of the effects lagged behind that of the plasma concentration. The maximum effective time for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection appeared 24 h after cerebral ischemia, which provides a reference for the screening of specific drugs for ischemic stroke, optimal dosing regimens and rational clinical drug use.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to clarify the regulation role of miR-708 and miR-335-3p in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) autophagy and apoptosis in glaucoma. Chronic glaucoma mice were established by laser photocoagulation. RGCs were isolated and transfected with a series of plasmids and the cultured in 60 mmHg pressure. miR-335-3p, miR-708, and ATG3 mRNA expressions were detected by qRT-PCR. Protein levels of ATG3, autophagy-related protein LC3, and p62 were detected by Western blot. The apoptosis of RGCs was detected by flow cytometry. The regulation role of miR-335-3p/miR-708 in ATG3 was confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter gene. The expressions of several miRNAs were measured in retinal tissues from chronic glaucoma mice and RGCs under pressure conditions, and results showed that both miR-335-3p and miR-708 were down-regulated. Besides, the inhibition of miR-708 and miR-335-3p induced the apoptosis of RGCs through promoting autophagy. Also, miR-708 and miR-335-3p could bind to ATG3 and targeted regulated ATG3. Furthermore, the interference with miR-708/miR-335-3p induced RGC apoptosis by up-regulating ATG3 to promote autophagy. In general, the down-regulation of miR-708 and miR-335-3p contributed to the apoptosis of RGCs through promoting autophagy in glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNP rs2043211 in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CARD8&lt;/em&gt; was found to have significant association with ischemic stroke. This study aimed to explore the possible association between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese and explain the possible mechanism. In total, 716 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and 1088 controls were included in the study. Co-dominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models were constructed to evaluate the relationship between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke risk by odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Stratified and interaction analyses were also done. We selected another 111 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and measured the CARD8 levels in their plasma samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Participants who carry T/T genotype have a higher risk of large-artery atherosclerosis stroke compared with those carry A/T or A/A genotypes (odds ratio = 1.35, 95% confidence intervals 1.03–1.77, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.029). The higher risk for the T/T genotype is still notable in female, people with hypertension, and people without diabetes. In the interaction analysis, compared to the non-hypertensive participants with the wild homozygote type A/A, the hypertensive participants with the A/T+T/T homozygote had 3.27-fold increased risk (odds ratio = 3.27, 95% confidence intervals 2.33–4.60). The A/A group had lower CARD8 levels in plasma than the A/T and T/T group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Further bioinformatics prediction indicated that the rs2043211 could significantly influence the mRNA secondary structure and protein expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CARD8&lt;/em&gt; (eQTL &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 9.8 × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;−198&lt;/sup&gt;). The rs2043211 is probably a novel biomarker for large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Outbred rats differentially consume alcohol when having free access to it. Among others, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is believed to control voluntary ethanol intake in rodents. Meanwhile, expression of BDNF exons in brain regions and epigenetic mechanisms underlying alcohol intake pattern remain obscure. The main goal was to study whether voluntary alcohol drinking pattern affects expression of BDNF exons in selected rat brain regions during early abstinence. Intermittent access to 20% ethanol in a two-bottle-choice procedure (IA2BC) was used as a model of voluntary ethanol intake. Male Wistar rats (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 24) had twenty 24-h sessions of free access to two-bottle choice (water or 20% ethanol) with 24-h withdrawal periods (water only). Control animals had access to water only (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 11). After finishing IA2BC, the animals were divided according to the compliance of ethanol intake pattern with gradual escalation, a key feature of the paradigm. To access potential behavioral disturbances during the early abstinence, rats were consequently tested in the open field test, the elevated plus-maze, and the sucrose preference test. On the third day after the last drinking session, expression of BDNF exons and polypeptide was measured in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and midbrain using quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to analyze enrichment of positive Ph-CREB (Ser133) and negative EZH2 transcriptional regulators as well as markers of active H3K9ac and repressed H3K27me3 chromatin at exon-specific BDNF promoters in brain regions with affected BDNF expression. During the course of the IA2BC, one part of animals demonstrated gradual escalation from low to high alcohol intake and preference of alcohol over water (a typical pattern for IA2BC) while the other one consumed alcohol at a consistently high level (an unusual pattern for IA2BC). Drinking pattern in the IA2BC does not define differences of behavior in any of the tests during early abstinence. Finally, the IA2BC rats with growing alcohol intake showed elevation of BDNF mRNA containing exon VI in the hippocampus associated with an enhanced H3K9ac occupancy at the respective promoter. Thus, rats differentially consuming alcohol in the IA2BC paradigm differ in epigenetically determined expression of BDNF exon VI in the hippocampus during early abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To feel other’s pain would elicit empathy. Some theorists hypothesized that observing other’s pain may activate the primary emotion of maternal care instinct, which may function as a precursor of empathy. The maternal care instinct and empathy share the same genetic background and neuroendocrine underpinnings. An extensive body of research has shown that maternal behaviors relate to the oxytocinergic system, which has a strong influence on empathy. These studies suggest that the maternal care instinct may mediate the effect of oxytocin receptor gene (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;OXTR&lt;/em&gt;) on empathy. To provide evidence for this mediation, we used the subscale of CARE in Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) to measure the maternal care instinct and tested two &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;OXTR&lt;/em&gt; single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs53576 and rs13316193, in 880 high school participants (588 females, 292 males; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 16.51 years old, SD = 0.65). Results showed that the genotype of rs13316193 was indirectly associated with empathy via CARE, suggesting a mediating role of CARE in the pathway from &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;OXTR&lt;/em&gt; to empathy. These findings may contribute to an understanding of how empathy emerges when one witnesses another person in pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Metachromatic leukodystrophy(MLD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by the mutations in arylsulfatase A gene (ARSA), which results in the deficiency of ARSA enzyme. The common clinical characteristics of MLD are abnormal gait, and then gradually appears ataxia, spastic quadriplegia, optic atrophy, cortical blindness, and dementia. We describe two patients in China who were diagnosed with MLD and find that the four ARSA gene mutations (c.1115G&amp;gt;A, c.302G&amp;gt;T, c.893 G&amp;gt; T, and c.302G&amp;gt;T) are associated with MLD, in which c.893 G&amp;gt;T and c.302G&amp;gt;T are novel mutations by gene sequence and clinical manifestations, to further understand the relationship between MLD and ARSA gene.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The sweet taste receptor, which was identified approximately 20 years ago, mediates sweet taste recognition in humans and other vertebrates. With the development of genomics, metabonomics, structural biology, evolutionary biology, physiology, and neuroscience, as well as technical advances in these areas, our understanding of this important protein has resulted in substantial progress. This article reviews the structure, function, genetics, and evolution of the sweet taste receptor and offers meaningful insights into this G protein–coupled receptor, which may be helpful guidances for personalized feeding, diet, and medicine. Prospective directions for research on sweet taste receptors have also been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

To explore the genetic background of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene on DPN development, this study analyzed the correlation between SNPs in the 3'UTR of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene and their interaction with environmental factors in DPN patients of Han Chinese nationality. Sanger sequencing was used to analyze the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; genotypes at the rs1048201, rs3804158, rs41348645, rs6854081, rs3747676, rs7683093, rs1476215, and rs1476217 loci in 150 DPN patients, 150 NDPN patients, and 150 healthy control patients. Plasma FGF2 levels were measured in all subjects by using ELISAs. Subjects carrying the T allele at the rs1048201 locus in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene had a significantly lower risk of developing DPN compared with subjects carrying the C allele (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.33–0.56, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Subjects with the G genotype at the rs6854081 locus had an exceptionally higher risk of developing DPN than subjects with the T allele (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.39–1.89, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Individuals harboring the G allele at the rs7683093 locus had a markedly higher risk of DPN than patients with the C allele (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.36–1.87, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Finally, individuals having the A genotype at the rs1476215 locus had a significantly higher risk of DPN than individuals carrying the T allele (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.53–2.02, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). There was an interaction between age and alcohol consumption and the SNP rs7683093. SNPs at rs1048201, rs6854081, rs7683093, and rs1476215 in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; 3’UTR were strongly associated with plasma levels of FGF2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). SNPs at the rs1048201, rs6854081, rs7683093, and rs1476215 loci in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene were significantly associated with the risk of DPN. A possible mechanism is that these SNPs affect the expression level of FGF2 by interrupting the binding of microRNAs to target sites in the 3'UTR.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation and rupture. Interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt;) is known as the nuclear factor of activated T cells and regulates cell growth. This study was aimed to explore the effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; on IA progression. Human brain VSMCs (hBVSMCs) were transfected with pCDNA3.1(+), pCDNA3.1(+)-ILF2, siRNA-negative control, and siRNA-ILF2. The transfection efficiency was then evaluated by determining &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; expression. The cell viability and apoptosis were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 and Annexin V-FITC cell apoptosis assay kit, respectively. Real-time quantification PCR (RT-qPCR) was applied to measure the expression levels of apoptosis-related and inflammation-related genes. Finally, western blot was used to detect the expression level of Fas cell surface death receptor 95 (CD95) and Caspase 8. Overexpression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; could significantly increase cell viability and decrease cell apoptosis (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while knock-down of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; showed opposite trends for hBVSMCs on cell viability and apoptosis (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). RT-qPCR results showed that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; knock-down downregulated the expression levels of BCL2 apoptosis regulator (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BCL2&lt;/em&gt;), transcriptional regulator Myc-like (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;c-Myc&lt;/em&gt;), and caspase 1 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ICE&lt;/em&gt;) whereas upregulated the expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CD95&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p53&lt;/em&gt;, and interleukin-13 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-13&lt;/em&gt;). Additionally, the protein expression levels of CD95 and Caspase 8 were significantly decreased after &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; overexpression while were significantly increased after &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; knock-down (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; knock-down may inhibit cell viability and promote cell apoptosis of hBVSMCs by regulating the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes and suppressing inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is known as a chronic neuroinflammatory disorder typified by an immune-mediated demyelination process with ensuing axonal damage and loss. Sinomenine is a natural alkaloid with different therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities. In this study, possible beneficial effects of sinomenine in an MOG-induced model of MS were determined. Sinomenine was given to MOG&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;35–55&lt;/sub&gt;-immunized C57BL/6 mice at doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg/day after onset of MS clinical signs till day 30 post-immunization. Analyzed data showed that sinomenine reduces severity of the clinical signs and to some extent decreases tissue level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNFα, IL-17A, and increases level of anti-inflammatory IL-10. In addition, sinomenine successfully attenuated tissue levels of inflammasome NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1 besides its reduction of intensity of neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage and loss in lumbar spinal cord specimens. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for MBP decreased and increased for GFAP and Iba1 after MOG-immunization, which was in part reversed upon sinomenine administration. Overall, sinomenine decreases EAE severity, which is attributed to its alleviation of microglial and astrocytic mobilization, demyelination, and axonal damage along with its suppression of neuroinflammation, and its beneficial effect is also associated with its inhibitory effects on inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways; this may be of potential benefit for the primary progressive phenotype of MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Studies from our lab demonstrated that 1 × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; intra-arterial mesenchymal stem cells (IA MSCs) at 6 h following ischemic stroke are efficacious owing to its maximum homing due to elevated stromal derived factor 1 (SDF1) in the tissue. Further, IA MSCs could abate the infarct progression, improve functional outcome, and decrease expression of calcineurin by modifying neuronal Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels following ischemic stroke. Since stroke pathology also encompasses acidosis that worsens the condition; hence, the role of acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) in this context could not be overlooked. ASIC1a being the major contributor towards acidosis triggers Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions overload which progressively contributes towards exacerbation of neuronal injury following ischemic insult. Inflammasome involvement in ischemic stroke is well reported as activated ASIC1a increases the expression of inflammasome in a pH-dependent manner to trigger inflammatory cascade. Hence, the current study aimed to identify if IA MSCs can decrease the production of inflammasome by attenuating ASIC1a expression to render neuroprotection. Ovariectomized Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 90 min were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 1 × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; MSCs IA at 6 h to check for the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasome in different groups. Inhibition studies were carried out to explore the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrate that IA MSCs improves functional outcome and oxidative stress parameters, and decreases the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasomes in the cortical brain region after ischemic stroke. This study offers a preliminary evidence of the role of IA MSCs in regulating inflammasome by modulating ASIC1a.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To describe the reasons for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and to evaluate the outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) admitted to the ICU.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients and methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Retrospective observational cohort study of 101 PCNSL patients admitted to 3 ICUs over a two-decade period.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Acute respiratory failure, mainly secondary to aspiration pneumonia and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pneumocystis jirovecii&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia, was the leading reason for ICU admission (33%). Aspiration pneumonia was more common in patients with brainstem tumor (67% vs. 0%, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas patients with intracranial hypertension were more frequently admitted for coma without seizures (61% vs. 9%, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004). Hospital and 6-month mortality were 47% and 53%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, admission for coma without seizures (OR 7.28), cancer progression (OR 3.47), mechanical ventilation (OR 6.58) and vasopressors (OR 4.07) were associated with higher 6-month mortality. Karnofsky performance status prior to ICU admission was independently associated with lower 6-month mortality (OR 0.96).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Six-month survival of PCNSL patients admitted to the ICU appears to be relatively favorable (around 50%) and the presence of PCNSL alone is not a relevant criterion for ICU refusal. Predictive factors of mortality may help clinicians to make optimal triage decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

 While experience unfolds continuously, memories are organized as a set of discrete events that bind together the &quot;where&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, and &quot;what&quot; of episodic memory. This segmentation of continuous experience is thought to be facilitated by the detection of salient environmental or cognitive events. However, the underlying neural mechanisms and how such segmentation shapes episodic memory representations remain unclear. We recorded from single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe while subjects watched videos with different types of embedded boundaries and were subsequently evaluated for memories of the video contents. Here we show neurons that signal the presence of cognitive boundaries between subevents from the same episode and neurons that detect the abstract separation between different episodes. The firing rate and spike timing of these boundary-responsive neurons were predictive of later memory retrieval accuracy. At the population level, abrupt neural state changes following boundaries predicted enhanced memory strength but impaired order memory, capturing the behavioral tradeoff subjects exhibited when recalling episodic content versus temporal order. Successful retrieval was associated with reinstatement of the neural state present following boundaries, indicating that boundaries structure memory search. These findings reveal a neuronal substrate for detecting cognitive boundaries and show that cognitive boundary signals facilitate the mnemonic organization of continuous experience as a set of discrete episodic events.</content>

 Scientists have long conjectured that the neocortex learns the structure of the environment in a predictive, hierarchical manner. To do so, expected, predictable features are differentiated from unexpected ones by comparing bottom-up and top-down streams of data. It is theorized that the neocortex then changes the representation of incoming stimuli, guided by differences in the responses to expected and unexpected events. Such differences in cortical responses have been observed; however, it remains unknown whether these unexpected event signals govern subsequent changes in the brain's stimulus representations, and, thus, govern learning. Here, we show that unexpected event signals predict subsequent changes in responses to expected and unexpected stimuli in individual neurons and distal apical dendrites that are tracked over a period of days. These findings were obtained by observing layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex of awake, behaving mice using two-photon calcium imaging. We found that many neurons in both layers 2/3 and 5 showed large differences between their responses to expected and unexpected events. These unexpected event signals also determined how the responses evolved over subsequent days, in a manner that was different between the somata and distal apical dendrites. This difference between the somata and distal apical dendrites may be important for hierarchical computation, given that these two compartments tend to receive bottom-up and top-down information, respectively. Together, our results provide novel evidence that the neocortex indeed instantiates a predictive hierarchical model in which unexpected events drive learning.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Survival requires both the ability to persistently pursue goals and the ability to determine when it is time to stop, an adaptive balance of perseverance and disengagement. Neural activity in the lateral habenula (LHb) has been linked to aversion and negative valence, but its role in regulating the balance between reward-seeking and disengaged behavioral states remains unclear. Here, we show that LHb neural activity is tonically elevated during minutes-long disengagements from reward-seeking behavior, whether due to repeated reward omission or following sufficient consumption of reward. Further, we show that LHb inhibition extends ongoing reward-seeking behavioral states but does not prompt re-engagement. We find no evidence for similar tonic activity fluctuations in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons. Our findings implicate the LHb as a key mediator of disengagement from reward-seeking behavior in multiple contexts and argue against the idea that the LHb contributes to decisions solely by signaling aversion.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) family plays a major role in cell signalling and is predominant in leukocytes. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the PIK3CD gene lead to the development of activated PI3K{delta} syndrome (APDS), a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder. A subset of APDS patients also displays neurodevelopmental delay symptoms, suggesting a potential role of PIK3CD in cognitive and behavioural function. However, the extent and nature of the neurodevelopmental deficits has not been previously quantified. Here, we assessed the cognitive functions of two APDS patients, and investigated the causal role of the PIK3CD GOF mutation in neurological deficits using a murine model of this disease. We used E1020K knock-in mice, harbouring the most common APDS mutation in patients. We found that APDS patients present with visuomotor deficits, exacerbated by autism spectrum disorder comorbidity, whereas p110{delta}E1020K mice exhibited impairments in motor behaviour, learning and repetitive behaviour patterning. Our data indicate that PIK3CD GOF mutations increase the risk for neurodevelopmental deficits, supporting previous findings on the interplay between the nervous and the immune system. Further, our results validate the knock-in mouse model, and offer an objective assessment tool for patients that could be incorporated in diagnosis and in the evaluation of treatments.</content>

 Within populations, some individuals tend to exhibit a bold or shy social behavior phenotype relative to the mean. The neural underpinnings of these differing phenotypes -- also described as syndromes, personalities, and coping styles -- is an area of ongoing investigation. Although a social decision-making network has been described across vertebrate taxa, most studies examining activity within this network do so in relation to exhibited differences in behavioral expression. Our study instead focuses on constitutive gene expression in bold and shy individuals by isolating baseline gene expression profiles that influence social boldness predisposition, rather than those reflecting the results of social interaction and behavioral execution. We performed this study on male green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), an established model organism for behavioral research, which provides a crucial comparison group to investigations of birds and mammals. After identifying subjects as bold or shy through repeated reproductive and agonistic behavior testing, we used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression profiles between these groups within various forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions. The ventromedial hypothalamus had the largest group differences in gene expression, with bold males having increased expression of calcium channels and neuroendocrine receptor genes compared to shy males. Conversely, shy males express more integrin alpha-10 in the majority of examined regions. There were no significant group differences in physiology or hormone levels. Our results highlight the ventromedial hypothalamus as an important center of behavioral differences across individuals and provide novel candidates for investigation into the regulation of individual variation in social behavior phenotype.</content>

 Primates and rodents are able to continually acquire, adapt, and transfer knowledge and skill, and lead to goal-directed behavior during their lifespan. For the case when context switches slowly, animals learn via slow processes. For the case when context switches rapidly, animals learn via fast processes. We build a biologically realistic model with modules similar to a distributed computing system. Specifically, we are emphasizing the role of thalamocortical learning on a slow time scale between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial dorsal thalamus (MD). Previous work [1] has already shown experimental evidence supporting classification of cell ensembles in the medial dorsal thalamus, where each class encodes a different context. However, the mechanism by which such classification is learned is not clear. In this work, we show that such learning can be self-organizing in the manner of an automaton (a distributed computing system), via a combination of Hebbian learning and homeostatic synaptic scaling. We show that in the simple case of two contexts, the network with hierarchical structure can do context-based decision making and smooth switching between different contexts. Our learning rule creates synaptic competition [2] between the thalamic cells to create winner-take-all activity. Our theory shows that the capacity of such a learning process depends on the total number of task-related hidden variables, and such a capacity is limited by system size N. We also theoretically derived the effective functional connectivity as a function of an order parameter dependent on the thalamo-cortical coupling structure.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Semantic binding refers to constructing complex meaning based on elementary building blocks. Using EEG, we investigated the age-related changes in modulations of oscillatory brain activity supporting semantic binding. Young and older adult participants were visually presented two-word phrases in a semantic binding (e.g. swift horse) vs. no semantic binding context (e.g. swrfeq horse). We found that the oscillatory brain activity associated with semantic binding significantly differed between healthy older and young adults. Specifically, in young adults we found a semantic binding signature in the low-beta range centred around the onset of the target word (i.e. a smaller low-beta increase for binding relative to no binding), while in healthy older adults we found an opposite pattern about ~500ms later in the low- and high-beta range (i.e. a smaller low- and high-beta decrease for binding relative to no binding). We interpret the different and delayed oscillatory signature for semantic binding in healthy older adults to reflect that they are relying on different mechanisms to integrate word meaning into their semantic context.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Significance: Image reconstruction of fNIRS data is a useful technique for transforming channel-based fNIRS into a volumetric representation and managing spatial variance based on optode location. We present a novel integrated pipeline for image reconstruction of fNIRS data using either MRI templates or individual anatomy. Aim: We demonstrate a pipeline with accompanying code to allow users to clean and prepare optode location information, prepare and standardize individual anatomical images, create the light model, run the 3D image reconstruction, and analyze data in group space. Approach: We synthesize a combination of new and existing software packages to create a complete pipeline, from raw data to analysis. Results: This pipeline has been tested using both templates and individual anatomy, and on data from different fNIRS data collection systems. We show high temporal correlations between channel-based and image-based fNIRS data. In addition, we demonstrate the reliability of this pipeline with a sample dataset that included 74 children as part of a longitudinal study taking place in Scotland. We demonstrate good correspondence between data in channel space and image reconstructed data. Conclusions: The pipeline presented here makes a unique contribution by integrating multiple tools to assemble a complete pipeline for image reconstruction in fNIRS. We highlight further issues that may be of interest to future software developers in the field.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Modern light microscopy, including super-resolution techniques, brought about a demand for small labeling tags that bring the fluorophore closer to the target. This challenge can be addressed by labeling unnatural amino acids (UAAs) with click chemistry. UAAs are site-specifically incorporated into a protein of interest by genetic code expansion. If the UAA carries a strained alkene or alkyne moiety it can be conjugated to a tetrazine-bearing fluorophore via a strain-promoted inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition (SPIEDAC), a variant of bioorthogonal click chemistry. The minimal size of the incorporated tag and the possibility to couple the fluorophores directly to the protein of interest with single-residue precision make SPIEDAC live-cell labeling unique. However, until now, this type of labeling has not been used in complex, non-dividing cells, such as neurons. Using neurofilament light chain as a target protein, we established SPIEDAC labeling in living primary neurons and applied it for fixed-cell, live-cell, dual-color pulse-chase and super-resolution microscopy. We also show that SPIEDAC labeling can be combined with CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering for tagging endogenous NFL. Due to its versatile nature and compatibility with advanced microscopy techniques, we anticipate that SPIEDAC labeling will contribute to novel discoveries in neurobiology.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Opioid withdrawal is a key driver of opioid addiction and an obstacle to recovery. However, withdrawal effects on opioid reinforcement and mesolimbic neuroadaptation are understudied and the role of sex is largely unknown. Methods: Male (n=10) and female (n=9) rats responded under a fentanyl-vs.-food choice procedure during daily 2h sessions. In addition to the daily choice sessions, rats were provided extended access to fentanyl during 12h sessions. After two weeks of this self-administration regimen, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) of a subset of rats were subjected to RNA sequencing. In the remaining rats, a third week of this self-administration regimen was conducted, during which methadone effects on fentanyl-vs.-food choice were determined. Results: Prior to opioid dependence, male and female rats similarly allocated responding between fentanyl and food. Abstinence from extended fentanyl access elicited a similar increase in somatic withdrawal signs in both sexes. Despite similar withdrawal signs and extended access fentanyl intake, opioid withdrawal was accompanied by a maladaptive increase in fentanyl choice in males, but not females. Behavioral sex differences corresponded with transcriptional hyperfunction in the NAc and VTA of opioid-withdrawn females relative to males. Methadone blocked withdrawal-associated increases in fentanyl choice in males, but failed to further decrease fentanyl choice in females. Conclusions: These results provide foundational evidence of sex-specific neuroadaptations to opioid withdrawal, which may be relevant to the female-specific resilience to withdrawal-associated increases in opioid choice and aid in the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Reward-guided learning and decision-making is a fundamental adaptive ability and depends on a number of component processes. We investigate how such component processes mature during human adolescence. Our approach was guided by analyses of the effects of lateral orbitofrontal lesions in macaque monkeys, as this part of the brain shows clear developmental maturation in humans during adolescence. Using matched tasks and analyses in humans (n=388, 11-35yrs), we observe developmental changes in two key learning mechanisms as predicted from the monkey data. First, choice-reward credit assignment - the ability to link a specific outcome to a specific choice - is reduced in adolescents. Second, the effects of the global reward state - how good the environment is overall recently - exerts a distinctive pattern of influence on learning in humans compared to other primates and across adolescence this pattern becomes more pronounced. Both mechanisms were correlated across participants suggesting that associative learning of correct reward assignments and GRS based learning constitute two complementary mechanisms of reward-learning that co-mature during adolescence.</content>

 Astrocytes play a key role in brain homeostasis and functions such as memory. Specifically, astrocytes express multiple receptors that transduce signals via the second messenger cAMP. However, the involvement of astrocytic cAMP in animal behavior and the underlying glial–neuronal interactions remains largely unknown.

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26009?af=R"/>
		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26009?af=R</id>
		<updated>2021-01-15T15:42:24+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the survival of motor neuron (&lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt;) gene in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unclear, with several conflicting reports. A decisive result on this topic is needed, given that treatment options are available now for &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this largest multicenter case control study to evaluate the effect of &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy numbers in ALS, we used whole genome sequencing data from Project MinE data freeze 2. &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; copy numbers of 6,375 patients with ALS and 2,412 controls were called from whole genome sequencing data, and the reliability of the calls was tested with multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy number distribution of &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; between cases and controls did not show any statistical differences (binomial multivariate logistic regression &lt;i&gt;SMN1 p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.54 and &lt;i&gt;SMN2 p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.49). In addition, the copy number of &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; did not associate with patient survival (Royston‐Parmar; &lt;i&gt;SMN1 p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.78 and &lt;i&gt;SMN2 p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.23) or age at onset (Royston‐Parmar; &lt;i&gt;SMN1 p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.75 and &lt;i&gt;SMN2 p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.63).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our well‐powered study, there was no association of SMN1 or SMN2 copy numbers with the risk of ALS or ALS disease severity. This suggests that changing SMN protein levels in the physiological range may not modify ALS disease course. This is an important finding in the light of emerging therapies targeted at SMN deficiencies. ANN NEUROL 2021&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limbic encephalitis (LE) comprises a spectrum of inflammatory changes in affected brain structures including the presence of autoantibodies and lymphoid cells. However, the potential of distinct lymphocyte subsets alone to elicit key clinicopathological sequelae of LE potentially inducing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with chronic spontaneous seizures and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we scrutinized pathogenic consequences emerging from CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells targeting hippocampal neurons by recombinant adeno‐associated virus‐mediated expression of the model‐autoantigen ovalbumin (OVA) in CA1 neurons of OT‐I/RAG1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice (termed &quot;OVA‐CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LE model&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral‐mediated antigen transfer caused dense CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell infiltrates confined to the hippocampal formation starting on day 5 after virus transduction. Flow cytometry indicated priming of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in brain‐draining lymph nodes preceding hippocampal invasion. At the acute model stage, the inflammatory process was accompanied by frequent seizure activity and impairment of hippocampal memory skills. Magnetic resonance imaging scans at day 7 of the OVA‐CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LE model revealed hippocampal edema and blood–brain barrier disruption that converted into atrophy until day 40. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells specifically targeted OVA‐expressing, SIINFEKL‐H‐2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–positive CA1 neurons and caused segmental apoptotic neurodegeneration, astrogliosis, and microglial activation. At the chronic model stage, mice exhibited spontaneous recurrent seizures and persisting memory deficits, and the sclerotic hippocampus was populated with CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells escorted by NK cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that a CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell–initiated attack of distinct hippocampal neurons is sufficient to induce LE converting into TLE‐HS. Intriguingly, the role of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells exceeds neurotoxic effects and points to their major pathogenic role in TLE following LE. ANN NEUROL 2021&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Feature selection for a given model can be transformed into an optimization
task. The essential idea behind it is to find the most suitable subset of
features according to some criterion. Nature-inspired optimization can mitigate
this problem by producing compelling yet straightforward solutions when dealing
with complicated fitness functions. Additionally, new mathematical
representations, such as quaternions and octonions, are being used to handle
higher-dimensional spaces. In this context, we are introducing a meta-heuristic
optimization framework in a hypercomplex-based feature selection, where
hypercomplex numbers are mapped to real-valued solutions and then transferred
onto a boolean hypercube by a sigmoid function. The intended hypercomplex
feature selection is tested for several meta-heuristic algorithms and
hypercomplex representations, achieving results comparable to some
state-of-the-art approaches. The good results achieved by the proposed approach
make it a promising tool amongst feature selection research.

 &lt;p&gt;We introduce optimal energy shaping as an enhancement of classical
passivity-based control methods. A promising feature of passivity theory,
alongside stability, has traditionally been claimed to be intuitive performance
tuning along the execution of a given task. However, a systematic approach to
adjust performance within a passive control framework has yet to be developed,
as each method relies on few and problem-specific practical insights. Here, we
cast the classic energy-shaping control design process in an optimal control
framework; once a task-dependent performance metric is defined, an optimal
solution is systematically obtained through an iterative procedure relying on
neural networks and gradient-based optimization. The proposed method is
validated on state-regulation tasks.

 &lt;p&gt;Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically-inspired counterpart of
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) which, owing to its strong theoretical
guarantees and the locality in space of its learning rule, fosters the design
of energy-efficient hardware dedicated to learning. In practice, however, EP
does not scale to visual tasks harder than MNIST. In this work, we show that a
bias in the gradient estimate of EP, inherent in the use of finite nudging, is
responsible for this phenomenon and that cancelling it allows training deep
ConvNets by EP, including architectures with distinct forward and backward
connections. These results highlight EP as a scalable approach to compute error
gradients in deep neural networks, thereby motivating its hardware
implementation.

 &lt;p&gt;Experimental manipulations perturb the neuronal activity. This phenomenon is
manifested in the fMRI response. Dynamic causal model and its variants can
model these neuronal responses along with the BOLD responses [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] .
Physiologically-informed DCM (P-DCM) [5] gives state-of-the-art results in this
aspect. But, P-DCM has more parameters compared to the standard DCM model and
the stability of this particular model is still unexplored. In this work, we
will try to explore the stability of the P-DCM model and find the ranges of the
model parameters which make it stable.

 &lt;p&gt;This article introduces a multiple classifier method to improve the
performance of concatenate-designed neural networks, such as ResNet and
DenseNet, with the purpose to alleviate the pressure on the final classifier.
We give the design of the classifiers, which collects the features produced
between the network sets, and present the constituent layers and the activation
function for the classifiers, to calculate the classification score of each
classifier. We use the L2 normalization method to obtain the classifier score
instead of the Softmax normalization. We also determine the conditions that can
enhance convergence. As a result, the proposed classifiers are able to improve
the accuracy in the experimental cases significantly, and show that the method
not only has better performance than the original models, but also produces
faster convergence. Moreover, our classifiers are general and can be applied to
all classification related concatenate-designed network models.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Accurate and efficient source analysis in electro- and magnetoencephalography
using sophisticated realistic head geometries requires advanced numerical
approaches. This paper presents DUNEuro, a free and open source C++ software
toolbox for forward modeling in bioelectromagnetism. Building upon the DUNE
framework, it provides implementations of modern fitted and unfitted finite
element methods to efficiently solve the forward problems in electro- and
magnetoencephalography. The user can choose between a variety of different
source models that are implemented. The software's aim is to provide interfaces
that are extendible and easy-to-use. In order to enable a closer integration
into existing analysis pipelines, interfaces to Python and Matlab are provided.
The practical use is demonstrated by a source analysis example of somatosensory
evoked potentials using a realistic six compartment head model.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04488"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We propose a method to optimize the representation and distinguishability of
samples from two probability distributions, by maximizing the estimated power
of a statistical test based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). This
optimized MMD is applied to the setting of unsupervised learning by generative
adversarial networks (GAN), in which a model attempts to generate realistic
samples, and a discriminator attempts to tell these apart from data samples. In
this context, the MMD may be used in two roles: first, as a discriminator,
either directly on the samples, or on features of the samples. Second, the MMD
can be used to evaluate the performance of a generative model, by testing the
model's samples against a reference data set. In the latter role, the optimized
MMD is particularly helpful, as it gives an interpretable indication of how the
model and data distributions differ, even in cases where individual model
samples are not easily distinguished either by eye or by classifier.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Biological development is often described as a dynamic, emergent process. This is evident across a variety of phenomena, from the temporal organization of cell types in the embryo to compounding trends that affect large-scale differentiation. To better understand this, we propose combining quantitative investigations of biological development with theory-building techniques. This provides an alternative to the gene-centric view of development: namely, the view that developmental genes and their expression determine the complexity of the developmental phenotype. Using the model system &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;, we examine time-dependent properties of the embryonic phenotype and utilize the unique life-history properties to demonstrate how these emergent properties can be linked together by data analysis and theory-building. We also focus on embryogenetic differentiation processes, and how terminally-differentiated cells contribute to structure and function of the adult phenotype. Examining embryogenetic dynamics from 200 to 400 min post-fertilization provides basic quantitative information on developmental tempo and process. To summarize, theory construction techniques are summarized and proposed as a way to rigorously interpret our data. Our proposed approach to a formal data representation that can provide critical links across life-history, anatomy and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ensuring proper dosage of treatment and repetition over time is a major challenge in neurorehabilitation. However, a requirement of physical distancing to date compromises their achievement. While mostly associated to COVID-19, physical distancing is not only required in a pandemic scenario, but also advised for several clinical conditions (e.g. immunocompromised individuals) or forced for specific social contexts (e.g. people living in remote areas worldwide). All these contexts advocate for the implementation of alternative healthcare models. The objective of this perspective is to highlight the benefits of remote administration of rehabilitative treatment, namely telerehabilitation, in counteracting physical distancing barriers in neurorehabilitation. Sustaining boosters of treatment outcome, such as compliance, sustainability, as well as motivation, telerehabilitation may adapt to multiple neurological conditions, with the further advantage of a high potential for individualization to patient’s or pathology’s specificities. The effectiveness of telerehabilitation can be potentiated by several technologies available to date: virtual reality can recreate realistic environments in which patients may bodily operate, wearable sensors allow to quantitatively monitor the patient’s performance, and signal processing may contribute to the prediction of long-term dynamics of patient recovery. Telerehabilitation might spark its advantages far beyond the mere limitation of physical distancing effects, mitigating criticalities of daily neurorehabilitative practice, and thus paving the way to the envision of mixed models of care, where hospital-based procedures are complementarily integrated with telerehabilitative ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One of the central goals in systems neuroscience is to understand how information is encoded in the brain, and the standard approach is to identify the relation between a stimulus and a neural response. However, the feature of a stimulus is typically defined by the researcher's hypothesis, which may cause biases in the research conclusion. To demonstrate potential biases, we simulate four likely scenarios using deep neural networks trained on the image classification dataset CIFAR-10 and demonstrate the possibility of selecting suboptimal/irrelevant features or overestimating the network feature representation/noise correlation. Additionally, we present studies investigating neural coding principles in biological neural networks to which our points can be applied. This study aims to not only highlight the importance of careful assumptions and interpretations regarding the neural response to stimulus features but also suggest that the comparative study between deep and biological neural networks from the perspective of machine learning can be an effective strategy for understanding the coding principles of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aggregation and deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in extracellular plaques and in the cerebral vasculature are prominent neuropathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and closely associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Amyloid plaques in the brains of most AD patients and transgenic mouse models exhibit heterogeneity in the composition of Aβ deposits, due to the occurrence of elongated, truncated, and post-translationally modified Aβ peptides. Importantly, changes in the deposition of these different Aβ variants are associated with the clinical disease progression and considered to mark sequential phases of plaque and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) maturation at distinct stages of AD. We recently showed that Aβ phosphorylated at serine residue 26 (pSer26Aβ) has peculiar characteristics in aggregation, deposition, and neurotoxicity. In the current study, we developed and thoroughly validated novel monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that recognize Aβ depending on the phosphorylation-state of Ser26. Our results demonstrate that selected phosphorylation state-specific antibodies were able to recognize Ser26 phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Aβ with high specificity in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western Blotting (WB) assays. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analyses with these antibodies demonstrated the occurrence of pSer26Aβ in transgenic mouse brains that show differential deposition as compared to non-phosphorylated Aβ (npAβ) or other modified Aβ species. Notably, pSer26Aβ species were faintly detected in extracellular Aβ plaques but most prominently found intraneuronally and in cerebral blood vessels. In conclusion, we developed new antibodies to specifically differentiate Aβ peptides depending on the phosphorylation state of Ser26, which are applicable in ELISA, WB, and immunofluorescence staining of mouse brain tissues. These site- and phosphorylation state-specific Aβ antibodies represent novel tools to examine phosphorylated Aβ species to further understand and dissect the complexity in the age-related and spatio-temporal deposition of different Aβ variants in transgenic mouse models and human AD brains.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Clinical studies have found that some Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients suffer from Cushing’s syndrome (CS). CS is caused by the long-term release of excess glucocorticoids (GCs) from the adrenal gland, which in turn, impair brain function and induce dementia. Thus, we investigated the mechanism of the effect of corticosterone (CORT) on the development and progression of AD in a preclinical model. Specifically, the plasma CORT levels of 9-month-old APP/PS1 Tg mice were abnormally increased, suggesting an association between GCs and AD. Long-term administration of CORT accelerated cognitive dysfunction by increasing the production and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ). The mechanism of action of CORT treatment involved stimulation of the expression of BACE-1 and presenilin (PS) 1 in in vitro and in vivo. This observation was confirmed in mice with adrenalectomy (ADX), which had lower levels of GCs. Moreover, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediated the effects of CORT on the stimulation of the expression of BACE-1 and PS1 via the PKA and CREB pathways in neuroblastoma N2a cells. In addition to these mechanisms, CORT can induce a cognitive decline in APP/PS1 Tg mice by inducing apoptosis and decreasing the differentiation of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a disease that potentially threatens a large segment of high-altitude populations during extended living at altitudes above 2,500 m. Patients with CMS suffer from severe hypoxemia, excessive erythrocytosis and neurologic deficits. The cellular mechanisms underlying CMS neuropathology remain unknown. We previously showed that iPSC-derived CMS neurons have altered mitochondrial dynamics and increased susceptibility to hypoxia-induced cell death. Genome analysis from the same population identified many ER stress-related genes that play an important role in hypoxia adaptation or lack thereof. In the current study, we showed that iPSC-derived CMS neurons have increased expression of ER stress markers Grp78 and XBP1s under normoxia and hyperphosphorylation of PERK under hypoxia, alleviating ER stress does not rescue the hypoxia-induced CMS neuronal cell death. Akt is a cytosolic regulator of ER stress with PERK as a direct target of Akt. CMS neurons exhibited lack of Akt activation and lack of increased Parkin expression as compared to non-CMS neurons under hypoxia. By enhancing Akt activation and Parkin overexpression, hypoxia-induced CMS neuronal cell death was reduced. Taken together, we propose that increased Akt activation protects non-CMS from hypoxia-induced cell death. In contrast, impaired adaptive mechanisms including failure to activate Akt and increase Parkin expression render CMS neurons more susceptible to hypoxia-induced cell death.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;Brain iron accumulation has been suggested as a pathomechanism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with cognitive impairment. This research aims to examine the total-brain pattern of iron accumulation in relation to executive function decline in patients with T2DM by voxel-based quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 32 patients with T2DM and 34 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent brain magnetic resonance examination, and 48 individuals underwent cognitive function assessments. Imaging data were collected with three-dimensional fast low-angle shot sequences to achieve magnitude as well as phase images. Using voxel-based QSM analysis, we compared the voxel-wise susceptibility values of the whole brain among groups and explored whether the susceptibility values had correlations with cognitive data.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Among the 66 participants, cognitive function was estimated in 23 patients with T2DM (11 males and 12 females; average age, 64.65 ± 8.44 years) and 25 HCs (13 males and 12 females; average age, 61.20 ± 7.62 years). T2DM patients exhibited significantly (t = 4.288, P &amp;lt; 0.001) lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores [T2DM, 27 (27, 28); HCs, 29 (28, 29); normal standard ≥ 26)] and higher Trail-making Test (TMT)-A/TMT-B scores [71 (51, 100)/185 (149, 260)] than HCs [53 (36.5, 63.5)/150 (103, 172.5)] (Z = 2.612, P = 0.009; Z = 2.797, P = 0.005). Subjects with T2DM showed significantly higher susceptibility values than HCs in the caudate/putamen/pallidum, frontal inferior triangular gyrus, and precentral gyrus on the right hemisphere. In contrast (HC &amp;gt; T2DM), no region showed a significant difference in susceptibility values between the groups. The correlation analysis between susceptibility values and cognitive function scores was tested by voxel-based susceptibility value with sex and age as covariates. After multiple comparison correction, in T2DM patients, the left thalamus showed a significant relationship with TMT-A (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.53, P = 0.001). The right thalamus and left thalamus showed a significant relationship with TMT-B (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.35, P = 0.019; and R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.38, P = 0.017, respectively). In HCs, the cluster of right precentral/middle frontal gyrus/inferior frontal gyrus/inferior triangular gyrus showed a significant relationship with TMT-B (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.59, P = 0.010). No relationship was found between the susceptibility values with MoCA in the brain region in both two groups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with T2DM presented declined cognitive assessments and elevated iron deposition in the striatum and frontal lobe, suggesting that executive function decline in T2DM might be associated with the cerebral iron burden and that changes in susceptibility values may represent a latent quantitative imaging marker for early assessment of cognitive decline in patients with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are often contaminated by electromyographic (EMG) artifacts, especially when recording during movement. Existing methods to remove EMG artifacts include independent component analysis (ICA), and other high-order statistical methods. However, these methods can not effectively remove most of EMG artifacts. Here, we proposed a modified ICA model for EMG artifacts removal in the EEG, which is called EMG Removal by Adding Sources of EMG (ERASE). In this new approach, additional channels of real EMG from neck and head muscles (reference artifacts) were added as inputs to ICA in order to “force” the most power from EMG artifacts into a few independent components (ICs). The ICs containing EMG artifacts (the “artifact ICs”) were identified and rejected using an automated procedure. ERASE was validated first using both simulated and experimentally-recorded EEG and EMG. Simulation results showed ERASE removed EMG artifacts from EEG significantly more effectively than conventional ICA. Also, it had a low false positive rate and high sensitivity. Subsequently, EEG was collected from 8 healthy participants while they moved their hands to test the realistic efficacy of this approach. Results showed that ERASE successfully removed EMG artifacts (on average, about 75% of EMG artifacts were removed when using real EMGs as reference artifacts) while preserving the expected EEG features related to movement. We also tested the ERASE procedure using simulated EMGs as reference artifacts (about 63% of EMG artifacts removed). Compared to conventional ICA, ERASE removed on average 26% more EMG artifacts from EEG. These findings suggest that ERASE can achieve significant separation of EEG signal and EMG artifacts without a loss of the underlying EEG features. These results indicate that using additional real or simulated EMG sources can increase the effectiveness of ICA in removing EMG artifacts from EEG. Combined with automated artifact IC rejection, ERASE also minimizes potential user bias. Future work will focus on improving ERASE so that it can also be used in real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the nervous system has been extensively used in neurorehabilitation due to its capacity to engage the muscle fibers, improving muscle tone, and the neural pathways, sending afferent volleys toward the brain. Although different neuroimaging tools suggested the capability of NMES to regulate the excitability of sensorimotor cortex and corticospinal circuits, how the intensity and dose of NMES can neuromodulate the brain oscillatory activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG) is still unknown to date. We quantified the effect of NMES parameters on brain oscillatory activity of 12 healthy participants who underwent stimulation of wrist extensors during rest. Three different NMES intensities were included, two below and one above the individual motor threshold, fixing the stimulation frequency to 35 Hz and the pulse width to 300 μs. Firstly, we efficiently removed stimulation artifacts from the EEG recordings. Secondly, we analyzed the effect of amplitude and dose on the sensorimotor oscillatory activity. On the one hand, we observed a significant NMES intensity-dependent modulation of brain activity, demonstrating the direct effect of afferent receptor recruitment. On the other hand, we described a significant NMES intensity-dependent dose-effect on sensorimotor activity modulation over time, with below-motor-threshold intensities causing cortical inhibition and above-motor-threshold intensities causing cortical facilitation. Our results highlight the relevance of intensity and dose of NMES, and show that these parameters can influence the recruitment of the sensorimotor pathways from the muscle to the brain, which should be carefully considered for the design of novel neuromodulation interventions based on NMES.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Seizures are among the most common neurological sequelae of stroke, and diabetes notably increases the incidence of post-ischemic seizures. Recent studies have indicated that Sestrin3 (SESN3) is a regulator of a proconvulsant gene network in human epileptic hippocampus. But the association of SESN3 and post-ischemic seizures in diabetes remains unclear. The present study aimed to reveal the involvement of SESN3 in seizures following transient cerebral ischemia in diabetes. Diabetes was induced in adult male mice and rats via intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Forebrain ischemia (15 min) was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, the 2-vessel occlusion (2VO) in mice and 4-vessel occlusion (4VO) in rats. Our results showed that 59% of the diabetic wild-type mice developed seizures after ischemia while no seizures were observed in non-diabetic mice. Although no apparent cell death was detected in the hippocampus of seizure mice within 24 h after the ischemic insult, the expression of SESN3 was significantly increased in seizure diabetic mice after ischemia. The post-ischemic seizure incidence significantly decreased in SESN3 knockout mice. Furthermore, all diabetic rats suffered from post-ischemic seizures and non-diabetic rats have no seizures. Electrophysiological recording showed an increased excitatory synaptic transmission and intrinsic membrane excitability in dentate granule cells of the rat hippocampus, together with decreased I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; currents and Kv4.2 expression levels. The above results suggest that SESN3 up-regulation may contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure generation in diabetic animals after ischemia. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanism of SESN3 in seizure generation after ischemia in diabetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM) suggests that space, time, and quantities are processed through a generalized magnitude system. ATOM posits that task-irrelevant magnitudes interfere with the processing of task-relevant magnitudes as all the magnitudes are processed by a common system. Many behavioral and neuroimaging studies have found support in favor of a common magnitude processing system. However, it is largely unknown whether such cross-domain monotonic mapping arises from a change in the accuracy of the magnitude judgments or results from changes in precision of the processing of magnitude. Therefore, in the present study, we examined whether large numerical magnitude affects temporal accuracy or temporal precision, or both. In other words, whether numerical magnitudes change our temporal experience or simply bias duration judgments. The temporal discrimination (between comparison and standard duration) paradigm was used to present numerical magnitudes (“1,” “5,” and “9”) across varied durations. We estimated temporal accuracy (PSE) and precision (Weber ratio) for each numerical magnitude. The results revealed that temporal accuracy (PSE) for large (9) numerical magnitude was significantly lower than that of small (1) and identical (5) magnitudes. This implies that the temporal duration was overestimated for large (9) numerical magnitude compared to small (1) and identical (5) numerical magnitude, in line with ATOM’s prediction. However, no influence of numerical magnitude was observed on temporal precision (Weber ratio). The findings of the present study suggest that task-irrelevant numerical magnitude selectively affects the accuracy of processing of duration but not duration discrimination itself. Further, we argue that numerical magnitude may not directly affect temporal processing but could influence via attentional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human development has become particularly complex during the evolution. In this complexity, adolescence is an extremely important developmental stage. Adolescence is characterized by biological and social changes that create the prerequisites to psychopathological problems, including both substance and non-substance addictive behaviors. Central to the dynamics of the biological changes during adolescence are the synergy between sexual and neurophysiological development, which activates the motivational/emotional systems of Dominance/Submission. The latter are characterized by the interaction between the sexual hormones, the dopaminergic system and the stress axis (HPA). The maturation of these motivational/emotional systems requires the integration with the phylogenetically more recent Attachment/CARE Systems, which primarily have governed the subject’s relationships until puberty. The integration of these systems is particularly complex in the human species, due to the evolution of the process of competition related to sexual selection: from a simple fight between two individuals (of the same genus and species) to a struggle for the acquisition of a position in rank and the competition between groups. The latter is an important evolutionary acquisition and believed to be the variable that has most contributed to enhancing the capacity for cooperation in the human species. The interaction between competition and cooperation, and between competition and attachment, characterizes the entire human relational and emotional structure and the unending work of integration to which the BrainMind is involved. The beginning of the integration of the aforementioned motivational/emotional systems is currently identified in the prepubertal period, during the juvenile stage, with the development of the Adrenarche—the so-called Adrenal Puberty. This latter stage is characterized by a low rate of release of androgens, the hormones released by the adrenal cortex, which activate the same behaviors as those observed in the PLAY system. The Adrenarche and the PLAY system are biological and functional prerequisites of adolescence, a period devoted to learning the difficult task of integrating the phylogenetically ancient Dominance/Submission Systems with the newer Attachment/CARE Systems. These systems accompany very different adaptive goals which can easily give rise to mutual conflict and can in turn make the balance of the BrainMind precarious and vulnerable to mental suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;While many publications have reported brain hemodynamic responses to decision-making under various conditions of risk, no inventory management scenarios, such as the newsvendor problem (NP), have been investigated in conjunction with neuroimaging. In this study, we hypothesized (I) that NP stimulates the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) joined with frontal polar area (FPA) significantly in the human brain, and (II) that local brain network properties are increased when a person transits from rest to the NP decision-making phase. A 77-channel functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system with wide field-of-view (FOV) was employed to measure frontal cerebral hemodynamics in response to NP in 27 healthy human subjects. NP-induced changes in oxy-hemoglobin concentration, Δ[HbO], were investigated using a general linear model (GLM) and graph theory analysis (GTA). Significant activation induced by NP was shown in both DLPFC and OFC+FPA across all subjects. Specifically, higher risk NP with low-profit margins (LM) activated left-DLPFC but deactivated right-DLPFC in 14 subjects, while lower risk NP with high-profit margins (HM) stimulated both DLPFC and OFC+FPA in 13 subjects. The local efficiency, clustering coefficient, and path length of the network metrics were significantly enhanced under NP decision making. In summary, multi-channel fNIRS enabled us to identify DLPFC and OFC+FPA as key cortical regions of brain activations when subjects were making inventory-management risk decisions. We demonstrated that challenging NP resulted in the deactivation within right-DLPFC due to higher levels of stress. Also, local brain network properties were increased when a person transitioned from the rest phase to the NP decision-making phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mood disorder patients have greater suicide risk than members of the general population, but how suicidal behavior relates to brain functions has not been fully elucidated. This study investigated how functional connectivity (FC) values between the right/left amygdala and the whole brain relate to suicidal behavior in patients with mood disorder. The participants in this study were 100 mood disorder patients with suicidal behavior (SB group), 120 mood disorder patients with non-suicidal behavior (NSB group), and 138 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC group). Whole-brain FC values among the three groups were compared using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Compared to the NSB and HC groups, increased FC values in the right amygdala-bilateral paracentral lobule/precuneus circuit were observed in the SB group (Bonferroni-corrected, p &amp;lt; 0.017). The FC values in the NSB group did not differ significantly from those in the HC group (Bonferroni-corrected, p &amp;gt; 0.017). Moreover, there were no significant differences in FC values between mood disorder patients with suicide attempt (SA group) and mood disorder patients with suicidal ideation (SI group), while the FC values between the right amygdala and bilateral paracentral lobule/precuneus in the SA group were higher than the mean in the SI group. These findings suggest that right amygdala-paracentral lobule/precuneus dysfunction has an important role in patients with mood disorder and suicidal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are characterized by attenuated pulmonary function and are frequently reported with cognitive impairments, especially memory impairments. The mechanism underlying the memory impairments still remains unclear. We applied resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) to compare the brain local activities with static and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (sALFF, dALFF) among patients with COPD (n = 32) and healthy controls (HC, n = 30). Compared with HC, COPD patients exhibited decreased sALFF in the right basal ganglia and increased dALFF in the bilateral parahippocampal/hippocampal gyrus. The reduced the left basal ganglia was associated with lower oxygen partial pressure. Besides, the increased dALFF in the left hippocampal/parahippocampal cortex was associated with poor semantic-memory performance and the increased dALFF in the left hippocampal/parahippocampal cortex was associated the forced vital capacity. The present study revealed the abnormal static and dynamic local-neural activities in the basal ganglia and parahippocampal/hippocampal cortex in COPD patient and its relationship with poor lung function and semantic-memory impairments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Granule cells (GCs) are the most numerous cell type in the cerebellum and indeed, in the brain: at least 99% of all cerebellar neurons are granule cells. In this review article, we first consider the formation of the upper rhombic lip, from which all granule cell precursors arise, and the way by which the upper rhombic lip generates the external granular layer, a secondary germinal epithelium that serves to amplify the upper rhombic lip precursors. Next, we review the mechanisms by which postmitotic granule cells are generated in the external granular layer and migrate radially to settle in the granular layer. In addition, we review the evidence that far from being a homogeneous population, granule cells come in multiple phenotypes with distinct topographical distributions and consider ways in which the heterogeneity of granule cells might arise during development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent experimental results on spike avalanches measured in the urethane-anesthetized rat cortex have revealed scaling relations that indicate a phase transition at a specific level of cortical firing rate variability. The scaling relations point to critical exponents whose values differ from those of a branching process, which has been the canonical model employed to understand brain criticality. This suggested that a different model, with a different phase transition, might be required to explain the data. Here we show that this is not necessarily the case. By employing two different models belonging to the same universality class as the branching process (mean-field directed percolation) and treating the simulation data exactly like experimental data, we reproduce most of the experimental results. We find that subsampling the model and adjusting the time bin used to define avalanches (as done with experimental data) are sufficient ingredients to change the apparent exponents of the critical point. Moreover, experimental data is only reproduced within a very narrow range in parameter space around the phase transition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Homeostatic plasticity plays important role in regulating synaptic and intrinsic neuronal function to stabilize output following perturbations to circuit activity. In glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease of the visual system commonly associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), the early disease is associated with altered synaptic inputs to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), changes in RGC intrinsic excitability, and deficits in optic nerve transport and energy metabolism. These early functional changes can precede RGC degeneration and are likely to alter RGC outputs to their target structures in the brain and thereby trigger homeostatic changes in synaptic and neuronal properties in those brain regions. In this study, we sought to determine whether and how neuronal and synaptic function is altered in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), an important RGC projection target in the thalamus, and how functional changes related to IOP. We accomplished this using patch-clamp recordings from thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons in the dLGN in two established mouse models of glaucoma—the DBA/2J (D2) genetic mouse model and an inducible glaucoma model with intracameral microbead injections to elevate IOP. We found that the intrinsic excitability of TC neurons was enhanced in D2 mice and these functional changes were mirrored in recordings of TC neurons from microbead-injected mice. Notably, many neuronal properties were correlated with IOP in older D2 mice, when IOP rises. The frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) was reduced in 9-month-old D2 mice, and vGlut2 staining of RGC synaptic terminals was reduced in an IOP-dependent manner. These data suggest that glaucoma-associated changes to neuronal excitability and synaptic inputs in the dLGN might represent a combination of both stabilizing/homeostatic plasticity and pathological dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: The terminal branches of the trigeminal nerve in meninges are supposed to be the origin site of migraine pain. The main function of these peripheral sensory axons is the initiation and propagation of spikes in the orthodromic direction to the second order neurons in the brainstem. The stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion induces the release of the neuropeptide CGRP in meninges suggesting the antidromic propagation of excitation in these fibers. However, the direct evidence on antidromic spike traveling in meningeal afferents is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: By recording of spikes from peripheral or central parts of the trigeminal nerve in rat meninges, we explored their functional activity and tested the expression of ATP-, serotonin-, and capsaicin-gated receptors in the distal vs. proximal parts of these nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We show the significant antidromic propagation of spontaneous spikes in meningeal nerves which was, however, less intense than the orthodromic nociceptive traffic due to higher number of active fibers in the latter. Application of ATP, serotonin and capsaicin induced a high frequency nociceptive firing in peripheral processes while, in central parts, only ATP and capsaicin were effective. Disconnection of nerve from trigeminal ganglion dramatically reduced the tonic antidromic activity and attenuated the excitatory action of ATP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our data indicate the bidirectional nociceptive traffic and dissimilar expression of P2X, 5-HT and TRPV1 receptors in proximal vs. distal parts of meningeal afferents, which is important for understanding the peripheral mechanisms of migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The dentate granule cells (DGCs) play a crucial role in learning and memory. Many studies have described the role and physiological properties of these sparsely active neurons using different behavioral contexts. However, the morpho-functional features of DGCs recruited in mice maintained in their home cage (without training), considered as a baseline condition, have not yet been established. Using fosGFP transgenic mice, we observed ex vivo that DGCs recruited in animals maintained in the home cage condition are mature neurons that display a longer dendritic tree and lower excitability compared with non-activated cells. The higher GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated shunting inhibition contributes to the lower excitability of DGCs activated in the home environment by shifting the input resistance towards lower values. Remarkably, that shunting inhibition is neither observed in non-activated DGCs nor in DGCs activated during training in virtual reality. In short, our results suggest that strong shunting inhibition and reduced excitability could constitute a distinctive neural signature of mature DGCs recruited in the context of the home environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The goal of sensory processing is to represent the environment of an animal. All sensory systems share a similar constraint: they need to encode a wide range of stimulus magnitudes within their narrow neuronal response range. The most efficient way, exploited by even the simplest nervous systems, is to encode relative changes in stimulus magnitude rather than the absolute magnitudes. For instance, the retina encodes contrast, which are the variations of light intensity occurring in time and in space. From this perspective, it is easy to understand why the bright plumage of a moving bird gains a lot of attention, while an octopus remains motionless and mimics its surroundings for concealment. Stronger contrasts simply cause stronger visual signals. However, the gains in retinal performance associated with higher contrast are far more than what can be attributed to just a trivial linear increase in signal strength. Here we discuss how this improvement in performance is reflected throughout different parts of the neural circuitry, within its neural code and how high contrast activates many non-linear mechanisms to unlock several sophisticated retinal computations that are virtually impossible in low contrast conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia affects more than 1% of the world’s population and shows very high heterogeneity in the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms experienced by patients. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying this neurodevelopmental disorder are largely unknown, although it is proposed to emerge from multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. In this work, we explore the potential alterations in the developing blood vessel network which could contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Specifically, we discuss how the vascular network evolves during early postnatal life and how genetic and environmental risk factors can lead to detrimental changes. Blood vessels, capillaries in particular, constitute a dynamic and complex infrastructure distributing oxygen and nutrients to the brain. During postnatal development, capillaries undergo many structural and anatomical changes in order to form a fully functional, mature vascular network. Advanced technologies like magnetic resonance imaging and near infrared spectroscopy are now enabling to study how the brain vasculature and its supporting features are established in humans from birth until adulthood. Furthermore, the contribution of the different neurovascular unit elements, including pericytes, endothelial cells, astrocytes and microglia, to proper brain function and behavior, can be dissected. This investigation conducted among different brain regions altered in schizophrenia, such as the prefrontal cortex, may provide further evidence that schizophrenia can be considered a neurovascular disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) may present retinal changes before brain pathology, suggesting the retina as an accessible biomarker of AD. The present work is a diachronic study using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to determine the total retinal thickness and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in an APP&lt;sup&gt;NL−F/NL−F&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model of AD at 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, and 20 months old compared to wild type (WT) animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Total retinal thickness and RNFL thickness were determined. The mean total retinal thickness was analyzed following the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study sectors. RNFL was measured in six sectors of axonal ring scans around the optic nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the APP&lt;sup&gt;NL−F/NL−F&lt;/sup&gt; group compared to WT animals, the total retinal thickness changes observed were the following: (i) At 6-months-old, a significant thinning in the outer temporal sector was observed; (ii) at 15-months-old a significant thinning in the inner temporal and in the inner and outer inferior retinal sectors was noticed; (iii) at 17-months-old, a significant thickening in the inferior and nasal sectors was found in both inner and outer rings; and (iv) at 20-months-old, a significant thinning in the inner ring of nasal, temporal, and inferior retina and in the outer ring of superior and temporal retina was seen. In RNFL thickness, there was significant thinning in the global analysis and in nasal and inner-temporal sectors at 6 months old. Thinning was also found in the supero-temporal and nasal sectors and global value at 20 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: In the APP&lt;sup&gt;NL−F/NL−F&lt;/sup&gt; AD model, the retinal thickness showed thinning, possibly produced by neurodegeneration alternating with thickening caused by deposits and neuroinflammation in some areas of the retina. These changes over time are similar to those observed in the human retina and could be a biomarker for AD. The APP&lt;sup&gt;NL−F/NL−F&lt;/sup&gt; AD model may help us better understand the different retinal changes during the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;The present study seeks to provide an overview of executive (inhibition and flexibility) deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD) by combining a cognitive and behavioral approach.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifteen PD patients and 15 healthy controls underwent a neuropsychological and behavioral assessment including the Hayling and Trails Tests, the Questionnaire for Impulsive–Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease (QUIP-RS), the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-A), and the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). The level of awareness of executive functioning was also analyzed. We finally explored how these neuropsychological and clinical outcomes could relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;PD patients performed significantly worse in both neuropsychological tasks designed to evaluate inhibition abilities. They also reported more inhibition difficulties in everyday life and poorer quality of life. Associations between neuropsychological measures and self-reports were found. Moreover, as indicated by the discrepancy score, PD patients were as accurate as their relatives in self-reporting their executive daily difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Inhibition and cognitive flexibility impairments assessed by the neuropsychological tests (Hayling and Trails tests) seem to capture daily life executive problems in PD. Furthermore, our study provides a deeper understanding of PD patients’ and their relatives’ experience of these executive dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although very different in etiology and symptoms, numerous neurodegenerative diseases can be classified as proteinopathies. More so, evidence indicates that the key misfolded proteins at the basis of different neuropathies might share common mechanisms of propagation. As such, the prion-like spreading of protein aggregates through the neural network is subject of intensive research focus and requires adequate models. Here, we made use of the well-defined architecture and large accessibility of the visual system, of which the retinotopic connections represent a simple route of anterograde signaling and an elegant model to investigate transsynaptic, prion-like spreading. In two independent studies, uptake and seeding of alpha-synuclein and tau were examined after intravitreal injection of preformed fibrils. However, extracellular matrix components in the vitreous space and at the vitreoretinal surface appeared to act as a barrier for the entry of both fibrils into the retina. These results show that further experimental refinement is needed to fully realize the potential of the visual system as a model for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of anterograde, transsynaptic spreading of prion-like proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent research on Parkinson's disease (PD) has demonstrated the topological abnormalities of structural covariance networks (SCNs) using various morphometric features from structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI). However, the sulcal depth (SD)-based SCNs have not been investigated. In this study, we used SD to investigate the topological alterations of SCNs in 60 PD patients and 56 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). SCNs were constructed by thresholding SD correlation matrices of 68 regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Compared with HC, PD patients showed increased normalized clustering coefficient and normalized path length, as well as a reorganization of degree-based and betweenness-based hubs (i.e., less frontal hubs). Moreover, the degree distribution analysis showed more high-degree nodes in PD patients. In addition, we also found the increased assortativity and reduced robustness under a random attack in PD patients compared to HC. Taken together, these findings indicated an abnormal topological organization of SD-based SCNs in PD patients, which may contribute in understanding the pathophysiology of PD at the network level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;To explore the retinal vascular density changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruit 62 AD patients, 47 MCI patients, and 49 cognitively healthy controls (HC) in this study. All participants in the study received a comprehensive ophthalmological and neurological evaluation, including global cognitive screening, as well as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and completed the following eye examinations: visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), examination with slit-lamp, fundus photography (Version 1.5.0.0, NIDEK CO, LTD) and Optical coherence tomography imaging (software ReVue version 2017.1.0.155, Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, United States). The visual rating scales for atrophy and white matter lesion in MRI was evaluated for all the patients with AD and MCI.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the AD patient group, the superficial vascular density in the superior, inferior and whole retina was 44.64 ± 3.34, 44.65 ± 3.55, and 44.66 ± 3.36, respectively. These values were 44.24 ± 3.15, 43.72 ± 3.16, and 44 ± 3.07, respectively, in the MCI patient group. After multivariate analysis of the generalized linear model, adjustments for the confounding factors of sex, age, hypertension, diabetes and the quality index of OCTA image, the superficial vascular density in the AD and MCI patient groups was significantly lower than that in the HC group (P &amp;lt; 0.05): 46.94 ± 2.04, 46.67 ± 2.26, and 46.82 ± 2.08, respectively. No difference in the area of the FAZ among the three groups was observed (AD group: 0.34 ± 0.11 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; MCI group: 0.36 ± 0.12 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; control group: 0.33 ± 0.12 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p &amp;gt; 0.05). The ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness, inner parafovea thickness, and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (p-RNFL) thickness were associated with the superficial vascular density. We found no significant correlation between the global cognition (MMSE scores) or between the Fazekas score and retinal OCT angiogram flow density.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The superficial vascular density in the AD and MCI patient groups was significantly lower than that in the HC group. Our findings suggest the retinal microvascular dysfunction occurred in MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Human cells are equipped with a plethora of antiviral proteins protecting them against invading viral pathogens. In contrast to apoptotic or pyroptotic cell death, which serves as ultima ratio to combat viral infections, these cell-intrinsic restriction factors may prevent or at least slow down viral spread while allowing the host cell to survive. Nevertheless, their antiviral activity may also have detrimental effects on the host. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity of restriction factors are frequently well investigated, potential undesired effects of their antiviral functions on the host cell are hardly explored. With a focus on antiretroviral proteins, we summarize in this review how individual restriction factors may exert adverse effects as trade-off for efficient defense against attacking pathogens.</content>

 When bacterial cells come in contact, antagonism mediated by the delivery of toxins frequently ensues. The potential for such encounters to have long-term beneficial consequences in recipient cells has not been investigated. Here we examined the effects of intoxication by DddA, a cytosine deaminase delivered via the type VI secretion system (T6SS) of &lt;i&gt;Burkholderia cenocepacia&lt;/i&gt;. Despite its killing potential, we observed that several bacterial species resist DddA and instead accumulate mutations. These mutations can lead to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, indicating that even in the absence of killing, interbacterial antagonism can have profound consequences on target populations. Investigation of additional toxins from the deaminase superfamily revealed that mutagenic activity is a common feature of these proteins, including a representative we show targets single-stranded DNA and displays a markedly divergent structure. Our findings suggest that a surprising consequence of antagonistic interactions between bacteria could be the promotion of adaptation via the action of directly mutagenic toxins.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Sepsis is a dynamic state that progresses at variable rates and has life-threatening consequences. Staging patients along the sepsis timeline requires a thorough knowledge of the evolution of cellular and molecular events at the tissue level. Here, we investigated the kidney, an organ central to the pathophysiology of sepsis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing in a murine endotoxemia model revealed the involvement of various cell populations to be temporally organized and highly orchestrated. Endothelial and stromal cells were the first responders. At later time points, epithelial cells upregulated immune-related pathways while concomitantly downregulating physiological functions such as solute homeostasis. Sixteen hours after endotoxin, there was global cell–cell communication failure and organ shutdown. Despite this apparent organ paralysis, upstream regulatory analysis showed significant activity in pathways involved in healing and recovery.

 Amoeboid cells are fundamental to animal biology and broadly distributed across animal diversity, but their evolutionary origin is unclear. The closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellates, display a polarized cell architecture (with an apical flagellum encircled by microvilli) that closely resembles that of epithelial cells and suggests homology, but this architecture differs strikingly from the deformable phenotype of animal amoeboid cells. Here, we show that choanoflagellates subjected to confinement differentiate into an amoeboid form by retracting their flagella and activating myosin-based motility. This switch allows escape from confinement and is conserved across choanoflagellate diversity. The conservation of the amoeboid cell phenotype across animals and choanoflagellates, together with the conserved role of myosin, is consistent with the homology of amoeboid motility in both lineages. We hypothesize that the differentiation between animal epithelial and crawling cells might have evolved from a stress-induced phenotypic switch between flagellate and amoeboid forms in their single-celled ancestors.</content>

 Under high light, oxygenic photosynthetic organisms avoid photodamage by thermally dissipating absorbed energy, which is called non-photochemical quenching. In green algae, a chlorophyll and carotenoid-binding protein, light-harvesting complex stress-related (LHCSR3), detects excess energy via a pH drop and serves as a quenching site. Using a combined in vivo and in vitro approach, we investigated quenching within LHCSR3 from &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.&lt;/i&gt; In vitro two distinct quenching processes, individually controlled by pH and zeaxanthin, were identified within LHCSR3. The pH-dependent quenching was removed within a mutant LHCSR3 that lacks the residues that are protonated to sense the pH drop. Observation of quenching in zeaxanthin-enriched LHCSR3 even at neutral pH demonstrated zeaxanthin-dependent quenching, which also occurs in other light-harvesting complexes. Either pH- or zeaxanthin-dependent quenching prevented the formation of damaging reactive oxygen species, and thus the two quenching processes may together provide different induction and recovery kinetics for photoprotection in a changing environment.</content>

 Nutrient-dependent body size plasticity differs between the sexes in most species, including mammals. Previous work in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; showed that body size plasticity was higher in females, yet the mechanisms underlying increased female body size plasticity remain unclear. Here, we discover that a protein-rich diet augments body size in females and not males because of a female-biased increase in activity of the conserved insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS). This sex-biased upregulation of IIS activity was triggered by a diet-induced increase in &lt;i&gt;stunted&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in females, and required &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;insulin-like peptide&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;, illuminating new sex-specific roles for these genes. Importantly, we show that sex determination gene &lt;i&gt;transformer&lt;/i&gt; promotes the diet-induced increase in &lt;i&gt;stunted&lt;/i&gt; mRNA via transcriptional coactivator Spargel to regulate the male-female difference in body size plasticity. Together, these findings provide vital insight into conserved mechanisms underlying the sex difference in nutrient-dependent body size plasticity.</content>

 Early-life microbiota has been linked to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. It has been hypothesized that maternal vaginal microbiota is an important initial seeding source and therefore might have lifelong effects on disease risk. To understand maternal vaginal microbiota’s role in seeding the child’s microbiota and the extent of delivery mode-dependent transmission, we studied 665 mother–child dyads from the COPSAC&lt;sub&gt;2010&lt;/sub&gt; cohort. The maternal vaginal microbiota was evaluated twice in the third trimester and compared with the children’s fecal (at 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year of age) and airway microbiota (at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months). Based on the concept of weighted transfer ratios (WTRs), we have identified bacterial orders for which the WTR displays patterns indicate persistent or transient transfer from the maternal vaginal microbiome, as well as orders that are shared at later time points independent of delivery mode, indicating a common reservoir.</content>

 The mechanical challenge of attaching elastic tendons to stiff bones is solved by the formation of a unique transitional tissue. Here, we show that murine tendon-to-bone attachment cells are bi-fated, activating a mixture of chondrocyte and tenocyte transcriptomes, under regulation of shared regulatory elements and Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) transcription factors. High-throughput bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of humeral attachment cells revealed expression of hundreds of chondrogenic and tenogenic genes, which was validated by in situ hybridization and single-molecule ISH. ATAC sequencing showed that attachment cells share accessible intergenic chromatin areas with either tenocytes or chondrocytes. Epigenomic analysis revealed enhancer signatures for most of these regions. Transgenic mouse enhancer reporter assays verified the shared activity of some of these enhancers. Finally, integrative chromatin and motif analyses and transcriptomic data implicated KLFs as regulators of attachment cells. Indeed, blocking expression of both &lt;i&gt;Klf2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; in developing limb mesenchyme impaired their differentiation.</content>

 A functional benefit of attention is to proactively enhance perceptual sensitivity in space and time. Although attentional orienting has traditionally been associated with cortico-thalamic networks, recent evidence has indicated that individuals with cerebellar degeneration (CD) show reduced reaction time benefit from temporal cues that entail an interval-based representation. While this deficit might merely reflect impairment in anticipatory motor preparation, it is also possible that the cerebellum contributes to the temporal modulation of perceptual sensitivity. To examine this, we tested CD participants on a non-speeded challenging perceptual discrimination task, asking if they benefit from temporal cues. Strikingly, the CD group showed no duration-specific perceptual sensitivity benefit when temporal orienting relied on isolated interval representation, while showing a comparable benefit to controls when the cues were defined by rhythmic sequences. This dissociation further specifies the functional domain of the cerebellum, establishing its role in the attentional adjustment of perceptual sensitivity in time.</content>

 Projections between the thalamus and sensory cortices are established early in development and play an important role in sleep regulation as well as in relaying sensory information to cortex. Atypical thalamocortical functional connectivity frequently observed in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) might therefore be linked to sensory and sleep problems common in ASD. Here we investigated the relationship between auditory-thalamic functional connectivity measured during natural sleep fMRI, sleep problems, and sound sensitivities in 70 toddlers and preschoolers (1.5 to 5-year-olds) with ASD compared to a matched group of 46 typically developing (TD) children. In children with ASD, sleep problems and sensory sensitivities were positively correlated, and increased sleep latency was associated with overconnectivity between the thalamus and auditory cortex in a subsample with high quality MRI data (n=29). Additionally, auditory cortex BOLD signal amplitude was elevated in children with ASD, potentially reflecting reduced sensory gating or a lack of auditory habituation during natural sleep. These findings indicate that atypical thalamocortical functional connectivity can be detected early in development and may play a crucial role in sleep problems and sensory sensitivities in ASD.</content>

 Several neuroimaging studies have shown the somatotopy of body part representations in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), but the functional hierarchy of distinct subregions in human S1 has not been adequately addressed. The current study investigates the functional hierarchy of cyto-architectonically distinct regions, Brodmann areas BA3, BA1, and BA2, in human S1. During functional MRI experiments, we presented participants with vibrotactile stimulation of the fingertips at 3 different vibration frequencies. Using population Receptive Field (pRF) modeling of the fMRI BOLD activity, we identified the hand region in S1 and the somatotopy of the fingertips. For each voxel, the pRF center indicates the finger that most effectively drives the BOLD signal, and the pRF size measures the spatial somatic pooling of fingertips. We find a systematic relationship of pRF sizes from lower-order areas to higher-order areas. Specifically, we found that pRF sizes are smallest in BA3, increase slightly towards BA1, and are largest in BA2, paralleling the increase in visual receptive field size as one ascends the visual hierarchy. Additionally, we find that the time-to-peak of the hemodynamic response in BA3 is roughly 0.5s earlier compared to BA1 and BA2, further supporting the notion of a functional hierarchy of subregions in S1. These results were obtained during stimulation of different mechanoreceptors, suggesting that different afferent fibers leading up to S1 feed into the same cortical hierarchy.</content>

 Learning-induced neuroplastic changes, further modulated by content and setting, are mirrored in brain functional connectivity. Animal models emphasized the crucial role of serotonin in neuroplasticity particularly for emotional relearning, but comparable studies in humans are scarce. Assessing the translation of learning effects from animals to humans, 99 healthy subjects underwent six weeks of emotional or semantic learning and subsequent relearning and three resting-state acquisitions for functional connectivity estimation. During relearning, subjects received either a daily dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram or placebo. The influence of escitalopram on functional connectivity was connection- and learning content-dependent, with potentiation of decreases during emotional and increases during semantic learning. The directedness of these effects indicates serotonergic modulation of emotional feedback routes. These results demonstrate that escitalopram intake during relearning facilitates content-dependent network adaptations and support the conclusion that enhanced neuroplasticity might be the major underlying mechanism in psychiatric therapies.</content>

 Cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers play critical regulatory roles in modulating gene expression during brain development. The development of massively parallel reporter assays has enabled high-throughput functional screening of candidate DNA sequences for enhancer activity. Tissue-specific screening of in vivo enhancer function at scale has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of the role of non-coding sequences in development, evolution, and disease. Here, we adapted the self-transcribing regulatory element MPRA strategy for delivery to early postnatal mouse brain via recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). We identify putative enhancers capable of driving reporter gene expression in mouse forebrain, including regulatory elements within an intronic CACNA1C linkage disequilibrium block associated with risk in neuropsychiatric disorder genetic studies. In vivo functional testing of putative enhancers, as we demonstrate here, will be critical toward characterizing regulatory activity of enhancers and understanding how enhancer sequences organize gene expression in normal and pathogenic brain development.</content>

 Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests a role for amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) in Alzheimer's disease, yet many anti-A{beta} treatments are clinically ineffective. Regional heterogeneity of efficacy may contribute to these disappointing results. Here we compared the regiospecificity of various anti-A{beta} treatments by combining focused electrophoretic whole-brain clearing, amyloid labelling and light-sheet imaging with whole-brain analyses of plaque topology in A{beta}-overexpressing mice. A{beta} plaque numbers progressed from around 1'200'000 to 2'500'000 over a 9-month period. We then assessed the regiospecific plaque clearance in mice subjected to {beta}-secretase inhibition, amyloid intercalation by polythiophenes, and anti-A{beta} antibodies. Each treatment showed unique spatiotemporal A{beta} clearance signatures, with polythiophenes emerging as potent anti-A{beta} compounds with promising pharmacokinetic properties and the anti-A{beta} antibody showing only minor effects. By aligning (25 um)^3 voxels that showed drug effectiveness to spatial transcriptomics atlases, we identified genes matching regiospecific A{beta} clearance. As expected, Bace1 expression was highly correlated with the regiospecific efficacy of BACE inhibition. In addition, we found that voxels cleared by polythiophenes correlated with transcripts encoding synaptic proteins, whereas voxels cleared by BACE inhibition correlated with oligodendrocyte-specific genes. The differential regional susceptibility of distinct plaque populations to specific treatments may explain the clinical failure of anti-A{beta} therapies, and suggests that combinatorial regimens may improve functional outcomes.</content>

 Animals learn certain complex tasks remarkably fast, sometimes after a single experience. What behavioral algorithms support this efficiency? Many contemporary studies based on two-alternative-forced-choice (2AFC) tasks observe only slow or incomplete learning. As an alternative, we study the unconstrained behavior of mice in a complex labyrinth and measure the dynamics of learning and the behaviors that enable it. A mouse in the labyrinth makes ~2000 navigation decisions per hour. The animal quickly discovers the location of a reward in the maze and executes correct 10-bit choices after only 10 reward experiences - a learning rate 1000-fold higher than in 2AFC experiments. Many mice improve discontinuously from one minute to the next, suggesting moments of sudden insight about the structure of the labyrinth. The underlying search algorithm does not require a global memory of places visited and is largely explained by purely local turning rules.</content>

 Deep neural networks (DNN) models have the potential to provide new insights in the study of human decision making, due to their high capacity and data-driven design. While these models may be able to go beyond theory-driven models in predicting human behaviour, their opaque nature limits their ability to explain how an operation is carried out. This explainability problem remains unresolved. Here we demonstrate the use of a DNN model as an exploratory tool to identify predictable and consistent human behaviour in value-based decision making beyond the scope of theory-driven models. We then propose using theory-driven models to characterise the operation of the DNN model. We trained a DNN model to predict human decisions in a four-armed bandit task. We found that this model was more accurate than a reinforcement-learning reward-oriented model geared towards choosing the most rewarding option. This disparity in accuracy was more pronounced during times when the expected reward from all options was similar, i.e., no unambiguous good option. To investigate this disparity, we introduced a reward-oblivious model, which was trained to predict human decisions without information about the rewards obtained from each option. This model captured decision-sequence patterns made by participants (e.g., a-b-c-d). In a series of experimental offline simulations of all models we found that the general model was in line with a reward-oriented model's predictions when one option was clearly better than the others. However, when options' expected rewards were similar to each other, it was in-line with the reward-oblivious model's pattern completion predictions. These results indicate the contribution of predictable but task-irrelevant decision patterns to human decisions, especially when task-relevant choices are not immediately apparent. Importantly, we demonstrate how theory-driven cognitive models can be used to characterise the operation of DNNs, making them a useful explanatory tool in scientific investigation.</content>

 Recent studies have illuminated the importance of several key signaling pathways in regulating the dynamic surveillance and phagocytic activity of microglia. Yet little is known about how these signals result in the assembly of phagolysosomal machinery near targets of phagocytosis, especially in processes distal from the microglial soma. Neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes locally regulate protein translation within distal processes. Therefore, we tested whether there is regulated local translation within peripheral microglia processes (PeMPs). We show that PeMPs contain ribosomes which engage in de novo protein synthesis, and these associate with a subpool of transcripts involved in pathogen defense, motility, and phagocytosis. Using a live slice preparation, we further show that acute translation blockade impairs the formation of PeMP phagocytic cups, the localization of lysosomal proteins within them, and phagocytosis. Collectively, these data argue for a regulated local translation in PeMPs and indicate a need for new translation to support dynamic microglial function.</content>

 Large-scale recordings of neural activity are providing new opportunities to study network-level dynamics. However, the sheer volume of data and its dynamical complexity are critical barriers to uncovering and interpreting these dynamics. Deep learning methods are a promising approach due to their ability to uncover meaningful relationships from large, complex, and noisy datasets. When applied to high-D spiking data from motor cortex (M1) during stereotyped behaviors, they offer improvements in the ability to uncover dynamics and their relation to subjects behaviors on a millisecond timescale. However, applying such methods to less-structured behaviors, or in brain areas that are not well-modeled by autonomous dynamics, is far more challenging, because deep learning methods often require careful hand-tuning of complex model hyperparameters (HPs). Here we demonstrate AutoLFADS, a large-scale, automated model-tuning framework that can characterize dynamics in diverse brain areas without regard to behavior. AutoLFADS uses distributed computing to train dozens of models simultaneously while using evolutionary algorithms to tune HPs in a completely unsupervised way. This enables accurate inference of dynamics out-of-the-box on a variety of datasets, including data from M1 during stereotyped and free-paced reaching, somatosensory cortex during reaching with perturbations, and frontal cortex during cognitive timing tasks. We present a cloud software package and comprehensive tutorials that enable new users to apply the method without needing dedicated computing resources.</content>

 In this study, we merged methods from machine learning and human neuroimaging to causally test the role of self-induced affect states in biasing the affective perception of subsequent image stimuli. To test this causal relationship, we developed a novel paradigm in which (n=40) healthy adult participants observed multivariate neural decodings of their real-time functional magnetic resonance image (rtfMRI) responses as feedback to guide explicit regulation of their brain (and corollary affect processing) state towards a positive valence goal state. By this method, individual differences in affect regulation ability were controlled. Attaining this brain-affect goal state triggered the presentation of pseudo-randomly selected affectively congruent (positive valence) or incongruent (negative valence) image stimuli drawn from the International Affective Picture Set. Separately, subjects passively viewed randomly triggered positively and negatively valenced image stimuli during fMRI acquisition. Multivariate neural decodings of the affect processing induced by these stimuli were modeled using the task trial type (state- versus randomly-triggered) as the fixed-effect of a general linear mixed effects model. Random effects were modeled subject-wise. We found that self-induction of a positive affective valence state significantly positively biased the perceived valence of subsequent stimuli. As a manipulation check, we validated affective state induction achieved by the image stimuli using independent psychophysiological response measures of hedonic valence and autonomic arousal. We also validated the predictive fidelity of the trained neural decoding models for brain states induced by an out-of-sample set of image stimuli. Beyond its contribution to our understanding of the neural mechanisms that bias affect processing, this work demonstrated the viability of novel experimental paradigms triggered by pre-defined affective cognitive states. This line of individual differences experimentation potentially provides scientists with a valuable tool for causal exploration of the roles and identities of intrinsic cognitive processing mechanisms that shape our perceptual processing of sensory stimuli.</content>

 How humans visually select where to grasp an object depends on many factors, including grasp stability and preferred grasp configuration. We examined how endpoints are selected when these two factors are brought into conflict: Do people favor stable grasps or do they prefer their natural grasp configurations? Participants reached to grasp one of three cuboids oriented so that its two corners were either aligned with, or rotated away from, each individual's natural grasp axis (NGA). All objects were made of brass (mass: 420 g) but the surfaces of their sides were manipulated to alter friction: 1) all-brass, 2) two opposing sides covered with wood, while the other two remained of brass, or 3) two opposing sides covered with sandpaper, and the two remaining brass sides smeared with vaseline. Grasps were evaluated as either clockwise (thumb to the left of finger in frontal plane) or counterclockwise of the NGA. Grasp endpoints depended on both object orientation and surface material. For the all-brass object, grasps were bimodally distributed in the NGA-aligned condition but predominantly clockwise in the NGA-unaligned condition. These data reflected participants' natural grasp configuration independently of surface material. When grasping objects with different surface materials, endpoint selection changed: Participants sacrificed their usual grasp configuration to choose the more stable object sides. A model in which surface material shifts participants' preferred grip angle proportionally to the perceived friction of the surfaces accounts for our results. Our findings demonstrate that a stable grasp is more important than a biomechanically comfortable grasp configuration.</content>

 Lower family income during childhood is related to increased rates of adolescent depression, though the specific mechanisms are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that individuals with depression demonstrate hypoactivation in brain regions involved in reward learning and decision-making processes (e.g., portions of the prefrontal cortex). Separately, lower family income has been associated with neural alterations in similar regions. We examined associations between family income, depression, and brain activity during a reward learning and decision-making fMRI task in a sample of adolescents (full n=94; usable n=78; mean age=15.4 years). We identified neural regions representing 1) expected value (EV), the learned subjective value of an object, and 2) prediction error, the difference between EV and the actual outcome received. Regions of interest related to reward learning were examined in connection to childhood family income and parent-reported adolescent depressive symptoms. As hypothesized, lower activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate (sACC) for EV in response to approach stimuli was associated with lower childhood family income, as well as greater symptoms of depression measured one-year after the neuroimaging session. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that lower early family income leads to disruptions in reward and decision-making brain circuitry, which leads to adolescent depression.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Learning from error is often a slow process. To accelerate learning, previous motor adaptation studies have focused on explicit factors such as reward or punishment, but the results have been inconsistent. Here, we considered the idea that a movement error carries an implicit cost for the organism because the act of correcting for error consumes time and energy. If this implicit cost could be modulated, it may robustly alter how the brain learns from error. To vary the cost of error, we considered a simple saccade adaptation task but combined it with motion discrimination: movement errors resulted in corrective saccades, but those corrections took time away from acquiring information in the discrimination task. We then modulated error cost using coherence of the discrimination task and found that when error cost was large, pupil diameter increased, and the brain learned more from error. However, when error cost was small, the pupil constricted, and the brain learned less from the same error. Thus, during sensorimotor adaptation, the act of correcting for error carried an implicit cost for the brain. Modulating this cost affects how the brain learns from error.</content>

 This report describes the principal outcomes of an Impact Acceleration Account project (grant number EP/I000992/1) between the University of Surrey and Transport for London carried out between Oct. 2019 and Mar. 2020. The aim of the project was to compare the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Fatigue Risk tool with SAFTE and other more recent models of fatigue, where fatigue here primarily means a reduced ability to function effectively and efficiently as a result of inadequate sleep. We have not sought to discuss the useability of the HSE Fatigue Risk tool or SAFTE since this has been discussed comprehensively elsewhere, we have instead focussed on the fundamental principles underlying the models. All current biomathematical models have limitations and make asumptions that are not always evident from the accompanying documentation. Since full details of the HSE Fatigue Risk tool and the SAFTE model are not publicly available, Sections 1 and 2 give a mathematical description of the equations that we believe underlie each of these models. A comparison of predictions made by our versions of the HSE and SAFTE equations for one particular shift schedule of relevance to the UK and global tunnelling and construction industries is shown in Section 3. In this comparison, we use data collected durings TfL's Crossrail project by Dragados. Crossrail is the biggest railway infrastructure project in Europe and is one of the largest single investments undertaken in the UK. It is a joint venture between TfL and the UK Department of Transport. Construction started in 2009 and intensive operational testing is expected to take place in 2021. The project included digging 42 kilometres of new rail tunnel under London. Dragados was one of two engineering companies responsible for tunnelling. Essentially, both models give broadly the same message for the schedule we looked at, but the ability to display fatigue as it develops within a shift is a strength of SAFTE. A summary of the strengths and limitations of the use of these kind of scheduling tools is given in the final section, Section 4. Limitations include: (i) Models do not describe fatigue during times when people are not in shift (e.g. driving home). However, they could readily be extended to do so. (ii) Models assume people start well-rested. This is not always a good assumption and can lead to an under-estimate of fatigue. (iii) Most models are currently based on population averages, but there are large individual different. It would be possible to further develop models to include uncertainty in fatigue predictions associated with individual differences. (iv) Few models include the light environment, which is important both to promote short-term alertness and facilitate circadian alignment. (v) Models are not transparent, which makes them hard to independently validate. (vi) It is hard to relate the outputs of current models to measureable outcomes in the field. We also discuss briefly recent developments in mathematical modelling of fatigue and possible future directions. These include (i) Guidance on scheduling and education on sleep and fatigue should be considered at least as important as current biomathematical models. (ii) Only by analysing and integrating high quality individual data on sleep, fatigue, performance, near misses, accidents, actual shift patterns with models can we develop better models and management systems to reduce fatigue and associated risks. Wearables combined with apps present a great opportunity to collect data at scale but need to be used appropriately. (iii) The importance of making time for sleep is not always recognised. Education, early diagnosis of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, and self-monitoring all have a role to play in reducing fatigue-related risk in the work-place. Section 3 and Section 4 may be understood without reading the intermediate more mathematical sections.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Affective touch is necessary for proper neurodevelopment and sociability. However, it is still unclear how the neurons innervating the skin detect affective and social behaviours. To clarify this matter, we targeted a specific population of somatosensory neurons in mice, named C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), that appears particularly well suited physiologically and anatomically to perceive affective and social touch but whose contribution to these processes has not yet been resolved. Our observations revealed that C-LTMRs functional deficiency from birth induced social isolation and reduced tactile interactions in adults. Conversely, transient increase in C-LTMRs excitability in adults using chemogenetics was rewarding, temporally promoted touch seeking behaviours and thus had pro-social effects on group dynamics. This work provides the first empirical evidence that specific peripheral inputs alone can drive complex social behaviour, demonstrating the existence of a specialised neuronal circuit originating from the skin wired to promote interaction with other individuals.</content>

 Impaired detection of causal relationships between actions and their outcomes can lead to maladaptive behavior. However, causal roles of specific prefrontal cortex (PFC) sub-regions and the caudate nucleus in mediating such relationships in primates are unclear. We inactivated and over-activated five PFC sub-regions, reversibly and pharmacologically: areas 24 (perigenual anterior cingulate cortex), 32 (medial PFC), 11 (anterior orbitofrontal cortex, OFC), 14 (rostral ventromedial PFC/medial OFC) and 14-25 (caudal ventromedial PFC), and the anteromedial caudate, to examine their role in expressing learned action-outcome contingencies using a contingency degradation paradigm in marmosets. Area 24 or caudate inactivation impaired the response to contingency change, while area 11 inactivation enhanced it, and inactivation of areas 14, 32 or 14-25 had no effect. Over-activation of areas 11 and 24 impaired this response. These findings demonstrate distinct roles of PFC sub-regions in goal-directed behavior and illuminate the candidate neurobehavioral substrates of psychiatric disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Sex and age influence gonadal steroid hormone receptor distributions relative to estrogen receptor β‐containing neurons in the mouse hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8d910d04-c9fa-4905-99a8-27cbaf079c2b/cne25093-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light and electron microscopic studies reveal that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear (a) and extranuclear (b) gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner. AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; GPER, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), estrogen receptor (ER) β and other gonadal hormone receptors play a role in central cardiovascular processes. However, the influence of sex and age on the cellular and subcellular relationships of ERβ with ERα, G‐protein ER (GPER1), as well as progestin and androgen receptors (PR and AR) in the PVN is uncertain. In young (2‐ to 3‐month‐old) females and males, ERβ‐enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) containing neurons were approximately four times greater than ERα‐labeled and PR‐labeled nuclei in the PVN. In subdivisions of the PVN, young females, compared to males, had: (1) more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in neuroendocrine rostral regions; (2) fewer ERα‐labeled nuclei in neuroendocrine and autonomic projecting medial subregions; and (3) more ERα‐labeled nuclei in an autonomic projecting caudal region. In contrast, young males, compared to females, had approximately 20 times more AR‐labeled nuclei, which often colocalized with ERβ‐EGFP in neuroendocrine (approximately 70%) and autonomic (approximately 50%) projecting subregions. Ultrastructurally, in soma and dendrites, PVN ERβ‐EGFP colocalized primarily with extranuclear AR (approximately 85% soma) and GPER1 (approximately 70% soma). Aged (12‐ to 24‐month‐old) males had more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in a rostral neuroendocrine subregion compared to aged females and females with accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) and in a caudal autonomic subregion compared to post‐AOF females. Late‐aged (18‐ to 24‐month‐old) females compared to early‐aged (12‐ to 14‐month‐old) females and AOF females had fewer AR‐labeled nuclei in neuroendrocrine and autonomic projecting subregions. These findings indicate that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear and extranuclear gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Fitting stochastic transmission models to electronic patient data can offer detailed insights into the transmission of healthcare-associated infections and improve infection control. Pathogen whole-genome sequencing may improve the precision of model inferences, but computational constraints have limited modelling applications predominantly to small datasets and specific outbreaks, whereas large-scale sequencing studies have mostly relied on simple rules for identifying/excluding plausible transmission. We present a novel approach for integrating detailed epidemiological data on patient contact networks in hospitals with large-scale pathogen sequencing data. We apply our approach to study &lt;i&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/i&gt; transmission using a dataset of 1223 infections in Oxfordshire, UK, 2007–2011. 262 (21% [95% credibility interval 20–22%]) infections were estimated to have been acquired from another known case. There was heterogeneity by sequence type (ST) in the proportion of cases acquired from another case with the highest rates in ST1 (ribotype-027), ST42 (ribotype-106) and ST3 (ribotype-001). These same STs also had higher rates of transmission mediated via environmental contamination/spores persisting after patient discharge/recovery; for ST1 these persisted longer than for most other STs except ST3 and ST42. We also identified variation in transmission between hospitals, medical specialties and over time; by 2011 nearly all transmission from known cases had ceased in our hospitals. Our findings support previous work suggesting only a minority of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;difficile&lt;/i&gt; infections are acquired from known cases but highlight a greater role for environmental contamination than previously thought. Our approach is applicable to other healthcare-associated infections. Our findings have important implications for effective control of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;difficile&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JhQfgigtbI4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mosaic animals have provided the platform for many fundamental discoveries in developmental biology, cell biology, and other fields. Techniques to produce mosaic animals by mitotic recombination have been extensively developed in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; but are less common for other laboratory organisms. Here, we report mosaic analysis by gRNA-induced crossing-over (MAGIC), a new technique for generating mosaic animals based on DNA double-strand breaks produced by CRISPR/Cas9. MAGIC efficiently produces mosaic clones in both somatic tissues and the germline of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Further, by developing a MAGIC toolkit for 1 chromosome arm, we demonstrate the method’s application in characterizing gene function in neural development and in generating fluorescently marked clones in wild-derived &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; strains. Eliminating the need to introduce recombinase-recognition sites in the genome, this simple and versatile system simplifies mosaic analysis in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and can in principle be applied in any organism that is compatible with CRISPR/Cas9.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/A900WxWZhIY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The Mediator multiprotein complex functions as a regulator of RNA polymerase II‐catalyzed gene transcription. In this study, exome sequencing (ES) detected biallelic putative disease‐causing variants in &lt;i&gt;MED27&lt;/i&gt;, encoding Mediator Complex Subunit 27, in sixteen patients from eleven families with a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome. Patient phenotypes are highly homogeneous including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, axial hypotonia with distal spasticity, dystonic movements, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Seizures and cataracts were noted in severely affected individuals. Identification of multiple patients with biallelic &lt;i&gt;MED27&lt;/i&gt; variants supports the critical role of MED27 in normal human neural development, particularly for the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Neuronal localization of m1 muscarinic receptor immunoreactivity in the monkey basolateral amygdala&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3bfc833b-32d6-4a9a-8ad5-4be6f076a8bf/cne25104-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using antibodies to calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) as a marker for pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the monkey basolateral amygdala (BNC) it was shown that virtually all PNs in the BNC express type 1 muscarinic receptors (m1Rs). Additional studies indicated that one‐third of inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and 60% of parvalbumin immunoreactive INs (PV) were also m1R+. These results indicate that expression of m1Rs in BNC INs is greater in the monkey versus the rat.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basolateral nuclear complex (BNC) of the amygdala plays an important role in the generation of emotional/motivational behavior and the consolidation of emotional memories. Activation of M1 cholinergic receptors (M1Rs) in the BNC is critical for memory consolidation. Previous receptor binding studies in the monkey amygdala demonstrated that the BNC has a high density of M1Rs, but did not have sufficient resolution to identify which neurons in the BNC expressed them. This was accomplished in the present immunohistochemical investigation using an antibody for the m1 receptor (m1R). Analysis of m1Rs in the monkey BNC using immunoperoxidase techniques revealed that their expression was very dense in the BNC, and suggested that virtually all of the pyramidal projection neurons (PNs) in all of the BNC nuclei were m1R‐immunoreactive (m1R+). This was confirmed with dual‐labeling immunofluorescence using staining for calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) as a marker for BNC PNs. However, additional dual‐labeling studies indicated that one‐third of inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were also m1R+. Moreover, the finding that 60% of parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactive neurons were m1R+ indicated that this IN subpopulation was the main GAD+ subpopulation exhibiting m1R expression. The cholinergic innervation of the amygdala is greatly reduced in Alzheimer's disease and there is currently considerable interest in developing selective M1R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) to treat the symptoms. The results of the present study indicate that M1Rs in both PNs and INs in the primate BNC would be targeted by M1R PAMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We study the recognition capabilities of the Hopfield model with auxiliary
hidden layers, which emerge naturally upon a Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation. We show that the recognition capabilities of such a model at
zero-temperature outperform those of the original Hopfield model, due to a
substantial increase of the storage capacity and the lack of a naturally
defined basin of attraction. The modified model does not fall abruptly in a
regime of complete confusion when memory load exceeds a sharp threshold.

 &lt;p&gt;Graph theoretical analyses of nervous systems usually omit the aspect of
connection polarity, due to data insufficiency. The chemical synapse network of
Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-reconstructed directed network, but the signs
of its connections are yet to be elucidated. Here, we present the gene
expression-based sign prediction of the ionotropic chemical synapse connectome
of C. elegans (3,638 connections and 20,589 synapses total), incorporating
available presynaptic neurotransmitter and postsynaptic receptor gene
expression data for three major neurotransmitter systems. We made predictions
for more than two-thirds of these chemical synapses and observed an
excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) ratio close to 4:1 which was found similar to that
observed in many real-world networks. Our open source tool
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://EleganSign.linkgroup.hu&quot;&gt;this http URL&lt;/a&gt;) is simple but efficient in predicting
polarities by integrating neuronal connectome and gene expression data.

 &lt;p&gt;Medical brain image analysis is a necessary step in Computer Assisted /Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) systems. Advancements in both hardware and software in the past
few years have led to improved segmentation and classification of various
diseases. In the present work, we review the published literature on systems
and algorithms that allow for classification, identification, and detection of
White Matter Hyperintensities (WMHs) of brain MRI images specifically in cases
of ischemic stroke and demyelinating diseases. For the selection criteria, we
used the bibliometric networks. Out of a total of 140 documents we selected 38
articles that deal with the main objectives of this study. Based on the
analysis and discussion of the revised documents, there is constant growth in
the research and proposal of new models of deep learning to achieve the highest
accuracy and reliability of the segmentation of ischemic and demyelinating
lesions. Models with indicators (Dice Score, DSC: 0.99) were found, however
with little practical application due to the uses of small datasets and lack of
reproducibility. Therefore, the main conclusion is to establish
multidisciplinary research groups to overcome the gap between CAD developments
and their complete utilization in the clinical environment.

 &lt;p&gt;A sufficient amount of annotated data is required to fine-tune pre-trained
language models for downstream tasks. Unfortunately, attaining labeled data can
be costly, especially for multiple language varieties/dialects. We propose to
self-train pre-trained language models in zero- and few-shot scenarios to
improve the performance on data-scarce dialects using only resources from
data-rich ones. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in the context of
Arabic sequence labeling by using a language model fine-tuned on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA) only to predict named entities (NE) and part-of-speech
(POS) tags on several dialectal Arabic (DA) varieties. We show that
self-training is indeed powerful, improving zero-shot MSA-to-DA transfer by as
large as \texttildelow 10\% F$_1$ (NER) and 2\% accuracy (POS tagging). We
acquire even better performance in few-shot scenarios with limited labeled
data. We conduct an ablation experiment and show that the performance boost
observed directly results from the unlabeled DA examples for self-training and
opens up opportunities for developing DA models exploiting only MSA resources.
Our approach can also be extended to other languages and tasks.

 &lt;p&gt;The disjunctively constrained knapsack problem consists in packing a subset
of pairwisely compatible items in a capacity-constrained knapsack such that the
total profit of the selected items is maximized while satisfying the knapsack
capacity. DCKP has numerous applications and is however computationally
challenging (NP-hard). In this work, we present a threshold search based
memetic algorithm for solving the DCKP that combines the memetic framework with
threshold search to find high quality solutions. Extensive computational
assessments on two sets of 6340 benchmark instances in the literature
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive compared to the
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we report 24 and 354 improved
best-known results (new lower bounds) for Set I (100 instances) and for Set II
(6240 instances), respectively. We analyze the key algorithmic components and
shed lights on their roles for the performance of the algorithm. The code of
our algorithm will be made publicly available.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We investigated the vestibular perception of position, velocity, and time (duration) in humans with rotational stimuli including low velocities and small amplitudes. The participants were categorized into young, middle, and old age groups, and each consisted of 10 subjects. Position perception was assessed after yaw rotations ranged from 30 to 180° in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. For each position, the rotation was delivered at two or more different velocities ranging from 15 to 120°/s. Position perception tended to underestimate the actual position and was similar during the slow and fast rotations. However, the trends of underestimation disappeared in the old age group. Velocity perception was evaluated by forcing the selection of the faster direction in each pair of rotations toward two positions (30° and 60°) with velocity differences from 0 to 20°/s. Velocity discrimination was similar between the rotation amplitudes or among the age groups. For duration perception, participants chose the rotation of longer duration for three test paradigms with different amplitudes (small vs. large) and durations (short vs. long) of rotation. The accuracy of discriminating duration was similar across the test paradigms or age groups, but the precision was lower in the older group and altered significantly according to the test paradigm. In conclusion, vestibular perception can be assessed using rotations of low velocities and small amplitudes. The perception of position and duration is affected by aging. The precision of duration perception can be influenced by the interactions between the amplitude and duration of motion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, but the pathomechanism is largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyse the molecular mechanisms contributing to synaptic alterations in hippocampi of adolescent rats exposed prenatally to MIA. MIA was evoked in pregnant female rats by i.p. administration of lipopolysaccharide at gestation day 9.5. Hippocampi of offspring (52–53-days-old rats) were analysed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), qPCR and Western blotting. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential, activity of respiratory complexes, and changes in glutathione system were measured. It was found that MIA induced changes in hippocampi morphology, especially in the ultrastructure of synapses, including synaptic mitochondria, which were accompanied by impairment of mitochondrial electron transport chain and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. These phenomena were in agreement with increased generation of reactive oxygen species, which was evidenced by a decreased reduced/oxidised glutathione ratio and an increased level of dichlorofluorescein (DCF) oxidation. Activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β on Ser9 occurred, leading to its inhibition and, accordingly, to hypophosphorylation of microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT). Abnormal phosphorylation and dysfunction of MAPT, the manager of the neuronal cytoskeleton, harmonised with changes in synaptic proteins. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating widespread synaptic changes in hippocampi of adolescent offspring prenatally exposed to MIA.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Over the past decades, the human life span has dramatically increased, and therefore, a steady increase in diseases associated with age (such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease) is expected. In these neurodegenerative diseases, there is a cognitive decline and memory loss, which accompany increased systemic inflammation, the inflamm-aging, and the insulin resistance. Despite numerous studies of age-related pathologies, data on the contribution of brain insulin resistance and innate immunity components to aging are insufficient. Recently, much research has been focused on the consequences of nutrients and adiposity- and nutrient-related signals in brain aging and cognitive decline. Moreover, given the role of metainflammation in neurodegeneration, lifestyle interventions such as calorie restriction may be an effective way to break the vicious cycle of metainflammation and have a role in social behavior. The various effects of calorie restriction on metainflammation, insulin resistance, and neurodegeneration have been described. Less attention has been paid to the social determinants of aging and the possible mechanism by which calorie restriction might influence social behavior. The purpose of this review is to discuss current knowledge in the interdisciplinary field of geroscience—immunosenescence, inflamm-aging, and metainflammation—which makes a significant contribution to aging. A substantial part of the review is devoted to frontiers in the brain insulin resistance in relation to neuroinflammation. In addition, we summarize new data on potential mechanisms of calorie restriction that influence as a lifestyle intervention on the social brain. This knowledge can be used to initiate successful aging and slow the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain connectivity plays an important role in determining the brain region’s function. Previous researchers proposed that the brain region’s function is characterized by that region’s input and output connectivity profiles. Following this proposal, numerous studies have investigated the relationship between connectivity and function. However, this proposal only utilizes direct connectivity profiles and thus is deficient in explaining individual differences in the brain region’s function. To overcome this problem, we proposed that a brain region’s function is characterized by that region’s multi-hops connectivity profile. To test this proposal, we used multi-hops functional connectivity to predict the individual face activation of the right fusiform face area (rFFA) via a multi-layer graph neural network and showed that the prediction performance is essentially improved. Results also indicated that the two-layer graph neural network is the best in characterizing rFFA’s face activation and revealed a hierarchical network for the face processing of rFFA.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by changes in cognitive and behavioral functions. With the exception or rare mutations in PSEN and APP genes causing early-onset autosomal dominant AD (EOADAD), little is known about the genetic factors that underlie the vast majority (&amp;gt;95%) of early onset AD (EOAD) cases. We have previously identified copy number variations (CNVs) in microRNA genes in patients with EOAD, including a duplication of the MIR-138-2 gene. Overexpression of miR-138 in cultured cells increased Aβ production and tau phosphorylation, similar to what is seen in AD brain. In this study, we sought to determine if miR-138 overexpression could recapitulate certain features of disease in vivo in non-transgenic mice. A mild overexpression of pre-miR-138 in the brain of C57BL/6J wildtype mice altered learning and memory in a novel object recognition test and in the Barnes Maze. Increased levels of anxiety were also observed in the open-field test. MiR-138 upregulation in vivo caused an increase in endogenous Aβ42 production as well as changes in synaptic and inflammation markers. Tau expression was significantly lower with no overt effects on phosphorylation. We finally observed that Sirt1, a direct target of miR-138 involved in Aβ production, learning and memory as well as anxiety, is decreased following miR-138 overexpression. In sum, this study further strengthens a role for increased gene dosage of MIR-138-2 gene in modulating AD risk, possibly by acting on different biological pathways. Further studies will be required to better understand the role of CNVs in microRNA genes in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the ongoing research of the functions of consciousness, special emphasis has been put on integration of information: the ability to combine different signals into a coherent, unified one. Several theories of consciousness hold that this ability depends on – or at least goes hand in hand with – conscious processing. Yet some empirical findings have suggested otherwise, claiming that integration of information could take place even without awareness. Trying to reconcile this apparent contradiction, the “windows of integration” (WOI) hypothesis claims that conscious access enables signal processing over large integration windows. The hypothesis applies to integration windows defined either temporally, spatially, or semantically. In this review, we explain the hypothesis and re-examine it in light of new studies published since it was suggested. In line with the hypothesis, these studies provide compelling evidence for unconscious integration, but also demonstrate its limits with respect to time, space, and semantic distance. The review further highlights open questions that still need to be pursued to demonstrate the applicability of the WOI hypothesis as a guiding principle for understanding the depth and scope of unconscious processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Indirect speech acts—responding “I forgot to wear my watch today” to someone who asked for the time—are ubiquitous in daily conversation, but are understudied in current neurobiological models of language. To comprehend an indirect speech act like this one, listeners must not only decode the lexical-semantic content of the utterance, but also make a pragmatic, bridging inference. This inference allows listeners to derive the speaker’s true, intended meaning—in the above dialog, for example, that the speaker cannot provide the time. In the present work, we address this major gap by asking non-aphasic patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, n = 21) and brain-damaged controls with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 17) to judge simple question-answer dialogs of the form: “Do you want some cake for dessert?” “I’m on a very strict diet right now,” and relate the results to structural and diffusion MRI. Accuracy and reaction time results demonstrate that subjects with bvFTD, but not MCI, are selectively impaired in indirect relative to direct speech act comprehension, due in part to their social and executive limitations, and performance is related to caregivers’ judgment of communication efficacy. MRI imaging associates the observed impairment in bvFTD to cortical thinning not only in traditional language-associated regions, but also in fronto-parietal regions implicated in social and executive cerebral networks. Finally, diffusion tensor imaging analyses implicate white matter tracts in both dorsal and ventral projection streams, including superior longitudinal fasciculus, frontal aslant, and uncinate fasciculus. These results have strong implications for updated neurobiological models of language, and emphasize a core, language-mediated social disorder in patients with bvFTD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to make inferences about relationships between brain areas and their functions because, in contrast to neuroimaging tools, it modulates neuronal activity. The central aim of this article is to critically evaluate to what extent it is possible to draw causal inferences from repetitive TMS (rTMS) data. To that end, we describe the logical limitations of inferences based on rTMS experiments. The presented analysis suggests that rTMS alone does not provide the sort of premises that are sufficient to warrant strong inferences about the direct causal properties of targeted brain structures. Overcoming these limitations demands a close look at the designs of rTMS studies, especially the methodological and theoretical conditions which are necessary for the functional decomposition of the relations between brain areas and cognitive functions. The main points of this article are that TMS-based inferences are limited in that stimulation-related causal effects are not equivalent to structure-related causal effects due to TMS side effects, the electric field distribution, and the sensitivity of neuroimaging and behavioral methods in detecting structure-related effects and disentangling them from confounds. Moreover, the postulated causal effects can be based on indirect (network) effects. A few suggestions on how to manage some of these limitations are presented. We discuss the benefits of combining rTMS with neuroimaging in experimental reasoning and we address the restrictions and requirements of rTMS control conditions. The use of neuroimaging and control conditions allows stronger inferences to be gained, but the strength of the inferences that can be drawn depends on the individual experiment’s designs. Moreover, in some cases, TMS might not be an appropriate method of answering causality-related questions or the hypotheses have to account for the limitations of this technique. We hope this summary and formalization of the reasoning behind rTMS research can be of use not only for scientists and clinicians who intend to interpret rTMS results causally but also for philosophers interested in causal inferences based on brain stimulation research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is comprised of several conditions characterized by alterations in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the heterogeneous development of ASD behaviors. Several rodent models display ASD-like phenotypes, including repetitive behaviors. In this review article, we discuss the potential neural mechanisms involved in repetitive behaviors in rodent models of ASD and related neuropsychiatric disorders. We review signaling pathways, neural circuits, and anatomical alterations in rodent models that display robust stereotypic behaviors. Understanding the mechanisms and circuit alterations underlying repetitive behaviors in rodent models of ASD will inform translational research and provide useful insight into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of repetitive behaviors in ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a transmembrane receptor that binds over 40 potential ligands and is involved in processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. LRP1 is ubiquitously expressed in the organism and enriched among others in blood vessels, liver, and the central nervous system (CNS). There, it is strongly expressed by neurons, microglia, immature oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. The constitutive LRP1 knockout leads to embryonic lethality. Therefore, previous studies focused on conditional LRP1-knockout strategies and revealed that the deletion of LRP1 causes an increased differentiation of neural stem and precursor cells into astrocytes. Furthermore, astrocytic LRP1 is necessary for the degradation of Aβ and the reduced accumulation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease. Although the role of LRP1 in neurons has intensely been investigated, the function of LRP1 with regard to the differentiation and maturation of astrocytes and their functionality is still unknown. To address this question, we generated an inducible conditional transgenic mouse model, where LRP1 is specifically deleted from GLAST-positive astrocyte precursor cells. The recombination with resulting knockout events was visualized by the simultaneous expression of the fluorescent reporter tdTomato. We observed a significantly increased number of GLT-1 expressing astrocytes in LRP1-depleted astrocytic cultures in comparison to control astrocytes. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of astrocytic LRP1 on neuronal activity and synaptogenesis using the co-culture of hippocampal neurons with control or LRP1-depleted astrocytes. These analyses revealed that the LRP1-deficient astrocytes caused a decreased number of single action potentials as well as a negatively influenced neuronal network activity. Moreover, the proportion of pre- and postsynaptic structures was significantly altered in neurons co-cultured with LPR1-depleted astrocytes. However, the number of structural synapses was not affected. Additionally, the supernatant of hippocampal neurons co-cultured with LRP1-deficient astrocytes showed an altered set of cytokines in comparison to the control condition, which potentially contributed to the altered neuronal transmission and synaptogenesis. Our results suggest astrocytic LRP1 as a modulator of synaptic transmission and synaptogenesis by altering the expression of the glutamate transporter on the cell surface on astrocytes and the release of cytokines in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Exercise intervention studies in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), have demonstrated inconsistent yet promising results. Addressing the limitations of previous studies, this trial investigated the effects of a 12-month structured exercise program on the progression of MCI. The NeuroExercise study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial across three European countries (Ireland, Netherlands, Germany). Hundred and eighty-three individuals with amnestic MCI were included and were randomized to a 12-month exercise intervention (3 units of 45 min) of either aerobic exercise (AE; n = 60), stretching and toning exercise (ST; n = 65) or to a non-exercise control group (CG; n = 58). The primary outcome, cognitive performance, was determined by an extensive neuropsychological test battery. For the primary complete case (CC) analyses, between-group differences were analyzed with analysis of covariance under two conditions: (1) the exercise group (EG = combined AE and ST groups) compared to the CG and (2) AE compared to ST. Primary analysis of the full cohort (n = 166, 71.5 years; 51.8% females) revealed no between-group differences in composite cognitive score [mean difference (95% CI)], 0.12 [(−0.03, 0.27), p = 0.13] or in any cognitive domain or quality of life. VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peak was significantly higher in the EG compared to the CG after 12 months [−1.76 (−3.39, −0.10), p = 0.04]. Comparing the two intervention groups revealed a higher VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;peak level in the aerobic exercise compared to the stretching and toning group, but no differences for the other outcomes. A 12-month exercise intervention did not change cognitive performance in individuals with amnestic MCI in comparison to a non-exercise CG. An intervention effect on physical fitness was found, which may be an important moderator for long term disease progression and warrants long-term follow-up investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02913053, identifier: NCT02913053.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Isoflurane, a widely used volatile anesthetic, induces neuronal apoptosis and memory impairments in various animal models. However, the potential mechanisms and effective pharmacologic agents are still not fully understood. The p38MAPK/ATF-2 pathway has been proved to regulate neuronal cell survival and inflammation. Besides, atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective effects. Thus, this study aimed to explore the influence of atorvastatin on isoflurane-induced neurodegeneration and underlying mechanisms. Aged C57BL/6 mice (20 months old) were exposed to isoflurane (1.5%) anesthesia for 6 h. Atorvastatin (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg body weight) was administered to the mice for 7 days. Atorvastatin attenuated the isoflurane-induced generation of ROS and apoptosis. Western blotting revealed a decrease in cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 expression in line with ROS levels. Furthermore, atorvastatin ameliorated the isoflurane-induced activation of p38MAPK/ATF-2 signaling. In a cellular study, we proved that isoflurane could induce oxidative stress and inflammation by activating the p38MAPK/ATF-2 pathway in BV-2 microglia cells. In addition, SB203580, a selected p38MAPK inhibitor, inhibited the isoflurane-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. The results implied that p38MAPK/ATF-2 was a potential target for the treatment of postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain functional network (BFN) analysis is becoming a crucial way to explore the inherent organized pattern of the brain and reveal potential biomarkers for diagnosing neurological or psychological disorders. In so doing, a well-estimated BFN is of great concern. In practice, however, noises or artifacts involved in the observed data (i.e., fMRI time series in this paper) generally lead to a poor estimation of BFN, and thus a complex preprocessing pipeline is often used to improve the quality of the data prior to BFN estimation. One of the popular preprocessing steps is data-scrubbing that aims at removing “bad” volumes from the fMRI time series according to the amplitude of the head motion. Despite its helpfulness in general, this traditional scrubbing scheme cannot guarantee that the removed volumes are necessarily unhelpful, since such a step is fully independent to the subsequent BFN estimation task. Moreover, the removal of volumes would reduce the statistical power, and different numbers of volumes are generally scrubbed for different subjects, resulting in an inconsistency or bias in the estimated BFNs. To address these issues, we develop a new learning framework that conducts BFN estimation and data-scrubbing simultaneously by an alternating optimization algorithm. The newly developed algorithm adaptively weights volumes (instead of removing them directly) for the task of BFN estimation. As a result, the proposed method can not only reduce the difficulty of threshold selection involved in the traditional scrubbing scheme, but also provide a more flexible framework that scrubs the data in the subsequent FBN estimation model. Finally, we validate the proposed method by identifying subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal controls based on the estimated BFNs, achieving an 80.22% classification accuracy, which significantly improves the baseline methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most prevalent types of late-life dementia. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) contributes to both AD and VD. Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that fingolimod (FTY720) is neuroprotective in acute cerebral ischemic stroke animal models, and the drug is now being used in clinical translation studies. However, fewer studies have addressed the role of FTY720 in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-related brain damage. In the present study, to investigate whether FTY720 can improve CCH-induced spatial memory loss and its underlying mechanism, two-vessel occlusion (2VO) rats were administered intraperitoneal FTY720 (1 mg/kg) for 7 consecutive weeks from post-operative day 8. Spatial memory was tested using the Morris Water Maze (MWM), and the rats' brains were harvested to allow molecular, biochemical, and pathological tests. We found that FTY720 treatment significantly reduced the escape latency and increased the target quadrant swimming time of the 2VO rats in the MWM task. The improvement in memory performance paralleled lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Iba-1 positive cells in the hippocampus of the 2VO rats, indicating that FTY720 had a beneficial effect in mitigating neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we found that FTY720 alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction in 2VO rats, as manifested by lower malondialdehyde levels, higher ATP content, and upregulation of ATP synthase activity in the hippocampus after treatment. FTY720 had no effect on the CCH-induced decrease in the activity of hippocampal Sirtuin-3, a master regulator of mitochondrial function and neuroinflammation. In summary, the results showed that FTY720 can improve CCH-induced spatial memory loss. The mechanism may involve Sirtuin-3-independent regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. The present study provides new clues to the pathological mechanism of CCH-induced cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been widely employed in MCI research. However, there is no reliable systematic evidence regarding the effects of rTMS on MCI. The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A comprehensive literature search of nine electronic databases was performed to identify articles published in English or Chinese before June 20, 2019. The identified articles were screened, data were extracted, and the methodological quality of the included trials was assessed. The meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.3 software. We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Nine studies comprising 369 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that rTMS may significantly improve global cognitive function (standardized mean difference [SMD] 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 3.24, p = 0.0004, seven studies, n = 296; low-quality evidence) and memory (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.72, p = 0.002, six studies, n = 204; moderate-quality evidence). However, there was no significant improvement in executive function and attention (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Subgroup analyses revealed the following: (1) rTMS targeting the left hemisphere significantly enhanced global cognitive function, while rTMS targeting the bilateral hemispheres significantly enhanced global cognitive function and memory; (2) high-frequency rTMS significantly enhanced global cognitive function and memory; and (3) a high number of treatments ≥20 times could improve global cognitive function and memory. There was no significant difference in dropout rate (p &amp;gt; 0.05) between the rTMS and control groups. However, patients who received rTMS had a higher rate of mild adverse effects (risk ratio 2.03, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.52, p = 0.01, seven studies, n = 317; moderate-quality evidence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: rTMS appears to improve global cognitive function and memory in patients with MCI and may have good acceptability and mild adverse effects. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the relatively small number of trials, particularly for low-frequency rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Although the range of immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is variable, cytokine storm is observed in a subset of symptomatic individuals. To further understand the disease pathogenesis and, consequently, to develop an additional tool for clinicians to evaluate patients for presumptive intervention we sought to compare plasma cytokine levels between a range of donor and patient samples grouped by a COVID-19 Severity Score (CSS) based on need for hospitalization and oxygen requirement. Here we utilize a mutual information algorithm that classifies the information gain for CSS prediction provided by cytokine expression levels and clinical variables. Using this methodology, we found that a small number of clinical and cytokine expression variables are predictive of presenting COVID-19 disease severity, raising questions about the mechanism by which COVID-19 creates severe illness. The variables that were the most predictive of CSS included clinical variables such as age and abnormal chest x-ray as well as cytokines such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1RA). Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a plethora of changes in cytokine profiles and that particularly in severely ill patients, these changes are consistent with the presence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome and could furthermore be used as a biomarker to predict disease severity.</content>

 Biomedical data are usually analyzed at the univariate level, focused on a single primary outcome measure to provide insight into systems biology, complex disease states, and precision medicine opportunities. More broadly, these complex biological and disease states can be detected as common factors emerging from the relationships among measured variables using multivariate approaches. 'Syndromics' refers to an analytical framework for measuring disease states using principal component analysis and related multivariate statistics as primary tools for extracting underlying disease patterns. A key part of the syndromic workflow is the interpretation, the visualization, and the study of robustness of the main components that characterize the disease space. We present a new software package, &lt;i&gt;syndRomics&lt;/i&gt;, an open-source R package with utility for component visualization, interpretation, and stability for syndromic analysis. We document the implementation of &lt;i&gt;syndRomics&lt;/i&gt; and illustrate the use of the package in case studies of neurological trauma data.</content>

 Although mechanisms that activate organogenesis in plants are well established, much less is known about the subsequent fine-tuning of cell proliferation, which is crucial for creating properly structured and sized organs. Here we show, through analysis of temperature-dependent fasciation (TDF) mutants of Arabidopsis, &lt;i&gt;root redifferentiation defective 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rrd1&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;rrd2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;root initiation defective 4 &lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;rid4&lt;/i&gt;), that mitochondrial RNA processing is required for limiting cell division during early lateral root (LR) organogenesis. These mutants formed abnormally broadened (i.e., fasciated) LRs under high-temperature conditions due to extra cell division. All TDF proteins localized to mitochondria, where they were found to participate in RNA processing: RRD1 in mRNA deadenylation, and RRD2 and RID4 in mRNA editing. Further analysis suggested that LR fasciation in the TDF mutants is triggered by reactive oxygen species generation caused by defective mitochondrial respiration. Our findings provide novel clues for the physiological significance of mitochondrial activities in plant organogenesis.</content>

 Previous studies have related pair bonding in &lt;i&gt;Microtus ochrogaster&lt;/i&gt;, the prairie vole, with plastic changes in several brain regions. However, the interactions between these socially-relevant regions have yet to be described. In this study, we used resting state magnetic resonance imaging to explore bonding behaviors and functional connectivity of brain regions previously associated with pair bonding. Thirty-two male and female prairie voles were scanned at baseline, 24h and 2 weeks after the onset of cohabitation By using network based statistics, we identified that the functional connectivity of a cortico-striatal network predicted the onset of affiliative behavior, while another predicted the amount of social interaction during a partner preference test. Furthermore, a network with significant changes in time was revealed, also showing associations with the level of partner preference. Overall, our findings revealed the association between network-level functional connectivity changes and social bonding.</content>

 Long-term effects of the growing population of HIV-treated people in Southern Africa on individuals and the public health sector at large are not yet understood. This study proposes a novel 'ratio' model that relates CD4+ T-cell counts of HIV-infected individuals to the CD4+ count reference values from healthy populations. We use mixed-effects regression to fit the model to data from 1,616 children (median age 4.3 years at ART initiation) and 14,542 adults (median age 36 years at ART initiation). We found that the scaled carrying capacity, maximum CD4+ count relative to an HIV-negative individual of similar age, and baseline scaled CD4+ counts were closer to healthy values in children than in adults. Post-ART initiation, CD4+ growth rate was inversely correlated with baseline CD4+ T-cell counts, and consequently higher in adults than children. Our results highlight the impacts of age on dynamics of the immune system of healthy and HIV-infected individuals.</content>

 'Sunk' or irrecoverable costs impact reward-based decisions across species. However, it is not known if these incurred costs elicit a sustained change in reward value. To address this, we examined if sunk temporal costs subsequently alter reward consumption and reward preference in rats. We first identified the relative preference between different flavored food pellets during a free-feeding consumption test. Animals were then trained to experience the initial less preferred reward after long delays and the initial preferred reward after short delays. This training regimen enhanced the consumption and preference for the initial less desirable food reward. We probed whether this change in reward preference involved neural systems that contribute to reward valuation. Pharmacological manipulations and site-specific lesions were performed to examine the potential involvement of the dopamine system, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The change in reward preference was unaffected by systemic dopamine receptor antagonism or OFC lesions. In contrast, lesions of the BLA or the RSC prevented the enhanced consumption and preference for the initial less desirable reward. These findings demonstrate that both the BLA and RSC participate in how sunk temporal costs alter reward value and reward preference.</content>

 Adolescence is a period of development which is characterised by distinct differences in decision-making strategies relative to adults. While it is broadly established that there are relative differences in the structural maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and subcortical reward nuclei, such as the amygdala and ventral striatum, heterogeneity within the PFC is often neglected. In particular very little is known about the fine-scale gray matter (GM) development of the Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC), itself critical to a number of learning and decision-making mechanisms which show delayed development trajectories. Here we applied voxel-based morphometry to examine subregional differences in OFC grey matter in high-quality structural MRI scans of 125 subjects aged 11-35yrs from the Human Connectome Project. First, we examined fine-scale GM maturation in 5 anatomically dissociable OFC subregions and identified the best-fitting polynomial model. Next, we directly compared developmental trajectories across 3 functionally dissociable subregions, revealing a complex topological developmental profile from medial to lateral subregions. Collectively, the two complementary analyses suggest that while unequivocally the phylogenetically younger lateral OFCs showed the greatest shift in GM volume across adolescence, with maturation continuing well into young adulthood, the differences between the medial and central OFC subregions suggested a more complex pattern of maturation than a simple graded medial to lateral topological development. We argue that knowledge of these fine-scale anatomical differences in maturation could explain precise mechanistic differences in goal-directed behaviours.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated synaptic mechanisms in the hippocampus that could explain how loss of circadian timing leads to impairments in spatial and recognition memory. Experiments were performed in hippocampal slices from Siberian hamsters (&lt;i&gt;Phodopus sungorus&lt;/i&gt;) because, unlike mice and rats, their circadian rhythms are easily eliminated without modifications to their genome and without surgical manipulations, thereby leaving neuronal circuits intact. Recordings of excitatory postsynaptic field potentials and population spikes in area CA1 and dentate gyrus granule cells revealed no effect of circadian arrhythmia on basic functions of synaptic circuitry, including long‐term potentiation. However, dentate granule cells from circadian‐arrhythmic animals maintained a more depolarized resting membrane potential than cells from circadian‐intact animals; a significantly greater proportion of these cells depolarized in response to the cholinergic agonist carbachol (10 μM), and did so by increasing their membrane potential three‐fold greater than cells from the control (entrained) group. Dentate granule cells from arrhythmic animals also exhibited higher levels of tonic inhibition, as measured by the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Carbachol also decreased stimulus‐evoked synaptic excitation in dentate granule cells from both intact and arrhythmic animals as expected, but reduced stimulus‐evoked synaptic inhibition only in cells from control hamsters. These findings show that loss of circadian timing is accompanied by greater tonic inhibition, and increased synaptic inhibition in response to muscarinic receptor activation in dentate granule cells. Increased inhibition would likely attenuate excitation in dentate‐CA3 microcircuits, which in turn might explain the spatial memory deficits previously observed in circadian‐arrhythmic hamsters.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Myelin is a specialized membrane produced by oligodendrocytes that insulates and supports axons. Oligodendrocytes extend numerous cellular processes, as projections of the plasma membrane, and simultaneously wrap multiple layers of myelin membrane around target axons. Notably, myelin sheaths originating from the same oligodendrocyte are variable in size, suggesting local mechanisms regulate myelin sheath growth. Purified myelin contains ribosomes and hundreds of mRNAs, supporting a model that mRNA localization and local protein synthesis regulate sheath growth and maturation. However, the mechanisms by which mRNAs are selectively enriched in myelin sheaths are unclear. To investigate how mRNAs are targeted to myelin sheaths, we tested the hypothesis that transcripts are selected for myelin enrichment through consensus sequences in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR). Using methods to visualize mRNA in living zebrafish larvae, we identified candidate 3′ UTRs that were sufficient to localize mRNA to sheaths and enriched near growth zones of nascent membrane. We bioinformatically identified motifs common in 3′ UTRs from 3 myelin-enriched transcripts and determined that these motifs are required and sufficient in a context-dependent manner for mRNA transport to myelin sheaths. Finally, we show that 1 motif is highly enriched in the myelin transcriptome, suggesting that this sequence is a global regulator of mRNA localization during developmental myelination.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AIjTnc1b5Hs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Axon guidance at the spinal cord midline – a live imaging perspective&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9f0c67f6-ded3-44fe-ae06-72714b01236f/cne25107-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a novel method to culture the intact spinal cord of the chicken embryo for live imaging of axon guidance at the midline. The stability of this ex vivo method  allowed us to characterize key aspects of midline crossing such as, axonal growth, timing of crossing, dynamic morphological changes of the growth cones and growth cone‐floor plate cell interactions. .

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During neural circuit formation, axons navigate several choice points to reach their final target. At each one of these intermediate targets, growth cones need to switch responsiveness from attraction to repulsion in order to move on. Molecular mechanisms that allow for the precise timing of surface expression of a new set of receptors that support the switch in responsiveness are difficult to study &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Mostly, mechanisms are inferred from the observation of snapshots of many different growth cones analyzed in different preparations of tissue harvested at distinct time points. However, to really understand the behavior of growth cones at choice points, a single growth cone should be followed arriving at and leaving the intermediate target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; preparations, like cultures of an ‘open‐book’ preparation of the spinal cord have been successfully used to study floor‐plate entry and exit, but artefacts prevent the analysis of growth cone behavior at the floor‐plate exit site. Here, we describe a novel spinal cord preparation that allows for live imaging of individual axons during navigation in their intact environment. When comparing growth cone behavior in our &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; system with snapshots from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; navigation, we do not see any differences. The possibility to observe the dynamics of single growth cones navigating their intermediate target allows for measuring growth speed, changes in morphology, or aberrant behavior, like stalling and wrong turning. Moreover, observation of the intermediate target – the floor plate – revealed its active participation and interaction with commissural axons during midline crossing.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;A novel telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic morphogenetic domain coexpressing Foxg1 and Otp produces most of the glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8d8f484e-e50e-4db1-a304-c954f049fec1/cne25103-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows that most glutamatergic neurons of the mouse medial extended amygdala originate in a novel telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of these neurons in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deficits in social cognition and behavior are a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders. The medial extended amygdala, including the medial amygdala and the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, is a key component of functional networks involved in sociality. However, this nuclear complex is highly heterogeneous and contains numerous GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron subpopulations. Deciphering the connections of different neurons is essential in order to understand how this structure regulates different aspects of sociality, and it is necessary to evaluate their differential implication in distinct mental disorders. Developmental studies in different vertebrates are offering new venues to understand neuronal diversity of the medial extended amygdala and are helping to establish a relation between the embryonic origin and molecular signature of distinct neurons with the functional subcircuits in which they are engaged. These studies have provided many details on the distinct GABAergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala, but information on the glutamatergic neurons is still scarce. Using an Otp‐eGFP transgenic mouse and multiple fluorescent labeling, we show that most glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala originate in a distinct telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), located at the transition between telencephalon and hypothalamus, which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 but not Nkx2.1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons of the medial amygdala, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of this neuron subtype in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate patients with ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody (gAChR‐Ab) positive autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy using a multi‐modal testing protocol to characterise their full clinical phenotype and explore biomarkers to quantify immunotherapy response.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohort study of thirteen individuals (seven female; 21–69 years) with autonomic failure and gAChR‐Ab&amp;gt;100pM identified between 2005–2019. From 2018, all patients were longitudinally assessed with cardiovascular, pupillary, urinary, sudomotor, lacrimal and salivary testing, and COMPASS‐31 autonomic symptom questionnaires. The orthostatic intolerance ratio was calculated by dividing change in systolic blood pressure over time tolerated on head‐up tilt. Eleven patients received immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first assessment, all 13 patients had cardiovascular and pupillary impairments, 7/8 had post‐ganglionic sudomotor dysfunction, 9/11 had urinary retention and xeropthalmia, and 6/8 had xerostomia. After immunotherapy, there were significant improvements in orthostatic intolerance ratio (33.3[17.8–61.3] to 5.2[1.4–8.2], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .007), heart rate response to deep breathing (1.5[0.0–3.3] to 4.5[3.0–6.3], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .02), pupillary constriction to light (12.0[5.5–18.0] to 19.0[10.6–23.8]%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .02), saliva production (0.01[0.01–0.05] to 0.08[0.02–0.20]g/min, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .03) and COMPASS‐31 scores (52 to 17, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .03). Orthostatic intolerance ratio correlated with autonomic symptoms at baseline (r = 0.841, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .01) and following immunotherapy (r = 0.889, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .02). Immunofluorescence analyses of skin samples from a patient 32 years after disease onset showed loss of nerve fibres supplying the dermal autonomic adnexa and epidermis, with clear improvements following immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy demonstrated objective evidence of widespread sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic failure, with significant improvements after immunotherapy. Quantitative autonomic biomarkers should be used to define initial deficits, guide therapeutic decisions, and document treatment response.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Phenomics is concerned with detailed description of all aspects of organisms,
from their physical foundations at genetic, molecular and cellular level, to
behavioural and psychological traits. Neuropsychiatric phenomics, endorsed by
NIMH, provides such broad perspective to understand mental disorders. It is
clear that learning sciences also need similar approach that will integrate
efforts to understand cognitive processes from the perspective of the brain
development, in temporal, spatial, psychological and social aspects. The brain
is a substrate shaped by genetic, epigenetic, cellular and environmental
factors including education, individual experiences and personal history,
culture, social milieu. Learning sciences should thus be based on the
foundation of neurocognitive phenomics. A brief review of selected aspects of
such approach is presented, outlining new research directions. Central,
peripheral and motor processes in the brain are linked to the inventory of the
learning styles.

 &lt;p&gt;This paper presents a computational evolutionary game model to study and
understand fraud dynamics in the consumption tax system. Players are
cooperators if they correctly declare their value added tax (VAT), and are
defectors otherwise. Each player's payoff is influenced by the amount evaded
and the subjective probability of being inspected by tax authorities. Since
transactions between companies must be declared by both the buyer and seller, a
strategy adopted by one influences the other's payoff. We study the model with
a well-mixed population and different scale-free networks. Model parameters
were calibrated using real-world data of VAT declarations by businesses
registered in the Canary Islands region of Spain. We analyzed several scenarios
of audit probabilities for high and low transactions and their prevalence in
the population, as well as social rewards and penalties to find the most
efficient policy to increase the proportion of cooperators. Two major insights
were found. First, increasing the subjective audit probability for low
transactions is more efficient than increasing this probability for high
transactions. Second, favoring social rewards for cooperators or alternative
penalties for defectors can be effective policies, but their success depends on
the distribution of the audit probability for low and high transactions.

 &lt;p&gt;Many experimental paradigms in neuroscience involve driving the nervous
system with periodic sensory stimuli. Neural signals recorded with a variety of
techniques will then include phase-locked oscillations at the stimulation
frequency. The analysis of such data often involves standard univariate
statistics such as T-tests, conducted on the Fourier amplitude components
(ignoring phase). However, the assumptions of these tests will often be
violated because amplitudes are not normally distributed, and furthermore weak
signals might be missed if the phase information is discarded. An alternative
approach is to conduct multivariate statistical tests using the real and
imaginary Fourier components. Here the performance of two multivariate
extensions of the T-test are compared: Hotelling's $T^2$ and a variant called
$T^2_{circ}$. A novel test of the assumptions of $T^2_{circ}$ is developed,
based on the condition index of the data (the square root of the ratio of
eigenvalues of a bounding ellipse), and a heuristic for excluding outliers
using the Mahalanobis distance is proposed. The $T^2_{circ}$ statistic is then
extended to multi-level designs, resulting in a new statistical test termed
$ANOVA^2_{circ}$. This has identical assumptions to $T^2_{circ}$, and is shown
to be more sensitive than MANOVA when these assumptions are met. The use of
these tests is demonstrated for two publicly available empirical data sets, and
practical guidance is suggested for choosing which test to run. Implementations
of these novel tools are provided as an R package, in the hope that their wider
adoption will improve the sensitivity of statistical inferences involving
periodic data.

 &lt;p&gt;As neural networks gain widespread adoption in embedded devices, there is a
need for model compression techniques to facilitate deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization is one of the go-to methods
yielding state-of-the-art model compression. Most approaches take a fully
trained model, apply different heuristics to determine the optimal
bit-precision for different layers of the network, and retrain the network to
regain any drop in accuracy. Based on Activation Density (AD)-the proportion of
non-zero activations in a layer-we propose an in-training quantization method.
Our method calculates bit-width for each layer during training yielding a mixed
precision model with competitive accuracy. Since we train lower precision
models during training, our approach yields the final quantized model at lower
training complexity and also eliminates the need for re-training. We run
experiments on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImagenet on
VGG19/ResNet18 architectures and report the accuracy and energy estimates for
the same. We achieve ~4.5x benefit in terms of estimated
multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) reduction while reducing the training complexity
by 50% in our experiments. To further evaluate the energy benefits of our
proposed method, we develop a mixed-precision scalable Process In Memory (PIM)
hardware accelerator platform. The hardware platform incorporates shift-add
functionality for handling multi-bit precision neural network models.
Evaluating the quantized models obtained with our proposed method on the PIM
platform yields ~5x energy reduction compared to 16-bit models. Additionally,
we find that integrating AD based quantization with AD based pruning (both
conducted during training) yields up to ~198x and ~44x energy reductions for
VGG19 and ResNet18 architectures respectively on PIM platform compared to
baseline 16-bit precision, unpruned models.

 &lt;p&gt;Ever since the advent of the neuron doctrine more than a century ago,
information processing in the brain is widely believed to mainly follow the
forward pre to post-synaptic neurons direction. In this paper, we emit the
backpropagation-based recollection hypothesis as follows: weak and fast fading
Action Potentials following the (highest weight) post to pre-synaptic backward
pathways, mediate explicit cue-based memory recall. This includes also the
tasks of imagination, future episodic thinking, language understanding and
associating names to various stimuli. These signals originate in highly
invariant neurons, which uniquely respond to some specific stimuli (e.g. image
of a cat). They then travel backwards to reactivate the same populations of
neurons that uniquely respond to this specific stimuli during perception, thus
recreating &quot;offline&quot; an experience that is similar. After stating our
hypothesis in details, we review abundant evidence on the existence of such
backpropagating signals as well as other relevant literature that supports our
claims. We then leverage simulations based on existing spiking neural network
models with STDP learning to show the computational feasibility of using such a
mechanism to map the image of an object to its name with the same high accuracy
as a state of the art machine learning classifier. Although not yet a theory,
we believe this hypothesis presents a paradigm shift that is worth further
investigating: it opens the way, among others, to new interpretations of
language acquisition and understanding, the interplay between memories encoding
and retrieval, as well as reconciling the apparently opposed views between
sparse coding and distributed representations.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Runtime analysis aims at contributing to our understanding of evolutionary
algorithms through mathematical analyses of their runtimes. In the context of
discrete optimization problems, runtime analysis classically studies the time
needed to find an optimal solution. However, both from a practical and a
theoretical viewpoint, more fine-grained performance measures are needed. Two
complementary approaches have been suggested: fixed-budget analysis and
fixed-target analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we conduct an in-depth study on the advantages and limitations
of fixed-target analyses. We show that, different from fixed-budget analyses,
many classical methods from the runtime analysis of discrete evolutionary
algorithms yield fixed-target results without greater effort. We use this to
conduct a number of new fixed-target analyses. However, we also point out
examples where an extension of the existing runtime result to a fixed-target
result is highly non-trivial.

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide, and no cure is currently available. The major pathological hallmarks of AD are considered to be amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, generated by respectively APP processing and Tau phosphorylation. Recent evidence imply that glycosylation of these proteins, and a number of other AD-related molecules is altered in AD, suggesting a potential implication of this process in disease pathology. In this review we summarize the understanding of glycans in AD pathogenesis, and discuss how glycobiology can contribute to early diagnosis and treatment of AD, serving as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we look into the potential link between the emerging topic neuroinflammation and glycosylation, combining two interesting, and until recent years, understudied topics in the scope of AD. Lastly, we discuss how new model platforms such as induced pluripotent stem cells can be exploited and contribute to a better understanding of a rather unexplored area in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Medical image fusion, which aims to derive complementary information from multi-modality medical images, plays an important role in many clinical applications, such as medical diagnostics and treatment. We propose the LatLRR-FCNs, which is a hybrid medical image fusion framework consisting of the latent low-rank representation (LatLRR) and the fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Specifically, the LatLRR module is used to decompose the multi-modality medical images into low-rank and saliency components, which can provide fine-grained details and preserve energies, respectively. The FCN module aims to preserve both global and local information by generating the weighting maps for each modality image. The final weighting map is obtained using the weighted local energy and the weighted sum of the eight-neighborhood-based modified Laplacian method. The fused low-rank component is generated by combining the low-rank components of each modality image according to the guidance provided by the final weighting map within pyramid-based fusion. A simple sum strategy is used for the saliency components. The usefulness and efficiency of the proposed framework are thoroughly evaluated on four medical image fusion tasks, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR), T1- and T2-weighted MR, positron emission tomography and MR, and single-photon emission CT and MR. The results demonstrate that by leveraging the LatLRR for image detail extraction and the FCNs for global and local information description, we can achieve performance superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both objective assessment and visual quality in some cases. Furthermore, our method has a competitive performance in terms of computational costs compared to other baselines.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Functional remodeling may vary with tumor aggressiveness of glioma. Investigation of the functional remodeling is expected to provide scientific relevance of tumor characterization and disease management of glioma. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional remodeling of the contralesional hemisphere and its utility in predicting the malignant grade of glioma at the individual level with multivariate logistic regression (MLR) analysis. Subjects and Methods: One hundred and twenty-six right-handed subjects with histologically confirmed cerebral glioma were included with 80 tumors located in the left hemisphere (LH) and 46 tumors located in the right hemisphere (RH). Resting-state functional networks of the contralesional hemisphere were constructed using the human brainnetome atlas based on resting-state fMRI data. Functional connectivity and topological features of functional networks were quantified. The performance of functional features in predicting the glioma grade was evaluated using area under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The dataset was divided into training and validation datasets. Features with high AUC values in malignancy classification in the training dataset were determined as predictive features. An MLR model was constructed based on predictive features and its classification performance was evaluated on the training and validation datasets with 10-fold cross validation. Results: Predictive functional features showed apparent hemispheric specifications. MLR classification models constructed with age and predictive functional connectivity features (AUC of 0.853 ± 0.079 and 1.000 ± 0.000 for LH and RH group, respectively) and topological features (AUC of 0.788 ± 0.150 and 0.897 ± 0.165 for LH and RH group, respectively) achieved efficient performance in predicting the malignant grade of gliomas. Conclusion: Functional remodeling of the contralesional hemisphere was hemisphere-specific and highly predictive of the malignant grade of glioma. Network approach provides a novel pathway that may innovate glioma characterization and management at the individual level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Excessive glucocorticoids (GC) may lead to the aggravation of several basic diseases including myopia, due to plasma hormone imbalances associated with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPAA). Electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective therapeutic method to treat many diseases, although it remains unclear whether EA at acupoints on the foot or back would be effective in treating eye diseases. It was recently found that visual cortex activity for responses to visual stimuli with spatial frequency and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) between the supramarginal gyrus and rostrolateral prefrontal cortex was significantly reduced in patients with high myopia. The present study aims to investigate the role of the alternation of resting-state FC among the bilateral visual cortex and hypothalamus in exerting anti-myopia effects of EA in GC-enhanced lens-induced myopic (LIM) guinea pigs such that the mechanisms of EA to treat GC-enhanced myopia at Shenshu (BL23) acupoints can be probed. To confirm the effects of EA, ocular parameters including axial length and GC-associated physiological parameters such as animal appearance, behavior, bodyweight, and levels of four HPAA-associated plasma hormones [free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T)] were also collected. Increased resting-state FC between the left and right visual cortex was detected in GC-enhanced lens-induced myopic guinea pigs with EA at BL23 acupoints (LIM+GC+EA) guinea pigs compared to GC-enhanced lens-induced myopic guinea pigs with EA at sham acupoints (LIM+GC+Sham) guinea pigs, as well as suppressed myopia and recovery of symptoms initially caused by overdose of GC. Recovered symptoms included improved animal appearance, behavior, bodyweight, and HPAA-associated plasma hormone levels were observed after 4 weeks of EA treatment. In contrast, the LIM+GC+Sham group showed decreased FC with elongation of axial length for myopization as compared to the control group and LIM group and exhibited a deterioration in physiological parameters including reduced body weight and balance disruption in the four measured HPAA-associated plasma hormones. Our findings suggest that EA could effectively treat GC-enhanced myopia by increasing resting-state FC between the left and right visual cortices, which may be pivotal to further understanding the application and mechanisms of EA in treating GC-enhanced myopia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The popularity of mesoscopic whole-brain imaging techniques has increased dramatically, but these techniques generate teravoxel-sized volumetric image data. Visualizing or interacting with these massive data is both necessary and essential in the bioimage analysis pipeline; however, due to their size, researchers have difficulty using typical computers to process them. The existing solutions do not consider applying web visualization and three-dimensional (3D) volume rendering methods simultaneously to reduce the number of data copy operations and provide a better way to visualize 3D structures in bioimage data. Here, we propose webTDat, an open-source, web-based, real-time 3D visualization framework for mesoscopic-scale whole-brain imaging datasets. webTDat uses an advanced rendering visualization method designed with an innovative data storage format and parallel rendering algorithms. webTDat loads the primary information in the image first and then decides whether it needs to load the secondary information in the image. By performing validation on TB-scale whole-brain datasets, webTDat achieves real-time performance during web visualization. The webTDat framework also provides a rich interface for annotation, making it a useful tool for visualizing mesoscopic whole-brain imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although the neural systems that underlie spoken language are well-known, how they adapt to evolving social cues during natural conversations remains an unanswered question. In this work we investigate the neural correlates of face-to-face conversations between two individuals using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and acoustical analyses of concurrent audio recordings. Nineteen pairs of healthy adults engaged in live discussions on two controversial topics where their opinions were either in agreement or disagreement. Participants were matched according to their a priori opinions on these topics as assessed by questionnaire. Acoustic measures of the recorded speech including the fundamental frequency range, median fundamental frequency, syllable rate, and acoustic energy were elevated during disagreement relative to agreement. Consistent with both the a priori opinion ratings and the acoustic findings, neural activity associated with long-range functional networks, rather than the canonical language areas, was also differentiated by the two conditions. Specifically, the frontoparietal system including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus showed increased activity while talking during disagreement. In contrast, talking during agreement was characterized by increased activity in a social and attention network including right supramarginal gyrus, bilateral frontal eye-fields, and left frontopolar regions. Further, these social and visual attention networks were more synchronous across brains during agreement than disagreement. Rather than localized modulation of the canonical language system, these findings are most consistent with a model of distributed and adaptive language-related processes including cross-brain neural coupling that serves dynamic verbal exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromarketing has gained attention to bridge the gap between conventional marketing studies and electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) research. It determines what customers actually want through preference prediction. The performance of EEG-based preference detection systems depends on a suitable selection of feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. In this study, We examined preference detection of neuromarketing dataset using different feature combinations of EEG indices and different algorithms for feature extraction and classification. For EEG feature extraction, we employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and power spectral density (PSD), which were utilized to measure the EEG-based preference indices that enhance the accuracy of preference detection. Moreover, we compared deep learning with other traditional classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). We also studied the effect of preference indicators on the performance of classification algorithms. Through rigorous offline analysis, we investigated the computational intelligence for preference detection and classification. The performance of the proposed deep neural network (DNN) outperforms KNN and SVM in accuracy, precision, and recall; however, RF achieved results similar to those of the DNN for the same dataset.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurosurgery for psychiatric disorders (NPD), also sometimes referred to as psychosurgery, is rapidly evolving, with new techniques and indications being investigated actively. Many within the field have suggested that some form of guidelines or regulations are needed to help ensure that a promising field develops safely. Multiple countries have enacted specific laws regulating NPD. This article reviews NPD-specific laws drawn from North and South America, Asia and Europe, in order to identify the typical form and contents of these laws and to set the groundwork for the design of an optimal regulation for the field. Key challenges for this design that are revealed by the review are how to define the scope of the law (what should be regulated), what types of regulations are required (eligibility criteria, approval procedures, data collection, and oversight mechanisms), and how to approach international harmonization given the potential migration of researchers and patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stereotypic dendrite arborizations are key morphological features of neuronal identity, as the size, shape and location of dendritic trees determine the synaptic input fields and how information is integrated within developed neural circuits. In this review, we focus on the actions of extrinsic intercellular communication factors and their effects on intrinsic developmental processes that lead to dendrite patterning. Surrounding neurons or supporting cells express adhesion receptors and secreted proteins that respectively, act via direct contact or over short distances to shape, size, and localize dendrites during specific developmental stages. The different ligand-receptor interactions and downstream signaling events appear to direct dendrite morphogenesis by converging on two categorical mechanisms: local cytoskeletal and adhesion modulation and global transcriptional regulation of key dendritic growth components, such as lipid synthesis enzymes. Recent work has begun to uncover how the coordinated signaling of multiple extrinsic factors promotes complexity in dendritic trees and ensures robust dendritic patterning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal migration is a fundamental brain development process that allows cells to move from their birthplaces to their sites of integration. Although neuronal migration largely ceases during embryonic and early postnatal development, neuroblasts continue to be produced and to migrate to a few regions of the adult brain such as the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). In the SVZ, a large number of neuroblasts migrate into the olfactory bulb (OB) along the rostral migratory stream (RMS). Neuroblasts migrate in chains in a tightly organized micro-environment composed of astrocytes that ensheath the chains of neuroblasts and regulate their migration; the blood vessels that are used by neuroblasts as a physical scaffold and a source of molecular factors; and axons that modulate neuronal migration. In addition to diverse sets of extrinsic micro-environmental cues, long-distance neuronal migration involves a number of intrinsic mechanisms, including membrane and cytoskeleton remodeling, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, mitochondria dynamics, energy consumption, and autophagy. All these mechanisms are required to cope with the different micro-environment signals and maintain cellular homeostasis in order to sustain the proper dynamics of migrating neuroblasts and their faithful arrival in the target regions. Neuroblasts in the postnatal brain not only migrate into the OB but may also deviate from their normal path to migrate to a site of injury induced by a stroke or by certain neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we will focus on the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate long-distance neuroblast migration in the adult brain and on how these pathways may be modulated to control the recruitment of neuroblasts to damaged/diseased brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social interaction, language delay and repetitive or restrictive behaviors. With increasing prevalence, ASD is currently estimated to affect 0.5–2.0% of the global population. However, its etiology remains unclear due to high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Copy number variations (CNVs) are implicated in several forms of syndromic ASD and have been demonstrated to contribute toward ASD development by altering gene dosage and expression. Increasing evidence points toward the p-arm of chromosome 3 (chromosome 3p) as an ASD risk locus. Deletions occurring at chromosome 3p result in 3p-deletion syndrome (Del3p), a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms and often, ASD or ASD-associated behaviors. Therefore, we hypothesize that overlapping molecular mechanisms underlie the pathogenesis of Del3p and ASD. To investigate which genes encoded in chromosome 3p could contribute toward Del3p and ASD, we performed a comprehensive literature review and collated reports investigating the phenotypes of individuals with chromosome 3p CNVs. We observe that high frequencies of CNVs occur in the 3p26.3 region, the terminal cytoband of chromosome 3p. This suggests that CNVs disrupting genes encoded within the 3p26.3 region are likely to contribute toward the neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in individuals affected by Del3p. The 3p26.3 region contains three consecutive genes encoding closely related neuronal immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs): Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1), Contactin-6 (CNTN6), and Contactin-4 (CNTN4). CNVs disrupting these neuronal IgCAMs may contribute toward ASD phenotypes as they have been associated with key roles in neurodevelopment. CHL1, CNTN6, and CNTN4 have been observed to promote neurogenesis and neuronal survival, and regulate neuritogenesis and synaptic function. Furthermore, there is evidence that these neuronal IgCAMs possess overlapping interactomes and participate in common signaling pathways regulating axon guidance. Notably, mouse models deficient for these neuronal IgCAMs do not display strong deficits in axonal migration or behavioral phenotypes, which is in contrast to the pronounced defects in neuritogenesis and axon guidance observed in vitro. This suggests that when CHL1, CNTN6, or CNTN4 function is disrupted by CNVs, other neuronal IgCAMs may suppress behavioral phenotypes by compensating for the loss of function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The induction of a coma by traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a crucial factor for poor clinical prognoses. We report that acupuncture at the hand 12 Jing-Well points (HTWP) improved consciousness and neurologic function in TBI rats. Gene chip analyses showed that HTWP acupuncture mostly activated genes modulating neuronal projections (P2rx7, P2rx3, Trpv1, Tacr1, and Cacna1d), protein secretion (Exoc1, Exoc3l1, Fgb, and Fgr), and dopamine (DA) receptor D3 (Drd3) in the ventral periaqueductal gray (vPAG), among which the expression rate of P2rx7 was the most obviously increased. Acupuncture also increased the expression and excitability of DA and P2RX7 neurons, and the DA neurons expressed P2RX7, P2RX3, and TRPV1 in the vPAG. Intracerebroventricular administration of P2RX7, P2RX3, or TRPV1 antagonists blocked acupuncture-induced consciousness, and the subsequent injection of a P2RX7 antagonist into the vPAG nucleus also inhibited this effect. Our findings provide evidence that acupuncture alleviates TBI-induced comas via DA neurons expressing P2RX7 in the vPAG, so as to reveal the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the improvement of TBI clinical outcomes by HTWP acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Oligodendrogenesis dysfunction impairs memory consolidation in adult mice, and an oligodendrocyte abnormality is an important change occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While fluoxetine (FLX) is known to delay memory decline in AD models, its effects on hippocampal oligodendrogenesis are unclear. Here, we subjected 8-month-old male amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice to the FLX intervention for 2 months. Their exploratory behaviors and general activities in a novel environment, spatial learning and memory and working and reference memory were assessed using the open-field test, Morris water maze, and Y maze. Furthermore, changes in hippocampal oligodendrogenesis were investigated using stereology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blotting techniques. FLX delayed declines in the spatial learning and memory, as well as the working and reference memory of APP/PS1 mice. In addition, APP/PS1 mice exhibited immature hippocampal oligodendrogenesis, and FLX increased the numbers of 2′3′cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and newborn CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes in the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, FLX increased the density of SRY-related HMG-box 10 protein (SOX10)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and reduced the percentage of oligodendrocyte lineage cells displaying the senescence phenotype (CDKN2A/p16INK4a) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, FLX had no effect on the serotonin (5-HT) 1A receptor (5-HT1AR) content or number of 5-HT1AR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes, but it reduced the content and activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Taken together, FLX delays the senescence of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and promotes oligodendrocyte maturation in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. FLX may regulate GSK3β through a mechanism other than 5-HT1AR and then inhibit the negative effect of GSK3β on oligodendrocyte maturation in the hippocampus of an AD mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;As higher mental demands at work are associated with lower dementia risk and a key symptom of dementia is hippocampal atrophy, the study aimed at investigating the association between mental demands at work and hippocampal volume. We analyzed data from the population-based LIFE-Adult-Study in Leipzig, Germany (n = 1,409, age 40–80). Hippocampal volumes were measured via three-dimensional Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 3D MP-RAGE) and mental demands at work were classified via the O*NET database. Linear regression analyses adjusted for gender, age, education, APOE e4-allele, hypertension, and diabetes revealed associations between higher demands in “language and knowledge,” “information processing,” and “creativity” at work on larger white and gray matter volume and better cognitive functioning with “creativity” having stronger effects for people not yet retired. Among retired individuals, higher demands in “pattern detection” were associated with larger white matter volume as well as larger hippocampal subfields CA2/CA3, suggesting a retention effect later in life. There were no other relevant associations with hippocampal volume. Our findings do not support the idea that mental demands at work protect cognitive health via hippocampal volume or brain volume. Further research may clarify through what mechanism mentally demanding activities influence specifically dementia pathology in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Cognitive frailty is a particular state of cognitive vulnerability toward dementia with neuropathological hallmarks. The hippocampus is a complex, heterogeneous structure closely relates to the cognitive impairment in elderly which is composed of 12 subregions. Atrophy of these subregions has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the changes in hippocampal subregions in older adults with cognitive frailty and the relationship between subregions and cognitive impairment as well as physical frailty.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six older adults with cognitive frailty and 26 matched healthy controls were included in this study. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (Fuzhou version) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Chinese version (WMS-RC), while physical frailty was tested with the Chinese version of the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS) and grip strength. The volume of the hippocampal subregions was measured with structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Partial correlation analysis was carried out between the volumes of hippocampal subregions and MoCA scores, Wechsler’s Memory Quotient and physical frailty indexes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A significant volume decrease was found in six hippocampal subregions, including the bilateral presubiculum, the left parasubiculum, molecular layer of the hippocampus proper (molecular layer of the HP), and hippocampal amygdala transition area (HATA), and the right cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) area, in older adults with cognitive frailty, while the proportion of brain parenchyma and total number of white matter fibers were lower than those in the healthy controls. Positive correlations were found between Wechsler’s Memory Quotient and the size of the left molecular layer of the HP and HATA and the right presubiculum. The sizes of the left presubiculum, molecular of the layer HP, and HATA and right CA1 and presubiculum were found to be positively correlated with MoCA score. The sizes of the left parasubiculum, molecular layer of the HP and HATA were found to be negatively correlated with the physical frailty index.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Significant volume decrease occurs in hippocampal subregions of older adults with cognitive frailty, and these changes are correlated with cognitive impairment and physical frailty. Therefore, the atrophy of hippocampal subregions could participate in the pathological progression of cognitive frailty.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a paralyzing autoimmune condition affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Within GBS there are several variants affecting different aspects of the peripheral nerve. In general, there appears to be a role for T cells, macrophages, B cells, and complement in initiating and perpetuating attacks on gangliosides of Schwann cells and axons. Of note, GBS has an increased prevalence and severity with increasing age. In addition, there are alterations in immune cell functioning that may play a role in differences in GBS with age alongside general age-related declines in reparative processes (e.g., delayed de-differentiation of Schwann cells and decline in phagocytic ability of macrophages). The present review will explore the immune response in GBS as well as in animal models of several variants of the disorder. In addition, the potential involvement of an aging immune system in contributing to the increased prevalence and severity of GBS with age will be theorized.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by non-motor symptoms as well as motor deficits. The non-motor symptoms rarely appear individually and occur simultaneously with motor deficits or independently. However, a comprehensive research on the non-motor symptoms using an experimental model of PD remains poorly understood. The aim of the current study is to establish a chronic mouse model of PD mimicking the comprehensive non-motor symptoms of human PD by injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and probenecid (MPTP/p). The non-motor and motor symptoms were evaluated by performing buried food, short-term olfactory memory, hot plate, open field, tail suspension, Y maze, novel object recognition, bead expulsion, one-h stool collection, rotarod, rearing, catalepsy, and akinesia tests after 10 injections of MPTP/p into mice. The expression levels of α-synuclein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or DJ-1 were analyzed by Western blotting or immunostaining. MPTP/p-treated mice achieved to reproduce the key features of non-motor symptoms including olfactory deficit, thermal hyperalgesia, anxiety, depression, cognitive decline, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in addition to motor deficits. The MPTP/p-treated mice also showed the high levels of α-synuclein and low levels of TH and DJ-1 in striatum, substantia nigra, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, locus coeruleus, or colon. In addition, the expression levels of phosphorylated-α-synuclein and GFAP were elevated in the striatum and substantia nigra in the MPTP/p-treated mice. Taken together, our study clarifies that the chronic MPTP/p-treated mice have a variety of non-motor dysfunctions as well as motor abnormalities by α-synuclein overexpression and dopaminergic depletion. Therefore, the study of comprehensive phenotypes of non-motor symptoms in one PD model would advance in-depth understandings of neuropathological alternations and contribute to future strategies for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) contributes to cognitive impairments, and hippocampal neuronal death is one of the key factors involved in this process. Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (D3NB) is a synthetic compound originally isolated from the seeds of Apium graveolens, which exhibits neuroprotective effects against some neurological diseases. However, the protective mechanisms of D3NB in a CCH model mimicking vascular cognitive impairment remains to be explored. We induced CCH in rats by a bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) operation. Animals were randomly divided into a sham-operated group, CCH 4-week group, CCH 8-week group, and the corresponding D3NB-treatment groups. Cultured primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) to mimic CCH in vitro. We aimed to explore the effects of D3NB treatment on hippocampal neuronal death after CCH as well as its underlying molecular mechanism. We observed memory impairment and increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in the CCH groups, combined with inhibition of CNTF/CNTFRα/JAK2/STAT3 signaling, as compared with that of sham control rats. D3NB significantly attenuated cognitive impairment in CCH rats and decreased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis after BCCAO in vivo or OGD/R in vitro. More importantly, D3NB reversed the inhibition of CNTF/CNTFRα expression and activated the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Additionally, JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibitor AG490 counteracted the protective effects of D3NB in vitro. Our results suggest that D3NB could improve cognitive function after CCH and that this neuroprotective effect may be associated with reduced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis via modulation of CNTF/CNTFRα/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. D3NB may be a promising therapeutic strategy for vascular cognitive impairment induced by CCH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The ADP-ribosylation factor-like 3 (ARL3) is a ciliopathy G-protein which regulates the ciliary trafficking of several lipid-modified proteins. ARL3 is activated by its guanine exchange factor (GEF) ARL13B via an unresolved mechanism. BART is described as an ARL3 effector which has also been implicated in ciliopathies, although the role of its ARL3 interaction is unknown. Here we show that, at physiological GTP:GDP levels, human ARL3GDP is weakly activated by ARL13B. However, BART interacts with nucleotide-free ARL3 and, in concert with ARL13B, efficiently activates ARL3. In addition, BART binds ARL3GTP and inhibits GTP dissociation, thereby stabilising the active G-protein; the binding of ARL3 effectors then releases BART. Finally, using live cell imaging, we show that BART accesses the primary cilium and colocalises with ARL13B. We propose a model wherein BART functions as a &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; co-GEF for ARL3 and maintains the active ARL3GTP, until it is recycled by ARL3 effectors.</content>

 Mapping polyclonal serum responses is critical to rational vaccine design. However, most high-resolution mapping approaches involve isolating and characterizing individual antibodies, which incompletely defines the polyclonal response. Here we use two complementary approaches to directly map the specificities of the neutralizing and binding antibodies of polyclonal anti-HIV-1 sera from rabbits immunized with BG505 Env SOSIP trimers. We used mutational antigenic profiling to determine how all mutations in Env affected viral neutralization and electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM) to directly visualize serum Fabs bound to Env trimers. The dominant neutralizing specificities were generally only a subset of the more diverse binding specificities. Additional differences between binding and neutralization reflected antigenicity differences between virus and soluble Env trimer. Further, we refined residue-level epitope specificity directly from sera, revealing subtle differences across sera. Together, mutational antigenic profiling and EMPEM yield a holistic view of the binding and neutralizing specificity of polyclonal sera.</content>

 Generating mammalian cells with specific mtDNA-nDNA combinations is desirable but difficult to achieve and would be enabling for studies of mitochondrial-nuclear communication and coordination in controlling cell fates and functions. We developed 'MitoPunch', a pressure-driven mitochondrial transfer device, to deliver isolated mitochondria into numerous target mammalian cells simultaneousl&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;. MitoPunch and MitoCeption, a previously described force-based mitochondrial transfer approach, both yield stable isolated mitochondrial recipient (SIMR) cells that permanently retain exogenous mtDNA, whereas coincubation of mitochondria with cells does not yield SIMR cells. Although a typical MitoPunch or MitoCeption delivery results in dozens of immortalized SIMR clones with restored oxidative phosphorylation, only MitoPunch can produce replication-limited, non-immortal human SIMR clones. The MitoPunch device is versatile, inexpensive to assemble, and easy to use for engineering mtDNA-nDNA combinations to enable fundamental studies and potential translational applications.</content>

 The microphthalmia associated transcription factor (MITF) is a critical regulator of melanocyte development and differentiation. It also plays an important role in melanoma where it has been described as a molecular rheostat that, depending on activity levels, allows reversible switching between different cellular states. Here we show that MITF directly represses the expression of genes associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and focal adhesion pathways in human melanoma cells as well as of regulators of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as CDH2, thus affecting cell morphology and cell-matrix interactions. Importantly, we show that these effects of MITF are reversible, as expected from the rheostat model. The number of focal adhesion points increased upon MITF knockdown, a feature observed in drug resistant melanomas. Cells lacking MITF are similar to the cells of minimal residual disease observed in both human and zebrafish melanomas. Our results suggest that MITF plays a critical role as a repressor of gene expression and is actively involved in shaping the microenvironment of melanoma cells in a cell-autonomous manner.</content>

 Many different functions are regulated by circadian rhythms, including those orchestrated by discrete clock neurons within animal brains. To comprehensively characterize and assign cell identity to the 75 pairs of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; circadian neurons, we optimized a single cell RNA sequencing method and assayed clock neuron gene expression at different times of day. The data identify at least 17 clock neuron categories with striking spatial regulation of gene expression. Transcription factor regulation is prominent and likely contributes to the robust circadian oscillation of many transcripts, including those that encode cell-surface proteins previously shown to be important for cell recognition and synapse formation during development. The many other clock-regulated genes also constitute an important resource for future mechanistic and functional studies between clock neurons and/or for temporal signaling to circuits elsewhere in the fly brain.</content>

 Dendritic integration of synaptic inputs involves their increased electrotonic attenuation at distal dendrites, which can be counterbalanced by the increased synaptic receptor density. However, during network activity the influence of individual synapses depends on their release fidelity, the dendritic distribution of which remains poorly understood. Here, we employed classical optical quantal analyses and a genetically encoded optical glutamate sensor in acute hippocampal slices of rats and mice to monitor release at CA3-CA1 synapses. We find that their release probability increases with greater distances from the soma. Similar-fidelity synapses tend to group together whereas release probability shows no trends regarding the branch ends. Simulations with a realistic CA1 pyramidal cell hosting stochastic synapses suggest that the observed trends boost signal transfer fidelity, particularly at higher input frequencies. Because high-frequency bursting has been associated with learning, the release probability pattern we have found may play a key role in memory trace formation.</content>

 Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that acts directly on CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and dendritic cells to promote progression of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic inflammation. However, a direct role for TSLP in CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell primary responses remains controversial and its role in memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses to secondary viral infection is unknown. Here, we investigate the role of TSLP in both primary and recall responses in mice using two different viral systems. Interestingly, TSLP limited the primary CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell response to influenza but did not affect T cell function nor significantly alter the number of memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells generated after influenza infection. However, TSLP inhibited memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell responses to secondary viral infection with influenza or acute systemic LCMV infection. These data reveal a previously unappreciated role for TSLP on recall CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell responses in response to viral infection, findings with potential translational implications.</content>

 There has been accumulating evidence of human social chemo-signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Considering the evolutionarily conserved roles of oxytocin and vasopressin in reproductive and social behaviors, we examined whether the two neuropeptides are involved in the subconscious processing of androsta-4,16,-dien-3-one and estra-1,3,5 (10),16-tetraen-3-ol, two human chemosignals that convey masculinity and femininity to the targeted recipients, respectively. Psychophysical data collected from 216 heterosexual and homosexual men across five experiments totaling 1056 testing sessions consistently showed that such chemosensory communications of masculinity and femininity were blocked by a competitive antagonist of both oxytocin and vasopressin receptors called atosiban, administered nasally. On the other hand, intranasal oxytocin, but not vasopressin, modulated the decoding of androstadienone and estratetraenol in manners that were dose-dependent, nonmonotonic, and contingent upon the recipients’ social proficiency. Taken together, these findings establish a causal link between neuroendocrine factors and subconscious chemosensory communications of sex-specific information in humans.</content>

 Most funding agencies rely on peer review to evaluate grant applications and proposals, but research into the use of this process by funding agencies has been limited. Here we explore if two changes to the organization of peer review for proposals submitted to various funding actions by the European Union has an influence on the outcome of the peer review process. Based on an analysis of more than 75,000 applications to three actions of the Marie Curie programme over a period of 12 years, we find that the changes – a reduction in the number of evaluation criteria used by reviewers and a move from in-person to virtual meetings – had little impact on the outcome of the peer review process. Our results indicate that other factors, such as the type of grant or area of research, have a larger impact on the outcome.</content>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean visual system is a product of selection pressures favoring underwater vision, yet relatively little is known about it across taxa. Previous studies report several mutations in the opsin genetic sequence in cetaceans, suggesting the evolutionary complete or partial loss of retinal cone photoreceptor function in mysticete and odontocete lineages, respectively. Despite this, limited anatomical evidence suggests cone structures are partially maintained but with absent outer and inner segments in the bowhead retina. The functional consequence and anatomical distributions associated with these unique cone morphologies remain unclear. The current study further investigates the morphology and distribution of cone photoreceptors in the bowhead whale and beluga retina and evaluates the potential functional capacity of these cells' alternative to photoreception. Refined histological and advanced microscopic techniques revealed two additional cone morphologies in the bowhead and beluga retina that have not been previously described. Two proteins involved in magnetosensation were present in these cone structures suggesting the possibility for an alternative functional role in responding to changes in geomagnetic fields. These findings highlight a revised understanding of the unique evolution of cone and gross retinal anatomy in cetaceans, and provide prefatory evidence of potential functional reassignment of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;We delivered transcranial direct current stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex before, during, or after working memory training in order to assess the optimal stimulation timing to maximize learning. Although our procedure did not end up eliciting learning benefits, we did find that stimulation immediately after training &lt;i&gt;impaired&lt;/i&gt; performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research investigating transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to enhance cognitive training augments both our understanding of its long‐term effects on cognitive plasticity as well as potential applications to strengthen cognitive interventions. Previous work has demonstrated enhancement of working memory training while applying concurrent tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, the optimal stimulation parameters are still unknown. For example, the timing of tDCS delivery has been shown to be an influential variable that can interact with task learning. In the present study, we used tDCS to target the right DLPFC while participants trained on a visuospatial working memory task. We sought to compare the relative efficacy of online stimulation delivered during training to offline stimulation delivered either immediately before or afterwards. We were unable to replicate previously demonstrated benefits of online stimulation; however, we did find evidence that offline stimulation delivered after training can actually be detrimental to training performance relative to sham. We interpret our results in light of evidence suggesting a role of the right DLPFC in promoting memory interference, and conclude that while tDCS may be a promising tool to influence the results of cognitive training, more research and an abundance of caution are needed before fully endorsing its use for cognitive enhancement. This work suggests that effects can vary substantially in magnitude and direction between studies, and may be heavily dependent on a variety of intervention protocol parameters such as the timing and location of stimulation delivery, about which our understanding is still nascent.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Plant mitochondrial genomes have distinctive features compared to those of animals; namely, they are large and divergent, with sizes ranging from hundreds of thousands of to a few million bases. Recombination among repetitive regions is thought to produce similar structures that differ slightly, known as “multipartite structures,” which contribute to different phenotypes. Although many reference plant mitochondrial genomes represent almost all the genes in mitochondria, the full spectrum of their structures remains largely unknown. The emergence of long-read sequencing technology is expected to yield this landscape; however, many studies aimed to assemble only one representative circular genome, because properly understanding multipartite structures using existing assemblers is not feasible. To elucidate multipartite structures, we leveraged the information in existing reference genomes and classified long reads according to their corresponding structures. We developed a method that exploits two classic algorithms, partial order alignment (POA) and the hidden Markov model (HMM) to construct a sensitive read classifier. This method enables us to represent a set of reads as a POA graph and analyze it using the HMM. We can then calculate the likelihood of a read occurring in a given cluster, resulting in an iterative clustering algorithm. For synthetic data, our proposed method reliably detected one variation site out of 9,000-bp synthetic long reads with a 15% sequencing-error rate and produced accurate clustering. It was also capable of clustering long reads from six very similar sequences containing only slight differences. For real data, we assembled putative multipartite structures of mitochondrial genomes of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; from nine accessions sequenced using PacBio Sequel. The results indicated that there are recurrent and strain-specific structures in &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt; mitochondrial genomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GEtL_p_DDs8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Episodic memory depends on the computational process of pattern separation in order to establish distinct memory representations of similar episodes. Studies of pattern separation in humans rely on mnemonic discrimination tasks, which have been shown to tax hippocampal‐dependent pattern separation. Although previous neuroimaging research has focused on hippocampal processing, little is known about how other brain regions, known to be involved in recognition memory performance, are involved in mnemonic discrimination tasks. Conversely, neuroimaging studies of pattern separation with whole‐brain coverage lack spatial resolution to localize activation to hippocampal subfields. In this study, 48 healthy young adult participants underwent whole‐brain high‐resolution functional MRI (fMRI) scanning while completing a mnemonic discrimination task. A priori region‐of‐interest analyses revealed activation patterns consistent with pattern separation in distinct hippocampal subregions, particularly in the subiculum. Connectivity analyses revealed a network of cortical regions consistent with the memory retrieval network where fMRI activation was correlated with hippocampal activation. An exploratory whole‐brain analysis revealed widespread activation differentially associated with performance of the mnemonic discrimination task. Taken together, these results suggest that a network of brain regions contribute to mnemonic discrimination performance, with the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex as a hub in the network displaying clear signals consistent with pattern separation and regions such as the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex particularly important for successful lure discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult‐born granule cells (abGCs) integrate into the hippocampus and form connections with dentate gyrus parvalbumin‐positive (PV+) interneurons, a circuit important for modulating plasticity. Many of these interneurons are surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures known to participate in plasticity. We compared abGC projections to PV+ interneurons with negative‐to‐low intensity PNNs to those with high intensity PNNs using retroviral and 3R‐Tau labeling in adult mice, and found that abGC mossy fibers and boutons are more frequently located near PV+ interneurons with high intensity PNNs. These results suggest that axons of new neurons preferentially stabilize near target cells with intense PNNs. Next, we asked whether the number of abGCs influences PNN formation around PV+ interneurons, and found that near complete ablation of abGCs produced a decrease in the intensity and number of PV+ neurons with PNNs, suggesting that new neuron innervation may enhance PNN formation. Experience‐driven changes in adult neurogenesis did not produce consistent effects, perhaps due to widespread effects on plasticity. Our study identifies abGC projections to PV+ interneurons with PNNs, with more presumed abGC mossy fiber boutons found near the cell body of PV+ interneurons with strong PNNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We propose a method for meta-learning reinforcement learning algorithms by
searching over the space of computational graphs which compute the loss
function for a value-based model-free RL agent to optimize. The learned
algorithms are domain-agnostic and can generalize to new environments not seen
during training. Our method can both learn from scratch and bootstrap off known
existing algorithms, like DQN, enabling interpretable modifications which
improve performance. Learning from scratch on simple classical control and
gridworld tasks, our method rediscovers the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm.
Bootstrapped from DQN, we highlight two learned algorithms which obtain good
generalization performance over other classical control tasks, gridworld type
tasks, and Atari games. The analysis of the learned algorithm behavior shows
resemblance to recently proposed RL algorithms that address overestimation in
value-based methods.

 &lt;p&gt;A wide variety of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have recently been
proposed to learn profitable investment strategies. The rules learned by these
models outperform the previous strategies specially in high frequency trading
environments. However, it is shown that the quality of the extracted features
from a long-term sequence of raw prices of the instruments greatly affects the
performance of the trading rules learned by these models. Employing a neural
encoder-decoder structure to extract informative features from complex input
time-series has proved very effective in other popular tasks like neural
machine translation and video captioning in which the models face a similar
problem. The encoder-decoder framework extracts highly informative features
from a long sequence of prices along with learning how to generate outputs
based on the extracted features. In this paper, a novel end-to-end model based
on the neural encoder-decoder framework combined with DRL is proposed to learn
single instrument trading strategies from a long sequence of raw prices of the
instrument. The proposed model consists of an encoder which is a neural
structure responsible for learning informative features from the input
sequence, and a decoder which is a DRL model responsible for learning
profitable strategies based on the features extracted by the encoder. The
parameters of the encoder and the decoder structures are learned jointly, which
enables the encoder to extract features fitted to the task of the decoder DRL.
In addition, the effects of different structures for the encoder and various
forms of the input sequences on the performance of the learned strategies are
investigated. Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperforms
other state-of-the-art models in highly dynamic environments.

 &lt;p&gt;This tutorial paper surveys training alternatives to end-to-end
backpropagation (E2EBP) -- the de facto standard for training deep
architectures. Modular training refers to strictly local training without both
the forward and the backward pass, i.e., dividing a deep architecture into
several nonoverlapping modules and training them separately without any
end-to-end operation. Between the fully global E2EBP and the strictly local
modular training, there are &quot;weakly modular&quot; hybrids performing training
without the backward pass only. These alternatives can match or surpass the
performance of E2EBP on challenging datasets such as ImageNet, and are gaining
increased attention primarily because they offer practical advantages over
E2EBP, which will be enumerated herein. In particular, they allow for greater
modularity and transparency in deep learning workflows, aligning deep learning
with the mainstream computer science engineering that heavily exploits
modularization for scalability. Modular training has also revealed novel
insights about learning and may have further implications on other important
research domains. Specifically, it induces natural and effective solutions to
some important practical problems such as data efficiency and transferability
estimation.

 &lt;p&gt;In this paper, machine learning and artificial neural network models are
proposed for quantum noise classification in stochastic quantum dynamics. For
this purpose, we train and then validate support vector machine, multi-layer
perceptron and recurrent neural network, models with different complexity and
accuracy, to solve supervised binary classification problems. By exploiting the
quantum random walk formalism, we demonstrate the high efficacy of such tools
in classifying noisy quantum dynamics using data sets collected in a single
realisation of the quantum system evolution. In addition, we also show that for
a successful classification one just needs to measure, in a sequence of
discrete time instants, the probabilities that the analysed quantum system is
in one of the allowed positions or energy configurations, without any external
driving. Thus, neither measurements of quantum coherences nor sequences of
control pulses are required. Since in principle the training of the machine
learning models can be performed a-priori on synthetic data, our approach is
expected to find direct application in a vast number of experimental schemes
and also for the noise benchmarking of the already available noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices.

 &lt;p&gt;When evolution algorithms are used to unfold the neutron energy spectrum,
fitness function design is an important fundamental work for evaluating the
quality of the solution, but it has not attracted much attention. In this work,
we investigated the performance of eight fitness functions attached to the
genetic algorithm (GA) and the differential evolution algorithm (DEA) used for
unfolding four neutron spectra selected from the IAEA 403 report. Experiments
show that the fitness functions with a maximum in the GA can limit the ability
of the population to percept the fitness change, but the ability can be made up
in the DEA. The fitness function with a feature penalty term helps to improve
the performance of solutions, and the fitness function using the standard
deviation and the Chi-squared result shows the balance between the algorithm
and the spectra. The results also show that the DEA has good potential for
neutron energy spectrum unfolding. The purposes of this work are to provide
evidence for structuring and modifying the fitness functions and to suggest
some genetic operations that should receive attention when using the fitness
function to unfold neutron spectra.

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;Sparse&quot; neural networks, in which relatively few neurons or connections are
active, are common in both machine learning and neuroscience. Whereas in
machine learning, &quot;sparsity&quot; is related to a penalty term that leads to some
connecting weights becoming small or zero, in biological brains, sparsity is
often created when high spiking thresholds prevent neuronal activity. Here we
introduce sparsity into a reservoir computing network via neuron-specific
learnable thresholds of activity, allowing neurons with low thresholds to
contribute to decision-making but suppressing information from neurons with
high thresholds. This approach, which we term &quot;SpaRCe&quot;, optimises the sparsity
level of the reservoir without affecting the reservoir dynamics. The read-out
weights and the thresholds are learned by an on-line gradient rule that
minimises an error function on the outputs of the network. Threshold learning
occurs by the balance of two opposing forces: reducing inter-neuronal
correlations in the reservoir by deactivating redundant neurons, while
increasing the activity of neurons participating in correct decisions. We test
SpaRCe on classification problems and find that threshold learning improves
performance compared to standard reservoir computing. SpaRCe alleviates the
problem of catastrophic forgetting, a problem most evident in standard echo
state networks and recurrent neural networks in general, due to increasing the
number of task-specialised neurons that are included in the network decisions.

 &lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks have been proven effective in a variety of
image restoration tasks. Most state-of-the-art solutions, however, are trained
using images with a single particular degradation level, and their performance
deteriorates drastically when applied to other degradation settings. In this
paper, we propose deep likelihood network (DL-Net), aiming at generalizing
off-the-shelf image restoration networks to succeed over a spectrum of
degradation levels. We slightly modify an off-the-shelf network by appending a
simple recursive module, which is derived from a fidelity term, for
disentangling the computation for multiple degradation levels. Extensive
experimental results on image inpainting, interpolation, and super-resolution
show the effectiveness of our DL-Net.

 &lt;p&gt;Conspiracy theories, or in general seriously distorted beliefs, are
widespread. How and why are they formed in the brain is still more a matter of
speculation rather than science. In this paper one plausible mechanisms is
investigated: rapid freezing of high neuroplasticity (RFHN). Emotional arousal
increases neuroplasticity and leads to creation of new pathways spreading
neural activation. Using the language of neurodynamics a meme is defined as
quasi-stable associative memory attractor state. Depending on the temporal
characteristics of the incoming information and the plasticity of the network,
memory may self-organize creating memes with large attractor basins, linking
many unrelated input patterns. Memes with fake rich associations distort
relations between memory states. Simulations of various neural network models
trained with competitive Hebbian learning (CHL) on stationary and
non-stationary data lead to the same conclusion: short learning with high
plasticity followed by rapid decrease of plasticity leads to memes with large
attraction basins, distorting input pattern representations in associative
memory. Such system-level models may be used to understand creation of
distorted beliefs and formation of conspiracy memes, understood as strong
attractor states of the neurodynamics.

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.599781"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.599781</id>
		<updated>2021-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Inhalational anesthetic-induced burst suppression (BS) is classically considered a bilaterally synchronous rhythm. However, local asynchrony has been predicted in theoretical studies and reported in patients with pre-existing focal pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We used high-speed widefield calcium imaging to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of isoflurane-induced BS in rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that isoflurane-induced BS is not a globally synchronous rhythm. In the neocortex, neural activity first emerged in a spatially shifting, variably localized focus. Subsequent propagation across the whole cortex was rapid, typically within &amp;lt;100 milliseconds, giving the superficial resemblance to global synchrony. Neural activity remained locally asynchronous during the bursts, forming complex recurrent propagating waves. Despite propagation variability, spatial sequences of burst propagation were largely preserved between the hemispheres, and neural activity was highly correlated between the homotopic areas. The critical role of the thalamus in cortical burst initiation was demonstrated by using unilateral thalamic tetrodotoxin injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The classical impression that anesthetics-induced BS is a state of global brain synchrony is inaccurate. Bursts are a series of shifting local cortical events facilitated by thalamic projection that unfold as rapid, bilaterally asynchronous propagating waves.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes may not only be involved in the clearance of Amyloid beta peptides (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but appear to produce N-terminally truncated Aβ (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;n−x&lt;/sub&gt;) independently of BACE1, which generates the N-Terminus of Aβ starting with Asp1 (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;). A candidate protease for the generation of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;n−x&lt;/sub&gt; is cathepsin B (CatB), especially since CatB has also been reported to degrade Aβ, which could explain the opposite roles of astrocytes in AD. In this study, we investigated the influence of CatB inhibitors and the deletion of the gene encoding CatB (CTSB) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology on Aβ&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt; levels in cell culture supernatants by one- and two-dimensional Urea-SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot. While the cell-permeant inhibitors E64d and CA-074 Me did not significantly affect the Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt; levels in supernatants of cultured chicken and human astrocytes, they did reduce the Aβ&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt; levels. In the glioma-derived cell line H4, the Aβ&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt; levels were likewise decreased in supernatants by treatment with the more specific, but cell-impermeant CatB-inhibitor CA-074, by CA-074 Me treatment, and by CTSB gene deletion. Additionally, a more than 2-fold increase in secreted Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt; was observed under the latter two conditions. The CA-074 Me-mediated increase of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;, but not the decrease of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt;, was influenced by concomitant treatment with the vacuolar H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin A1. This indicated that non-lysosomal CatB mediated the production of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt; in astrocytes, while the degradation of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt; seemed to be dependent on lysosomal CatB in H4 cells, but not in primary astrocytes. These findings highlight the importance of considering organelle targeting in drug development to promote Aβ degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A key area of research in epilepsy neurological disorder is the characterization of epileptic networks as they form and evolve during seizure events. In this paper, we describe the development and application of an integrative workflow to analyze functional and structural connectivity measures during seizure events using stereotactic electroencephalogram (SEEG) and diffusion weighted imaging data (DWI). We computed structural connectivity measures using electrode locations involved in recording SEEG signal data as reference points to filter fiber tracts. We used a new workflow-based tool to compute functional connectivity measures based on non-linear correlation coefficient, which allows the derivation of directed graph structures to represent coupling between signal data. We applied a hierarchical clustering based network analysis method over the functional connectivity data to characterize the organization of brain network into modules using data from 27 events across 8 seizures in a patient with refractory left insula epilepsy. The visualization of hierarchical clustering values as dendrograms shows the formation of connected clusters first within each insulae followed by merging of clusters across the two insula; however, there are clear differences between the network structures and clusters formed across the 8 seizures of the patient. The analysis of structural connectivity measures showed strong connections between contacts of certain electrodes within the same brain hemisphere with higher prevalence in the perisylvian/opercular areas. The combination of imaging and signal modalities for connectivity analysis provides information about a patient-specific dynamical functional network and examines the underlying structural connections that potentially influences the properties of the epileptic network. We also performed statistical analysis of the absolute changes in correlation values across all 8 seizures during a baseline normative time period and different seizure events, which showed decreased correlation values during seizure onset; however, the changes during ictal phases were varied.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain organoids, or cerebral organoids, have become widely used to study the human brain in vitro. As pluripotent stem cell-derived structures capable of self-organization and recapitulation of physiological cell types and architecture, brain organoids bridge the gap between relatively simple two-dimensional human cell cultures and non-human animal models. This allows for high complexity and physiological relevance in a controlled in vitro setting, opening the door for a variety of applications including development and disease modeling and high-throughput screening. While technologies such as single cell sequencing have led to significant advances in brain organoid characterization and understanding, improved functional analysis (especially electrophysiology) is needed to realize the full potential of brain organoids. In this review, we highlight key technologies for brain organoid development and characterization, then discuss current electrophysiological methods for brain organoid analysis. While electrophysiological approaches have improved rapidly for two-dimensional cultures, only in the past several years have advances been made to overcome limitations posed by the three-dimensionality of brain organoids. Here, we review major advances in electrophysiological technologies and analytical methods with a focus on advances with applicability for brain organoid analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) lesioning is a new treatment for brain disorders. However, the skull is a major barrier of ultrasound sonication in MRgFUS because it has an irregular surface and varies its size and shape among individuals. We recently developed the concept of skull density ratio (SDR) to select candidates for MRgFUS from among patients with essential tremor (ET). However, SDR is not the only factor contributing to successful MRgFUS lesioning treatment—refining the target through exact measurement of the ultrasonic echo in the transducer also improves treatment efficacy. In the present study, we carried out MRgFUS lesioning using an autofocusing echo imaging technique. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this new approach, especially in patients with low SDR in whom previous focusing methods have failed.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;From December 2019 to March 2020, we recruited 10 patients with ET or Parkinson’s disease (PD) who had a low SDR. Two patients dropped out of the trial due to the screening failure of other medical diseases. In total, eight patients were included: six with ET who underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy and two with PD who underwent MRgFUS pallidotomy. The autofocusing echo imaging technique was used in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean SDR of the patients with ET was 0.34 (range: 0.29–0.39), while that of the patients with PD was 0.41 (range: 0.38–0.44). The mean skull volume of patients with ET was 280.57 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (range: 227–319 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), while that of the patients with PD was 287.13 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (range: 271–303 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). During MRgFUS, a mean of 15 sonications were performed, among which a mean of 5.63 used the autofocusing technique. The mean maximal temperature (Tmax) achieved was 55.88°C (range: 52–59°C), while the mean energy delivered was 34.75 kJ (range: 20–42 kJ) among all patients. No serious adverse events occurred during or after treatment. Tmax or sonication factors (skull volume, SDR, sonication number, autofocusing score, similarity score, energy range, and power) were not correlated with autofocusing technique (p &amp;gt; 0.05, autofocusing score showed a p-value of 0.071).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Using autofocusing echo imaging lesioning, a safe and efficient MRgFUS treatment, is available even for patients with a low SDR. Therefore, the indications for MRgFUS lesioning could be expanded to include patients with ET who have an SDR &amp;lt; 0.4 and those with PD who have an SDR &amp;lt; 0.45.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT03935581.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In this study, we verified that the recently introduced optimized fingerprint method and the automatic removal of cardiac interference (ARCI) approach not only remove physiological artifacts from EEG recordings but also preserve global brain dynamics, as assessed with a new approach based on microstate analysis. We recorded EEG activity with a high-resolution EEG system during two resting-state conditions (eyes open, 25 volunteers, and eyes closed, 26 volunteers) known to exhibit different brain dynamics. After signal decomposition by independent component analysis (ICA), the independent components (ICs) related to eyeblinks, eye movements, myogenic interference, and cardiac electromechanical activity were identified with the optimized fingerprint method and ARCI approach and statistically compared with the outcome of the expert classification of the ICs by visual inspection. Brain dynamics in two different groups of denoised EEG signals, reconstructed after having removed the artifactual ICs identified by either visual inspection or the automated methods, was assessed by calculating microstate topographies, microstate metrics (duration, occurrence, and coverage), and directional predominance (based on transition probabilities). No statistically significant differences between the expert and the automated classification of the artifactual ICs were found (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Cronbach’s α values assessed the high test–retest reliability of microstate parameters for EEG datasets denoised by the automated procedure. The total EEG signal variance explained by the sets of global microstate templates was about 80% for all denoised EEG datasets, with no significant differences between groups. For the differently denoised EEG datasets in the two recording conditions, we found that the global microstate templates and the sequences of global microstates were very similar (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Descriptive statistics and Cronbach’s α of microstate metrics highlighted no significant differences and excellent consistency between groups (p &amp;gt; 0.5). These results confirm the ability of the optimized fingerprint method and the ARCI approach to effectively remove physiological artifacts from EEG recordings while preserving global brain dynamics. They also suggest that microstate analysis could represent a novel approach for assessing the ability of an EEG denoising method to remove artifacts without altering brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alginate hydrogels are a commonly used substrate for in vitro 3D cell culture. These naturally derived biomaterials are highly tunable, biocompatible, and can be designed to mimic the elastic modulus of the adult brain at 1% w/v solution. Recent studies show that the molecular weight of the alginate can affect cell viability and differentiation. The relationship between the molecular weight, viscosity and ratio of G:M monomers of alginate hydrogels is complex, and the balance between these factors must be carefully considered when deciding on a suitable alginate hydrogel for stem cell research. This study investigates the formation of embryoid bodies (EB) from mouse embryonic stem cells, using low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) alginates. The cells are differentiated using a retinoic acid-based protocol, and the resulting aggregates are sectioned and stained for the presence of stem cells and the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). The results highlight that aggregates within LMW and HMW alginate are true EBs, as demonstrated by positive staining for markers of the three germ layers. Using tubular alginate scaffolds, formed with an adapted gradient maker protocol, we also propose a novel 3D platform for the patterned differentiation of mESCs, based on gradients of retinoic acid produced in situ by lateral motor column (LMC) motor neurons. The end product of our platform will be of great interest as it can be further developed into a powerful model of neural tube development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Facial muscle activities are essential for the appearance and communication of human beings. Therefore, exploring the activation patterns of facial muscles can help understand facial neuromuscular disorders such as Bell’s palsy. Given the irregular shape of the facial muscles as well as their different locations, it should be difficult to detect the activities of whole facial muscles with a few electrodes. In this study, a high-density surface electromyogram (HD sEMG) system with 90 electrodes was used to record EMG signals of facial muscles in both healthy and Bell’s palsy subjects when they did different facial movements. The electrodes were arranged in rectangular arrays covering the forehead and cheek regions of the face. The muscle activation patterns were shown on maps, which were constructed from the Root Mean Square (RMS) values of all the 90-channel EMG recordings. The experimental results showed that the activation patterns of facial muscles were distinct during doing different facial movements and the activated muscle regions could be clearly observed. Moreover, two features of the activation patterns, 2D correlation coefficient (corr2) and Centre of Gravity (CG) were extracted to quantify the spatial symmetry and the location of activated muscle regions respectively. Furthermore, the deviation of activated muscle regions on the paralyzed side of a face compared to the healthy side was quantified by calculating the distance between two sides of CGs. The results revealed that corr2 of the activated facial muscle region (classified into forehead region and cheek region) in Bell’s palsy subjects was significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) lower than that in healthy subjects, while CG distance of activated facial region in Bell’s palsy subjects was significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) higher than that in healthy subjects. The correlation between corr2 of these regions and Bell’s palsy [assessed by the Facial Nerve Grading Scale (FNGS) 2.0] was also significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in Bell’s palsy subjects. The spatial information on activated muscle regions may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of Bell’s palsy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) deficits are pervasive co-morbidities of epilepsy. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning these impairments remain elusive, it is thought that WM depends on oscillatory interactions within and between nodes of large-scale functional networks. These include the hippocampus and default mode network as well as the prefrontal cortex and frontoparietal central executive network. Here, we review the functional roles of neural oscillations in subserving WM and the putative mechanisms by which epilepsy disrupts normative activity, leading to aberrant oscillatory signatures. We highlight the particular role of interictal epileptic activity, including interictal epileptiform discharges and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in WM deficits. We also discuss the translational opportunities presented by greater understanding of the oscillatory basis of WM function and dysfunction in epilepsy, including potential targets for neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Humans quickly and accurately learn new visual concepts from sparse data, sometimes just a single example. The impressive performance of artificial neural networks which hierarchically pool afferents across scales and positions suggests that the hierarchical organization of the human visual system is critical to its accuracy. These approaches, however, require magnitudes of order more examples than human learners. We used a benchmark deep learning model to show that the hierarchy can also be leveraged to vastly improve the speed of learning. We specifically show how previously learned but broadly tuned conceptual representations can be used to learn visual concepts from as few as two positive examples; reusing visual representations from earlier in the visual hierarchy, as in prior approaches, requires significantly more examples to perform comparably. These results suggest techniques for learning even more efficiently and provide a biologically plausible way to learn new visual concepts from few examples.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: DL-3n-butylphthalide (NBP) has beneficial effects in different stages of ischemic stroke. Our previous studies have demonstrated that NBP promoted angiogenesis in the perifocal region of the ischemic brain. However, the molecular mechanism of NBP for blood–brain barrier protection in acute ischemic stroke was unclear. Here, we explored the neuroprotective effects of NBP on blood–brain barrier integrity in the acute phase of ischemic stroke in a rat model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 82) underwent 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and received 90 mg/kg of NBP for 3 days. Brain edema, infarct volume, surface blood flow, and neurological severity score were evaluated. Blood–brain barrier integrity was evaluated by Evans blue leakage and changes in tight junction proteins. We further examined AQP4 and eNOS expression, MMP-9 enzyme activity, and possible signaling pathways for the role of NBP after ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: NBP treatment significantly increased eNOS expression and surface blood flow in the brain, reduced brain edema and infarct volume, and improved neurological severity score compared to the control group (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, NBP attenuated Evans blue and IgG leakage and increased tight junction protein expression compared to the control after 1 and 3 days of ischemic stroke (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Finally, NBP decreased AQP4 expression, MMP-9 enzyme activity, and increased MAPK expression during acute ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: NBP protected blood–brain barrier integrity and attenuated brain injury in the acute phase of ischemic stroke by decreasing AQP4 expression and MMP-9 enzyme activity. The MAPK signaling pathway may be associated in this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Adenosine, a major neuromodulator in the central nervous system (CNS), is involved in a variety of regulatory functions such as the sleep/wake cycle. Because exogenous adenosine displays dark- and night-mimicking effects in the vertebrate retina, we tested the hypothesis that a circadian (24 h) clock in the retina uses adenosine to control neuronal light responses and information processing. Using a variety of techniques in the intact goldfish retina including measurements of adenosine overflow and content, tracer labeling, and electrical recording of the light responses of cone photoreceptor cells and cone horizontal cells (cHCs), which are post-synaptic to cones, we demonstrate that a circadian clock in the retina itself—but not activation of melatonin or dopamine receptors—controls extracellular and intracellular adenosine levels so that they are highest during the subjective night. Moreover, the results show that the clock increases extracellular adenosine at night by enhancing adenosine content so that inward adenosine transport ceases. Also, we report that circadian clock control of endogenous cone adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation increases rod-cone gap junction coupling and rod input to cones and cHCs at night. These results demonstrate that adenosine and A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity are controlled by a circadian clock in the retina, and are used by the clock to modulate rod-cone electrical synapses and the sensitivity of cones and cHCs to very dim light stimuli. Moreover, the adenosine system represents a separate circadian-controlled pathway in the retina that is independent of the melatonin/dopamine pathway but which nevertheless acts in concert to enhance the day/night difference in rod-cone coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a deadly pandemic with surging mortality rates and no cure. COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with a range of clinical symptoms, including cough, fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, and a loss of smell or taste. Aged individuals with compromised immunity are highly susceptible to COVID-19 and the likelihood of mortality increases with age and the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 highjacks mitochondria of immune cells, replicates within mitochondrial structures, and impairs mitochondrial dynamics leading to cell death. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell and are largely involved in maintaining cell immunity, homeostasis, and cell survival/death. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria from COVID-19 infected cells are highly vulnerable, and vulnerability increases with age. The purpose of our article is to summarize the role of various age-related comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and neurological diseases in increasing mortality rates amongst the elderly with COVID-19. Our article also highlights the interaction between coronavirus and mitochondrial dynamics in immune cells. We also highlight the current treatments, lifestyles, and safety measures that can help protect against COVID-19. Further research is urgently needed to understand the molecular mechanisms between the mitochondrial virus and disease progression in COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent investigations demonstrated that genetic factors might play an important role in sporadic Parkinson’s disease (sPD). To clarify the specific loci susceptibility to sPD, we analyze the relationship between 30 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and sPD in the population of Han ancestry from Chinese mainland (HACM) by using genome-wide association study, sequenom massARRAY, DNA sequence, and biological information analysis. Results showed that the subjects carrying the T allele of rs863108 and rs28499371 exhibited a decreased risk for sPD. The subjects carrying the T allele of rs80315856 exhibited an increased risk for sPD. The A/T genotype of rs863108 and the C/T genotype of rs28499371 were a potential increased risk for sPD, and the G/T genotype of rs80315856 and T/T genotype of rs2270568 were a potential decreased risk for sPD. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs80315856 and rs2270568 was higher in sPD. The T allele of rs80315856 and rs2270568 might be a risk locus for sPD. Our data suggested that the alteration of these SNPs might play some roles through changing/affecting LINC01524/LOC105372666, DMRT2/SMARCA2, PLEKHN1, and FLJ23172/FNDC3B genes in the pathogenesis of sPD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that plasma β-amyloid (Aβ) levels are useful biomarkers to reflect brain amyloidosis and gray matter structure, but little is known about their correlation with subclinical white matter (WM) integrity in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the microstructural changes in WM between subjects with low and high plasma Aβ levels among individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This study included 142 cognitively normal individuals with SCD who underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests, plasma Aβ measurements, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based on the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE). Using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), we compared fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) in WM between subjects with low (N = 71) and high (N = 71) plasma Aβ levels (cut-off: 761.45 pg/ml for Aβ40 and 10.74 pg/ml for Aβ42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We observed significantly decreased FA and increased MD in the high Aβ40 group compared to the low Aβ40 group in various regions, including the body, the genu, and the splenium of the corpus callosum; the superior longitudinal fasciculus; the corona radiata; the thalamic radiation; the external and internal capsules; the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus; and the sagittal stratum [p &amp;lt; 0.05, familywise error (FWE) corrected]. Average FA values were associated with poor performance on executive and memory assessments. No significant differences were found in either MD or FA between the low and high Aβ42 groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results suggest that a correlation exists between WM integrity and plasma Aβ40 levels in individuals with SCD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The capsids of non-enveloped viruses are highly multimeric and multifunctional protein assemblies that play key roles in viral biology and pathogenesis. Despite their importance, a comprehensive understanding of how mutations affect viral fitness across different structural and functional attributes of the capsid is lacking. To address this limitation, we globally define the effects of mutations across the capsid of a human picornavirus. Using this resource, we identify structural and sequence determinants that accurately predict mutational fitness effects, refine evolutionary analyses, and define the sequence specificity of key capsid encoded motifs. Furthermore, capitalizing on the derived sequence requirements for capsid encoded protease cleavage sites, we implement a bioinformatic approach for identifying novel host proteins targeted by viral proteases. Our findings represent the most comprehensive investigation of mutational fitness effects in a picornavirus capsid to date and illuminate important aspects of viral biology, evolution, and host interactions.</content>

 Genetic factors account for the majority of the variance of human bone mass, but the contribution of non-genetic factors remains largely unknown. By utilizing maternal/offspring transmission, cohabitation, or fecal material transplantation (FMT) studies, we investigated the influence of the gut microbiome on skeletal maturation. We show that the gut microbiome is a communicable regulator of bone structure and turnover in mice. In addition, we found that the acquisition of a specific bacterial strain, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a gut microbe that induces intestinal Th17 cell expansion, was sufficient to negatively impact skeletal maturation. These findings have significant translational implications, as the identification of methods or timing of microbiome transfer may lead to the development of bacteriotherapeutic interventions to optimize skeletal maturation in humans. Moreover, the transfer of SFB-like microbes capable of triggering the expansion of human Th17 cells during therapeutic FMT procedures could lead to significant bone loss in fecal material recipients.</content>

 The purpose of preclinical research is to inform the development of novel diagnostics or therapeutics, and the results of experiments on animal models of disease often inform the decision to conduct studies in humans. However, a substantial number of clinical trials fail, even when preclinical studies have apparently demonstrated the efficacy of a given intervention. A number of large-scale replication studies are currently trying to identify the factors that influence the robustness of preclinical research. Here, we discuss replications in the context of preclinical research trajectories, and argue that increasing validity should be a priority when selecting experiments to replicate and when performing the replication. We conclude that systematically improving three domains of validity – internal, external and translational – will result in a more efficient allocation of resources, will be more ethical, and will ultimately increase the chances of successful translation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The symbiotic partnership between leaf-cutting ants and fungal cultivars processes plant biomass via ant fecal fluid mixed with chewed plant substrate before fungal degradation. Here we present a full proteome of the fecal fluid of &lt;i&gt;Acromyrmex&lt;/i&gt; leaf-cutting ants, showing that most proteins function as biomass degrading enzymes and that ca. 85% are produced by the fungus and ingested, but not digested, by the ants. Hydrogen peroxide producing oxidoreductases were remarkably common in the proteome, inspiring us to test a scenario in which hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron to form reactive oxygen radicals after which oxidized iron is reduced by other fecal-fluid enzymes. Our biochemical assays confirmed that these so-called Fenton reactions do indeed take place in special substrate pellets, presumably to degrade plant cell wall polymers. This implies that the symbiotic partnership manages a combination of oxidative and enzymatic biomass degradation, an achievement that surpasses current human bioconversion technology.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Opisthorchiasis is an overlooked danger to Southeast Asia. High-resolution disease risk maps are critical but haven't been available for Southeast Asia. Georeferenced disease data and potential influencing factor data were collected through a systematic review of literatures and open-access databases, respectively. Bayesian spatial-temporal joint models were developed to analyze both point- and area-level disease data, within a logit regression in combination of potential influencing factors and spatial-temporal random effects. The model-based risk mapping identified areas of low, moderate and high prevalence across the study region. Even though the overall population-adjusted estimated prevalence presented a trend down, a total of 12.39 million (95% BCI: 10.10-15.06) people were estimated infected with &lt;i&gt;O. viverrini&lt;/i&gt; in 2018 in four major endemic countries (i.e., Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam), highlighting the public health importance of the disease in the study region. The high-resolution risk maps provide valuable information for spatial targeting of opisthorchiasis control interventions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Autologous, CCR5 gene-edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is a promising strategy for achieving HIV remission. However, only a fraction of HSPCs can be edited ex vivo to provide protection against infection. To project the thresholds of CCR5-edition necessary for HIV remission, we developed a mathematical model that recapitulates blood T cell reconstitution and plasma simian-HIV (SHIV) dynamics from SHIV-1157ipd3N4-infected pig-tailed macaques that underwent autologous transplantation with CCR5 gene editing. The model predicts that viral control can be obtained following analytical treatment interruption (ATI) when: (1) transplanted HSPCs are at least fivefold higher than residual endogenous HSPCs after total body irradiation and (2) the fraction of protected HSPCs in the transplant achieves a threshold (76–94%) sufficient to overcome transplantation-dependent loss of SHIV immunity. Under these conditions, if ATI is withheld until transplanted gene-modified cells engraft and reconstitute to a steady state, spontaneous viral control is projected to occur.</content>

 We introduce a random access parallel (RAP) imaging modality that uses a novel design inspired by a Newtonian telescope to image multiple spatially separated samples without moving parts or robotics. This scheme enables near simultaneous image capture of multiple petri dishes and random-access imaging with sub-millisecond switching times at the full resolution of the camera. This enables the RAP system to capture long duration records from different samples in parallel, which is not possible using conventional automated microscopes. The system is demonstrated by continuously imaging multiple cardiac monolayer and &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;) preparations.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Homeostasis in adult tissues relies on the replication dynamics of stem cells, their progenitors and the spatial balance between them. This spatial and kinetic coordination is crucial to the successful maintenance of tissue size and its replenishment with new cells. However, our understanding of the role of cellular replicative lifespan and spatial correlation between cells in shaping tissue integrity is still lacking. We developed a mathematical model for the stochastic spatial dynamics that underlie the rejuvenation of corneal epithelium. Our model takes into account different spatial correlations between cell replication and cell removal. We derive the tradeoffs between replicative lifespan, spatial correlation length, and tissue rejuvenation dynamics. We determine the conditions that allow homeostasis and are consistent with biological timescales, pattern formation, and mutants phenotypes. Our results can be extended to any cellular system in which spatial homeostasis is maintained through cell replication.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is difficult in patients with less fulminant diseases, like epilepsy. However, recognition is important, as patients require immunotherapy. This study aims to identify antibodies in patients with focal epilepsy of unknown etiology, and to create a score to preselect patient requiring testing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this prospective, multicenter, cohort study, adults with focal epilepsy of unknown etiology, without recognized AIE, were included, between December 2014–2017, and followed for one year. Serum, and if available CSF, were analyzed using different laboratory techniques. The ACES score was created using factors favoring an autoimmune etiology of seizures (AES), as determined by multivariable logistic regression. The model was externally validated and evaluated using Concordance (C) statistic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 582 patients, with median epilepsy duration of 8 years (IQR 2–18). Twenty patients (3.4%) had AES, of whom 3 anti‐Leucine‐rich‐Glioma‐Inactivated 1, 3 anti‐Contactin‐Associated Protein‐like2, 1 anti‐N‐methyl‐D‐Aspartate Receptor, and 13 anti‐Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase‐65 (ELISA‐concentrations&amp;gt;10,000 IU/ml). Risk factors for AES were: temporal MRI‐hyperintensities (OR 255.3,95%‐CI 19.6–3332.2;p &amp;lt; 0.0001), autoimmune diseases (OR 13.31,95%‐CI 3.1–56.6;p = 0.0005), behavioral changes (OR 12.3,95%‐CI 3.2–49.9;p = 0.0003), autonomic symptoms (OR 13.3,95%‐CI 3.1–56.6;p = 0.0005), cognitive symptoms (OR 30.6,95%‐CI 2.4–382.7;p = 0.009), and speech problems (OR 9.6,95%‐CI 2.0–46.7;p = 0.005). The internally validated C statistic was 0.95, and 0.92 in the validation cohort (n = 128). Assigning each factor one point, an ACES score ≥ 2 had a sensitivity of 100% to detect AES, and a specificity of 84.9%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific signs point towards AES in focal epilepsy of unknown etiology. The ACES score (cut‐off ≥2) is useful to select patients requiring antibody testing.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut microbiome alterations in Parkinson disease (PD) have been reported repeatedly, but their functional relevance remains unclear. Fecal metabolomics, which provide a functional readout of microbial activity, have scarcely been investigated. We investigated fecal microbiome and metabolome alterations in PD, and their clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hundred subjects (104 patients, 96 controls) underwent extensive clinical phenotyping. Stool samples were analyzed using &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene sequencing. Fecal metabolomics were performed using two platforms, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fecal microbiome and metabolome composition in PD was significantly different from controls, with the largest effect size seen in NMR‐based metabolome. Microbiome and NMR‐based metabolome compositional differences remained significant after comprehensive confounder analyses. Differentially abundant fecal metabolite features and predicted functional changes in PD versus controls included bioactive molecules with putative neuroprotective effects (eg, short chain fatty acids [SCFAs], ubiquinones, and salicylate) and other compounds increasingly implicated in neurodegeneration (eg, ceramides, sphingosine, and trimethylamine N‐oxide). In the PD group, cognitive impairment, low body mass index (BMI), frailty, constipation, and low physical activity were associated with fecal metabolome compositional differences. Notably, low SCFAs in PD were significantly associated with poorer cognition and low BMI. Lower butyrate levels correlated with worse postural instability–gait disorder scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut microbial function is altered in PD, characterized by differentially abundant metabolic features that provide important biological insights into gut–brain pathophysiology. Their clinical relevance further supports a role for microbial metabolites as potential targets for the development of new biomarkers and therapies in PD. ANN NEUROL 2021&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Experimental single-cell approaches are becoming widely used for many purposes, including investigation of the dynamic behaviour of developing biological systems. Consequently, a large number of computational methods for extracting dynamic information from such data have been developed. One example is RNA velocity analysis, in which spliced and unspliced RNA abundances are jointly modeled in order to infer a ‘direction of change’ and thereby a future state for each cell in the gene expression space. Naturally, the accuracy and interpretability of the inferred RNA velocities depend crucially on the correctness of the estimated abundances. Here, we systematically compare five widely used quantification tools, in total yielding thirteen different quantification approaches, in terms of their estimates of spliced and unspliced RNA abundances in five experimental droplet scRNA-seq data sets. We show that there are substantial differences between the quantifications obtained from different tools, and identify typical genes for which such discrepancies are observed. We further show that these abundance differences propagate to the downstream analysis, and can have a large effect on estimated velocities as well as the biological interpretation. Our results highlight that abundance quantification is a crucial aspect of the RNA velocity analysis workflow, and that both the definition of the genomic features of interest and the quantification algorithm itself require careful consideration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VkX-bHkvpSs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Nucleosome positioning in the genome is essential for the regulation of many nuclear processes. We currently have limited capability to predict nucleosome positioning &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, especially the locations and sizes of nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs). Here, we present a thermodynamic model that incorporates the intrinsic affinity of histones, competitive binding of sequence-specific factors, and nucleosome remodeling to predict nucleosome positioning in budding yeast. The model shows that the intrinsic affinity of histones, at near-saturating histone concentration, is not sufficient in generating NDRs in the genome. However, the binding of a few factors, especially RSC towards GC-rich and poly(A/T) sequences, allows us to predict ~ 66% of genome-wide NDRs. The model also shows that nucleosome remodeling activity is required to predict the correct NDR sizes. The validity of the model was further supported by the agreement between the predicted and the measured nucleosome positioning upon factor deletion or on exogenous sequences introduced into yeast. Overall, our model quantitatively evaluated the impact of different genetic components on NDR formation and illustrated the vital roles of sequence-specific factors and nucleosome remodeling in this process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FlsrdhTnrrk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The Opsin 3/Teleost multiple tissue opsin system: mRNA localization in the retina and brain of medaka (Oryzias latipes)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b846009-cca4-4fe1-89a3-41fee3efb5b5/cne25106-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opsin 3 (Opn3) / Teleost multiple tissue (Tmt) opsins are putative blue‐light‐sensitive photoreceptor protein found in animals. The distributions of mRNA of &lt;i&gt;opn3/tmt‐opsins&lt;/i&gt; in the retina and brain of medaka were investigated by in situ hybridization. These opsins are differentially expressed in the multiple retinal and brain regions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photoreceptor protein, opsin, is one of the major components for vision and photoreceptive function in animals. Although many opsins have been discovered from animal genomes, only a few non‐image‐forming functions mediated by opsins have been identified. Understanding the mRNA distribution of photoreceptor proteins is one crucial step in uncovering their photoreceptive function in animals. Here we focus on the medaka fish (&lt;i&gt;Oryzias latipes&lt;/i&gt;) Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple opsin (Tmt) system, which constitutes a separate phylogenetic group, having putative blue light photoreceptors for non‐image‐forming functions. In medaka, there is one &lt;i&gt;opn3&lt;/i&gt; and five &lt;i&gt;tmt‐opsin&lt;/i&gt; orthologs. The expression pattern of the &lt;i&gt;opn3/tmt‐opsins&lt;/i&gt; in the retina and brain was investigated by in situ hybridization. mRNAs for &lt;i&gt;opn3/tmt‐opsins&lt;/i&gt; were distributed in the retinal ganglion cells as well as interneurons and specific brain nuclei. Specifically, hybridization signals were observed in the &lt;i&gt;glutamate decarboxylase 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;gad1&lt;/i&gt;)‐expressing amacrine cells for &lt;i&gt;opn3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt1a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt1b&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;tmt2&lt;/i&gt;, in the caudal lobe of the cerebellum for &lt;i&gt;tmt1b&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;tmt2,&lt;/i&gt; in the cranial nerve nuclei for &lt;i&gt;opn3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt1a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt1b&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt2&lt;/i&gt;, and in the rostral pars distalis (adenohypophysis) for &lt;i&gt;opn3&lt;/i&gt;. These expression patterns suggest that blue light sensing in the fish retina and brain may be involved in the integration of visual inputs, vestibular function, somatosensation, motor outputs, and pituitary endocrine regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare inherited prion disease characterized by sleep, autonomic, and motor disturbances. Neuro‐ophthalmological abnormalities have been reported at the onset of disease, although not further characterized. We analyzed video recordings of eye movements of 6 patients with FFI from 3 unrelated kindreds, seen within 6 months from the onset of illness. Excessive saccadic intrusions were the most prominent findings. In patients with severe insomnia, striking saccadic intrusions are an early diagnostic clue for FFI. The fact that the thalamus is the first structure affected in FFI also suggests its role in the control of steady fixation. ANN NEUROL 2021&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a specific biomarker of neuronal injury. We measured sNfL concentrations of 29 critically ill COVID‐19 patients, 10 critically ill non–COVID‐19 patients, and 259 healthy controls.

 &lt;p&gt;Working memory is a cognitive function involving the storage and manipulation
of latent information over brief intervals of time, thus making it crucial for
context-dependent computation. Here, we use a top-down modeling approach to
examine network-level mechanisms of working memory, an enigmatic issue and
central topic of study in neuroscience and machine intelligence. We train
thousands of recurrent neural networks on a working memory task and then
perform dynamical systems analysis on the ensuing optimized networks, wherein
we find that four distinct dynamical mechanisms can emerge. In particular, we
show the prevalence of a mechanism in which memories are encoded along slow
stable manifolds in the network state space, leading to a phasic neuronal
activation profile during memory periods. In contrast to mechanisms in which
memories are directly encoded at stable attractors, these networks naturally
forget stimuli over time. Despite this seeming functional disadvantage, they
are more efficient in terms of how they leverage their attractor landscape and
paradoxically, are considerably more robust to noise. Our results provide new
dynamical hypotheses regarding how working memory function is encoded in both
natural and artificial neural networks.

 &lt;p&gt;Large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) are characterized
as involving hundreds or even thousands of decision variables and multiple
conflicting objectives. An excellent algorithm for solving LSMOPs should find
Pareto-optimal solutions with diversity and escape from local optima in the
large-scale search space. Previous research has shown that these optimal
solutions are uniformly distributed on the manifold structure in the
low-dimensional space. However, traditional evolutionary algorithms for solving
LSMOPs have some deficiencies in dealing with this structural manifold,
resulting in poor diversity, local optima, and inefficient searches. In this
work, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based manifold interpolation
framework is proposed to learn the manifold and generate high-quality solutions
on this manifold, thereby improving the performance of evolutionary algorithms.
We compare the proposed algorithm with several state-of-the-art algorithms on
large-scale multiobjective benchmark functions. Experimental results have
demonstrated the significant improvements achieved by this framework in solving
LSMOPs.

			<subtitle type="html">Nature Reviews Neuroscience is the leading review journal in the neurosciences. It publishes articles that review recent progress in brain and nervous system research. Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry. One of the unique features of Nature Reviews Neuroscience is its extraordinary breadth and depth of coverage. This very broad scope – from molecules to mind – captures the essence of modern neuroscience, and allows the journal to attract readers from all areas of this ever-expanding discipline.</subtitle>

 &lt;p&gt;Several physiology signals, including heart rate and pupil size, have been widely used as peripheral indices of arousal to evaluate the effects of arousal on brain functions. However, whether behavior depends differently on arousal indexed by these physiological signals remains unclear. We simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram (ECG) and pupil size in head-fixed rats performing tactile discrimination tasks. We found both heartbeat dynamics and pupil size co-varied with behavioral outcomes, indicating behavior was dependent upon arousal indexed by the two physiological signals. To estimate the potential difference between the effects of pupil-linked arousal and heart rate-linked arousal on behavior, we constructed a Bayesian decoder to predict animals' behavior from pupil size and heart rate prior to stimulus presentation. The performance of the decoder was significantly better when using both heart rate and pupil size as inputs than when using either of them alone, suggesting the effects of the two arousal systems on behavior are not completely redundant. Supporting this notion, we found that, on a substantial portion of trials correctly predicted by the heart rate-based decoder, the pupil size-based decoder failed to correctly predict animals' behavior. Taken together, these results suggest that pupil-linked and heart rate-linked arousal systems exert different influences on animals' behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Animals rely on internal motivational states to make decisions. The role of motivational salience in decision making is in early stages of mathematical understanding. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that relies on neural networks to learn optimal ongoing behavior for dynamically changing motivation values. First, we show that neural networks implementing Q-learning with motivational salience can navigate in environment with dynamic rewards without adjustments in synaptic strengths when the needs of an agent shift. In this setting, our networks may display elements of addictive behaviors. Second, we use a similar framework in hierarchical manager-agent system to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm with motivation that both infers motivational states and behaves. Finally, we show that, when trained in the Pavlovian conditioning setting, the responses of the neurons in our model resemble previously published neuronal recordings in the ventral pallidum, a basal ganglia structure involved in motivated behaviors. We conclude that motivation allows Q-learning networks to quickly adapt their behavior to conditions when expected reward is modulated by agent’s dynamic needs. Our approach addresses the algorithmic rationale of motivation and makes a step toward better interpretability of behavioral data via inference of motivational dynamics in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Different glial cell types are found throughout the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), where they have important functions. These cell types are also involved in nervous system pathology, playing roles in neurodegenerative disease and following trauma in the brain and spinal cord (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes), nerve degeneration and development of pain in peripheral nerves (Schwann cells, satellite cells), retinal diseases (Müller glia) and gut dysbiosis (enteric glia). These cell type have all been proposed as potential targets for treating these conditions. One approach to target these cell types is the use of gene therapy to modify gene expression. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been shown to be safe and effective in targeting cells in the nervous system and have been used in a number of clinical trials. To date, a number of studies have tested the use of different AAV serotypes and cell-specific promoters to increase glial cell tropism and expression. However, true glial-cell specific targeting for a particular glial cell type remains elusive. This review provides an overview of research into developing glial specific gene therapy and discusses some of the issues that still need to be addressed to make glial cell gene therapy a clinical reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of CAG triplets in the huntingtin gene, leading to severe neuropathological changes that result in a devasting and lethal phenotype. Neurodegeneration in HD begins in the striatum and spreads to other brain regions such as cortex and hippocampus, causing motor and cognitive dysfunctions. To understand the signaling pathways involved in HD, animal models that mimic the human pathology are used. The R6/2 mouse as model of HD was already shown to present major neuropathological changes in the caudate putamen and other brain regions, but recently established biomarkers in HD patients were yet not analyzed in these mice. We therefore performed an in-depth analysis of R6/2 mice to establish new and highly translational readouts focusing on Ctip2 as biological marker for motor system-related neurons and translocator protein (TSPO) as a promising readout for early neuroinflammation. Our results validate already shown pathologies like mutant huntingtin aggregates, ubiquitination, and brain atrophy, but also provide evidence for decreased tyrosine hydroxylase and Ctip2 levels as indicators of a disturbed motor system, while vesicular acetyl choline transporter levels as marker for the cholinergic system barely change. Additionally, increased astrocytosis and activated microglia were observed by GFAP, Iba1 and TSPO labeling, illustrating, that TSPO is a more sensitive marker for early neuroinflammation compared to GFAP and Iba1. Our results thus demonstrate a high sensitivity and translational value of Ctip2 and TSPO as new marker for the preclinical evaluation of new compounds in the R6/2 mouse model of HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Variants of the SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3), which encodes postsynaptic scaffolds, are associated with brain disorders. The targeted alleles in a few Shank3 knock-out (KO) lines contain a neomycin resistance (Neo) cassette, which may perturb the normal expression of neighboring genes; however, this has not been investigated in detail. We previously reported an unexpected increase in the mRNA expression of Shank3 exons 1–12 in the brains of Shank3B KO mice generated by replacing Shank3 exons 13–16 with the Neo cassette. In this study, we confirmed that the increased Shank3 mRNA in Shank3B KO brains produced an unusual ∼60 kDa Shank3 isoform (Shank3-N), which did not properly localize to the synaptic compartment. Functionally, Shank3-N overexpression altered the dendritic spine morphology in cultured neurons. Importantly, Shank3-N expression in Shank3B KO mice was not a compensatory response to a reduction of full-length Shank3 because expression was still detected in the brain after normalizing the level of full-length Shank3. Moreover, in another Shank3 KO line (Shank3 gKO) with a similar Shank3 exonal deletion as that in Shank3B KO mice but without a Neo cassette, the mRNA expression levels of Shank3 exons 1–12 were lower than those of wild-type mice and Shank3-N was not detected in the brain. In addition, the expression levels of genes neighboring Shank3 on chromosome 15 were altered in the striatum of Shank3B KO but not Shank3 gKO mice. These results suggest that the Neo cassette has potential off-target effects in Shank3B KO mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aims: To determine whether acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1)–sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) signaling pathway participates in chronic visceral pain of adult rats with neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Chronic visceral pain was detected by colorectal distension (CRD). Western blotting and Immunofluorescence were performed to detect the expression and location of ASIC1 and NKCC1. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed to record spinal synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The excitatory synaptic transmission was enhanced and the inhibitory synaptic transmission was weakened in the spinal dorsal horn of NMD rats. ASIC1 and NKCC1 protein expression in the spinal dorsal horn was significantly up-regulated in NMD rats. Incubation of Amiloride reduced the amplitude of mEPSCs. Incubation of Bumetanide (BMT) increased the amplitude of mIPSCs. Intrathecal injection of ASIC1 or NKCC1 inhibitors reversed the threshold of CRD in NMD rats. Also, Amiloride treatment significantly reversed the expression of NKCC1 in the spinal dorsal horn of NMD rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our data suggest that the ASIC1-NKCC1 signaling pathway is involved in chronic visceral pain in NMD rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Connexins are transmembrane proteins that form hemichannels allowing the exchange of molecules between the extracellular space and the cell interior. Two hemichannels from adjacent cells dock and form a continuous gap junction pore, thereby permitting direct intercellular communication. Connexin 36 (Cx36), expressed primarily in neurons, is involved in the synchronous activity of neurons and may play a role in aberrant synchronous firing, as seen in seizures. To understand the reciprocal interactions between Cx36 and seizure-like neural activity, we examined three questions: (a) does Cx36 deficiency affect seizure susceptibility, (b) does seizure-like activity affect Cx36 expression patterns, and (c) does acute blockade of Cx36 conductance increase seizure susceptibility. We utilize the zebrafish pentylenetetrazol [PTZ; a GABA(A) receptor antagonist] induced seizure model, taking advantage of the compact size and optical translucency of the larval zebrafish brain to assess how PTZ affects brain-wide neuronal activity and Cx36 protein expression. We exposed wild-type and genetic Cx36-deficient (cx35.5-/-) zebrafish larvae to PTZ and subsequently mapped neuronal activity across the whole brain, using phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (pERK) as a proxy for neuronal activity. We found that cx35.5-/- fish exhibited region-specific susceptibility and resistance to PTZ-induced hyperactivity compared to wild-type controls, suggesting that genetic Cx36 deficiency may affect seizure susceptibility in a region-specific manner. Regions that showed increased PTZ sensitivity include the dorsal telencephalon, which is implicated in human epilepsy, and the lateral hypothalamus, which has been underexplored. We also found that PTZ-induced neuronal hyperactivity resulted in a rapid reduction of Cx36 protein levels within 30 min. This Cx36 reduction persists after 1-h of recovery but recovered after 3–6 h. This acute downregulation of Cx36 by PTZ is likely maladaptive, as acute pharmacological blockade of Cx36 by mefloquine results in increased susceptibility to PTZ-induced neuronal hyperactivity. Together, these results demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between Cx36 and seizure-associated neuronal hyperactivity: Cx36 deficiency contributes region-specific susceptibility to neuronal hyperactivity, while neuronal hyperactivity-induced downregulation of Cx36 may increase the risk of future epileptic events.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the sensory and sympathetic innervations associated with both acupoint “Shenshu” (BL23) and kidney in the rat for insight into the neuronal correlation between the Back-Shu Point and its corresponding visceral organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The BL23 and kidney were selected as the representative acupoint and visceral organ in this study, in which their local nerve fibers were examined by using double fluorescent immunohistochemistry with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Meanwhile, their neuronal correlation in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), spinal cord, and sympathetic (paravertebral) chain were investigated using a double fluorescent neural tracing technique with Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 conjugates with cholera toxin subunit B (AF488/594-CTB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The local tissue of acupoint BL23 and the fibrous capsule of kidney distributed abundantly with CGRP- and TH-positive nerve fibers, corresponding to their sensory and sympathetic innervation. On the other hand, the sensory neurons associated with acupoint BL23 and kidney were labeled with AF488/594-CTB and distributed from thoracic (T) 11 to lumbar (L) 3 DRGs and from T10 to L2 DRGs, respectively, in which some of them in T12-T13 DRGs were simultaneously labeled with both AF488/594-CTB. Also, postganglionic neurons associated with both acupoint BL23 and kidney were found in the sympathetic chain at the same spinal segments but separately labeled with AF488-CTB and AF594-CTB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the neural characteristics of the acupoint BL23 and kidney in the rat from the perspective of neurochemistry and neural pathways, providing an example for understanding the neuronal correlation between the Back-Shu Points and their corresponding visceral organs. These results suggest that the stimulation of the Back-Shu Points may regulate the activities of the target-organs via the periphery sensory and sympathetic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurocognitive dysfunction based on metabolic disorders caused by severe liver disease, which has a high one-year mortality. Mild hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) has a high risk of converting to overt HE, and thus the accurate identification of MHE from cirrhosis with no HE (noHE) is of great significance in reducing mortality. Previously, most studies focused on studying abnormality in the static brain networks of MHE to find biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to use multi-layer modular algorithm to study abnormality in dynamic graph properties of brain network in MHE patients and construct a machine learning model to identify individual MHE from noHE. Here, a time length of 500-second resting-state functional MRI data were collected from 41 healthy subjects, 32 noHE patients and 30 MHE patients. Multi-layer modular algorithm was performed on dynamic brain functional connectivity graph. The connection-stability score was used to characterize the loyalty in each brain network module. Nodal flexibility, cohesion and disjointness were calculated to describe how the node changes the network affiliation across time. Results show that significant differences between MHE and noHE were found merely in nodal disjointness in higher cognitive network modules (ventral attention, fronto-parietal, default mode networks) and these abnormalities were associated with the decline in patients’ attention and visual memory function evaluated by Digit Symbol Test. Finally, feature extraction from node disjointness with the support vector machine classifier showed an accuracy of 88.71% in discrimination of MHE from noHE, which was verified by different window sizes, modular partition parameters and machine learning parameters. All these results show that abnormal nodal disjointness in higher cognitive networks during brain network evolution can be seemed as a biomarker for identification of MHE, which help us understand the disease mechanism of MHE at a fine scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific communication without which one cannot build upon each other’s work. Because modern human brain imaging relies on many integrated steps with a variety of possible algorithms, it has, however, become impossible to report every detail of a data processing workflow. In response to this analytical complexity, community recommendations are to share data analysis pipelines (scripts that implement workflows). Here we show that this can easily be done using EEGLAB and tools built around it. BIDS tools allow importing all the necessary information and create a study from electroencephalography (EEG)-Brain Imaging Data Structure compliant data. From there preprocessing can be carried out in only a few steps using EEGLAB and statistical analyses performed using the LIMO EEG plug-in. Using Wakeman and Henson (2015) face dataset, we illustrate how to prepare data and build different statistical models, a standard factorial design (faces &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; repetition), and a more modern trial-based regression approach for the stimulus repetition effect, all in a few reproducible command lines.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that as much as 40% of all causes of death in a group of patients with schizophrenia can be attributed to suicides and compared with the general population, patients with schizophrenia have an 8.5-fold greater suicide risk (SR). There is a vital need for accurate and reliable methods to predict the SR among patients with schizophrenia based on biological measures. However, it is unknown whether the suicidal risk in schizophrenia can be related to alterations in spontaneous brain activity, or if the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) measures can be used alongside machine learning (ML) algorithms in order to identify patients with SR.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-nine participants including patients with schizophrenia with and without SR as well as age and gender-matched healthy underwent 13 min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Both static and dynamic indexes of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity as well as functional connectivity (FC) were calculated and used as an input for five machine learning algorithms: Gradient boosting (GB), LASSO, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest and Support Vector Machine.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;All groups revealed different intra-network functional connectivity in ventral DMN and anterior SN. The best performance was reached for the LASSO applied to FC with an accuracy of 70% and AUROC of 0.76 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Significant classification ability was also reached for GB and LR using fALFF and ALFF measures.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that SR in schizophrenia can be seen on the level of DMN and SN functional connectivity alterations. ML algorithms were able to significantly differentiate SR patients. Our results could be useful in developing neuromarkers of SR in schizophrenia based on non-invasive rsfMRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Virtual environments (VEs), in the recent years, have become more prevalent in neuroscience. These VEs can offer great flexibility, replicability, and control over the presented stimuli in an immersive setting. With recent developments, it has become feasible to achieve higher-quality visuals and VEs at a reasonable investment. Our aim in this project was to develop and implement a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI)–based neurofeedback (NF) training paradigm, taking into account new technological advances that allow us to integrate complex stimuli into a visually updated and engaging VE. We built upon and developed a first-person shooter in which the dynamic change of the VE was the feedback variable in the brain–computer interface (BCI). We designed a study to assess the feasibility of the BCI in creating an immersive VE for NF training. In a randomized single-blinded fMRI-based NF-training session, 24 participants were randomly allocated into one of two groups: active and reduced contingency NF. All participants completed three runs of the shooter-game VE lasting 10 min each. Brain activity in a supplementary motor area region of interest regulated the possible movement speed of the player’s avatar and thus increased the reward probability. The gaming performance revealed that the participants were able to actively engage in game tasks and improve across sessions. All 24 participants reported being able to successfully employ NF strategies during the training while performing in-game tasks with significantly higher perceived NF control ratings in the NF group. Spectral analysis showed significant differential effects on brain activity between the groups. Connectivity analysis revealed significant differences, showing a lowered connectivity in the NF group compared to the reduced contingency-NF group. The self-assessment manikin ratings showed an increase in arousal in both groups but failed significance. Arousal has been linked to presence, or feelings of immersion, supporting the VE’s objective. Long paradigms, such as NF in MRI settings, can lead to mental fatigue; therefore, VEs can help overcome such limitations. The rewarding achievements from gaming targets can lead to implicit learning of self-regulation and may broaden the scope of NF applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) leads to a higher risk of brain damage and adversely affects cognition. The underlying neural mechanism of T2DM-induced cognitive impairment (T2DM-CI) remains unclear. This study proposes to identify a small number of dysfunctional brain connections as imaging biomarkers, distinguishing between T2DM-CI, T2DM with normal cognition (T2DM-NC), and healthy controls (HC). We have recruited 22 T2DM-CI patients, 31 T2DM-NC patients, and 39 HCs. The structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and resting state fMRI images are acquired, and neuropsychological tests are carried out. Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is analyzed to identify impaired brain regions implicated with T2DM and T2DM-CI. The functional network is built and all connections connected to impaired brain regions are selected. Subsequently, L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-norm regularized sparse canonical correlation analysis and sparse logistic regression are used to identify discriminative connections and Support Vector Machine is trained to realize three two-category classifications. It is found that single-digit dysfunctional connections predict T2DM and T2DM-CI. For T2DM-CI versus HC, T2DM-NC versus HC, and T2DM-CI versus T2DM-NC, the number of connections is 6, 7, and 5 and the area under curve (AUC) can reach 0.912, 0.901, and 0.861, respectively. The dysfunctional connection is mainly related to Default Model Network (DMN) and long-distance links. The strength of identified connections is significantly different among groups and correlated with cognitive assessment score (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Via ALFF analysis and further feature selection algorithms, a small number of dysfunctional brain connections can be identified to predict T2DM and T2DM-CI. These connections might be the imaging biomarkers of T2DM-CI and targets of intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Existing techniques have many limitations in the diagnosis and classification of ischemic stroke (IS). Considering this, we used metabolomics to screen for potential biomarkers of IS and its subtypes and to explore the underlying related pathophysiological mechanisms. Serum samples from 99 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) [the AIS subtypes included 49 patients with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) and 50 patients with small artery occlusion (SAO)] and 50 matched healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed by non-targeted metabolomics based on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. A multivariate statistical analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers. There were 18 significantly different metabolites, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, L-glutamine, L-arginine, and L-proline, between patients with AIS and HCs. These different metabolites are closely related to many metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. There were also differences in metabolic profiling between the LAA and SAO groups. There were eight different metabolites, including L-pipecolic acid, 1-Methylhistidine, PE, LysoPE, and LysoPC, which affected glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis, histidine metabolism, and lysine degradation. Our study effectively identified the metabolic profiles of IS and its subtypes. The different metabolites between LAA and SAO may be potential biomarkers in the context of clinical diagnosis. These results highlight the potential of metabolomics to reveal new pathways for IS subtypes and provide a new avenue to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying IS and its subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;The ABC/2 method is usually applied to evaluate intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) volume on computed tomography (CT), although it might be inaccurate and not applicable in estimating extradural or subdural hemorrhage (EDH, SDH) volume due to their irregular hematoma shapes. This study aimed to evaluate deep framework optimized for the segmentation and quantification of ICH, EDH, and SDH.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The training datasets were 3,000 images retrospectively collected from a collaborating hospital (Hospital A) and segmented by the Dense U-Net framework. Three experienced radiologists determined the ground truth by marking the pixels as hemorrhage area. We utilized the Dice and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) to test the reliability of the ground truth. Moreover, the testing datasets consisted of 211 images (internal test) from Hospital A, and 86 ICH images (external test) from another hospital (Hospital B). In this study, we chose scatter plots, ICC, and Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) with ground truth to evaluate the performance of the deep framework. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of the deep framework, we did a comparative analysis of the hemorrhage volume estimation between the deep model and the ABC/2 method.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The high Dice (0.89–0.95) and ICC (0.985–0.997) showed the consistency of the manual segmentations among the radiologists and the reliability of the ground truth. For the internal test, the Dice coefficients of ICH, EDH, and SDH were 0.90 ± 0.06, 0.88 ± 0.12, and 0.82 ± 0.16, respectively. For the external test, the segmentation Dice was 0.86 ± 0.09. Comparatively, the ICC and PCC of ICH volume estimations were 0.99 performed by Dense U-Net that overmatched the ABC/2 method.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study revealed the excellent performance of hematoma segmentation and volume evaluation based on Dense U-Net, which indicated our deep framework might contribute to efficiently developing treatment strategies for intracranial hemorrhage in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Instrumented assessments of quiet-stance postural control typically involve recording and analyzing of body sway signal, most often the center of pressure (CoP) movement. It has been recently suggested that transient characteristics of body sway may offer additional information regarding postural control. In this study, we explored the relationship between whole-trial estimates of body sway (CoP velocity, amplitude, and frequency) and corresponding transient behavior indexes, as well as the effects of leg preference. A total of 705 healthy young athletes performed 30 s single-leg body sway trials for both legs. It was found that the transient characteristics of the body sway (expressed as relative differences between individual time intervals within the trial) are in negligible or weak correlation (r ≤ 0.26) with the corresponding variables, averaged across the whole trial. All CoP variables showed transient characteristics, reflected in statistically significant decrease (CoP velocity and amplitude) or increase (CoP frequency) throughout the trial. The preferred leg showed smaller body sway; however, the effect sizes were very small. Moreover, differences between the legs were also noted in terms of transient characteristics of body sway. In particular, the preferred leg showed earlier reduction in anterior–posterior body sway and larger reduction in medial–lateral body sway. Further studies should focus on examining the clinical utility of indexes of transient behavior of body sway, for instance, their sensitivity to aging-related changes and risk of falling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Cognitive fatigue is a problem for the safety of critical systems (e.g., aircraft) as it can lead to accidents, especially during unexpected events. In order to determine the extent to which it disrupts adaptive capabilities, we evaluated its effect on online and anticipatory control. Despite numerous studies conducted to determine its effects, the exact mechanism(s) affected by fatigue remains to be clarified. In this study, we used distribution and electromyographic analysis to assess whether cognitive fatigue increases the capture of the incorrect automatic response or if it impairs its suppression (online control), and whether the conflict adaptation effect is reduced (anticipatory control). To this end, we evaluated the evolution of the performance over time during the Simon task, a classic conflict task that elicits incorrect automatic responses. To accentuate the presence of fatigue during the Simon task, two groups previously performed a dual-task with two different cognitive load levels to create two different levels of fatigue. The results revealed that time on task impaired online control by disrupting the capacity to suppress the incorrect response but leaving unaffected the expression of the automatic response. Furthermore, participants emphasized speed rather than accuracy with time on task, with in addition more fast guesses, suggesting that they opted for a less effortful response strategy. As the implementation of the suppression mechanism requires cognitive effort, the conjunction of these results suggests that the deficits observed may be due to disengagement of effort over time rather than reflecting an incapacity to make an effort.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A lot of research has been done on the detection of mental workload (MWL) using various bio-signals. Recently, deep learning has allowed for novel methods and results. A plethora of measurement modalities have proven to be valuable in this task, yet studies currently often only use a single modality to classify MWL. The goal of this research was to classify perceived mental workload (PMWL) using a deep neural network (DNN) that flexibly makes use of multiple modalities, in order to allow for feature sharing between modalities. To achieve this goal, an experiment was conducted in which MWL was simulated with the help of verbal logic puzzles. The puzzles came in five levels of difficulty and were presented in a random order. Participants had 1 h to solve as many puzzles as they could. Between puzzles, they gave a difficulty rating between 1 and 7, seven being the highest difficulty. Galvanic skin response, photoplethysmograms, functional near-infrared spectrograms and eye movements were collected simultaneously using LabStreamingLayer (LSL). Marker information from the puzzles was also streamed on LSL. We designed and evaluated a novel intermediate fusion multimodal DNN for the classification of PMWL using the aforementioned four modalities. Two main criteria that guided the design and implementation of our DNN are modularity and generalisability. We were able to classify PMWL within-level accurate (0.985 levels) on a seven-level workload scale using the aforementioned modalities. The model architecture allows for easy addition and removal of modalities without major structural implications because of the modular nature of the design. Furthermore, we showed that our neural network performed better when using multiple modalities, as opposed to a single modality. The dataset and code used in this paper are openly available.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Gender roles are anti-dichotomous and malleable social constructs that should theoretically be constructed independently from biological sex. However, it is unclear whether and how the factor of sex is related to neural mechanisms involved in social constructions of gender roles. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate sex specificity in gender role constructions and the corresponding underlying neural mechanisms. We measured gender role orientation using the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, used a voxel-based global brain connectivity method based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize the within-network connectivity in the brain reward network, and analyzed how the integration of the reward network is related to gender role scores between sex groups. An omnibus analysis of voxel-wise global brain connectivity values within a two-level linear mixed model revealed that in female participants, femininity scores were positively associated with integration in the posterior orbitofrontal cortex and subcallosal cortex, whereas masculinity scores were positively associated with integration in the frontal pole. By contrast, in male participants, masculinity was negatively correlated with integration in the nucleus accumbens and subcallosal cortex. For the first time, the present study revealed the sex-specific neural mechanisms underlying distinct gender roles, which elucidates the process of gender construction from the perspective of the interaction between reward sensitivity and social reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To identify the common and specific structural basis of bipolar depression (BD) and unipolar depression (UD) is crucial for clinical diagnosis. In this study, a total of 85 participants, including 22 BD patients, 36 UD patients, and 27 healthy controls, were enrolled. A voxel-based morphology method was used to identify the common and specific changes of the gray matter volume (GMV) to determine the structural basis. Significant differences in GMV were found among the three groups. Compared with healthy controls, UD patients showed decreased GMV in the orbital part of the left inferior frontal gyrus, whereas BD patients showed decreased GMV in the orbital part of the left middle frontal gyrus. Compared with BD, UD patients have increased GMV in the left supramarginal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. Our results revealed different structural changes in UD and BD patients suggesting BD and UD have different neurophysiological underpinnings. Our study contributes toward the biological determination of morphometric changes, which could help to discriminate between UD and BD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The study has two objectives: (1) to introduce grip force recording as a new technique for studying embodied numerical processing; and (2) to demonstrate how three competing accounts of numerical magnitude representation can be tested by using this new technique: the Mental Number Line (MNL), A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM) and Embodied Cognition (finger counting-based) account. While 26 healthy adults processed visually presented single digits in a go/no-go n-back paradigm, their passive holding forces for two small sensors were recorded in both hands. Spontaneous and unconscious grip force changes related to number magnitude occurred in the left hand already 100–140 ms after stimulus presentation and continued systematically. Our results support a two-step model of number processing where an initial stage is related to the automatic activation of all stimulus properties whereas a later stage consists of deeper conscious processing of the stimulus. This interpretation generalizes previous work with linguistic stimuli and elaborates the timeline of embodied cognition. We hope that the use of grip force recording will advance the field of numerical cognition research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Topological data analyses are widely used for describing and conceptualizing large volumes of neurobiological data, e.g., for quantifying spiking outputs of large neuronal ensembles and thus understanding the functions of the corresponding networks. Below we discuss an approach in which convergent topological analyses produce insights into how information may be processed in mammalian hippocampus—a brain part that plays a key role in learning and memory. The resulting functional model provides a unifying framework for integrating spiking data at different timescales and following the course of spatial learning at different levels of spatiotemporal granularity. This approach allows accounting for contributions from various physiological phenomena into spatial cognition—the neuronal spiking statistics, the effects of spiking synchronization by different brain waves, the roles played by synaptic efficacies and so forth. In particular, it is possible to demonstrate that networks with plastic and transient synaptic architectures can encode stable cognitive maps, revealing the characteristic timescales of memory processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Representing the brain’s innate immune cells that interact vividly with blood-derived immune cells and brain parenchymal cells, microglia set the stage for successful brain remodeling and repair in the aftermath of brain damage. With the development of pharmacological colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitors, which allow inhibiting or depleting microglial cells, and of transgenic mice, allowing the inducible depletion of microglial cells, experimental tools have become available for studying roles of microglia in neurodegenerative and neurorestorative processes. These models open fundamental insights into roles of microglia in controlling synaptic plasticity in the healthy and the injured brain. Acting as a switch from injury to repair, microglial cells might open opportunities for promoting neurological recovery in human patients upon brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A major consequence of traumatic brain and spinal cord injury is the loss of the myelin sheath, a cholesterol-rich layer of insulation that wraps around axons of the nervous system. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is produced and maintained by oligodendrocytes. Damage to the CNS may result in oligodendrocyte cell death and subsequent loss of myelin, which can have serious consequences for functional recovery. Demyelination impairs neuronal function by decelerating signal transmission along the axon and has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. After a traumatic injury, mechanisms of endogenous remyelination in the CNS are limited and often fail, for reasons that remain poorly understood. One area of research focuses on enhancing this endogenous response. Existing techniques include the use of small molecules, RNA interference (RNAi), and monoclonal antibodies that target specific signaling components of myelination for recovery. Cell-based replacement strategies geared towards replenishing oligodendrocytes and their progenitors have been utilized by several groups in the last decade as well. In this review article, we discuss the effects of traumatic injury on oligodendrocytes in the CNS, the lack of endogenous remyelination, translational studies in rodent models promoting remyelination, and finally human clinical studies on remyelination in the CNS after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dendrites are cellular structures essential for the integration of neuronal information. These elegant but complex structures are highly patterned across the nervous system but vary tremendously in their size and fine architecture, each designed to best serve specific computations within their networks. Recent in vivo imaging studies reveal that the development of mature dendrite arbors in many cases involves extensive remodeling achieved through a precisely orchestrated interplay of growth, degeneration, and regeneration of dendritic branches. Both degeneration and regeneration of dendritic branches involve precise spatiotemporal regulation for the proper wiring of functional networks. In particular, dendrite degeneration must be targeted in a compartmentalized manner to avoid neuronal death. Dysregulation of these developmental processes, in particular dendrite degeneration, is associated with certain types of pathology, injury, and aging. In this article, we review recent progress in our understanding of dendrite degeneration and regeneration, focusing on molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying spatiotemporal control of dendrite remodeling in neural development. We further discuss how developmental dendrite degeneration and regeneration are molecularly and functionally related to dendrite remodeling in pathology, disease, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Early progression in neurodegenerative disease involves challenges to homeostatic processes, including those controlling axonal excitability and dendritic organization. In glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness, stress from intraocular pressure (IOP) causes degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and their axons which comprise the optic nerve. Previously, we discovered that early progression induces axogenic, voltage-gated enhanced excitability of RGCs, even as dendritic complexity in the retina reduces. Here, we investigate a possible contribution of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel to enhanced excitability, given its role in modulating excitation in other neural systems. We find that genetic deletion of Trpv1 (Trpv1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) influences excitability differently for RGCs firing continuously to light onset (αON-Sustained) vs. light offset (αOFF-Sustained). Deletion drives excitability in opposing directions so that Trpv1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; RGC responses with elevated IOP equalize to that of wild-type (WT) RGCs without elevated IOP. Depolarizing current injections in the absence of light-driven presynaptic excitation to directly modulate voltage-gated channels mirrored these changes, while inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels and isolating retinal excitatory postsynaptic currents abolished both the differences in light-driven activity between WT and Trpv1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; RGCs and changes in response due to IOP elevation. Together, these results support a voltage-dependent, axogenic influence of Trpv1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; with elevated IOP. Finally, Trpv1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; slowed the loss of dendritic complexity with elevated IOP, opposite its effect on axon degeneration, supporting the idea that axonal and dendritic degeneration follows distinctive programs even at the level of membrane excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebral stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease that is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Stroke includes ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic strokes, of which the incidence of ischemic stroke accounts for 60–70% of the total number of strokes. Existing preclinical evidence suggests that inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a promising therapeutic intervention for stroke. In this study, the purpose was to investigate the possible effect of HDAC9 on ischemic brain injury, with the underlying mechanism related to microRNA-20a (miR-20a)/neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1) explored. The expression of HDAC9 was first detected in the constructed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-provoked mouse model and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell model. Next, primary neuronal apoptosis, expression of apoptosis-related factors (Bax, cleaved caspase3 and bcl-2), LDH leakage rate, as well as the release of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were evaluated by assays of TUNEL, Western blot, and ELISA. The relationships among HDAC9, miR-20a, and NeuroD1 were validated by in silico analysis and ChIP assay. HDAC9 was highly-expressed in MCAO mice and OGD-stimulated cells. Silencing of HDAC9 inhibited neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory factor release in vitro. HDAC9 downregulated miR-20a by enriching in its promoter region, while silencing of HDCA9 promoted miR-20a expression. miR-20a targeted Neurod1 and down-regulated its expression. Silencing of HDAC9 diminished OGD-induced neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory factor release in vitro as well as ischemic brain injury in vivo by regulating the miR-20a/NeuroD1 signaling. Overall, our study revealed that HDAC9 silencing could retard ischemic brain injury through the miR-20a/Neurod1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ischemic cerebral infarction represents a significant cause of disability and death worldwide. Caspase-1 is activated by the NLRP3/ASC pathway and inflammasomes, thus triggering pyroptosis, a programmed cell death. In particular, this death is mediated by gasdermin D (GSDMD), which induces secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. Accordingly, inhibition of caspase-1 prevents the development and worsening of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is not clear whether inhibition of caspase-1 can preserve blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity following cerebral infarction. This study therefore aimed at understanding the effect of caspase-1 on BBB dysfunction and its underlying mechanisms in permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Our findings in rat models revealed that expression of caspase-1 was upregulated following MCAO-induced injury in rats. Consequently, pharmacologic inhibition of caspase-1 using vx-765 ameliorated ischemia-induced infarction, neurological deficits, and neuronal injury. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-1 enhanced the encapsulation rate of pericytes at the ischemic edge, decreased leakage of both Evans Blue (EB) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) proteins, and upregulated the levels of tight junctions (TJs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in MCAO-injured rats. This in turn improved the permeability of the BBB. Meanwhile, vx-765 blocked the activation of ischemia-induced pyroptosis and reduced the expression level of inflammatory factors such as caspase-1, NLRP3, ASC, GSDMD, IL-1β, and IL-18. Similarly, vx-765 treatment significantly reduced the expression levels of inflammation-related receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), high-mobility family box 1 (HMGB1), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Evidently, inhibition of caspase-1 significantly improves ischemia-associated BBB permeability and integrity by suppressing pyroptosis activation and the RAGE/MAPK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) is prevalent in elderly patients and is recognized as brain dysfunction associated with increased inflammatory response in the central nervous system during sepsis. Neuroinflammation was demonstrated to be part of its mechanism and we aimed to validate the role of immunity imbalance in a combined retrospective and prospective cohort study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed a retrospective study analyzing the association between SAD and lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood, alongside a prospective trial evaluating the quantitative changes in lymphocyte subsets and their predictive value for early diagnosis of SAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the retrospective study, among 1,010 enrolled adult patients (age ≥65 years), 297 patients were diagnosed with delirium during intensive care unit (ICU) stay and lymphocyte counts at ICU admission in the SAD group were significantly higher than in non-delirious counterparts (1.09 ± 0.32 vs. 0.82 ± 0.24, respectively, p = 0.001). In the prospective study, lymphocyte counts [0.83 (0.56, 1.15) vs. 0.72 (0.40, 1.06) × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L, p = 0.020] and natural killer (NK) cell counts [96 (68, 118) vs. 56 (26, 92) cells/μl, p = 0.024] were significantly higher in the SAD group. The area under the curve value of NK cell count was 0.895 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.857, 0.933] and of lymphocyte count was 0.728 (95% CI: 0.662, 0.795). An NK cell count cut-off value of 87 cells/ml in septic patients at ICU admission was predictive of delirium with a sensitivity of 80.2% and specificity of 80.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: We found that lymphocyte and NK cell counts were significantly higher in senior patients with SAD and that NK cell count may be valuable for the prediction of SAD within elderly patient cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To characterize earlier damage pattern of white matter (WM) microstructure in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and its relationship with cognitive domain dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 144 CSVD patients and 100 healthy controls who underwent neuropsychological measurements and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examination were recruited. Cognitive function, emotion, and gait were assessed in each participant. The automated fiber quantification (AFQ) technique was used to extract different fiber properties between groups, and partial correlation and general linear regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between position-specific WM microstructure and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Specific segments in the association fibers, commissural WM regions of interest (ROIs), and projection fibers were damaged in the CSVD group [P &amp;lt; 0.05, family-wise error (FWE) correction], and these damaged segments showed interhemispheric symmetry. In addition, the damage to specific tract profiles [including the posteromedial component of the right cingulum cingulate (CC), the occipital lobe portion of the callosum forceps major, the posterior portion of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR)] was related to the dysfunction in specific cognitive domains. Among these tracts, we found the ATR to be the key set of tracts whose profiles were most associated with cognitive dysfunction. The left ATR was a specific fiber bundle associated with episode memory and language function, whereas the fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the intermediate component of the right ATR were negatively correlated with executive function and gait evaluation. It should be noted that the abovementioned relationships could not survive the Bonferroni correction (p &amp;lt; 0.05/27), so we chose more liberal uncorrected statistical thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Damage to the WM fiber bundles showed extensive interhemispheric symmetry and was limited to particular segments in CSVD patients. Disruption of strategically located fibers was associated with different cognitive deficits, especially the bilateral ATR.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Propionate, a short-chain fatty acid, serves important roles in the human body. However, our review of the current literature suggests that under certain conditions, excess levels of propionate may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The cause of the excessive levels of propionate may be related to the Bacteroidetes phylum, which are the primary producers of propionate in the human gut. Studies have shown that the relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum is significantly increased in older adults. Other studies have shown that levels of the Bacteroidetes phylum are increased in persons with AD. Studies on the diet, medication use, and propionate metabolism offer additional potential causes. There are many different mechanisms by which excess levels of propionate may lead to AD, such as hyperammonemia. These mechanisms offer potential points for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has long been classified into two main forms, aneurysmal SAH (aSAH) and non-aneurysmal SAH (naSAH), but the related risk factors for aSAH and naSAH are heterogeneous. Our objective was to determine the risk factors for SAH of known or unknown origin with respect to diagnostic evaluation in a large patient cohort. We sought to determine whether our classification system can further predict middle long-term stroke and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify risk factors for each SAH subtype. The discovery phase analyzed 11 risk factors from case studies in the literature. Kruskal-Wallis, Cox regression, logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to compare the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 14,904 (34.53%) male and 22,801 (52.84%) female patients were eligible for this study. At a median follow-up of 45.6 months, the 5-years overall survival was 97.768% (95% CI: 0.259–0.292) for aSAH patients and 87.904% (95% CI: 1.459–1.643) for naSAH patients. The 10-years survival rate was 93.870% (95% CI: 2.075–3.086) and 78.115% (95% CI: 2.810–3.156), respectively. Multi-risk factor subgroups showed significant intergroup differences. We identified eight risk factors (drugs, trauma, neoplastic, vessels lesion, inflammatory lesion, blood disease, aneurysm, peri-mesencephalic hemorrhage) using logistic regression, which were optimally differentiated among the aSAH [aSAH-S (AUC: 1), a-d-SAH (AUC: 0.9998), aSAH-T (AUC: 0.9199), aSAH-N (AUC: 0.9433), aSAH-V (AUC: 1), aSAH-I (AUC: 0.9954), a-bd-SAH (AUC: 0.9955)] and naSAH [na-pmSAH (AUC: 0.9979), na-ni-ivl-SAH (AUC: 1), na-t-SAH (AUC: 0.9997), na-ne-SAH (AUC: 0.9475), na-d-SAH (AUC: 0.7676)] subgroups. These models were applied in a parallel cohort, showing eight risk factors plus survival rates to predict the prognosis of SAH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The classification of risk factors related to aSAH and naSAH is helpful in the diagnosis and prediction of the prognosis of aSAH and naSAH patients. Further validation is needed in future clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: In recognition of the mixed associations between traditionally scored slow wave sleep and memory, we sought to explore the relationships between slow wave sleep, electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectra during sleep and overnight verbal memory retention in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements: Participants were 101 adults without dementia (52% female, mean age 70.3 years). Delayed verbal memory was first tested in the evening prior to overnight polysomnography (PSG). The following morning, subjects were asked to recall as many items as possible from the same List (overnight memory retention; OMR). Partial correlation analyses examined the associations of delayed verbal memory and OMR with slow wave sleep (SWS) and two physiologic EEG slow wave activity (SWA) power spectral bands (0.5–1 Hz slow oscillations vs. 1–4 Hz delta activity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In subjects displaying SWS, SWS was associated with enhanced delayed verbal memory, but not with OMR. Interestingly, among participants that did not show SWS, OMR was significantly associated with a higher slow oscillation relative power, during NREM sleep in the first ultradian cycle, with medium effect size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These findings suggest a complex relationship between SWS and memory and illustrate that even in the absence of scorable SWS, older adults demonstrate substantial slow wave activity. Further, these slow oscillations (0.5–1 Hz), in the first ultradian cycle, are positively associated with OMR, but only in those without SWS. Our findings raise the possibility that precise features of slow wave activity play key roles in maintaining memory function in healthy aging. Further, our results underscore that conventional methods of sleep evaluation may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect associations between SWA and memory in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was undertaken to identify preoperative predictive factors of long‐term motor outcome in a large cohort of consecutive Parkinson disease (PD) patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN‐DBS at the Grenoble University Hospital (France) from 1993 to 2015 were evaluated before surgery, at 1 year (short‐term), and in the long term after surgery. All available demographic variables, neuroimaging data, and clinical characteristics were collected. Preoperative predictors of long‐term motor outcome were investigated by performing survival and univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses. Loss of motor benefit from stimulation in the long term was defined as a reduction of less than 25% in the Movement Disorder Society–sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS‐UPDRS) part III scores compared to the baseline off‐medication scores. As a secondary objective, potential predictors of short‐term motor outcome after STN‐DBS were assessed by performing univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long‐term analyses (mean follow‐up = 8.4 ± 6.26 years, median = 10 years, range = 1–17 years), 138 patients were included. Preoperative higher frontal score and off‐medication MDS‐UPDRS part III scores predicted a better long‐term motor response to stimulation, whereas the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging predicted a worse motor outcome. In 357 patients with available 1‐year follow‐up, preoperative levodopa response, tremor dominant phenotype, baseline frontal score, and off‐medication MDS‐UPDRS part III scores predicted the short‐term motor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobe dysfunction, disease severity in the off‐medication condition, and the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging represent the main preoperative clinical predictors of long‐term motor STN‐DBS effects. ANN NEUROL 2021&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with traumatic brain injury who fail to obey commands after sedation‐washout pose one of the most significant challenges for neurological prognostication. Reducing prognostic uncertainty will lead to more appropriate care decisions and ensure provision of limited rehabilitation resources to those most likely to benefit. Bedside markers of covert residual cognition, including speech comprehension, may reduce this uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 28 patients with acute traumatic brain injury who were 2 to 7 days sedation‐free and failed to obey commands. Patients heard streams of isochronous monosyllabic words that built meaningful phrases and sentences while their brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In healthy individuals, EEG activity only synchronizes with the rhythm of phrases and sentences when listeners consciously comprehend the speech. This approach therefore provides a measure of residual speech comprehension in unresponsive patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventeen and 16 patients were available for assessment with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Outcome significantly correlated with the strength of patients’ acute cortical tracking of phrases and sentences (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.6, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.007), quantified by inter‐trial phase coherence. Linear regressions revealed that the strength of this comprehension response (beta = 0.603, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) significantly improved the accuracy of prognoses relative to clinical characteristics alone (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], computed tomography [CT] grade).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple, passive, auditory EEG protocol improves prognostic accuracy in a critical period of clinical decision making. Unlike other approaches to probing covert cognition for prognostication, this approach is entirely passive and therefore less susceptible to cognitive deficits, increasing the number of patients who may benefit.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurology residency program websites often serve as the initial face of a program for prospective residents early in the application process. We evaluated adult neurology residency programs’ websites to determine their comprehensiveness in order to identify areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list of adult neurology residency programs in the United States was compiled using information on the ERAS and FREIDA websites. A total of 24 website criteria covering educational, recruitment, and compensation content were assessed for comprehensiveness. Programs’ website comprehensiveness were compared based on geographic location, program affiliation (community and/or academic), program size, and program/hospital Doximity and US World News and Report rankings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 153 United States adult neurology residency programs’ websites were evaluated. Fewer than half of program websites were accessible with a direct link from either FREIDA or ERAS. The number of residency programs’ websites reporting each content criterion varied greatly. Mean percentage of overall website comprehensiveness amongst neurology residency programs was 65.9%. Northeast location, academic affiliation, larger programs, and ‘top’ ranked programs on Doximity were associated with greater program website comprehensiveness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is opportunity for all neurology residency programs to improve their websites to provide prospective applicants with a more informed and comprehensive perspective of programs during the application process.&lt;/p&gt;

Restoring gene function by the induced skipping of deleterious exons has been shown to be effective for treating genetic disorders. However, many of the clinically successful therapies for exon skipping are transient oligonucleotide-based treatments that require frequent dosing. CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing that causes exon skipping is a promising therapeutic modality that may offer permanent alleviation of genetic disease. We show that machine learning can select Cas9 guide RNAs that disrupt splice acceptors and cause the skipping of targeted exons. We experimentally measured the exon skipping frequencies of a diverse genome-integrated library of 791 splice sequences targeted by 1,063 guide RNAs in mouse embryonic stem cells. We found that our method, SkipGuide, is able to identify effective guide RNAs with a precision of 0.68 (50% threshold predicted exon skipping frequency) and 0.93 (70% threshold predicted exon skipping frequency). We anticipate that SkipGuide will be useful for selecting guide RNA candidates for evaluation of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated exon skipping therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/j1kY3vkHmjg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Nucleosome positioning is crucial for the genome’s function. Though the role of DNA sequence in positioning nucleosomes is well understood, a detailed mechanistic understanding on the impact of transcription remains lacking. Using numerical simulations, we investigated the dependence of nucleosome density profiles on transcription level across multiple species. We found that the low nucleosome affinity of yeast, but not mouse, promoters contributes to the formation of phased nucleosomes arrays for inactive genes. For the active genes, a heterogeneous distribution of +1 nucleosomes, caused by a tug-of-war between two types of remodeling enzymes, is essential for reproducing their density profiles. In particular, while positioning enzymes are known to remodel the +1 nucleosome and align it toward the transcription start site (TSS), spacer enzymes that use a pair of nucleosomes as their substrate can shift the nucleosome array away from the TSS. Competition between these enzymes results in two types of nucleosome density profiles with well- and ill-positioned +1 nucleosome. Finally, we showed that Pol II assisted histone exchange, if occurring at a fast speed, can abolish the impact of remodeling enzymes. By elucidating the role of individual factors, our study reconciles the seemingly conflicting results on the overall impact of transcription in positioning nucleosomes across species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5RKmZq8JDaA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Links between affective states and risk-taking are often characterised using summary statistics from serial decision-making tasks. However, our understanding of these links, and the utility of decision-making as a marker of affect, needs to accommodate the fact that ongoing (e.g., within-task) experience of rewarding and punishing decision outcomes may alter future decisions and affective states. To date, the interplay between affect, ongoing reward and punisher experience, and decision-making has received little detailed investigation. Here, we examined the relationships between reward and loss experience, affect, and decision-making in humans using a novel judgement bias task analysed with a novel computational model. We demonstrated the influence of within-task favourability on decision-making, with more risk-averse/‘pessimistic’ decisions following more positive previous outcomes and a greater current average earning rate. Additionally, individuals reporting more negative affect tended to exhibit greater risk-seeking decision-making, and, based on our model, estimated time more poorly. We also found that individuals reported more positive affective valence during periods of the task when prediction errors and offered decision outcomes were more positive. Our results thus provide new evidence that (short-term) within-task rewarding and punishing experiences determine both future decision-making and subjectively experienced affective states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OAYy0Bjv2Kw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Beatriz Seoane, Alessandra Carbone&lt;/p&gt;

The importance of unstructured biology has quickly grown during the last decades accompanying the explosion of the number of experimentally resolved protein structures. The idea that structural disorder might be a novel mechanism of protein interaction is widespread in the literature, although the number of statistically significant structural studies supporting this idea is surprisingly low. At variance with previous works, our conclusions rely exclusively on a large-scale analysis of all the 134337 X-ray crystallographic structures of the Protein Data Bank averaged over clusters of almost identical protein sequences. In this work, we explore the complexity of the organisation of all the interaction interfaces observed when a protein lies in alternative complexes, showing that interfaces progressively add up in a hierarchical way, which is reflected in a logarithmic law for the size of the union of the interface regions on the number of distinct interfaces. We further investigate the connection of this complexity with different measures of structural disorder: the standard missing residues and a new definition, called “soft disorder”, that covers all the flexible and structurally amorphous residues of a protein. We show evidences that both the interaction interfaces and the soft disordered regions tend to involve roughly the same amino-acids of the protein, and preliminary results suggesting that soft disorder spots those surface regions where new interfaces are progressively accommodated by complex formation. In fact, our results suggest that structurally disordered regions not only carry crucial information about the location of alternative interfaces within complexes, but also about the order of the assembly. We verify these hypotheses in several examples, such as the DNA binding domains of P53 and P73, the C3 exoenzyme, and two known biological orders of assembly. We finally compare our measures of structural disorder with several disorder bioinformatics predictors, showing that these latter are optimised to predict the residues that are missing in all the alternative structures of a protein and they are not able to catch the progressive evolution of the disordered regions upon complex formation. Yet, the predicted residues, when not missing, tend to be characterised as soft disordered regions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wjf4diCw_-o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Motile organisms actively detect environmental signals and migrate to a preferable environment. Especially, small animals convert subtle spatial difference in sensory input into orientation behavioral output for directly steering toward a destination, but the neural mechanisms underlying steering behavior remain elusive. Here, we analyze a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; thermotactic behavior in which a small number of neurons are shown to mediate steering toward a destination temperature. We construct a neuroanatomical model and use an evolutionary algorithm to find configurations of the model that reproduce empirical thermotactic behavior. We find that, in all the evolved models, steering curvature are modulated by temporally persistent thermal signals sensed beyond the time scale of sinusoidal locomotion of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Persistent rise in temperature decreases steering curvature resulting in straight movement of model worms, whereas fall in temperature increases curvature resulting in crooked movement. This relationship between temperature change and steering curvature reproduces the empirical thermotactic migration up thermal gradients and steering bias toward higher temperature. Further, spectrum decomposition of neural activities in model worms show that thermal signals are transmitted from a sensory neuron to motor neurons on the longer time scale than sinusoidal locomotion of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Our results suggest that employments of temporally persistent sensory signals enable small animals to steer toward a destination in natural environment with variable, noisy, and subtle cues.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k5TePF5vmfk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;White matter injury in the neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic brain and potential therapies targeting microglia&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/81baedcc-b98e-4c13-8622-37a618693c83/jnr24761-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential approaches to treating neonatal H‐I injury are as follows: 1. Inhibiting M1 microglia to secrete pro‐inflammatory cytokines or to promote microglia M2 polarization. 2. Targeting OPCs and oligodendrocytes and promoting their differentiation and maturation to maintain axonal integrity and conductivity and restoring axonal functions through remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (H‐I) injury, which mainly causes neuronal damage and white matter injury (WMI), is among the predominant causes of infant morbidity (cerebral palsy, cognitive and persistent motor disabilities) and mortality. Disruptions to the oxygen and blood supply in the perinatal brain affect the cerebral microenvironment and may affect microglial activation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. Microglia are significantly associated with axonal damage and myelinating oligodendrocytes, which are major pathological components of WMI. However, the effects of H‐I injury on microglial functions and underlying transformation mechanisms remain poorly understood. The historical perception that these cells are major risk factors for ischemic stroke has been questioned due to our improved understanding of the diversity of microglial phenotypes and their alterable functions, which exacerbate or attenuate injuries in different regions in response to environmental instability. Unfortunately, although therapeutic hypothermia is an efficient treatment, death and disability remain the prognosis for a large proportion of neonates with H‐I injury. Hence, novel neuroprotective therapies to treat WMI following H‐I injury are urgently needed. Here, we review microglial mechanisms that might occur in the developing brain due to neonatal H‐I injury and discuss whether microglia function as a double‐edged sword in WMI. Then, we emphasize microglial heterogeneity, notably at the single‐cell level, and sex‐specific effects on the etiology of neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss current knowledge of strategies aiming to improve microglia modulation and remyelination following neonatal H‐I injury. Overall, microglia‐targeted therapy might provide novel and valuable insights into the treatment of neonatal H‐I insult.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aging is the time-dependent process that all living organisms go through characterized by declining physiological function due to alterations in metabolic and molecular pathways. Many decades of research have been devoted to uncovering the cellular changes and progression of aging and have revealed that not all organisms with the same chronological age exhibit the same age-related declines in physiological function. In assessing biological age, factors such as epigenetic changes, telomere length, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction in rescue mechanisms such as autophagy all play major roles. Recent studies have focused on autophagy dysfunction in aging, particularly on mitophagy due to its major role in energy generation and reactive oxidative species generation of mitochondria. Mitophagy has been implicated in playing a role in the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The purpose of our article is to highlight the mechanisms of autophagy and mitophagy and how defects in these pathways contribute to the physiological markers of aging and AD. This article also discusses how mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics, impaired biogenesis, and defective mitophagy are related to aging and AD progression. This article highlights recent studies of amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau in relation to autophagy and mitophagy in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previous studies demonstrated specific expression of transcription factor Tbr2 in unipolar brush cells (UBCs) of the cerebellum during development and adulthood. To further study UBCs and the role of Tbr2 in their development we examined UBC morphology in transgenic mouse lines (reporter and lineage tracer) and also examined the effects of Tbr2 deficiency in Tbr2 (MGI: Eomes) conditional knock-out (cKO) mice. In Tbr2 reporter and lineage tracer cerebellum, UBCs exhibited more complex morphologies than previously reported including multiple dendrites, bifurcating dendrites, and up to four dendritic brushes. We propose that “dendritic brush cells” (DBCs) may be a more apt nomenclature. In Tbr2 cKO cerebellum, mature UBCs were completely absent. Migration of UBC precursors from rhombic lip to cerebellar cortex and other nuclei was impaired in Tbr2 cKO mice. Our results indicate that UBC migration and differentiation are sensitive to Tbr2 deficiency. To investigate whether UBCs develop similarly in humans as in rodents, we studied Tbr2 expression in mid-gestational human cerebellum. Remarkably, Tbr2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; UBC precursors migrate along the same pathways in humans as in rodent cerebellum and disperse to create the same “fountain-like” appearance characteristic of UBCs exiting the rhombic lip.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The complex, nanoscopic scale of neuronal function, taking place at dendritic spines, axon terminals, and other minuscule structures, cannot be adequately resolved using standard, diffraction-limited imaging techniques. The last couple of decades saw a rapid evolution of imaging methods that overcome the diffraction limit imposed by Abbe’s principle. These techniques, including structured illumination microscopy (SIM), stimulated emission depletion (STED), photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM), and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), among others, have revolutionized our understanding of synapse biology. By exploiting the stochastic nature of fluorophore light/dark states or non-linearities in the interaction of fluorophores with light, by using modified illumination strategies that limit the excitation area, these methods can achieve spatial resolutions down to just a few tens of nm or less. Here, we review how these advanced imaging techniques have contributed to unprecedented insight into the nanoscopic organization and function of mammalian neuronal presynapses, revealing new organizational principles or lending support to existing views, while raising many important new questions. We further discuss recent technical refinements and newly developed tools that will continue to expand our ability to delve deeper into how synaptic function is orchestrated at the nanoscopic level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Healthy brain function is marked by neuronal network dynamics at or near the critical phase, which separates regimes of instability and stasis. A failure to remain at this critical point can lead to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, which is associated with pathological synchronization of neuronal oscillations. Using full Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) simulations on a Small-World Network, we are able to generate synthetic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with intervals corresponding to seizure (ictal) or non-seizure (interictal) states that can occur based on the hyperexcitability of the artificial neurons and the strength and topology of the synaptic connections between them. These interictal simulations can be further classified into scale-free critical phases and disjoint subcritical exponential phases. By changing the HH parameters, we can model seizures due to a variety of causes, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), congenital channelopathies, and idiopathic etiologies, as well as the effects of anticonvulsant drugs. The results of this work may be used to help identify parameters from actual patient EEG or electrocorticographic (ECoG) data associated with ictogenesis, as well as generating simulated data for training machine-learning seizure prediction algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The sensory organs of the inner ear contain resident populations of macrophages, which are recruited to sites of cellular injury. Such macrophages are known to phagocytose the debris of dying cells but the full role of macrophages in otic pathology is not understood. Lateral line neuromasts of zebrafish contain hair cells that are nearly identical to those in the inner ear, and the optical clarity of larval zebrafish permits direct imaging of cellular interactions. In this study, we used larval zebrafish to characterize the response of macrophages to ototoxic injury of lateral line hair cells. Macrophages migrated into neuromasts within 20 min of exposure to the ototoxic antibiotic neomycin. The number of macrophages in the near vicinity of injured neuromasts was similar to that observed near uninjured neuromasts, suggesting that this early inflammatory response was mediated by “local” macrophages. Upon entering injured neuromasts, macrophages actively phagocytosed hair cell debris. The injury-evoked migration of macrophages was significantly reduced by inhibition of Src-family kinases. Using chemical-genetic ablation of macrophages before the ototoxic injury, we also examined whether macrophages were essential for the initiation of hair cell regeneration. Results revealed only minor differences in hair cell recovery in macrophage-depleted vs. control fish, suggesting that macrophages are not essential for the regeneration of lateral line hair cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previous studies indicate that top-down influence plays a critical role in visual information processing and perceptual detection. However, the substrate that carries top-down influence remains poorly understood. Using a combined technique of retrograde neuronal tracing and immunofluorescent double labeling, we characterized the distribution and cell type of feedback neurons in cat’s high-level visual cortical areas that send direct connections to the primary visual cortex (V1: area 17). Our results showed: (1) the high-level visual cortex of area 21a at the ventral stream and PMLS area at the dorsal stream have a similar proportion of feedback neurons back projecting to the V1 area, (2) the distribution of feedback neurons in the higher-order visual area 21a and PMLS was significantly denser than in the intermediate visual cortex of area 19 and 18, (3) feedback neurons in all observed high-level visual cortex were found in layer II–III, IV, V, and VI, with a higher proportion in layer II–III, V, and VI than in layer IV, and (4) most feedback neurons were CaMKII-positive excitatory neurons, and few of them were identified as inhibitory GABAergic neurons. These results may argue against the segregation of ventral and dorsal streams during visual information processing, and support “reverse hierarchy theory” or interactive model proposing that recurrent connections between V1 and higher-order visual areas constitute the functional circuits that mediate visual perception. Also, the corticocortical feedback neurons from high-level visual cortical areas to the V1 area are mostly excitatory in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Cognitive processes require striatal activity. The underlying molecular mechanisms are widely unknown. For this reason the striatal transcriptome of young (YM), aged cognitively impaired (OMB), and unimpaired (OMG) male rats was analyzed. The global comparison of transcripts reveal a higher number of differences between OMG and YM as compared to OMB and YM. Hierarchical clustering detects differences in up- and down-regulated gene clusters in OMG and OMB when compared to YM. In OMG we found more single genes to be specifically regulated in this group than in OMB when compared to young. These genes were considered as cognition specific, whereas genes shared in OMG and OMB were considered as age specific. OMB specific up-regulated genes are related to negative control of cell differentiation and transcription (Hopx), to phagocytosis (Cd202) and cell adhesion (Pcdhb21), whereas down-regulated genes are related to associative learning, behavioral fear response and synaptic transmission (Gabra5). OMG specific up-regulated genes are in the context of maintenance of transcription and estrogen receptor signaling (Padi2, Anxa3), signal transduction [Rassf4, Dock8)], sterol regulation (Srebf1), and complement activity (C4a, C4b). Down-regulated genes are related to lipid oxidation reduction processes (Far2) and positive regulation of axon extension (Islr2). These relations were supported by pathway analysis, which reveals cholesterol metabolism processes in both aged group and cholesterol biosynthesis specifically in OMG; adipogenesis and focal adhesion in OMB. In OMG glucuronidation, estrogen metabolism, inflammatory responses and TGF beta signaling where detected as specific for this group. Signal transduction of the sphingosine-1-phospate-receptor (S1P) receptor was the main pathway difference in the comparison of OMB and OMG with downregulated genes in the first group. This difference could also be observed in the OMB vs. YM comparison but not in the OMG vs. YM analysis. Thus, an up-regulation of cognition related genes could be observed in OMG compared to OMB rats. The S1P pathway discriminated between OMB and OMG as well as between OMB and OMG. Since this pathway has been described as essential for cognitive processes in the striatum of mice, it may, among steroid hormone signaling, significantly contribute to the maintenance of cognitive processes in OMG.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accurate biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are essential for early diagnosis and intervention. Available biomarkers are not sufficient to permit the monitoring of AD progression over time, and additional biomarkers are required. Measures of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) could be useful biomarkers for AD. Here, we investigate whether levels of Thioflavin-T (ThT) positive amyloid aggregates, i.e., nanoplaques, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could serve as useful biomarkers for AD. One-hundred and eighteen memory clinic patients were AT(N) classified, and CSF nanoplaque concentrations were compared between patients on the “Alzheimer’s continuum” (A+ patients) and patients with “Normal AD biomarkers” or “Non-AD pathologic change” (A− patients). CSF nanoplaque concentrations and sizes were quantified using the novel ThT-Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (ThT-FCS) assay, and core biomarkers (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, total tau and phosphorylated tau) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We investigated the association between nanoplaque concentrations and core biomarkers, and the diagnostic value of nanoplaque levels. Nanoplaque levels were increased in A+ patients compared to A− patients. Nanoplaque concentrations were negatively associated with Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, but not related to total tau or phosphorylated tau measures. Quantification of nanoplaques did not improve the classification of patients on the Alzheimer’s continuum compared to the core biomarkers alone. Dynamic changes in nanoplaques concentration and size throughout AD stages should be explored in longitudinal studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Astrocyte Regional Heterogeneity Revealed Through Machine Learning‐based Glial Neuroanatomical Assays&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fd770e84-c31a-4b1a-bfb3-7d14e6cad36c/cne25105-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional image analysis techniques fail to determine the morphological changes astrocytes undergo following inflammation. Developing an automated segmentation workflow allowed us to extract morphological data of GFAP or ALDH1L1 positive objects. Using principal component analysis and random forests, we were able to determine the features most important for identifying whether an astrocyte was baseline or reactive. To further determine the changes different segmented cellular astrocyte components underwent (i.e., the body or process), we performed k‐means clustering. Multiple, well‐validated machine learning approaches allowed us to determine astrocytes undergo a region‐specific heterogenous morphological change following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluation of reactive astrogliosis by neuroanatomical assays represents a common experimental outcome for neuroanatomists. The literature demonstrates several conflicting results as to the accuracy of such measures. We posited that the diverging results within the neuroanatomy literature were due to suboptimal analytical workflows in addition to astrocyte regional heterogeneity. We therefore generated an automated segmentation workflow to extract features of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Family 1, Member L1 (ALDH1L1) labeled astrocytes with and without neuroinflammation. We achieved this by capturing multiplexed immunofluorescent confocal images of mouse brains treated with either vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by implementation of our workflows. Using classical image analysis techniques focused on pixel intensity only, we were unable to identify differences between vehicle‐treated and LPS‐treated animals. However, when utilizing machine learning based algorithms, we were able to (1) accurately predict which objects were derived from GFAP or ALDH1L1 stained images indicating that GFAP and ALDH1L1 highlight distinct morphological aspects of astrocytes, (2) we could predict which neuroanatomical region the segmented GFAP or ALDH1L1 object had been derived from, indicating that morphological features of astrocytes change as a function of neuroanatomical location. (3) We discovered a statistically significant, albeit not highly accurate, prediction of which objects had come from LPS versus vehicle‐treated animals, indicating that although features exist capable of distinguishing LPS‐treated versus vehicle‐treated GFAP and ALDH1L1 segmented objects, that significant overlap between morphologies exists. We further determined that for most classification scenarios, non‐linear models were required for improved treatment class designations. We propose that unbiased automated image analysis techniques coupled with well‐validated machine learning tools represent highly useful models capable of providing insights into neuroanatomical assays.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Defining vitamin D receptor expression in the brain using a novel VDRCre mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9ce1ce57-6b0e-411a-a198-97d5c6122df2/cne25100-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generated a novel vitamin D receptor (VDR) VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; knockin mouse for the interrogation of VDR anatomy in the brain. In this article, we demonstrate through immunohistochemistry that VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;‐driven reporter expression colocalizes with VDR mRNA throughout the brain. Additionally, we demonstrate that tdTomato (+) neurons respond rapidly to vitamin D, which does not occur in tdTomato (−) neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D action has been linked to several diseases regulated by the brain including obesity, diabetes, autism, and Parkinson's. However, the location of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the brain is not clear due to conflicting reports. We found that two antibodies previously published as specific in peripheral tissues are not specific in the brain. We thus created a new knockin mouse with cre recombinase expression under the control of the endogenous VDR promoter (VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;). We demonstrated that the cre activity in the VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mouse brain (as reported by a cre‐dependent tdTomato expression) is highly overlapping with endogenous VDR mRNAs. These VDR‐expressing cells were enriched in multiple brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, and hypothalamus among others. In the hypothalamus, VDR partially colocalized with vasopressin, oxytocin, estrogen receptor‐α, and β‐endorphin to various degrees. We further functionally validated our model by demonstrating that the endogenous VDR agonist 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D activated all tested tdTomato&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus but had no effect on neurons without tdTomato fluorescence. Thus, we have generated a new mouse tool that allows us to visualize VDR‐expressing cells and to characterize their functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovering novel antibody enables diagnosis and early treatment of the autoimmune encephalitis. We discovered a novel antibody targeting a synaptic receptor and characterized the pathogenic mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened for unknown antibodies in serum and CSF samples from autoimmune encephalitis patients. Samples with reactivity to rat brain sections and no reactivity to conventional antibody tests underwent further process for antibody discovery, using immunoprecipitation to primary neuronal cells, mass‐spectrometry analysis, antigen‐binding assay on antigen‐overexpressed cell line, and electrophysiology assay with cultured hippocampal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two patients had a novel antibody against Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;α2δ (voltage‐gated calcium channel alpha‐2/delta subunit). The patient samples stained neuropils of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cortex in rat brain sections and bound to a Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;α2δ‐overexpressing cell line. Knockdown of the Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;α2δ expression in cultured neurons turned off the immunoreactivity of the patients' antibody to the neurons. The patients were associated with preceding meningitis or neuroendocrine carcinoma, and responded to immunotherapy. In cultured neurons, the antibody reduced neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals by interfering with tight coupling of calcium channels and exocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we found a novel autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti‐Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;α2δ antibody. Further analysis of the antibody in autoimmune encephalitis might promote the early diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis of single-cell genomics data presents several statistical challenges, and extensive efforts have been made to produce methods for the analysis of this data that impute missing values, address sampling issues and quantify and correct for noise. In spite of such efforts, no consensus on best practices has been established and all current approaches vary substantially based on the available data and empirical tests. The k-Nearest Neighbor Graph (kNN-G) is often used to infer the identities of, and relationships between, cells and is the basis of many widely used dimensionality-reduction and projection methods. The kNN-G has also been the basis for imputation methods using, &lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., neighbor averaging and graph diffusion. However, due to the lack of an agreed-upon optimal objective function for choosing hyperparameters, these methods tend to oversmooth data, thereby resulting in a loss of information with regard to cell identity and the specific gene-to-gene patterns underlying regulatory mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the tuning of kNN- and diffusion-based denoising methods with a novel non-stochastic method for optimally preserving biologically relevant informative variance in single-cell data. The framework, &lt;i&gt;Denoising Expression data with a Weighted Affinity Kernel and Self-Supervision&lt;/i&gt; (DEWÄKSS), uses a self-supervised technique to tune its parameters. We demonstrate that denoising with optimal parameters selected by our objective function (i) is robust to preprocessing methods using data from established benchmarks, (ii) disentangles cellular identity and maintains robust clusters over dimension-reduction methods, (iii) maintains variance along several expression dimensions, unlike previous heuristic-based methods that tend to oversmooth data variance, and (iv) rarely involves diffusion but rather uses a fixed weighted kNN graph for denoising. Together, these findings provide a new understanding of kNN- and diffusion-based denoising methods. Code and example data for DEWÄKSS is available at https://gitlab.com/Xparx/dewakss/-/tree/Tjarnberg2020branch.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/967wFN1lsTg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Dual-reinforcement learning theory proposes behaviour is under the tutelage of a retrospective, value-caching, model-free (MF) system and a prospective-planning, model-based (MB), system. This architecture raises a question as to the degree to which, when devising a plan, a MB controller takes account of influences from its MF counterpart. We present evidence that such a sophisticated self-reflective MB planner incorporates an anticipation of the influences its own MF-proclivities exerts on the execution of its planned future actions. Using a novel bandit task, wherein subjects were periodically allowed to design their environment, we show that reward-assignments were constructed in a manner consistent with a MB system taking account of its MF propensities. Thus, in the task participants assigned higher rewards to bandits that were momentarily associated with stronger MF tendencies. Our findings have implications for a range of decision making domains that includes drug abuse, pre-commitment, and the tension between short and long-term decision horizons in economics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QxHdqkRen64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Lassa fever is an haemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV). There is no vaccine approved against LASV and the only recommended antiviral treatment relies on ribavirin, despite limited evidence of efficacy. Recently, the nucleotide analogue favipiravir showed a high antiviral efficacy, with 100% survival obtained in an otherwise fully lethal non-human primate (NHP) model of Lassa fever. However the mechanism of action of the drug is not known and the absence of pharmacokinetic data limits the translation of these results to the human setting. Here we aimed to better understand the antiviral effect of favipiravir by developping the first mathematical model recapitulating Lassa viral dynamics and treatment. We analyzed the viral dynamics in 24 NHPs left untreated or treated with ribavirin or favipiravir, and we put the results in perspective with those obtained with the same drugs in the context of Ebola infection. Our model estimates favipiravir EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; to 2.89 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g.mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is much lower than what was found against Ebola virus. The main mechanism of action of favipiravir was to decrease virus infectivity, with an efficacy of 91% at the highest dose. Based on our knowledge acquired on the drug pharmacokinetics in humans, our model predicts that favipiravir doses larger than 1200 mg twice a day should have the capability to strongly reduce the production infectious virus and provide a milestone towards a future use in humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7Iw8o7tTHjI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Phenomenological relations such as Ohm’s or Fourier’s law have a venerable history in physics but are still scarce in biology. This situation restrains predictive theory. Here, we build on bacterial “growth laws,” which capture physiological feedback between translation and cell growth, to construct a minimal biophysical model for the combined action of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Our model predicts drug interactions like antagonism or synergy solely from responses to individual drugs. We provide analytical results for limiting cases, which agree well with numerical results. We systematically refine the model by including direct physical interactions of different antibiotics on the ribosome. In a limiting case, our model provides a mechanistic underpinning for recent predictions of higher-order interactions that were derived using entropy maximization. We further refine the model to include the effects of antibiotics that mimic starvation and the presence of resistance genes. We describe the impact of a starvation-mimicking antibiotic on drug interactions analytically and verify it experimentally. Our extended model suggests a change in the type of drug interaction that depends on the strength of resistance, which challenges established rescaling paradigms. We experimentally show that the presence of unregulated resistance genes can lead to altered drug interaction, which agrees with the prediction of the model. While minimal, the model is readily adaptable and opens the door to predicting interactions of second and higher-order in a broad range of biological systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vLmQvfofd8M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

State-of-the-art rare variant association testing methods aggregate the contribution of rare variants in biologically relevant genomic regions to boost statistical power. However, testing single genes separately does not consider the complex interaction landscape of genes, nor the downstream effects of non-synonymous variants on protein structure and function. Here we present the NETwork Propagation-based Assessment of Genetic Events (NETPAGE), an integrative approach aimed at investigating the biological pathways through which rare variation results in complex disease phenotypes. We applied NETPAGE to sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), using whole-genome sequencing from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, as well as whole-exome sequencing from the AD Sequencing Project (ADSP). NETPAGE is based on network propagation, a framework that models information flow on a graph and simulates the percolation of genetic variation through tissue-specific gene interaction networks. The result of network propagation is a set of smoothed gene scores that can be tested for association with disease status through sparse regression. The application of NETPAGE to AD enabled the identification of a set of connected genes whose smoothed variation profile was robustly associated to case-control status, based on gene interactions in the hippocampus. Additionally, smoothed scores significantly correlated with risk of conversion to AD in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects. Lastly, we investigated tissue-specific transcriptional dysregulation of the core genes in two independent RNA-seq datasets, as well as significant enrichments in terms of gene sets with known connections to AD. We present a framework that enables enhanced genetic association testing for a wide range of traits, diseases, and sample sizes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aEcyLZvYtDc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Finding medications or vaccines that may decrease the infectious period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could potentially reduce transmission in the broader population. We developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential clinical and economic impact of reducing the infectious period duration. Simulation experiments found that reducing the average infectious period duration could avert a median of 442,852 [treating 25% of symptomatic cases, reducing by 0.5 days, reproductive number (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) 3.5, and starting treatment when 15% of the population has been exposed] to 44.4 million SARS-CoV-2 cases (treating 75% of all infected cases, reducing by 3.5 days, R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 2.0). With R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 2.5, reducing the average infectious period duration by 0.5 days for 25% of symptomatic cases averted 1.4 million cases and 99,398 hospitalizations; increasing to 75% of symptomatic cases averted 2.8 million cases. At $500/person, treating 25% of symptomatic cases saved $209.5 billion (societal perspective). Further reducing the average infectious period duration by 3.5 days averted 7.4 million cases (treating 25% of symptomatic cases). Expanding treatment to 75% of all infected cases, including asymptomatic infections (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 2.5), averted 35.9 million cases and 4 million hospitalizations, saving $48.8 billion (societal perspective and starting treatment after 5% of the population has been exposed). Our study quantifies the potential effects of reducing the SARS-CoV-2 infectious period duration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J3v9-EJMPlo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Bistability is a common mechanism to ensure robust and irreversible cell cycle transitions. Whenever biological parameters or external conditions change such that a threshold is crossed, the system abruptly switches between different cell cycle states. Experimental studies have uncovered mechanisms that can make the shape of the bistable response curve change dynamically in time. Here, we show how such a dynamically changing bistable switch can provide a cell with better control over the timing of cell cycle transitions. Moreover, cell cycle oscillations built on bistable switches are more robust when the bistability is modulated in time. Our results are not specific to cell cycle models and may apply to other bistable systems in which the bistable response curve is time-dependent.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bq7N1WcUu0Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pyogenes&lt;/i&gt; (Group A streptococcus; GAS) is an important human pathogen responsible for mild to severe, life-threatening infections. GAS expresses a wide range of virulence factors, including the M family proteins. The M proteins allow the bacteria to evade parts of the human immune defenses by triggering the formation of a dense coat of plasma proteins surrounding the bacteria, including IgGs. However, the molecular level details of the M1-IgG interaction have remained unclear. Here, we characterized the structure and dynamics of this interaction interface in human plasma on the surface of live bacteria using integrative structural biology, combining cross-linking mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that the primary interaction is formed between the S-domain of M1 and the conserved IgG Fc-domain. In addition, we show evidence for a so far uncharacterized interaction between the A-domain and the IgG Fc-domain. Both these interactions mimic the protein G-IgG interface of group C and G streptococcus. These findings underline a conserved scavenging mechanism used by GAS surface proteins that block the IgG-receptor (FcγR) to inhibit phagocytic killing. We additionally show that we can capture Fab-bound IgGs in a complex background and identify XLs between the constant region of the Fab-domain and certain regions of the M1 protein engaged in the Fab-mediated binding. Our results elucidate the M1-IgG interaction network involved in inhibition of phagocytosis and reveal important M1 peptides that can be further investigated as future vaccine targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oCo3qRV_amI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We introduce a hybrid two-dimensional multiscale model of angiogenesis, the process by which endothelial cells (ECs) migrate from a pre-existing vascular bed in response to local environmental cues and cell-cell interactions, to create a new vascular network. Recent experimental studies have highlighted a central role of cell rearrangements in the formation of angiogenic networks. Our model accounts for this phenomenon via the heterogeneous response of ECs to their microenvironment. These cell rearrangements, in turn, dynamically remodel the local environment. The model reproduces characteristic features of angiogenic sprouting that include branching, chemotactic sensitivity, the brush border effect, and cell mixing. These properties, rather than being hardwired into the model, emerge naturally from the gene expression patterns of individual cells. After calibrating and validating our model against experimental data, we use it to predict how the structure of the vascular network changes as the baseline gene expression levels of the VEGF-Delta-Notch pathway, and the composition of the extracellular environment, vary. In order to investigate the impact of cell rearrangements on the vascular network structure, we introduce the mixing measure, a scalar metric that quantifies cell mixing as the vascular network grows. We calculate the mixing measure for the simulated vascular networks generated by ECs of different lineages (wild type cells and mutant cells with impaired expression of a specific receptor). Our results show that the time evolution of the mixing measure is directly correlated to the generic features of the vascular branching pattern, thus, supporting the hypothesis that cell rearrangements play an essential role in sprouting angiogenesis. Furthermore, we predict that lower cell rearrangement leads to an imbalance between branching and sprout elongation. Since the computation of this statistic requires only individual cell trajectories, it can be computed for networks generated in biological experiments, making it a potential biomarker for pathological angiogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c6q6XzetUQY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Natural environments, like soils or the mammalian gut, frequently contain microbial consortia competing within a niche, wherein many species contain genetically encoded mechanisms of interspecies competition. Recent computational work suggests that physical structures in the environment can stabilize local competition between species that would otherwise be subject to competitive exclusion under isotropic conditions. Here we employ Lotka-Volterra models to show that interfacial competition localizes to physical structures, stabilizing competitive ecological networks of many species, even with significant differences in the strength of competitive interactions between species. Within a limited range of parameter space, we show that for stable communities the length-scale of physical structure inversely correlates with the width of the distribution of competitive fitness, such that physical environments with finer structure can sustain a broader spectrum of interspecific competition. These results highlight the potentially stabilizing effects of physical structure on microbial communities and lay groundwork for engineering structures that stabilize and/or select for diverse communities of ecological, medical, or industrial utility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eQisoTeAscY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Vertebrate behavior is strongly influenced by light. Light receptors, encoded by functional opsin proteins, are present inside the vertebrate brain and peripheral tissues. This expression feature is present from fishes to human and appears to be particularly prominent in diurnal vertebrates. Despite their conserved widespread occurrence, the nonvisual functions of opsins are still largely enigmatic. This is even more apparent when considering the high number of opsins. Teleosts possess around 40 opsin genes, present from young developmental stages to adulthood. Many of these opsins have been shown to function as light receptors. This raises the question of whether this large number might mainly reflect functional redundancy or rather maximally enables teleosts to optimally use the complex light information present under water. We focus on &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin1b&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin2&lt;/i&gt;, c-opsins with ancestral-type sequence features, conserved across several vertebrate phyla, expressed with partly similar expression in non-rod, non-cone, non-retinal-ganglion-cell brain tissues and with a similar spectral sensitivity. The characterization of the single mutants revealed age- and light-dependent behavioral changes, as well as an impact on the levels of the preprohormone &lt;i&gt;sst1b&lt;/i&gt; and the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit &lt;i&gt;scn12aa&lt;/i&gt;. The amount of daytime rest is affected independently of the eyes, pineal organ, and circadian clock in &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin1b&lt;/i&gt; mutants. We further focused on daytime behavior and the molecular changes in &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin1b/2&lt;/i&gt; double mutants, and found that—despite their similar expression and spectral features—these opsins interact in part nonadditively. Specifically, double mutants complement molecular and behavioral phenotypes observed in single mutants in a partly age-dependent fashion. Our work provides a starting point to disentangle the highly complex interactions of vertebrate nonvisual opsins, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;tmt-opsin&lt;/i&gt;-expressing cells together with other visual and nonvisual opsins provide detailed light information to the organism for behavioral fine-tuning. This work also provides a stepping stone to unravel how vertebrate species with conserved opsins, but living in different ecological niches, respond to similar light cues and how human-generated artificial light might impact on behavioral processes in natural environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/A5SlMH1vVBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 50% of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex develop infantile spasms, a sudden‐onset epilepsy syndrome associated with poor neurological outcomes. While an increased burden of tubers confers an elevated risk of infantile spasms, it remains unknown whether some tuber locations confer higher risk than others. Here, we test whether tuber location and connectivity are associated with infantile spasms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We segmented tubers from 123 children with (n=74) and without (n=49) infantile spasms from a prospective observational cohort. We used voxel‐wise lesion symptom mapping to test for an association between spasms and tuber location. We then used lesion network mapping to test for an association between spasms and connectivity with tuber locations. Finally, we tested the discriminability of identified associations with logistic regression and cross validation as well as statistical mediation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuber locations associated with infantile spasms were heterogenous, and no single location was significantly associated with spasms. However, &amp;gt;95% of tuber locations associated with spasms were functionally connected to the globus pallidi and cerebellar vermis. These connections were specific compared to tubers in patients without spasms. Logistic regression found that globus pallidus connectivity was a stronger predictor of spasms (OR 1.96, 95%CI [1.10, 3.50], p=0.02) than tuber burden (OR 1.65, 95%CI [0.90, 3.04], p=0.11), with a mean ROC area under the curve of 0.73 (+/‐0.1) during repeated cross validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connectivity between tuber locations and the bilateral globus pallidus is associated with infantile spasms. Our findings lend insight into spasm pathophysiology and may identify patients at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the most common causes of death and disability worldwide. Neuroinflammation is a major pathological event involved in the process of ischemic injury and repair. In particular, microglia play a dual role in neuroinflammation. During the acute phase of stroke onset, M2 microglia are the dominant phenotype and exert protective effects on neuronal cells, whereas permanent M1 microglia contribute to prolonged inflammation and are detrimental to brain tissue. Emerging evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) may have regulatory effects on microglia-associated inflammation. Thus, we briefly reviewed the dynamic response of microglia after a stroke and assessed how specific miRNAs affect the behavior of reactive microglia. We concluded that miRNAs may be useful novel therapeutic targets to improve stroke outcomes and modulate neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Epilepsies are chronic neurological diseases that affect approximately 2% of the world population. In addition to being one of the most frequent neurological disorders, treatment for patients with epilepsy remains a challenge, because a proportion of patients do not respond to the antiseizure medications that are currently available. This results in a severe economic and social burden for patients, families, and the healthcare system. A characteristic common to all forms of epilepsy is the occurrence of epileptic seizures that are caused by abnormal neuronal discharges, leading to a clinical manifestation that is dependent on the affected brain region. It is generally accepted that an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition generates the synchronic electrical activity leading to seizures. However, it is still unclear how a normal neural circuit becomes susceptible to the generation of seizures or how epileptogenesis is induced. Herein, we review the results of recent proteomic studies applied to investigate the underlying mechanisms leading to epilepsies and how these findings may impact research and treatment for these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Aβo) start to accumulate in the human brain one to two decades before any clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are implicated in synapse loss, one of the best predictors of memory decline that characterize the illness. Cognitive impairment in AD was traditionally thought to result from a reduction in synaptic activity which ultimately induces neurodegeneration. More recent evidence indicates that in the early stages of AD synaptic failure is, at least partly, induced by neuronal hyperactivity rather than hypoactivity. Here, we review the growing body of evidence supporting the implication of soluble Aβo on the induction of neuronal hyperactivity in AD animal models, in vitro, and in humans. We then discuss the impact of Aβo-induced hyperactivity on memory performance, cell death, epileptiform activity, gamma oscillations, and slow wave activity. We provide an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are emerging to explain how Aβo induce neuronal hyperactivity. We conclude by providing an outlook on the impact of hyperactivity for the development of disease-modifying interventions at the onset of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hearing impairment is the most common sensory disorder in humans. So far, rehabilitation of profoundly deaf subjects relies on direct stimulation of the auditory nerve through cochlear implants. However, in some forms of genetic hearing impairment, the organ of Corti is structurally intact and therapeutic replacement of the mutated gene could potentially restore near natural hearing. In the case of defects of the otoferlin gene (OTOF), such gene therapy is hindered by the size of the coding sequence (~6 kb) exceeding the cargo capacity (&amp;lt;5 kb) of the preferred viral vector, adeno-associated virus (AAV). Recently, a dual-AAV approach was used to partially restore hearing in deaf otoferlin knock-out (Otof-KO) mice. Here, we employed in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the gene-therapeutic potential of naturally-occurring and newly-developed synthetic AAVs overloaded with the full-length Otof coding sequence. Upon early postnatal injection into the cochlea of Otof-KO mice, overloaded AAVs drove specific expression of otoferlin in ~30% of all IHCs, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence labeling and polymerase chain reaction. Recordings of auditory brainstem responses and a behavioral assay demonstrated partial restoration of hearing. Together, our results suggest that viral gene therapy of DFNB9—using a single overloaded AAV vector—is indeed feasible, reducing the complexity of gene transfer compared to dual-AAV approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) are prevalent worldwide. mTBIs can impair hippocampal-based functions such as memory and cause network hyperexcitability of the dentate gyrus (DG), a key entry point to hippocampal circuitry. One candidate for mediating mTBI-induced hippocampal cognitive and physiological dysfunction is injury-induced changes in the process of DG neurogenesis. There are conflicting results on how TBI impacts the process of DG neurogenesis; this is not surprising given that both the neurogenesis process and the post-injury period are dynamic, and that the quantification of neurogenesis varies widely in the literature. Even within the minority of TBI studies focusing specifically on mild injuries, there is disagreement about if and how mTBI changes the process of DG neurogenesis. Here we utilized a clinically relevant rodent model of mTBI (lateral fluid percussion injury, LFPI), gold-standard markers and quantification of the neurogenesis process, and three time points post-injury to generate a comprehensive picture of how mTBI affects adult hippocampal DG neurogenesis. Male C57BL/6J mice (6-8 weeks old) received either sham surgery or mTBI via LFPI. Proliferating cells, neuroblasts/immature neurons, and surviving cells were quantified via stereology in DG subregions (subgranular zone [SGZ], outer granule cell layer [oGCL], molecular layer, and hilus) at short-term (3 days post-injury, dpi), intermediate (7 dpi), and long-term (31 dpi) time points. The data show this model of mTBI induces transient, sequential increases in ipsilateral SGZ/GCL proliferating cells, neuroblasts/immature neurons, and surviving cells which is suggestive of mTBI-induced neurogenesis. In contrast to these ipsilateral hemisphere findings, measures in the contralateral hemisphere were not increased in key neurogenic DG subregions after LFPI. Our work in this mTBI model is in line with most literature on other and more severe models of TBI in showing TBI stimulates the process of DG neurogenesis. However, as our DG data in mTBI provide temporal, subregional, and neurogenesis-stage resolution, these data are important to consider in regard to the functional importance of TBI-induction of the neurogenesis process and future work assessing the potential of replacing and/or repairing DG neurons in the brain after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Epigenetic clocks are among the most promising biomarkers of aging. It is particularly important to establish biomarkers of brain aging to better understand neurodegenerative diseases. To advance application of epigenetic clocks—which were largely created with DNA methylation levels in blood samples—for use in brain, we need clearer evaluation of epigenetic clock behavior in brain, including direct comparisons of brain specimens with blood, a more accessible tissue for research. We leveraged data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine three established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge clocks) and a newer clock, trained in cortical tissue. We calculated each clock in three different specimens: (1) antemortem CD4+ cells derived from blood (n = 41); (2) postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, n = 730); and (3) postmortem posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, n = 186), among older women and men, age 66–108 years at death. Across all clocks, epigenetic age calculated from blood and brain specimens was generally lower than chronologic age, although differences were smallest for the Cortical clock when calculated in the brain specimens. Nonetheless, we found that Pearson correlations of epigenetic to chronologic ages in brain specimens were generally reasonable for all clocks; correlations for the Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge clocks largely ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 (all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The Cortical clock outperformed the other clocks, reaching a correlation of 0.83 in the DLFPC (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) for epigenetic vs. chronologic age. Nonetheless, epigenetic age was quite modestly correlated across blood and DLPFC in 41 participants with paired samples [Pearson r from 0.21 (p = 0.2) to 0.32 (p = 0.05)], indicating that broader research in neurodegeneration may benefit from clocks using CpG sites better conserved across blood and brain. Finally, in analyses stratified by sex, by pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, and by clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia, correlations of epigenetic to chronologic age remained consistently high across all groups. Future research in brain aging will benefit from epigenetic clocks constructed in brain specimens, including exploration of any advantages of focusing on CpG sites conserved across brain and other tissue types.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dance has traditionally been viewed from a Eurocentric perspective as a mode of self-expression that involves the human body moving through space, performed for the purposes of art, and viewed by an audience. In this Hypothesis and Theory article, we synthesize findings from anthropology, sociology, psychology, dance pedagogy, and neuroscience to propose The Synchronicity Hypothesis of Dance, which states that humans dance to enhance both intra- and inter-brain synchrony. We outline a neurocentric definition of dance, which suggests that dance involves neurobehavioral processes in seven distinct areas including sensory, motor, cognitive, social, emotional, rhythmic, and creative. We explore The Synchronicity Hypothesis of Dance through several avenues. First, we examine evolutionary theories of dance, which suggest that dance drives interpersonal coordination. Second, we examine fundamental movement patterns, which emerge throughout development and are omnipresent across cultures of the world. Third, we examine how each of the seven neurobehaviors increases intra- and inter-brain synchrony. Fourth, we examine the neuroimaging literature on dance to identify the brain regions most involved in and affected by dance. The findings presented here support our hypothesis that we engage in dance for the purpose of intrinsic reward, which as a result of dance-induced increases in neural synchrony, leads to enhanced interpersonal coordination. This hypothesis suggests that dance may be helpful to repattern oscillatory activity, leading to clinical improvements in autism spectrum disorder and other disorders with oscillatory activity impairments. Finally, we offer suggestions for future directions and discuss the idea that our consciousness can be redefined not just as an individual process but as a shared experience that we can positively influence by dancing together.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There is a relationship between reading and math skills, as well as comorbidity between reading and math disorders. A mutual foundation for this comorbidity could be that the quality of phonological representations is important for both early reading and arithmetic. In this study, we examine this hypothesis in a sample traced longitudinally from preschool to first grade (N = 259). The results show that phonological awareness does not explain development in arithmetic, but that there is an indirect effect between phoneme awareness in preschool and arithmetic in first grade via phoneme awareness in first grade. This effect is, however, weak and restricted to verbal arithmetic and not arithmetic fluency. This finding is only partly in line with other studies, and a reason could be that this study more strongly controls for confounders and previous skills than other studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The last 15 years have seen an explosion of new findings on the role of complement, a major arm of the immune system, in the central nervous system (CNS) compartment including contributions to cell migration, elimination of synapse during development, aberrant synapse pruning in neurologic disorders, damage to nerve cells in autoimmune diseases, and traumatic injury. Activation of the complement system in multiple sclerosis (MS) is typically thought to occur as part of a primary (auto)immune response from the periphery (the outside) against CNS antigens (the inside). However, evidence of local complement production from CNS-resident cells, intracellular complement functions, and the more recently discovered role of early complement components in shaping synaptic circuits in the absence of inflammation opens up the possibility that complement-related sequelae may start and finish within the brain itself. In this review, the complement system will be introduced, followed by evidence that implicates complement in shaping the developing, adult, and normal aging CNS as well as its contribution to pathology in neurodegenerative conditions. Discussion of data supporting “outside-in” vs. “inside-out” roles of complement in MS will be presented, concluded by thoughts on potential approaches to therapies targeting specific elements of the complement system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: Dementia is increasing in prevalence in aging populations. Current questionnaire-based cognitive assessments may not comprehensively assess cognitive function and real-time task-performance. Virtual reality (VR) technology has been used in cognitive assessments but existing systems have limited scope in evaluating all cognitive domains. We have developed a novel, fully-immersive VR system (CAVIRE: Cognitive Assessment by VIrtual REality), which incorporates automated audio-visual instructions. An automated scoring matrix to assess the six cognitive domains—perceptual-motor function, executive function, complex attention, social cognition, learning and memory, and language—is embedded in the CAVIRE system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aims: The primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of using the CAVIRE system to assess cognitive function of participants across different age groups from 35 to 84 years old. The secondary aims are to determine the CAVIRE performance-indices (completion time and scores) of the participants and to assess their acceptability toward the use of CAVIRE as a modality for cognitive assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One hundred and seventy-five participants will be assessed by CAVIRE at a primary care clinic in Singapore. They will be first assessed using questionnaires: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADLs), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). Those aged 65–84 years will be grouped into cognitively intact (n = 50, MoCA score ≥ 26) and cognitively impaired (n = 50, MoCA &amp;lt; 26). The CAVIRE performance-indices of cognitively healthy younger participants aged 35–64 years (n = 75) will serve as benchmark references. CAVIRE auto-computes the participant's performance-indices in 13 different segments. The tasks include domestic chores, memory, shopping, and social interactions. The proportion of participants who complete the entire VR assessment in each age group will be evaluated as feasibility indicators. The CAVIRE performance-indices will be compared across the different age groups. Feedback on the acceptability of the CAVIRE system will be collated and compared among the participants across the age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: CAVIRE is designed to assess the six domains of cognitive function using VR. The results of this feasibility study will provide insights for the implementation of the CAVIRE system as an alternative modality of cognitive assessment in the community.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Although the prevalent view regards a CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;‐lymphocyte autoimmune reaction against myelin at the root of the disease, recent studies propose autoimmunity as a secondary reaction to idiopathic brain damage. To gain knowledge about this possibility we investigated the presence of axonal and myelinic morphological alterations which could implicate imbalance of axon‐myelin units as primary event in MS pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;METHODS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using high resolution imaging histological brain specimens from MS patients and non‐neurological/non‐MS controls, we explored molecular changes underpinning imbalanced interaction between axon and myelin in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), a region characterized by normal myelination and absent inflammatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS brains, we detected blister‐like swellings formed by myelin detachment from axons, which were substantially less frequently retrieved in non‐neurological/non‐MS controls. Swellings in MS NAWM presented altered glutamate receptor expression, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) distribution and lipid biochemical composition of myelin sheaths. Changes in tethering protein expression, widening of nodes of Ranvier and altered distribution of sodium channels in nodal regions of otherwise normally myelinated axons were also present in MS NAWM. Finally, we demonstrate a significant increase, compared with controls, in citrullinated proteins in myelin of MS cases, pointing toward biochemical modifications that may amplify the immunogenicity of MS myelin.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the impaired interaction of myelin and axons potentially leads to myelin disintegration. Conceptually, the ensuing release of (post‐translationally modified) myelin antigens may elicit a subsequent immune attack in MS.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroplasticity in N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptor signaling in subregions of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla following sedentary versus physically active conditions&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/151bfa20-c8e3-43b3-9e6e-1d596bd57109/cne25094-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which the brain undergoes neuroplasticity during sedentary versus active conditions are important in understanding how a sedentary lifestyle has become the leading cause of death due to modifiable risk factors. Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate ongoing sympathetic vasoconstriction and cardiac function under normal conditions, and their activity appears heightened in models of cardiovascular disease associated with sympathetic overactivity. The current study provides evidence of activity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM via increased glutamate levels and increased expression of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐aspartic acid receptors in the RVLM of sedentary compared to active rats. These mechanisms produce a complex framework by which RVLM neurons increase their influence on sympathoexcitation in sedentary compared to physically active conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brain region involved in normal regulation of the cardiovascular system and heightened sympathoexcitatory states of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among major risk factors for CVD, sedentary lifestyles contribute to higher mortality than other modifiable risk factors. Previous studies suggest excessive glutamatergic excitation of presympathetic neurons in the RVLM occurs in sedentary animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine neuroplasticity in the glutamatergic system in the RVLM of sedentary and physically active rats. We hypothesized that relative to active rats, sedentary rats would exhibit higher expression of glutamate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐aspartic acid receptor subunits (GluN), phosphoGluN1, and the excitatory scaffold protein postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), while achieving higher glutamate levels. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (4 weeks old) were divided into sedentary and active (running wheel) conditions for 10–12 weeks. We used retrograde tracing/triple‐labeling techniques, western blotting, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report in sedentary versus physically active rats: 1) fewer bulbospinal non‐C1 neurons positive for GluN1, 2) significantly higher expression of GluN1 and GluN2B but lower levels of phosphoGluN1 (pSer896) and PSD95, and 3) higher levels of glutamate in the RVLM. Higher GluN expression is consistent with enhanced sympathoexcitation in sedentary animals; however, a more complex neuroplasticity occurs within subregions of the ventrolateral medulla. Our results in rodents may also indicate that alterations in glutamatergic excitation of the RVLM contribute to the increased incidence of CVD in humans who lead sedentary lifestyles. Thus, there is a strong need to further pursue mechanisms of inactivity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The chi-square periodogram (CSP), developed over 40 years ago, continues to be one of the most popular methods to estimate the period of circadian (circa 24-h) rhythms. Previous work has indicated the CSP is sometimes less accurate than other methods, but understanding of why and under what conditions remains incomplete. Using simulated rhythmic time-courses, we found that the CSP is prone to underestimating the period in a manner that depends on the true period and the length of the time-course. This underestimation bias is most severe in short time-courses (e.g., 3 days), but is also visible in longer simulated time-courses (e.g., 12 days) and in experimental time-courses of mouse wheel-running and ex vivo bioluminescence. We traced the source of the bias to discontinuities in the periodogram that are related to the number of time-points the CSP uses to calculate the observed variance for a given test period. By revising the calculation to avoid discontinuities, we developed a new version, the greedy CSP, that shows reduced bias and improved accuracy. Nonetheless, even the greedy CSP tended to be less accurate on our simulated time-courses than an alternative method, namely the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Thus, although our study describes a major improvement to a classic method, it also suggests that users should generally avoid the CSP when estimating the period of biological rhythms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GLnerg7E1a8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Phylogeographic inference allows reconstruction of past geographical spread of pathogens or living organisms by integrating genetic and geographic data. A popular model in continuous phylogeography—with location data provided in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates—describes spread as a Brownian motion (Brownian Motion Phylogeography, BMP) in continuous space and time, akin to similar models of continuous trait evolution. Here, we show that reconstructions using this model can be strongly affected by sampling biases, such as the lack of sampling from certain areas. As an attempt to reduce the effects of sampling bias on BMP, we consider the addition of sequence-free samples from under-sampled areas. While this approach alleviates the effects of sampling bias, in most scenarios this will not be a viable option due to the need for prior knowledge of an outbreak’s spatial distribution. We therefore consider an alternative model, the spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process (ΛFV), which has recently gained popularity in population genetics. Despite the ΛFV’s robustness to sampling biases, we find that the different assumptions of the ΛFV and BMP models result in different applicabilities, with the ΛFV being more appropriate for scenarios of endemic spread, and BMP being more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A4faYaa8IVQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Investigating metabolic functional capability of a human gut microbiome enables the quantification of microbiome changes, which can cause a phenotypic change of host physiology and disease. One possible way to estimate the functional capability of a microbial community is through inferring metagenomic content from 16S rRNA gene sequences. Genome-scale models (GEMs) can be used as scaffold for functional estimation analysis at a systematic level, however up to date, there is no integrative toolbox based on GEMs for uncovering metabolic functions. Here, we developed the MetGEMs (metagenome-scale models) toolbox, an open-source application for inferring metabolic functions from 16S rRNA gene sequences to facilitate the study of the human gut microbiome by the wider scientific community. The developed toolbox was validated using shotgun metagenomic data and shown to be superior in predicting functional composition in human clinical samples compared to existing state-of-the-art tools. Therefore, the MetGEMs toolbox was subsequently applied for annotating putative enzyme functions and metabolic routes related in human disease using atopic dermatitis as a case study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cvRxw_0L_cQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are prevalent in the eukaryotic proteome. Common functional roles of IDRs include forming flexible linkers or undergoing allosteric folding-upon-binding. Recent studies have suggested an additional functional role for IDRs: generating steric pressure on the plasma membrane during endocytosis, via molecular crowding. However, in order to accomplish useful functions, such crowding needs to be regulated in space (e.g., endocytic hotspots) and time (e.g., during vesicle formation). In this work, we explore binding-induced regulation of IDR steric volume. We simulate the IDRs of two proteins from Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) to see if their conformational spaces are regulated via binding-induced expansion. Using Monte-Carlo computational modeling of excluded volumes, we generate large conformational ensembles (3 million) for the IDRs of Epsin and Eps15 and dock the conformers to the alpha subunit of Adaptor Protein 2 (AP2α), their CME binding partner. Our results show that as more molecules of AP2α are bound, the Epsin-derived ensemble shows a significant increase in global dimensions, measured as the radius of Gyration (R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) and the end-to-end distance (EED). Unlike Epsin, Eps15-derived conformers that permit AP2α binding at one motif were found to be more likely to accommodate binding of AP2α at other motifs, suggesting a tendency toward co-accessibility of binding motifs. Co-accessibility was not observed for any pair of binding motifs in Epsin. Thus, we speculate that the disordered regions of Epsin and Eps15 perform different roles during CME, with accessibility in Eps15 allowing it to act as a recruiter of AP2α molecules, while binding-induced expansion of the Epsin disordered region could impose steric pressure and remodel the plasma membrane during vesicle formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O_Mks-JSRUk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

With an estimated $10.4 billion in medical costs and 31.4 million outpatient visits each year, influenza poses a serious burden of disease in the United States. To provide insights and advance warning into the spread of influenza, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs a challenge for forecasting weighted influenza-like illness (wILI) at the national and regional level. Many models produce independent forecasts for each geographical unit, ignoring the constraint that the national wILI is a weighted sum of regional wILI, where the weights correspond to the population size of the region. We propose a novel algorithm that transforms a set of independent forecast distributions to obey this constraint, which we refer to as probabilistically coherent. Enforcing probabilistic coherence led to an increase in forecast skill for 79% of the models we tested over multiple flu seasons, highlighting the importance of respecting the forecasting system’s geographical hierarchy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4BkC14wLJxg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

To ensure genome stability, sexually reproducing organisms require that mating brings together exactly 2 haploid gametes and that meiosis occurs only in diploid zygotes. In the fission yeast &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt;, fertilization triggers the Mei3-Pat1-Mei2 signaling cascade, which represses subsequent mating and initiates meiosis. Here, we establish a degron system to specifically degrade proteins postfusion and demonstrate that mating blocks not only safeguard zygote ploidy but also prevent lysis caused by aberrant fusion attempts. Using long-term imaging and flow-cytometry approaches, we identify previously unrecognized and independent roles for Mei3 and Mei2 in zygotes. We show that Mei3 promotes premeiotic S-phase independently of Mei2 and that cell cycle progression is both necessary and sufficient to reduce zygotic mating behaviors. Mei2 not only imposes the meiotic program and promotes the meiotic cycle, but also blocks mating behaviors independently of Mei3 and cell cycle progression. Thus, we find that fungi preserve zygote ploidy and survival by at least 2 mechanisms where the zygotic fate imposed by Mei2 and the cell cycle reentry triggered by Mei3 synergize to prevent zygotic mating.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kthJfvLIOcg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Collective migration of cohesive tissues is a fundamental process in morphogenesis and is particularly well illustrated during gastrulation by the rapid and massive internalization of the mesoderm, which contrasts with the much more modest movements of the ectoderm. In the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryo, the differences in morphogenetic capabilities of ectoderm and mesoderm can be connected to the intrinsic motility of individual cells, very low for ectoderm, highly for mesoderm. Surprisingly, we find that these seemingly deep differences can be accounted for simply by differences in Rho-kinases (Rock)-dependent actomyosin contractility. We show that Rock inhibition is sufficient to rapidly unleash motility in the ectoderm and confer it with mesoderm-like properties. In the mesoderm, this motility is dependent on 2 negative regulators of RhoA, the small GTPase Rnd1 and the RhoGAP Shirin/Dlc2/ArhGAP37. Both are absolutely essential for gastrulation. At the cellular and tissue level, the 2 regulators show overlapping yet distinct functions. They both contribute to decrease cortical tension and confer motility, but Shirin tends to increase tissue fluidity and stimulate dispersion, while Rnd1 tends to favor more compact collective migration. Thus, each is able to contribute to a specific property of the migratory behavior of the mesoderm. We propose that the “ectoderm to mesoderm transition” is a prototypic case of collective migration driven by a down-regulation of cellular tension, without the need for the complex changes traditionally associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/T_ck0PJhOhs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor derived from glioma cells upregulate matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 14 expression on microglia, which in turn promote glioma progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is released by glioma cells and promotes tumor growth. We have previously found that GDNF released from the tumor cells is a chemoattractant for microglial cells, the immune cells of the central nervous system. Here we show that GDNF increases matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP14 expression in cultured microglial cells from mixed sexes of neonatal mice. The GDNF‐induced microglial MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation is mediated by GDNF family receptor alpha 1 receptors and dependent on p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling. In organotypic brain slices, GDNF promotes the growth of glioma and this effect depends on the presence of microglia. We also previously found that MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation can be mediated by Toll‐like receptor (TLR) 2 signaling and here we demonstrate that GDNF increases the expression of TLR1 and TLR2. In conclusion, GDNF promotes the pro‐tumorigenic phenotype of microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Serial section immuno‐electron microscopy of gamma protocadherins (Pcdh‐γs), a subset of clustered protocadherins, at synapses in CA1. We characterized synaptic diameter and perforation status for synapses labeled with antibodies to Pcdh‐γs and found that they were larger with more frequent perforations. Results were confirmed by light level imaging of immunolabeled synapses. The results suggest that clustered protocadherins may mediate a late event in synaptic development. Bar = 500 nm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a family of ~60 cadherin‐like proteins (divided into subclasses α, β, and γ) that regulate dendrite morphology and neural connectivity. Their expression is controlled through epigenetic regulation at a gene cluster encoding the molecules. During neural development, Pcdhs mediate dendrite self‐avoidance in some neuronal types through an uncharacterized anti‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs are also important for dendritic complexity in cortical neurons likely through a pro‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs have also been postulated to participate in synaptogenesis and connectivity. Some synaptic defects were noted in knockout animals, including synaptic number and physiology, but the role of these molecules in synaptic development is not understood. The effect of Pcdh knockout on dendritic patterning may present a confound to studying synaptogenesis. We showed previously that Pcdh‐γs are highly enriched in intracellular compartments in dendrites and spines with localization at only a few synaptic clefts. To gain insight into how Pcdh‐γs might affect synapses, we compared synapses that harbored Pcdh‐γs versus those that did not for parameters of synaptic maturation including pre‐ and postsynaptic size, postsynaptic perforations, and spine morphology by light microscopy in cultured hippocampal neurons and by serial section immuno‐electron microscopy in hippocampal CA1. In mature neurons, synapses immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs were larger in diameter with more frequent perforations. Analysis of spines in cultured neurons revealed that mushroom spines were more frequently immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs at their tips than thin spines. These results suggest that Pcdh‐γ function at the synapse may be related to promotion of synaptic maturation and stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.609903"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Preterm infants exposed to supraphysiological oxygen (hyperoxia) during the neonatal period have hippocampal atrophy and cognitive dysfunction later in childhood and as adolescents. Previously, we reported that 14-week-old adult mice exposed to hyperoxia as newborns had spatial memory deficits and hippocampal shrinkage, findings that mirror those of human adolescents who were born preterm. The area CA1 region of the hippocampus that is crucial for spatial learning and memory is highly vulnerable to oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of neonatal hyperoxia exposure on hippocampal CA3–CA1 synaptic function. Male and female C57BL/6J mouse pups were continuously exposed to either 85% normobaric oxygen or air between postnatal days 2–14. Hippocampal slice electrophysiology at CA3–CA1 synapses was then performed at 14 weeks of age. We observed that hyperoxia exposed mice have heightened strength of basal synaptic transmission measured in input-output curves, increased fiber volley amplitude indicating increased axonal excitability, and heightened LTP magnitude at CA3–CA1 synapses, likely a consequence of increased postsynaptic depolarization during tetanus. These data demonstrate that supraphysiological oxygen exposure during the critical neonatal developmental period leads to pathologically heightened CA3–CA1 synaptic function during early adulthood which may contribute to hippocampal shrinkage and learning and memory deficits we previously reported. Furthermore, these results will help shed light on the consequences of hyperoxia exposure on the development of hippocampal synaptic circuit abnormalities that could be contributing to cognitive deficits in children born preterm.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the effect of resolution on iron content using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM); to verify the consistency of QSM across field strengths and manufacturers in evaluating the iron content of deep gray matter (DGM) of the human brain using subjects from multiple sites; and to establish a susceptibility baseline as a function of age for each DGM structure using both a global and regional iron analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Data from 623 healthy adults, ranging from 20 to 90 years old, were collected across 3 sites using gradient echo imaging on one 1.5 Tesla and two 3.0 Tesla MR scanners. Eight subcortical gray matter nuclei were semi-automatically segmented using a full-width half maximum threshold-based analysis of the QSM data. Mean susceptibility, volume and total iron content with age correlations were evaluated for each measured structure for both the whole-region and RII (high iron content regions) analysis. For the purpose of studying the effect of resolution on QSM, a digitized model of the brain was applied.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean susceptibilities of the caudate nucleus (CN), globus pallidus (GP) and putamen (PUT) were not significantly affected by changing the slice thickness from 0.5 to 3 mm. But for small structures, the susceptibility was reduced by 10% for 2 mm thick slices. For global analysis, the mean susceptibility correlated positively with age for the CN, PUT, red nucleus (RN), substantia nigra (SN), and dentate nucleus (DN). There was a negative correlation with age in the thalamus (THA). The volumes of most nuclei were negatively correlated with age. Apart from the GP, THA, and pulvinar thalamus (PT), all the other structures showed an increasing total iron content despite the reductions in volume with age. For the RII regional high iron content analysis, mean susceptibility in most of the structures was moderately to strongly correlated with age. Similar to the global analysis, apart from the GP, THA, and PT, all structures showed an increasing total iron content.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A reasonable estimate for age-related iron behavior can be obtained from a large cross site, cross manufacturer set of data when high enough resolutions are used. These estimates can be used for correcting for age related iron changes when studying diseases like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and other iron related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical thickness (CTh) via surface-based morphometry analysis is a popular method to characterize brain morphometry. Many studies have been performed to investigate CTh abnormalities in migraine. However, the results from these studies were not consistent and even conflicting. These divergent results hinder us to obtain a clear picture of brain morphometry regarding CTh alterations in migraine. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) is a promising technique to quantitatively pool individual neuroimaging studies to identify consistent brain areas involved. Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and SinoMed) and other sources (bioRxiv and reference lists of relevant articles and reviews) were systematically searched for studies that compared regional CTh differences between patients with migraine and healthy controls (HCs) up to May 15, 2020. A CBMA was performed using the Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images approach. In total, we identified 16 studies with 17 datasets reported that were eligible for the CBMA. The 17 datasets included 872 patients with migraine (average sample size 51.3, mean age 39.6 years, 721 females) and 949 HCs (average sample size 59.3, mean age 44.2 years, 680 females). The CBMA detected no statistically significant consistency of CTh alterations in patients with migraine relative to HCs. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis verified this result to be robust. Metaregression analyses revealed that this CBMA result was not confounded by age, gender, aura, attack frequency per month, and illness duration. Our CBMA adds to the evidence of the replication crisis in neuroimaging research that is increasingly recognized. Many potential confounders, such as underpowered sample size, heterogeneous patient selection criteria, and differences in imaging collection and methodology, may contribute to the inconsistencies of CTh alterations in migraine, which merit attention before planning future research on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;RXFP3 (relaxin-family peptide 3 receptor) is the cognate G-protein-coupled receptor for the neuropeptide, relaxin-3. RXFP3 is expressed widely throughout the brain, including the hypothalamus, where it has been shown to modulate feeding behavior and neuroendocrine activity in rodents. In order to better characterize its potential mechanisms of action, this study determined whether RXFP3 is expressed by dopaminergic neurons within the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), in addition to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neurons that express RXFP3 were visualized in coronal brain sections from RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato mice, which express the tdTomato fluorophore within RXFP3-positive cells, and dopaminergic neurons in these areas were visualized by simultaneous immunohistochemical detection of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity (TH-IR). Approximately 20% of ARC neurons containing TH-IR coexpressed tdTomato fluorescence, suggesting that RXFP3 can influence the dopamine pathway from the ARC to the pituitary gland that controls prolactin release. The ability of prolactin to reduce leptin sensitivity and increase food consumption therefore represents a potential mechanism by which RXFP3 activation influences feeding. A similar proportion of DMH neurons containing TH-IR expressed RXFP3-related tdTomato fluorescence, consistent with a possible RXFP3-mediated regulation of stress and neuroendocrine circuits. In contrast, RXFP3 was barely detected within the VTA. TdTomato signal was absent from the ARC and DMH in sections from Rosa26-tdTomato mice, suggesting that the cells identified in RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato mice expressed authentic RXFP3-related tdTomato fluorescence. Together, these findings identify potential hypothalamic mechanisms through which RXFP3 influences neuroendocrine control of metabolism, and further highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting RXFP3 in feeding-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This study decodes consumers' preference levels using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in neuromarketing. The classification accuracy in neuromarketing is a critical factor in evaluating the intentions of the consumers. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is utilized as a neuroimaging modality to measure the cerebral hemodynamic responses. In this study, a specific decoding structure, called CNN-based fNIRS-data analysis, was designed to achieve a high classification accuracy. Compared to other methods, the automated characteristics, constant training of the dataset, and learning efficiency of the proposed method are the main advantages. The experimental procedure required eight healthy participants (four female and four male) to view commercial advertisement videos of different durations (15, 30, and 60 s). The cerebral hemodynamic responses of the participants were measured. To compare the preference classification performances, CNN was utilized to extract the most common features, including the mean, peak, variance, kurtosis, and skewness. Considering three video durations, the average classification accuracies of 15, 30, and 60 s videos were 84.3, 87.9, and 86.4%, respectively. Among them, the classification accuracy of 87.9% for 30 s videos was the highest. The average classification accuracies of three preferences in females and males were 86.2 and 86.3%, respectively, showing no difference in each group. By comparing the classification performances in three different combinations (like vs. so-so, like vs. dislike, and so-so vs. dislike) between two groups, male participants were observed to have targeted preferences for commercial advertising, and the classification performance 88.4% between “like” vs. “dislike” out of three categories was the highest. Finally, pairwise classification performance are shown as follows: For female, 86.1% (like vs. so-so), 87.4% (like vs. dislike), 85.2% (so-so vs. dislike), and for male 85.7, 88.4, 85.1%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) is a neurodegenerative language disorder primarily characterized by impaired phonological processing. Sentence repetition and comprehension deficits are observed in lvPPA and linked to impaired phonological working memory, but recent evidence also implicates impaired speech perception. Currently, neural encoding of the speech envelope, which forms the scaffolding for perception, is not clearly understood in lvPPA. We leveraged recent analytical advances in electrophysiology to examine speech envelope encoding in lvPPA. We assessed cortical tracking of the speech envelope and in-task comprehension of two spoken narratives in individuals with lvPPA (n = 10) and age-matched (n = 10) controls. Despite markedly reduced narrative comprehension relative to controls, individuals with lvPPA had increased cortical tracking of the speech envelope in theta oscillations, which track low-level features (e.g., syllables), but not delta oscillations, which track speech units that unfold across a longer time scale (e.g., words, phrases, prosody). This neural signature was highly correlated across narratives. Results indicate an increased reliance on acoustic cues during speech encoding. This may reflect inefficient encoding of bottom-up speech cues, likely as a consequence of dysfunctional temporoparietal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a degenerative disease affecting language while leaving other cognitive facilities relatively unscathed. The agrammatic subtype of PPA (PPA-G) is characterized by agrammatic language production with impaired comprehension of noncanonical filler-gap syntactic structures, such as object-relatives [e.g., The sandwich that the girl ate (gap) was tasty], in which the filler (the sandwich) is displaced from the object position within the relative clause to a position preceding both the verb and the agent (the girl) and is replaced by a gap linked with the filler. One hypothesis suggests that the observed deficits of these structures reflect impaired thematic integration, including impaired prediction of the thematic role of the filler and impaired thematic integration at the gap, but spared structure building (i.e., creation of the gap). In the current study, we examined the on-line comprehension of object-relative and subject-relative clauses in healthy controls and individuals with agrammatic and logopenic PPA using eye-tracking. Eye-movement patterns in canonical subject-relative clause structures were essentially spared in both PPA groups. In contrast, eye-movement patterns in noncanonical object-relative clauses revealed delayed thematic prediction in both agrammatic and logopenic PPA, on-time structure building (i.e., gap-filling) in both groups, and abnormal thematic integration in agrammatic, but not logopenic, PPA. We argue that these results are consistent with the hypothesis that agrammatic comprehension deficits reflect impaired thematic integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional microcircuits are useful for studying interactions among neural dynamics of neighboring neurons during cognition and emotion. A functional microcircuit is a group of neurons that are spatially close, and that exhibit synchronized neural activities. For computational analysis, functional microcircuits are represented by graphs, which pose special challenges when applied as input to machine learning algorithms. Graph embedding, which involves the conversion of graph data into low dimensional vector spaces, is a general method for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we discuss limitations of conventional graph embedding methods that make them ill-suited to the study of functional microcircuits. We then develop a novel graph embedding framework, called Weighted Graph Embedding with Vertex Identity Awareness (WGEVIA), that overcomes these limitations. Additionally, we introduce a dataset, called the five vertices dataset, that helps in assessing how well graph embedding methods are suited to functional microcircuit analysis. We demonstrate the utility of WGEVIA through extensive experiments involving real and simulated microcircuit data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The imaging of neuronal activity using calcium indicators has become a staple of modern neuroscience. However, without ground truths, there is a real risk of missing a significant portion of the real responses. Here, we show that a common assumption, the non-negativity of the neuronal responses as detected by calcium indicators, biases all levels of the frequently used analytical methods for these data. From the extraction of meaningful fluorescence changes to spike inference and the analysis of inferred spikes, each step risks missing real responses because of the assumption of non-negativity. We first show that negative deviations from baseline can exist in calcium imaging of neuronal activity. Then, we use simulated data to test three popular algorithms for image analysis, CaImAn, suite2p, and CellSort, finding that suite2p may be the best suited to large datasets. We also tested the spike inference algorithms included in CaImAn, suite2p, and Cellsort, as well as the dedicated inference algorithms MLspike and CASCADE, and found each to have limitations in dealing with inhibited neurons. Among these spike inference algorithms, FOOPSI, from CaImAn, performed the best on inhibited neurons, but even this algorithm inferred spurious spikes upon the return of the fluorescence signal to baseline. As such, new approaches will be needed before spikes can be sensitively and accurately inferred from calcium data in inhibited neurons. We further suggest avoiding data analysis approaches that, by assuming non-negativity, ignore inhibited responses. Instead, we suggest a first exploratory step, using k-means or PCA for example, to detect whether meaningful negative deviations are present. Taking these steps will ensure that inhibition, as well as excitation, is detected in calcium imaging datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common in the elderly population. Obstructive sleep apnea that may cause significant changes in the cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid and T-tau and/or P-tau protein levels is often identified as a risk factor for development of AD. Although the underlying mechanisms of AD are still not fully understood, a hypothesis associating OSA with AD has been already proposed. In this systematic mini-review, we first discuss the recent findings supporting the association of OSA with an increased risk of AD and then provide evidence suggesting the positive effect of OSA treatment on a reduced risk of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Chemical graph generators are software packages to generate computer representations of chemical structures adhering to certain boundary conditions. Their development is a research topic of cheminformatics. Chemical graph generators are used in areas such as virtual library generation in drug design, in molecular design with specified properties, called inverse QSAR/QSPR, as well as in organic synthesis design, retrosynthesis or in systems for computer-assisted structure elucidation (CASE). CASE systems again have regained interest for the structure elucidation of unknowns in computational metabolomics, a current area of computational biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lsVjWfKyaMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Acute Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol prompts rapid changes in cannabinoid CB1 receptor immunolabeling and subcellular structure in CA1 hippocampus of young adult male mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fbcf6e6d-8902-428e-9ea0-aa94ae67d23e/cne25098-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute exposure to Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) significantly decreases cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor density at inhibitory terminals and mitochondria. Besides, dendrites are significantly larger, have more spines and contain more mitochondria. CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (arrows), inhibitory terminals (ter, red shading), mitochondria (m, purple shading), dendrites (blue shading), dendritic spines (sp, blue shading). Scale bars = 500 nm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use and abuse of cannabis can be associated with significant pathophysiology, however, it remains unclear whether (1) acute administration of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during early adulthood alters the cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor localization and expression in cells of the brain, and (2) THC produces structural brain changes. Here we use electron microscopy and a highly sensitive pre‐embedding immunogold method to examine CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the hippocampus cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) 30 min after male mice were exposed to a single THC injection (5 mg/kg). The findings show that acute exposure to THC can significantly decrease the percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor immunopositive terminals making symmetric synapses, mitochondria, and astrocytes. The percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses was unaffected. Lastly, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression was significantly lower at terminals of symmetric and asymmetric synapses as well as in mitochondria. Structurally, CA1 dendrites were significantly larger, and contained more spines and mitochondria following acute THC administration. The area of the dendritic spines, synaptic terminals, mitochondria, and astrocytes decreased significantly following acute THC exposure. Altogether, these results indicate that even a single THC exposure can have a significant impact on CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression, and can alter CA1 ultrastructure, within 30 min of drug exposure. These changes may contribute to the behavioral alterations experienced by young individuals shortly after cannabis intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Forebrain projection neurons target functionally diverse respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/942dd782-5e14-4e9b-afcd-0d151e8193c9/cne25091-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory motor activity can be modulated by higher brain inputs. We hypothesized that forebrain regions send descending inputs to the respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Our data imply that (a) volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the midbrain periaqueductal gray; (b) commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, whisking, swallowing) target the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, predominantly; and (c) limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream brainstem respiratory networks, including the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, and caudal raphé nuclei. We provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eupnea is generated by neural circuits located in the ponto‐medullary brainstem, but can be modulated by higher brain inputs which contribute to volitional control of breathing and the expression of orofacial behaviors, such as vocalization, sniffing, coughing, and swallowing. Surprisingly, the anatomical organization of descending inputs that connect the forebrain with the brainstem respiratory network remains poorly defined. We hypothesized that descending forebrain projections target multiple distributed respiratory control nuclei across the neuroaxis. To test our hypothesis, we made discrete unilateral microinjections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus (KFn), the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, or caudal midline raphé nuclei. We quantified the regional distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the forebrain 12–14 days postinjection. Overall, our data reveal that descending inputs from cortical areas predominantly target the PAG and KFn. Differential forebrain regions innervating the PAG (prefrontal, cingulate cortices, and lateral septum) and KFn (rhinal, piriform, and somatosensory cortices) imply that volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the PAG, while the KFn may receive commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, swallowing). Additionally, we observed that the limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream bulbar respiratory networks. Collectively, these data provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in profound neurologic impairment with widespread deficits in sensorimotor and autonomic systems. Voluntary and autonomic control of bladder function is disrupted resulting in possible detrusor overactivity, low compliance, and uncoordinated bladder and external urethral sphincter contractions impairing storage and/or voiding. Conservative treatments managing neurogenic bladder post-injury, such as oral pharmacotherapy and catheterization, are important components of urological surveillance and clinical care. However, as urinary complications continue to impact long-term morbidity in this population, additional therapeutic and rehabilitative approaches are needed that aim to improve function by targeting the recovery of underlying impairments. Several human and animal studies, including our previously published reports, have documented gains in bladder function due to activity-based recovery strategies, such as locomotor training. Furthermore, epidural stimulation of the spinal cord (scES) combined with intense activity-based recovery training has been shown to produce volitional lower extremity movement, standing, as well as improve the regulation of cardiovascular function. In our center, several participants anecdotally reported improvements in bladder function as a result of training with epidural stimulation configured for motor systems. Thus, in this study, the effects of activity-based recovery training in combination with scES were tested on bladder function, resulting in improvements in overall bladder storage parameters relative to a control cohort (no intervention). However, elevated blood pressure elicited during bladder distention, characteristic of autonomic dysreflexia, was not attenuated with training. We then examined, in a separate, large cross-sectional cohort, the interaction between detrusor pressure and blood pressure at maximum capacity, and found that the functional relationship between urinary bladder distention and blood pressure regulation is disrupted. Regardless of one’s bladder emptying method (indwelling suprapubic catheter vs. intermittent catheterization), autonomic instability can play a critical role in the ability to improve bladder storage, with SCI enhancing the vesico-vascular reflex. These results support the role of intersystem stimulation, integrating scES for both bladder and cardiovascular function to further improve bladder storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A key challenge in developmental neuroscience is identifying the local regulatory mechanisms that control neurite and synaptic refinement over large brain volumes. Innovative molecular techniques and high-resolution imaging tools are beginning to reshape our view of how local protein translation in subcellular compartments drives axonal, dendritic, and synaptic development and plasticity. Here we review recent progress in three areas of neurite and synaptic study in situ—compartment-specific transcriptomics/translatomics, targeted proteomics, and super-resolution imaging analysis of synaptic organization and development. We discuss synergies between sequencing and imaging techniques for the discovery and validation of local molecular signaling mechanisms regulating synaptic development, plasticity, and maintenance in circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There are growing indications for the involvement of calcium stores in the plastic properties of neurons and particularly in dendritic spines of central neurons. The store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels are assumed to be activated by the calcium sensor stromal interaction molecule (STIM)which leads to activation of its associated Orai channel. There are two STIM species, and the differential role of the two in SOCE is not entirely clear. In the present study, we were able to distinguish between transfected STIM1, which is more mobile primarily in young neurons, and STIM2 which is less mobile and more prominent in older neurons in culture. STIM1 mobility is associated with spontaneous calcium sparks, local transient rise in cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and in the formation and elongation of dendritic filopodia/spines. In contrast, STIM2 is associated with older neurons, where it is mobile and moves into dendritic spines primarily when cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; levels are reduced, apparently to activate resident Orai channels. These results highlight a role for STIM1 in the regulation of [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; fluctuations associated with the formation of dendritic spines or filopodia in the developing neuron, whereas STIM2 is associated with the maintenance of calcium entry into stores in the adult neuron.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nedd4 family interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1) is an adaptor of Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligases. Experimental results showed that Ndfip1 had a potential neuroprotective effect in neurology diseases. However, the neuroprotective effect and the underlying mechanisms of Ndfip1 in Parkinson's disease (PD) have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we explored the neuroprotective effect of Ndfip1 against mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone in a human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line and further elucidated its possible underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that rotenone could induce the up-regulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in both mRNA and protein levels. The expression of Ndfip1 decreased at 24 h after rotenone treatment. Further study showed that high expression of Ndfip1 could protect SH-SY5Y cells against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity and antagonize the rotenone-induced increase in α-syn protein levels. In addition, high expression of Ndfip1 inhibited rotenone-induced increase in the protein levels of caspase-3 and decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Further study showed that Ndfip1 did not affect the protein expression of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), while antagonized the increase in protein levels of P62 and ferritin L caused by rotenone. Our findings provide specific identification of Ndfip1 proteins to inhibit the increase of α-syn in rotenone-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Ndfip1 might be a new theoretical drug target for the prevention and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Due to its rarity, coupled to a multifactorial and very heterogeneous nature, the molecular etiology of Arnold-Chiari (AC) syndrome remains almost totally unknown. Its relationship with other neuropsychiatric disorders such as Tourette syndrome (TS) is also undetermined. The rare comorbid status between both disorders (ACTS) complicates the framework of diagnosis and negatively affects the patients' quality of life. In this exploratory study, we aimed to identify serum microRNA expression profiles as molecular fingerprints for AC, TS, and ACTS, by using a high-throughput approach. For this aim, 10 AC patients, 11 ACTS patients, 6 TS patients, and 8 unaffected controls (NC) were recruited. Nine miRNAs resulted significantly differentially expressed (DE): let-7b-5p (upregulated in ACTS vs. TS); miR-21-5p (upregulated in ACTS vs. AC; downregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-23a-3p (upregulated in TS vs. NCs; downregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-25-3p (upregulated in AC vs. TS and NCs; downregulated in ACTS vs. AC); miR-93-5p (upregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-130a-3p (downregulated in ACTS and TS vs. NCs); miR-144-3p (downregulated in ACTS vs. AC; upregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-222-3p (upregulated in ACTS vs. NCs); miR-451a (upregulated in AC vs. TS and NCs; in ACTS vs. NCs). Altered expression of miRNAs was statistically correlated to neuroimaging and neuropsychological anomalies. Furthermore, computational analyses indicated that DE miRNAs are involved in AC and TS pathomechanisms. Finally, we propose the dysregulation of the miRNA set as a potential molecular tool for supporting the current diagnosis of AC, TS, and ACTS by using liquid biopsies, in an unbiased and non-invasive way.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of small fibres is gaining attention in the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies, such as diabetes mellitus, and pain research. However, it is still challenging to characterise the electrical characteristics of axons in small fibres (Aδ and C fibres). In particular, in vitro measurement for human Aδ-fibre is difficult due to the presence of myelin and ethical reason. In this study, we investigate the in vivo electrical characteristics of the human Aδ-fibre to derive strength–duration (S–D) curves from the measurement. The Aδ-fibres are stimulated using coaxial planar electrodes with intraepidermal needle tip. For human volunteer experiments, the S–D curve of Aδ-fibre is obtained in terms of injected electrical current. With the computational analysis, the standard deviation of the S–D curve is mostly attributed to the thickness of the stratum corneum and depth of the needle tip, in addition to the fibre thickness. Then, we derive electrical parameters of the axon in the Aδ-fibre based on a conventional fibre model. The parameters derived here would be important in exploring the optimal stimulation condition of Aδ-fibres.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Neurofeedback training (NFT) has recently been proposed as a valuable technique for cognitive enhancement and psychiatric amelioration. However, effect of NFT of alpha activity on memory is controversial. The current study analyzed previous works in terms of randomized and blinded analyses, training paradigms, and participant characteristics to validate the efficacy of alpha NFT on memory in a healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: A systematic meta-analysis of studies with randomized controlled trials was performed to explore the effect of alpha NFT on working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM) in a healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from January 1, 1999, to November 30, 2019. Previous studies were evaluated with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB). A meta-analysis calculating absolute weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) using random-effects models was employed. Heterogeneity was estimated using I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistics. Funnel plots and Egger's test were performed to evaluate the quality of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Sixteen studies with 217 healthy participants in the control group and 210 participants in the alpha group met the eligibility criteria. Alpha NFT studies with WM measures presented little publication bias (P = 0.116), and 5 of 7 domains in the Cochrane RoB exhibited a low risk of bias. The overall effect size from 14 WM studies was 0.56 (95% CI 0.31–0.81, P &amp;lt; 0.0001; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 28%). Six EM studies exhibited an effect size of 0.77 (95% CI 0.06–1.49, P = 0.03; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 77%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Meta-analysis results suggest that alpha NFT seems to have a positive effect on the WM and EM of healthy participants. Future efforts should focus on the neurophysiological mechanisms of alpha NFT in memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems enable an alternative communication channel for severely-motor disabled patients to interact with their environment using no muscular movements. In recent years, the importance of research into non-gaze dependent brain-computer interface paradigms has been increasing, in contrast to the most frequently studied BCI-based speller paradigm (i.e., row-column presentation, RCP). Several visual modifications that have already been validated under the RCP paradigm for communication purposes have not been validated under the most extended non-gaze dependent rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. Thus, in the present study, three different sets of stimuli were assessed under RSVP, with the following communication features: white letters (WL), famous faces (FF), neutral pictures (NP). Eleven healthy subjects participated in this experiment, in which the subjects had to go through a calibration phase, an online phase and, finally, a subjective questionnaire completion phase. The results showed that the FF and NP stimuli promoted better performance in the calibration and online phases, being slightly better in the FF paradigm. Regarding the subjective questionnaires, again both FF and NP were preferred by the participants in contrast to the WL stimuli, but this time the NP stimuli scored slightly higher. These findings suggest that the use of FF and NP for RSVP-based spellers could be beneficial to increase information transfer rate in comparison to the most frequently used letter-based stimuli and could represent a promising communication system for individuals with altered ocular-motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Modeling the dynamics of neural masses is a common approach in the study of neural populations. Various models have been proven useful to describe a plenitude of empirical observations including self-sustained local oscillations and patterns of distant synchronization. We discuss the extent to which mass models really resemble the mean dynamics of a neural population. In particular, we question the validity of neural mass models if the population under study comprises a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are densely (inter-)connected. Starting from a network of noisy leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, we formulated two different population dynamics that both fall into the category of seminal Freeman neural mass models. The derivations contained several mean-field assumptions and time scale separation(s) between membrane and synapse dynamics. Our comparison of these neural mass models with the averaged dynamics of the population reveals bounds in the fraction of excitatory/inhibitory neuron as well as overall network degree for a mass model to provide adequate estimates. For substantial parameter ranges, our models fail to mimic the neural network's dynamics proper, be that in de-synchronized or in (high-frequency) synchronized states. Only around the onset of low-frequency synchronization our models provide proper estimates of the mean potential dynamics. While this shows their potential for, e.g., studying resting state dynamics obtained by encephalography with focus on the transition region, we must accept that predicting the more general dynamic outcome of a neural network via its mass dynamics requires great care.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death today. The current identification method of the diseases is analyzing the Electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a medical monitoring technology recording cardiac activity. Unfortunately, looking for experts to analyze a large amount of ECG data consumes too many medical resources. Therefore, the method of identifying ECG characteristics based on machine learning has gradually become prevalent. However, there are some drawbacks to these typical methods, requiring manual feature recognition, complex models, and long training time. This paper proposes a robust and efficient 12-layer deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network on classifying the five micro-classes of heartbeat types in the MIT- BIH Arrhythmia database. The five types of heartbeat features are classified, and wavelet self-adaptive threshold denoising method is used in the experiments. Compared with BP neural network, random forest, and other CNN networks, the results show that the model proposed in this paper has better performance in accuracy, sensitivity, robustness, and anti-noise capability. Its accurate classification effectively saves medical resources, which has a positive effect on clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Until recently, the visualization of cerebral microvessels was hampered by the fact that only short segments of vessels could be evaluated in brain sections by histochemistry. These limitations have been overcome by light sheet microscopy, which allows the 3D analysis of microvasculature in cleared brains. A major limitation of light sheet microscopy is that antibodies do not sufficiently penetrate cleared brains. We herein describe a technique of reverse clearing and rehydration, which after microvascular network analysis allows brain sectioning and immunohistochemistry employing a broad set of antibodies. Performing light sheet microscopy on brains of mice exposed to intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we show that in the early phase of microvascular remodeling branching point density was markedly reduced, more strongly than microvascular length. Brain infarcts in light sheet microscopy were sharply demarcated by their autofluorescence signal, closely corresponding to brain infarcts revealed by Nissl staining. Neuronal survival, leukocyte infiltration, and astrocytic reactivity could be evaluated by immunohistochemistry in rehydrated brains, as shown in direct comparisons with non-cleared brains. Immunohistochemistry revealed microthrombi in ischemic microvessels that were likely responsible for the marked branching point loss. The balance between microvascular thrombosis and remodeling warrants further studies at later time-points after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The topological organization of human brain networks can be mathematically characterized by the connectivity degree distribution of network nodes. However, there is no clear consensus on whether the topological structure of brain networks follows a power law or other probability distributions, and whether it is altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we employed resting-state functional MRI and graph theory approaches to investigate the fitting of degree distributions of the whole-brain functional networks and seven subnetworks in healthy subjects and individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), i.e., the prodromal stage of AD, and whether they are altered and correlated with cognitive performance in patients. Forty-one elderly cognitively healthy controls and 30 aMCI subjects were included. We constructed functional connectivity matrices among brain voxels and examined nodal degree distributions that were fitted by maximum likelihood estimation. In the whole-brain networks and all functional subnetworks, the connectivity degree distributions were fitted better by the Weibull distribution [f(x)~x&lt;sup&gt;(β−1)&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;(−λx&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;] than power law or power law with exponential cutoff. Compared with the healthy control group, the aMCI group showed lower Weibull β parameters (shape factor) in both the whole-brain networks and all seven subnetworks (false-discovery rate-corrected, p &amp;lt; 0.05). These decreases of the Weibull β parameters in the whole-brain networks and all subnetworks except for ventral attention were associated with reduced cognitive performance in individuals with aMCI. Thus, we provided a short-tailed model to capture intrinsic connectivity structure of the human brain functional networks in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus and parahippocampal region are essential for representing episodic memories involving various spatial locations and objects, and for using those memories for future adaptive behavior. The “dual‐stream model” was initially formulated based on anatomical characteristics of the medial temporal lobe, dividing the parahippocampal region into two streams that separately process and relay spatial and nonspatial information to the hippocampus. Despite its significance, the dual‐stream model in its original form cannot explain recent experimental results, and many researchers have recognized the need for a modification of the model. Here, we argue that dividing the parahippocampal region into spatial and nonspatial streams a priori may be too simplistic, particularly in light of ambiguous situations in which a sensory cue alone (e.g., visual scene) may not allow such a definitive categorization. Upon reviewing evidence, including our own, that reveals the importance of goal‐directed behavioral responses in determining the relative involvement of the parahippocampal processing streams, we propose the Goal‐directed Interaction of Stimulus and Task‐demand (GIST) model. In the GIST model, input stimuli such as visual scenes and objects are first processed by both the postrhinal and perirhinal cortices—the postrhinal cortex more heavily involved with visual scenes and perirhinal cortex with objects—with relatively little dependence on behavioral task demand. However, once perceptual ambiguities are resolved and the scenes and objects are identified and recognized, the information is then processed through the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, depending on whether it is used to fulfill navigational or non‐navigational goals, respectively. As complex sensory stimuli are utilized for both navigational and non‐navigational purposes in an intermixed fashion in naturalistic settings, the hippocampus may be required to then put together these experiences into a coherent map to allow flexible cognitive operations for adaptive behavior to occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Satyajit D Rao, Oleg A Igoshin&lt;/p&gt;

Bacteria use two-component systems (TCSs) to sense environmental conditions and change gene expression in response to those conditions. To amplify cellular responses, many bacterial TCSs are under positive feedback control, i.e. increase their expression when activated. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; -sensing TCS, PhoPQ, in addition to the positive feedback, includes a negative feedback loop via the upregulation of the MgrB protein that inhibits PhoQ. How the interplay of these feedback loops shapes steady-state and dynamical responses of PhoPQ TCS to change in Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; remains poorly understood. In particular, how the presence of MgrB feedback affects the robustness of PhoPQ response to overexpression of TCS is unclear. It is also unclear why the steady-state response to decreasing Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is biphasic, i.e. plateaus over a range of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations, and then increases again at growth-limiting Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to identify potential mechanisms behind these experimentally observed dynamical properties. The results make experimentally testable predictions for the regime with response robustness and propose a novel explanation of biphasic response constraining the mechanisms for modulation of PhoQ activity by Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and MgrB. Finally, we show how the interplay of positive and negative feedback loops affects the network’s steady-state sensitivity and response dynamics. In the absence of MgrB feedback, the model predicts oscillations thereby suggesting a general mechanism of oscillatory or pulsatile dynamics in autoregulated TCSs. These results improve the understanding of TCS signaling and other networks with overlaid positive and negative feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6fQ4zBAtcQo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Lyme carditis is an extracutaneous manifestation of Lyme disease characterized by episodes of atrioventricular block of varying degrees and additional, less reported cardiomyopathies. The molecular changes associated with the response to &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; over the course of infection are poorly understood. Here, we identify broad transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the heart during infection that reveal a profound down-regulation of mitochondrial components. We also describe the long-term functional modulation of macrophages exposed to live bacteria, characterized by an augmented glycolytic output, increased spirochetal binding and internalization, and reduced inflammatory responses. In vitro, glycolysis inhibition reduces the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by memory macrophages, whereas in vivo, it produces the reversion of the memory phenotype, the recovery of tissue mitochondrial components, and decreased inflammation and spirochetal burdens. These results show that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; induces long-term, memory-like responses in macrophages with tissue-wide consequences that are amenable to be manipulated in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PAFlA8PjHxs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>
