The strength and breadth of an individual’s antibody repertoire is an important predictor of their response to influenza infection or vaccination. Although progress has been made in understanding qualitatively how repeated exposures shape the antibody mediated immune response, quantitative understanding remains limited. We developed a set of mathematical models describing short-term antibody kinetics following influenza infection or vaccination and fit them to haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres from 5 groups of ferrets which were exposed to different combinations of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV with or without adjuvant), A/H3N2 priming inoculation and post-vaccination A/H1N1 inoculation. We fit models with various immunological mechanisms that have been empirically observed but have not previously been included in mathematical models of antibody landscapes, including; titre ceiling effects, antigenic seniority and exposure-type specific cross reactivity. Based on the parameter estimates of the best supported models, we describe a number of key immunological features. We found quantifiable differences in the degree of homologous and cross-reactive antibody boosting elicited by different exposure types. Infection and adjuvanted vaccination generally resulted in strong, broadly reactive responses whereas unadjuvanted vaccination resulted in a weak, narrow response. We found that the order of exposure mattered: priming with A/H3N2 improved subsequent vaccine response, and the second dose of adjuvanted vaccination resulted in substantially greater antibody boosting than the first. Either antigenic seniority or a titre ceiling effect were included in the two best fitting models, suggesting a role for a mechanism describing diminishing antibody boosting with repeated exposures. Although there was considerable uncertainty in our estimates of antibody waning parameters, our results suggest that both short and long term waning were present and would be identifiable with a larger set of experiments. These results highlight the potential use of repeat exposure animal models in revealing short-term, strain-specific immune dynamics of influenza.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/of7eQ7vA7z4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The Long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) is a primary source of genetic variation in humans and other mammals. Despite its importance, LINE-1 activity remains difficult to study because of its highly repetitive nature. Here, we developed and validated a method called TeXP to gauge LINE-1 activity accurately. TeXP builds mappability signatures from LINE-1 subfamilies to deconvolve the effect of pervasive transcription from autonomous LINE-1 activity. In particular, it apportions the multiple reads aligned to the many LINE-1 instances in the genome into these two categories. Using our method, we evaluated well-established cell lines, cell-line compartments and healthy tissues and found that the vast majority (91.7%) of transcriptome reads overlapping LINE-1 derive from pervasive transcription. We validated TeXP by independently estimating the levels of LINE-1 autonomous transcription using ddPCR, finding high concordance. Next, we applied our method to comprehensively measure LINE-1 activity across healthy somatic cells, while backing out the effect of pervasive transcription. Unexpectedly, we found that LINE-1 activity is present in many normal somatic cells. This finding contrasts with earlier studies showing that LINE-1 has limited activity in healthy somatic tissues, except for neuroprogenitor cells. Interestingly, we found that the amount of LINE-1 activity was associated with the with the amount of cell turnover, with tissues with low cell turnover rates (e.g. the adult central nervous system) showing lower LINE-1 activity. Altogether, our results show how accounting for pervasive transcription is critical to accurately quantify the activity of highly repetitive regions of the human genome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fVCUaG21g3A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

RNA-protein interaction plays important roles in post-transcriptional regulation. Recent advancements in cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq) technologies make it possible to detect the binding peaks of a given RNA binding protein (RBP) at transcriptome scale. However, it is still challenging to predict the functional consequences of RBP binding peaks. In this study, we propose the Protein-RNA Association Strength (PRAS), which integrates the intensities and positions of the binding peaks of RBPs for functional mRNA targets prediction. We illustrate the superiority of PRAS over existing approaches on predicting the functional targets of two related but divergent CELF (CUGBP, ELAV-like factor) RBPs in mouse brain and muscle. We also demonstrate the potential of PRAS for wide adoption by applying it to the enhanced CLIP-seq (eCLIP) datasets of 37 RNA decay related RBPs in two human cell lines. PRAS can be utilized to investigate any RBPs with available CLIP-seq peaks. PRAS is freely available at http://ouyanglab.jax.org/pras/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vt6p9-oazJE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Astrocytes, a glial cell type of the central nervous system, have emerged as detectors and regulators of neuronal information processing. Astrocyte excitability resides in transient variations of free cytosolic calcium concentration over a range of temporal and spatial scales, from sub-microdomains to waves propagating throughout the cell. Despite extensive experimental approaches, it is not clear how these signals are transmitted to and integrated within an astrocyte. The localization of the main molecular actors and the geometry of the system, including the spatial organization of calcium channels &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;, are deemed essential. However, as most calcium signals occur in astrocytic ramifications that are too fine to be resolved by conventional light microscopy, most of those spatial data are unknown and computational modeling remains the only methodology to study this issue. Here, we propose an &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-mediated calcium signaling model for dynamics in such small sub-cellular volumes. To account for the expected stochasticity and low copy numbers, our model is both spatially explicit and particle-based. Extensive simulations show that spontaneous calcium signals arise in the model via the interplay between excitability and stochasticity. The model reproduces the main forms of calcium signals and indicates that their frequency crucially depends on the spatial organization of the &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; channels. Importantly, we show that two processes expressing exactly the same calcium channels can display different types of calcium signals depending on the spatial organization of the channels. Our model with realistic process volume and calcium concentrations successfully reproduces spontaneous calcium signals that we measured in calcium micro-domains with confocal microscopy and predicts that local variations of calcium indicators might contribute to the diversity of calcium signals observed in astrocytes. To our knowledge, this model is the first model suited to investigate calcium dynamics in fine astrocytic processes and to propose plausible mechanisms responsible for their variability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NfQm5wwQpeI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One of the basic frameworks in science views behavioral products as a process
within a dynamic system. The mechanism might be seen as a representation of
many instances of centralized control in real time. Many real systems, however,
exhibit autonomy by denying statically treated mechanisms. This study addresses
the issues related to the identification of dynamic systems and suggests how
determining the basic principles of a collective structure may be key to
understanding complex behavioral processes. A fundamental model is derived to
assess the advantages of this perspective using a basic methodology. The
connection between perspective and technique demonstrates certain aspects
within their actual context, while also clearly including the framework of
actual dynamic system identification.

 &lt;p&gt;There is an increasing interest in the systematic disagreement about
profoundly ambiguous stimuli in the color domain. However, this research has
been hobbled by the fact that we could not create such stimuli at will. Here,
we describe a design principle that allows the creation of such stimuli and
apply this principle to create one such stimulus set - the crocs and socks.
Using this set, we probed the color perception of a large sample of observers,
showing that these stimuli are indeed categorically ambiguous and that we can
predict the percept from fabric priors resulting from experience. We also
relate the perception of these crocs to other color-ambiguous stimuli - the
dress and the sneaker and conclude that differential priors likely underlie
polarized disagreement in cognition more generally.

 OBJECTIVE： To assist clinicians to operate repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) precisely based on the coil magnetic field spatial distribution with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Navigation.
METHODS: A fast method for calculating electromagnetic fields in layered brain structures in frequency domain was proposed. By approaching Bessel function in different intervals, the integral with a highly oscillatory kernel was transformed into two parts: a definite integral and a weakened oscillatory one. The distribution of induced current density and magnetic field intensity of rTMS stimulation effect on brain was quantitatively calculated, so that clinicians could intuitively grasp the safe range of coil stimulation on brain. Then, the crucial factor of the stimulation effect of rTMS was determined, and an accurate coil positioning of the rTMS efficiently was completed.            
Result: The maximal attenuation of induced electric field and magnetic induction intensity was 72.20% and 86.867% at 3 cm away from the skin in the brain layered model. The clinical examination results of electric field intensity distribution, magnetic field intensity distribution, current density distribution, layered brain modeling and coil location speed in the brain model teaching group were significantly higher than those in the traditional teaching group (P &amp;lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: It is suitable for clinicians to quickly complete the precise positioning of rTMS, master the adjustment of coil stimulation therapeutic parameters, and realize the precise positioning operation of rTMS with MRI navigation in intracranial.</content>

		<content type="html">
 According to the prevailing 'clock' model, chromosome decondensation and nuclear envelope reformation when cells exit mitosis are byproducts of Cdk1 inactivation at the metaphase-anaphase transition, controlled by the spindle assembly checkpoint. However, mitotic exit was recently shown to be a function of chromosome separation during anaphase, assisted by a midzone Aurora B phosphorylation gradient - the 'ruler' model. Here we found that Cdk1 remains active during anaphase due to ongoing APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdc20&lt;/sup&gt;- and APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated degradation of B-type Cyclins in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and human cells. Failure to degrade B-type Cyclins during anaphase prevented mitotic exit in a Cdk1-dependent manner. Cyclin B1-Cdk1 localized at the spindle midzone in an Aurora B-dependent manner, with incompletely separated chromosomes showing the highest Cdk1 activity. Slowing down anaphase chromosome motion delayed Cyclin B1 degradation and mitotic exit in an Aurora B-dependent manner. Thus, a crosstalk between molecular 'rulers' and 'clocks' licenses mitotic exit only after proper chromosome separation.</content>

 Little is known about enteropathogen seroepidemiology among children in low-resource settings. We measured serological IgG responses to eight enteropathogens (&lt;i&gt;Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;, enterotoxigenic &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt;, norovirus) in cohorts from Haiti, Kenya, and Tanzania. We studied antibody dynamics and force of infection across pathogens and cohorts. Enteropathogens shared common seroepidemiologic features that enabled between-pathogen comparisons of transmission. Overall, exposure was intense: for most pathogens the window of primary infection was &amp;lt;3 years old; for highest transmission pathogens primary infection occurred within the first year. Longitudinal profiles demonstrated significant IgG boosting and waning above seropositivity cutoffs, underscoring the value of longitudinal designs to estimate force of infection. Seroprevalence and force of infection were rank-preserving across pathogens, illustrating the measures provide similar information about transmission heterogeneity. Our findings suggest antibody response can be used to measure population-level transmission of diverse enteropathogens in serologic surveillance.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have only investigated age-related differences in emotional processing and encoding in response to, not in anticipation of, emotional stimuli. In the current study, we investigated age-related differences in the impact of emotional anticipation on affective responses and episodic memory for emotional images. Young and older adults were scanned while encoding negative and neutral images preceded by cues that were either valid or invalid predictors of image valence. Participants were asked to rate the emotional intensity of the images and to complete a recognition task. Using multivariate behavioral partial least squares (PLS) analysis, we found that greater anticipatory recruitment of the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and hippocampus in older adults predicted reduced memory for negative than neutral images and the opposite for young adults. Seed PLS analysis further showed that following negative cues older adults, but not young adults, exhibited greater activation of vmPFC, reduced activation of amygdala, and worse memory for negative compared with neutral images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that the “positivity effect” seen in older adults’ memory performance may be related to the spontaneous emotional suppression of negative affect in anticipation of, not just in response to, negative stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 In recent years aberrant neural oscillations in various cortical areas have emerged as a common physiological hallmark across mouse models of amyloid pathology and patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, much less is known about the underlying effect of amyloid pathology on single cell activity. Here, we used high density silicon probe recordings from frontal cortex area of 9 months old APP/PS1 mice to show that resting state Local Field Potential (LFP) power in the theta and beta band is increased in transgenic animals, while single cell firing rates, specifically of putative pyramidal cells, are significantly reduced. At the same time, these sparsely firing pyramidal cells phase-lock their spiking activity more strongly to the ongoing theta and beta rhythms. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anti-epileptic drug, levetiracetam, can restore principal cell firing rates back to control levels. Overall, our results highlight reduced firing rates of cortical pyramidal cells as a symptom of amyloid pathology and indicate that lifting cortical inhibition might contribute to the beneficial effects of levetiracetam on AD patients.</content>

 Aims: First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients who use cannabis experience more frequent psychotic and euphoric intoxication experiences compared to controls. It is not clear whether this is consequent to patients being more vulnerable to the effects of cannabis use or to their heavier pattern of use. We aimed to determine whether extent of use predicted psychotic-like and euphoric intoxication experiences in FEP patients and controls and whether this differs between groups. Methods: We analysed data on lifetime cannabis using patients (n=655) and controls (n=654) across 15 sites from six countries in the EU-GEI study (2010-2015). We used multiple regression to model predictors of cannabis-induced experiences and to determine if there was an interaction between caseness and extent of use. Results: Caseness, frequency of cannabis use and money spent on cannabis predicted psychotic-like and euphoric experiences, independent of other experiences (p[≤]0.001). For psychotic-like experiences there was a significant interaction for caseness x frequency of use (p&amp;lt;0.001) and caseness x money spent on cannabis (p=0.001) such that FEP patients had increased experiences at increased levels of use compared to controls. There was no similar significant interaction for euphoric experiences (p&amp;gt;0.5). Conclusions and Relevance: FEP patients are particularly sensitive to increased psychotic-like, but not euphoric experiences, at higher frequency and amount of cannabis use compared to controls. This suggests a specific psychotomimetic response in patients related particularly to heavy cannabis use.</content>

 Thanks to the advancements in multichannel intracranial neural recordings, magnetic neuroimaging and magnetic neurostimulation techniques (including magnetogenetics), it is now possible to perform large-scale high-throughput neural recordings while imaging or controlling neural activity in a magnetic field. Analysis of neural recordings performed in a switching magnetic field, however, is not a trivial task as gradient and pulse artefacts interfere with the unit isolation. Here we introduce a toolbox called PASER, Processing and Analysis Schemes for Extracellular Recordings, that performs automated denoising, artefact removal, quality control of electrical recordings, unit classification and visualization. PASER is written in MATLAB and modular by design. The current version integrates with third party applications to provide additional functionality, including data import, spike sorting and the analysis of local field potentials. After the description of the toolbox, we evaluate 9 different spike sorting algorithms based on computational cost, unit yield, unit quality and clustering reliability across varying conditions including self-blurring and noise-reversal. Implementation of the best performing spike sorting algorithm (KiloSort) in the default version of the PASER provides the end user with a fully automated pipeline for quantitative analysis of broadband extracellular signals. PASER can be integrated with any established pipeline that sample neural activity with intracranial electrodes. Unlike the existing algorithmic solutions, PASER provides an end-to-end solution for neural recordings made in switching magnetic fields independent from the number of electrodes and the duration of recordings, thus enables high-throughput analysis of neural activity in a wide range of electro-magnetic recording conditions.</content>

 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a major public health burden but translating promising treatment findings from preclinical non-human models of ASD to the clinic has remained challenging. The recent development of forebrain organoids generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from subjects with brain disorders is a promising method to study human-specific neurobiology, and may facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. In this study, we utilized forebrain organoids generated from hiPSCs derived from patients from the Old Order Amish community with a rare syndromic form of ASD, carrying a homozygous c.3709DelG mutation in CNTNAP2 and healthy controls to investigate the effects of this mutation on cortical embryonic development. Patients carrying the c.3709DelG mutation in CNTNAP2 present with an increased head circumference and brain MRI reveals an increase in gray matter volume. Patient-derived organoids displayed an increase in total volume that was driven by an increased proliferation in neural progenitor cells, leading to an increase in the generation of cortical neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. The observed phenotypes were rescued after correction of the pathogenic mutation using CRISPR-Cas9. RNA sequencing revealed 339 genes differentially expressed between patient- and control-derived organoids of which a subset are implicated in cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Notably, these differentially expressed genes included previously identified ASD-associated genes and are enriched for genes in ASD-associated weighted gene co-expression networks. This work provides a critical step towards understanding the role of CNTNAP2 in human cortical development and has important mechanistic implications for ASD associated with brain overgrowth. This CNTNAP2 organoid model provides opportunity for further mechanistic inquiry and development of new therapeutic strategies for ASD.</content>

 Objective: the current epilepsy classification is primarily clinical driven and lacks a mechanistic basis. A mechanistic basis of the classification, and within the classification especially the etiology layer, may help to better understand epilepsy and the associated comorbidities. It may also be helpful in guiding epilepsy treatment. With this study we aimed to investigate if there is a modelled mechanistic underpinning for the etiological epilepsy classification by assessing the association between epilepsy etiology and brain network topology. Methods: to that aim we assessed the association between epilepsy etiology and brain network topology. We included children referred to our outpatient first seizure clinic with suspected epilepsy who had a standard interictal EEG recording. From these EEGs, functional networks were constructed based on eyes-closed resting state time-series. Networks were characterized using measures of segregation, integration, centrality, and network strength. Principal component analyses were used to assess whether patients with epilepsy of similar etiology cluster together based on their functional brain network topology. Results: in total, 228 children with epilepsy were included. Another 402 children served as control subjects. We were not able to detect a correlation between epilepsy etiology and functional brain network topology. We also did not find a difference in brain network topology between the controls and patients with epilepsy. Conclusions: our results do not support the presence of a brain network underpinning for the etiological epilepsy classification. This may support the hypothesis that brain network abnormalities in epilepsy are a result of ongoing seizure activity rather than the epilepsy etiology itself. Further in-depth analyses of network measures and longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.</content>

 French accentuation is held to belong to the level of the phrase. Consequently French is considered  a language without accent with speakers that are 'deaf to stress'. Recent ERP-studies investigating the French initial accent (IA) however demonstrate listeners not only discriminate between different stress patterns, but also expect words to be marked with I A early in the process of speech comprehension. Still, as words were presented in isolation, it remains unclear whether the preference applied to the lexical or to the phrasal level. In the current ERP-study, we address this ambiguity and manipulate IA on words embedded in a sentence. Furthermore, we orthogonally manipulate semantic congruity to investigate the interplay between accentuation and later speech processing stages. Results reveal a early fronto-centrally located negative deflection when words are presented without IA. Furthermore, we found an effect of semantic congruity in the centro-parietal region (the traditional region for N400), which was bigger for words without IA than for words with IA. Finally, we observed an interaction between metrical structure and semantic congruity such that the presence of IA continued to modulate N400 amplitude, but only in the sentences that were semantically incongruent. As participants attended to the semantic content of the sentences, the finding underlines the automaticity of stress processing and indicates that IA is encoded at a lexical level where it facilitates semantic processing.</content>

		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/738906v1?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Sensory perception can be modulated by the phase of neural oscillations, especially in the theta and alpha ranges. Oscillatory activity in the visual cortex can be entrained by transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) as well as periodic visual stimulation (i.e., flicker). Combined tACS and visual flicker stimulation modulates blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses and concurrent 4 Hz auditory click-trains and tACS modulates auditory perception in a phase-dependent way. Objective: In the present study, we investigated if phase synchrony between concurrent tACS and periodic visual stimulation (i.e., flicker) can modulate performance on a visual matching task. Methods: Participants completed a visual matching task on a flickering visual stimulus while receiving either in-phase (0 degree) or asynchronous (180, 90, or 270 degrees) tACS at alpha or theta frequency. Stimulation was applied over either occipital cortex or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Results: Visual performance was significantly better during theta frequency tACS over the visual cortex when it was in-phase (0 degree) with visual stimulus flicker, compared to anti-phase (180 degree). This effect did not appear with alpha frequency flicker or with DLPFC stimulation. Furthermore, a control sham group showed no effect. There were no significant performance differences amongst the asynchronous (180, 90, and 270 degrees) phase conditions. Conclusion: Extending previous studies on visual and auditory perception, our results support a crucial role of oscillatory phase in sensory perception and demonstrate a behaviourally relevant combination of visual flicker and tACS. The spatial and frequency specificity of our results have implications for research on the functional organisation of perception.</content>

		<content type="html">
 How the human brain supports accurate navigation of a learned environment has been an active topic of research for nearly a century (1-5). In rodents, the theta rhythm within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been proposed as a neural basis for fragmenting incoming information and temporally organizing experiences and is thus widely implicated in spatial and episodic memory (6). In addition, high-frequency theta (8Hz) is associated with navigation, and loss of theta results in spatial memory deficits in rats (7). Recently, high-frequency theta oscillations during ambulatory movement have been identified in humans (8,9), though their relationship to spatial memory remains unexplored. Here, we were able to record MTL activity during spatial memory and navigation in freely moving humans immersed in a room-scale virtual reality (VR) environment. Naturalistic movements were captured using motion tracking combined with wireless VR in participants implanted with an intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recording system for the treatment of epilepsy. We found that prevalence of theta oscillations across brain sites during both learning and recall of spatial locations during ambulatory navigation is critically linked to memory performance. This finding supports the reinstatement hypothesis of episodic memory thought to underlie our ability to recreate a prior experience (10-12)-and suggests that theta prevalence within the MTL may act as a potential representational state for memory reinstatement during spatial navigation. Additionally, we found that theta power is hexadirectionally modulated (13-15) as a function of the direction of physical movement, most prominently after learning has occurred. This effect bears a resemblance to the rodent grid cell system (16) and suggests an analog in human navigation. Taken together, our results provide the first characterization of neural oscillations in the human MTL during ambulatory spatial memory tasks and provide a platform for future investigations of neural mechanisms underlying freely moving navigation in humans.</content>

 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the neurodevelopmental disorders and characterized with persistent impairments in social communication (including verbal and nonverbal communication) and repetitive behavior together with various comorbid symptoms. Epidemiological studies suggest a significant association between advanced paternal age and incidence of ASD in offspring, which has been modeled in rodents. However, how paternal aging makes an impact on the offspring's early communicative behavior, especially at the individual level, has not been addressed. Here we focused on ultrasonic vocalization (USV) induced by maternal separation of pups corresponding to baby's cry. Maternal separation-induced USV of each offspring derived from young (3 months) or aged (&amp;gt;12 months) father was individually measured for 5 minutes at postnatal day 3 (P3), P6, P9, and P12. We classified USV syllables into 12 types according to Scattoni's classification with minor modifications, and analyzed duration, maximum frequency, maximum amplitude and interval of each syllable. Compared between the two groups, the offspring derived from aged fathers emitted the syllables with less number, shorter duration, different syllable components and less diversity. Interestingly, from an individual perspective, there were more individuals with atypical developmental patterns in the offspring group derived from aged fathers. Taken together, we demonstrated for the first time a significant influence of paternal aging on early vocal development with qualitative and quantitative aspects in individual mice.</content>

 A growing body of evidence indicates that visual perceptual learning (VPL) is enhanced by reward provided during training. Another line of studies has shown that sleep following training also plays a role in facilitating VPL, an effect known as the offline performance gain of VPL. However, whether the effects of reward and sleep interact on VPL remains unclear. Here, we show that reward interacts with sleep to facilitate offline performance gains of VPL. First, we demonstrated a significantly larger offline performance gain over a 12-h interval including sleep in a reward group than that in a No-reward group. However, the offline performance gains over the 12-h interval without sleep were not significantly different with or without reward during training, indicating a crucial interaction between reward and sleep in VPL. Next, we tested whether neural activations during posttraining sleep were modulated after reward was provided during training. Reward provided during training enhanced REM sleep time, increased oscillatory activities for reward processing in the prefrontal region during REM sleep, and inhibited neural activation in the untrained region in early visual areas in NREM and REM sleep. The offline performance gains were significantly correlated with oscillatory activities of visual processing during NREM sleep and reward processing during REM sleep in the reward group but not in the No-reward group. These results suggest that reward provided during training becomes effective during sleep, with excited reward processing sending inhibitory signals to suppress noise in visual processing, resulting in larger offline performance gains over sleep.</content>

 Sleep is beneficial for learning. However, whether NREM or REM sleep facilitates learning, whether the learning facilitation results from plasticity increases or stabilization and whether the facilitation results from learning-specific processing are all controversial. Here, after training on a visual task we measured the excitatory and inhibitory neurochemical (E/I) balance, an index of plasticity in human visual areas, for the first time, while subjects slept. Off-line performance gains of presleep learning were associated with the E/I balance increase during NREM sleep, which also occurred without presleep training. In contrast, increased stabilization was associated with decreased E/I balance during REM sleep only after presleep training. These indicate that the above-mentioned issues are not matters of controversy but reflect opposite neurochemical processing for different roles in learning during different sleep stages: NREM sleep increases plasticity leading to performance gains independently of learning, while REM sleep decreases plasticity to stabilize learning in a learning-specific manner.</content>

		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/738641v1?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 Previous studies have indicated that white matter hyperintensities (WMH) may evolve, i.e., shrink, grow, or stay stable, over a period of time. However, predicting the evolution of WMH is challenging because the rate and direction of WMH evolution varies greatly across studies. Evolution of WMH also has a non-deterministic nature because some clinical factors that possibly influence it are still not known. In this study, we attempt to predict the evolution of WMH from baseline image while addressing the non-deterministic nature of this process by proposing an end-to-end training model that uses deep learning and an auxiliary input module. We name this proposed model &quot;Disease Evolution Predictor&quot; (DEP). The DEP model receives a baseline image as input and produces a map called &quot;Disease Evolution Map&quot; (DEM), which represents the evolution of WMH from baseline to follow-up. Two models of DEP are proposed, i.e., DEP-UResNet and DEP-GAN, which represent supervised and unsupervised deep learning algorithms respectively. DEP-UResNet uses baseline T2-FLAIR as main input while DEP-GAN uses either baseline irregularity map (IM) or probability map (PM) instead. The generated DEM can be compared to the real DEM by using a simple subtraction between baseline and follow-up assessments. In this study, labels of WMH manually produced by an expert are used as reference standard for evaluation. To simulate the non-deterministic and unknown parameters involved in WMH evolution, we propose modulating a Gaussian noise array to the DEP model as auxiliary input. This forces the DEP model to imitate a wider spectrum of alternatives in the results. The alternatives of using other types of auxiliary input instead, such as baseline WMH and stroke lesion loads were also tested. Note that baseline WMH load is the strongest known risk factor of WMH evolution. Based on our experiments, DEP-GAN using PM and Gaussian noise as auxiliary input yielded one of the best results in almost all evaluations, including clinical plausibility. The DEP-UResNet regularly performed better than the DEP-GAN using PM and Gaussian noise in some evaluations, but eventually it did not show promise in the clinical evaluation. Moreover, supervised DEP-UResNet also requires manual WMH labels on two MRI scans for training, which, in many scenarios, is not applicable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive study on modelling WMH evolution using deep learning algorithms and dealing with the non-deterministic nature of WMH evolution.</content>

 Statistical regularities in natural sounds facilitate the perceptual segregation of auditory sources, or streams. Repetition is one cue that drives stream segregation in humans, but the neural basis of this perceptual phenomenon remains unknown. We trained ferrets to detect a stream of repeating noise samples (foreground) embedded in a stream of random noise samples (background). While they listened passively, we recorded neural activity in primary (A1) and secondary (PEG) fields of auditory cortex. We used context-dependent encoding models to test for evidence of streaming of the repeating stimulus in these brain areas. Separate models tested whether time-varying neural spike rates were better predicted by scaling the response to both streams of the repeating stimulus equally (global response gain), or by scaling the response of one stream relative to another (stream-specific response gain). Consistent with adaptation, we found an overall reduction in global gain when the stimulus was repeated. However, when we measured stream-specific changes in gain, neural responses to the foreground stream were enhanced relative to the background. This enhancement was stronger in PEG than in A1. In A1, the degree of enhancement depended on auditory tuning. It was strongest in units that displayed low sparseness (i.e., broad sensory tuning) and were tuned preferentially to the repeated sample. Thus, while overall auditory responses were reduced by the repeating sound, enhancement of responses to the foreground stream relative to the background provides evidence for stream segregation that emerges in A1 and is refined in PEG.</content>

		<content type="html">
 It is still unclear how implicit prior knowledge is involved in the extraction of the statistical structure underlying sensory input. Therefore, this study investigated whether the implicit knowledge on 2nd order transitional probabilities characterizing a stream of visual stimuli impacts the processing of unpredictable transitional probabilities embedded in a similar input stream. Young adults (N = 50) performed a four-choice reaction time (RT) task that consisted of structured and unstructured blocks. In the structured blocks, an alternating regularity repeated, yielding more probable and less probable short-range non-adjacent transitional probabilities. In the unstructured blocks, without the presence of the alternating regularity, the unique combinations of the short-range transitional probabilities occurred with equal probability, therefore, they were unpredictable. All task blocks were visually identical at the surface level. While one group of the participants completed first the structured blocks followed by the unstructured blocks, this was reversed in the other group. Participants completing first the structured blocks showed faster RTs to more probable than to less probable short-range transitional probabilities in both the structured and unstructured blocks, indicating the transfer of prior knowledge. In contrast, participants completing first the unstructured blocks showed this RT effect only in the structured blocks. These results overall suggest that, during the learning of serial dependence, the implicitly acquired prior knowledge on a transitional probability structure influences the processing of unstructured stimuli through the formation of internal models.</content>

 Recurrently connected networks of spiking neurons underlie the astounding information processing capabilities of the brain. But in spite of extensive research, it has remained open how learning through synaptic plasticity could be organized in such networks. We argue that two pieces of this puzzle were provided by experimental data from neuroscience. A new mathematical insight tells us how they need to be combined to enable network learning through gradient descent. The resulting learning method -- called e-prop -- approaches the performance of BPTT (backpropagation through time), the best known method for training recurrent neural networks in machine learning. But in contrast to BPTT, e-prop is biologically plausible. In addition, it elucidates how brain-inspired new computer chips -- that are drastically more energy efficient -- can be enabled to learn.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Synaptic plasticity is triggered by different patterns of neuronal network activity. Network activity leads to an increase in ambient GABA concentration and tonic activation of GABAA receptors. How tonic GABAA conductance affects synaptic plasticity during temporal and rate-based coding is poorly understood. Here, we show that tonic GABAA conductance differently affects long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by different stimulation patterns. The LTP based on a temporal spike - EPSP order (spike-timing-dependent [st] LTP) was not affected by exogenous GABA application. Backpropagating action potential, which enables Ca2+ entry through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during stLTP induction, was only slightly reduced by the tonic conductance. In contrast, GABA application impeded LTP dependent on spiking rate (theta-burst-induced [tb] LTP) by reducing the EPSP bust response and, hence, NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ entry during tbLTP induction. Our results may explain the changes in different forms of memory under physiological and pathological conditions that affect tonic GABAA conductance.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Human decision-making and self-reflection often depend on context and internal biases. For instance, decisions are often influenced by preceding choices, regardless of their relevance. It remains unclear how choice history influences different levels of the decision-making hierarchy. We employed analyses grounded in information and detection theories to estimate the relative strength of perceptual and metacognitive history biases, and to investigate whether they emerge from common/unique mechanisms. Though both perception and metacognition tended to be biased towards previous responses, we observed novel dissociations which challenge normative theories of confidence. Different evidence levels often informed perceptual and metacognitive decisions within observers, and response history distinctly influenced 1st (perceptual) and 2nd (metacognitive) order decision-parameters, with the metacognitive bias likely to be strongest and most prevalent in the general population. We propose that recent choices and subjective confidence represent heuristics which inform 1st and 2nd order decisions in the absence of more relevant evidence.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Poor sleep is associated with multiple age-related neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. The hippocampus plays a special role in sleep and sleep-dependent cognition, and accelerated hippocampal atrophy is typically seen with higher age. Hence, it is critical to establish how the relationship between sleep and hippocampal volume loss unfolds across the adult lifespan. Methods: Self-reported sleep measures and MRI-derived hippocampal volumes were obtained from 3105 cognitively normal participants (18-90 years) from major European brain studies in the Lifebrain consortium. Hippocampal volume change was estimated from 5116 MRIs from 1299 participants, covering up to 11 years. Cross-sectional analyses were repeated in a sample of 21390 participants from the UK Biobank. Results: The relationship between self-reported sleep and age differed across sleep items. Sleep duration, efficiency, problems, and use of medication worsened monotonously with age, whereas subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, and daytime tiredness improved. Women reported worse sleep in general than men, but the relationship to age was similar. No cross-sectional sleep - hippocampal volume relationships was found. However, worse sleep quality, efficiency, problems, and daytime tiredness were related to greater hippocampal volume loss over time, with high scorers showing on average 0.22% greater annual loss than low scorers. Simulations showed that longitudinal effects were too small to be detected as age-interactions in cross-sectional analyses. Conclusions: Worse self-reported sleep is associated with higher rates of hippocampal decline across the adult lifespan. This suggests that sleep is relevant to understand individual differences in hippocampal atrophy, but limited effect sizes call for cautious interpretation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Brain network parcellation based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is affected by noise, resulting in spurious small patches and decreased functional homogeneity within each network. Robust and homogeneous parcellation of neonate brain is more difficult with neonate rs-fMRI associated with higher level of noise and no functional atlas as spatial constraints. To meet these challenges, we developed a novel data-driven Regularized Normalized-cut (RNcut) method. RNcut is formulated by adding two regularization terms, a smoothing term using Markov random fields and a small-patch removal term, to conventional normalized-cut (Ncut) method. The RNcut and competing methods were tested with simulated datasets with known ground truth and then applied to both adult and neonate rs-fMRI datasets. Based on the parcellated networks generated by RNcut, intra-network connectivity was quantified. The test results from simulated datasets demonstrated that the RNcut method is more robust (p&amp;lt;0.01) to noise and can delineate parcellated functional networks with significantly better (p&amp;lt;0.01) spatial contiguity and significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0.01) functional homogeneity than competing methods. Application of RNcut to neonate and adult rs-fMRI dataset revealed distinctive functional brain organization of neonate brains from that of adult brains. Collectively, we developed a novel data-driven RNcut method by integrating conventional Ncut with two regularization terms, generating robust and homogeneous functional parcellation without imposing spatial constraints. A broad range of brain network applications and analyses, especially exploratory investigations of parcellating neonate and infant brain with noisy dataset, can potentially benefit from this RNcut method.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Characteristic features of sleep are conserved among species [1], and from humans to insects sleep is influenced by neural circuits involving monoamines such as serotonin and dopamine [2]. Glial cells have been increasingly implicated in mechanisms of baseline and homeostatic sleep regulation in mammals and flies [3-11], but it remains unknown whether and how glia might influence monoaminergic control of sleep. Sleep is regulated by circadian rhythms and a homeostatic drive to compensate for prolonged wakefulness, and growing evidence suggests that neural mechanisms controlling homeostatic sleep can be discriminated from those controlling baseline sleep [12-15]. In Drosophila, mutants of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (AANAT1lo) have normal baseline amounts of sleep and motor activity, but increased rebound sleep following deprivation [16]. AANAT1 can acetylate and inactivate monoamines in vitro [17], but the role of AANAT1 in vivo remains poorly understood. We find AANAT1 to be expressed in astrocytes and subsets of neurons in the adult Drosophila brain, with levels in astrocytes declining markedly overnight. In sleep-deprived AANAT1 mutant flies, heightened rebound sleep is accompanied by increased serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain. In neurons, AANAT1 functions to limit the quantity and consolidation of nighttime sleep, but in astrocytes AANAT1 constrains the amount of rebound sleep that flies take in response to sleep deprivation. These findings distinguish sleep-control functions of AANAT1 in neurons and astrocytes, and identify a critical role for astrocytes in the regulation of monoamine bioavailability and calibration of the response to sleep need.</content>

Understanding the molecular function of MeCP2 will not only provide insights into the pathogenesis of MeCP2-related disorders, but will also shed light on the epigenetic regulation of neuronal function. In the past few years, a number of studies have provided mechanistic evidence that MeCP2 recruits co-repressor complexes to particular sequences of methylated DNA. Additionally, innovative design and high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided opportunities to study the effects of MeCP2 on the neuronal transcriptome at an unprecedented level of detail, demonstrating that MeCP2 modulates gene expression in a context-specific manner. These findings have raised new questions and challenged current models of MeCP2 function. In this review, we describe several recent developments, highlight future challenges, and articulate a model by which MeCP2 functions as an organizer of chromatin architecture to modulate global gene expression in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Recent developments in neural recording technologies are providing unprecedented access to the activity of such populations during increasingly complex experimental contexts; however, extracting scientific insights from such recordings requires the concurrent development of analytical tools that relate this population activity to system-level function. This is a primary motivation for latent variable models, which seek to provide a low-dimensional description of population activity that can be related to experimentally controlled variables, as well as uncontrolled variables such as internal states (e.g. attention and arousal) and elements of behavior. While deriving an understanding of function from traditional latent variable methods relies on low-dimensional visualizations, new approaches are targeting more interpretable descriptions of the components underlying system-level function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Most biological systems are difficult to analyse due to a multitude of interacting components and the concomitant lack of information about the essential dynamics. Finding appropriate models that provide a systematic description of such biological systems and that help to identify their relevant factors and processes can be challenging given the sheer number of possibilities. Model selection algorithms that evaluate the performance of a multitude of different models against experimental data provide a useful tool to identify appropriate model structures. However, many algorithms addressing the analysis of complex dynamical systems, as they are often used in biology, compare a preselected number of models or rely on exhaustive searches of the total model space which might be unfeasible dependent on the number of possibilities. Therefore, we developed an algorithm that is able to perform model selection on complex systems and searches large model spaces in a dynamical way. Our algorithm includes local and newly developed non-local search methods that can prevent the algorithm from ending up in local minima of the model space by accounting for structurally similar processes. We tested and validated the algorithm based on simulated data and showed its flexibility for handling different model structures. We also used the algorithm to analyse experimental data on the cell proliferation dynamics of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells that were cultured under different conditions. Our analyses indicated dynamical changes within the proliferation potential of cells that was reduced within tissue-like 3D &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; cultures compared to suspension. Due to the flexibility in handling various model structures, the algorithm is applicable to a large variety of different biological problems and represents a useful tool for the data-oriented evaluation of complex model spaces.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/chXjj93krjA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anticoagulation reversal, intensive blood pressure lowering, neurosurgery, and access to critical care might all be beneficial in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We combined and implemented these as the “ABC” hyperacute care bundle and sought to determine whether the implementation was associated with lower case fatality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABC bundle was implemented from June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016. Key process targets were set, and a registry captured consecutive patients. We compared 30‐day case fatality before, during, and after bundle implementation with multivariate logistic regression and used mediation analysis to determine which care process measures mediated any association. Difference‐in‐difference analysis compared 30‐day case fatality with 32,295 patients with ICH from 214 other hospitals in England and Wales using Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 973 ICH patients were admitted in the study period. Compared to before implementation, the adjusted odds of death by 30 days were lower in the implementation period (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–0.97, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03), and this was sustained after implementation (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24–0.61, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Implementation of the bundle was associated with a 10.8 percentage point (95% CI = −17.9 to −3.7, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003) reduction in 30‐day case fatality in difference‐in‐difference analysis. The total effect of the care bundle was mediated by a reduction in do‐not‐resuscitate orders within 24 hours (52.8%) and increased admission to critical care (11.1%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation of the ABC care bundle was significantly associated with lower 30‐day case fatality after ICH. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Hypersynchronous network activity is the defining hallmark of epilepsy and manifests in a wide spectrum of phenomena of which electrographic activity during seizures is only one extreme. The aim of this study was to differentiate between different types of epileptiform activity patterns and investigate their temporal succession and interactions. We analyzed local field potentials from freely behaving male mice that had received an intrahippocampal kainate injection to model mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Epileptiform spikes occurred in distinct bursts. Using machine learning, we derived a scale reflecting the spike load of bursts and three main burst categories that we labeled high-load, medium-load and low-load bursts. We found that bursts of these categories were non-randomly distributed in time. High-load bursts formed clusters and were typically surrounded by transition phases with increased rates of medium-load and low-load bursts. In apparent contradiction to this, increased rates of low-load bursts were also associated with elongated background phases, i.e. periods lacking high-load bursting. Furthermore, the rate of low-load bursts was more strongly correlated with the duration of background phases than the overall rate of epileptiform spikes. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low-level epileptiform activity could promote network stability but could also participate in transitions towards major epileptiform events, depending on the current state of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; It is a major challenge in epilepsy research to understand how different types of epileptiform activity interact and whether epileptiform spikes prevent or promote major epileptic events. In our mouse model for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, epileptiform spikes occurred in bursts. Increased rates of bursts with low spike load were clearly associated with extended phases lacking high-load bursts, which is in line with the view that low-level activity could promote network stability in epilepsy. Low-load bursts, however, also occurred during transition phases to clusters of high-load bursts. Both findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low-level epileptiform activity could reduce the excitability of the network but that its impact depends on the current state of the network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Modern neuroimaging technologies, combined with state-of-the-art data
processing pipelines, have made it possible to collect longitudinal
observations of an individual's brain connectome at different ages. It is of
substantial scientific interest to study how brain connectivity varies over
time in relation to human cognitive traits. In brain connectomics, the
structural brain network for an individual corresponds to a set of
interconnections among brain regions. We propose a symmetric bilinear logistic
regression to learn a set of small subgraphs relevant to a binary outcome from
longitudinal brain networks as well as estimating the time effects of the
subgraphs. We enforce the extracted signal subgraphs to have clique structure
which has appealing interpretations as they can be related to neurological
circuits. The time effect of each signal subgraph reflects how its predictive
effect on the outcome varies over time, which may improve our understanding of
interactions between the aging of brain structure and neurological disorders.
Application of this method on longitudinal brain connectomics and cognitive
capacity data shows interesting discovery of relevant interconnections among a
small set of brain regions in frontal and temporal lobes with better predictive
performance than competitors.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis-associated joint pain is frequently observed independent
of disease activity, suggesting unidentified pain mechanisms. We demonstrate
that antibodies binding to cartilage, specific for collagen type II (CII) or
cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), elicit mechanical hypersensitivity
in mice, uncoupled from visual, histological and molecular indications of
inflammation. Cartilage antibody-induced pain-like behavior does not depend on
complement activation or joint inflammation, but instead on tissue antigen
recognition and local immune complex (IC) formation. smFISH and IHC suggest
that neuronal Fcgr1 and Fcgr2b mRNA are transported to peripheral ends of
primary afferents. CII-ICs directly activate cultured WT but not FcR{\gamma}
chain-deficient DRG neurons. In line with this observation, CII-IC does not
induce mechanical hypersensitivity in FcR{\gamma} chain-deficient mice.
Furthermore, injection of CII antibodies does not generate pain-like behavior
in FcR{\gamma} chain-deficient mice or mice lacking activating Fc{\gamma}Rs in
neurons. In summary, this study defines functional coupling between
autoantibodies and pain transmission that may facilitate the development of new
disease-relevant pain therapeutics.

 &lt;p&gt;Networks in the brain consist of different types of neurons. Here we
investigate the influence of neuron diversity on the dynamics, phase space
structure and computational capabilities of spiking neural networks. We find
that already a single neuron of a different type can qualitatively change the
network dynamics and that mixed networks may combine the computational
capabilities of ones with a single neuron type. We study inhibitory networks of
concave leaky (LIF) and convex &quot;anti-leaky&quot; (XIF) integrate-and-fire neurons
that generalize irregularly spiking non-chaotic LIF neuron networks. Endowed
with simple conductance-based synapses for XIF neurons, our networks can
generate a balanced state of irregular asynchronous spiking as well. We
determine the voltage probability distributions and self-consistent firing
rates assuming Poisson input with finite size spike impacts. Further, we
compute the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and the covariant
Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) specifying the corresponding perturbation directions.
We find that there is approximately one positive LE for each XIF neuron. This
indicates in particular that a single XIF neuron renders the network dynamics
chaotic. A simple mean-field approach, which can be justified by properties of
the CLVs, explains the finding. As an application, we propose a spike-based
computing scheme where our networks serve as computational reservoirs and their
different stability properties yield different computational capabilities.

 Cystatin B (CSTB) is a ubiquitous protein belonging to a superfamily of protease inhibitors. CSTB may play critical role in brain physiology because its mutations cause progressive myoclonic epilepsy-1A (EPM1A), the most common form of progressive myoclonic epilepsy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of CSTB role in the Central Nervous System (CNS) are largely unknown. To investigate the possible involvement of CSTB in the synaptic plasticity, we analyzed its expression in synaptosomes as model system in studying the physiology of the synaptic regions of the CNS. We found that CSTB is not only present in the synaptosomes isolated from rat and mouse brain cortex, but also secreted into the medium in a depolarization-controlled manner. In addition, using BONCAT (biorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging) procedure, we demonstrated, for the first time, that CSTB is locally synthesized in the synaptosomes. The synaptic localization of CSTB was confirmed in a human 3D model of cortical development, namely cerebral organoids. Altogether these results suggest that CSTB may play a role in the brain plasticity and open a new perspective in studying the involvement of CSTB deregulation in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.</content>

 Recently, we reported that ALWPs, which we developed by combining Liuwei Dihuang pills (LWPs) with antler, regulates the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory response and rescues LPS-induced short- and long-term memory impairment in wild-type (WT) mice. In the present study, we examined the effects of ALWPs on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and cognitive function in WT mice as well as 5×FAD mice (a mouse model of AD). Here, we found that administration of ALWPs significantly reduced amyloid plaque levels in 5×FAD mice and significantly decreased amyloid beta (Abeta) levels in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing H4 cells. In addition, ALWP administration significantly suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation in 5×FAD mice. Oral administration of ALWPs significantly improved long-term memory in scopolamine (SCO)-injected WT mice and 5×FAD mice by altering dendritic spine density. Importantly, ALWPs promoted spinogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons and WT mice and modulated the dendritic spine number in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that ALWPs are a candidate therapeutic drug for AD that can modulate amyloid plaque load, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic/cognitive function.</content>

 The advances in medicine, together with lifestyle modifications, led to a rising life expectancy. Unfortunately, however, aging is accompanied by an alarming boost of age-associated chronic pathologies, including neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Interestingly, a non-negligible interplay between alterations of glucose homeostasis and brain dysfunction has clearly emerged. In particular, epidemiological studies have pointed out a possible association between Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Insulin resistance, one of the major hallmark for etiology of T2D, has a detrimental influence on PD, negatively affecting PD phenotype, accelerating its progression and worsening cognitive impairment. This review aims to provide an exhaustive analysis of the most recent evidences supporting the key role of insulin resistance in PD pathogenesis. It will focus on the relevance of insulin in the brain, working as pro-survival neurotrophic factor and as a master regulator of neuronal mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Insulin action as a modulator of dopamine signaling and of alpha-synuclein degradation will be described in details, too. The intriguing idea that shared deregulated pathogenic pathways represent a link between PD and insulin resistance has clinical and therapeutic implications. Thus, ongoing studies about the promising healing potential of common antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, exenatide, DPP IV inhibitors, thiazolidinediones and bromocriptine, will be summarized and the rationale for their use to decelerate neurodegeneration will be critically assessed.</content>

 Sustained inflammation in the injured cortex is a promising therapeutic target for disease-modification after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, its extent and dynamics of expansion are incompletely understood which challenges the timing and placement of therapeutics to lesioned area. Our aim was to characterize the evolution of chronic inflammation during lesion expansion in lateral fluid-percussion injury (FPI) rat model with focus on the MRI-negative perilesional cortex. T2-weighted MR imaging (T2w MRI) and localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were performed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-injury. End-point histology, including Nissl for neuronal death, GFAP for astrogliosis, and Prussian Blue for iron were used to assess perilesional histopathology. An additional animal cohort was imaged with a positron emission tomography (PET) using translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) radiotracer [18F]-FEPPA. T2w MRI assessed lesion growth and detected chronic inflammation along the lesion border while rest of the ipsilateral cortex was MRI-negative (MRI-). Instead, myoinositol that is an inflammatory MRS marker for gliosis, glutathione for oxidative stress, and choline for membrane turnover were elevated throughout the 6-months follow-up in the MRI- perilesional cortex (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). MRS markers revealed chronically sustained inflammation across the ipsilateral cortex but did not indicate the upcoming lesion expansion. Instead, the rostral expansion of the cortical lesion was systematically preceded by a hyperintense band in T2w images months earlier. Histologic analysis of the hyperintensity indicated scattered astrocytes, incomplete glial scar, and intracellularly packed and free iron. Yet, the band was negative in [18F]-FEPPA-PET. [18F]-FEPPA also showed no cortical TSPO expression within the MRS voxel in MRI- perilesional cortex or anywhere along glial scar when assessed at 2 months post-injury. However, [18F]-FEPPA showed a robust signal increase, indicating reactive microgliosis in the ipsilateral thalamus at 2 months post-TBI. We present evidence that MRS reveals chronic posttraumatic inflammation in MRI-negative perilesional cortex. The mismatch in MRS, MRI and PET measures may allow noninvasive endophenotyping of beneficial and detrimental inflammatory processes to aid targeting and timing of anti-inflammatory therapeutics.</content>

 Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies. Accurate and robust tumor segmentation and prediction of patients' overall survival are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and risk factor identification. Here we present a deep learning-based framework for brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction in glioma using multimodal MRI scans. For tumor segmentation, we use ensembles of three different 3D CNN architectures for robust performance through majority rule. This approach can effectively reduce model bias and boost performance. For survival prediction, we extract 4524 radiomic features from segmented tumor region. Then decision tree and cross validation are used to select potent features. Finally, a random forest model is trained to predict the overall survival of patients. On 2018 MICCAI Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS), our method ranks at second place and 5th place out of 60+ participating teams on survival prediction task and segmentation task respectively, achieving a promising 61.0% accuracy on classification of short-survivors, mid-survivors and long-survivors.</content>

 The elite sports environment provides a unique setting for studying human performance, where both cognitive and physical demands are high. Successful performance in sport is contingent upon key cognitive skills such as attention, perception, working memory and decision-making. The demands of competitive sport also increase loading on the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) offer the potential to investigate the cognitive demands of sport, neuroplasticity of athletes, and biofeedback training. However, practical and technical limitations of these methods have generally limited their use to laboratory-based studies of athletes during simulated sporting tasks. This review provides a brief overview of research that has applied neuroimaging technology to study various aspects of cognitive function during sports performance in athletes, alternative methods for measuring CNS loading (e.g., direct current potential), possible solutions and avenues of focus for future neuroergonomics research in sport.</content>

 Background: It has been argued that prosocial behaviors and momentary rewards activate the similar reward systems. However, a recent theoretical hypothesis encourages a fundamentally different view. Specifically, the social heuristic hypothesis posits that individuals internalize prosocial behaviors that are advantageous in their daily social life. These advantageous behaviors are fundamentally different from tangible and immediate reward. 
Objectives: Our objectives are to test a hypothesis that these advantageous prosocial behaviors are so critical to survival that it is necessary to have a neural system in the brain that leads people to maintain repeated social interactions. These neural systems are different from the computations of rewards because prosocial behaviors are not advantageous if only considering the computations of rewards.
Methods: To deepen the understanding of the neural systems of prosocial behaviors and reward, we conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to examine brain activation in prosocial behaviors and reward tasks.
Results: Prosocial behaviors specifically activated distinct brain systems to a greater degree than reward. These systems were implicated in the processing of social behaviors and included the insula, temporal lobe and superior temporal gyrus. By contrast, reward specifically activated the lentiform nucleus, thalamus, caudate nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex, which are associated with the brain reward system. 
Conclusions: These findings suggest that prosocial behaviors are different from reward and involve specific brain mechanisms.</content>

 The avian retina is composed of different types of photoreceptors responsible for image and non-image forming tasks: the visual photoreceptor cells (cones and rods), the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photoresponsive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and horizontal cells. Furthermore, the nonvisual opsins Opn3 (encephalopsin/panaopsin) and Opn5 (neuropsin) have been shown to be expressed in the vertebrate inner retina, responding to blue (BL) and UV light, respectively. Here we investigated the expression and localization of Opn3 and Opn5 in the developing chick retina at different embryonic days (E) as well as in primary cultures of retinal Müller glial cells (MC). Opn3 and Opn5 mRNAs and proteins appeared as early as E10 although traces of Opn3- and Opn5-like proteins were seen earlier by E7 in the forming RGC layer and in glial cells extending throughout the developing nuclear layer. Later on, at postnatal days 1-10 (PN1-10) a significant expression of Opn3 was observed in inner retinal cells and processes in plexiform layers, together with expression of the glial markers glutamine synthetase (GS) and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Opn3 and Opn5 were found to be expressed in primary MC cultures prepared at E8 and kept for two weeks.  In addition, significant effects of BL exposure on Opn3 expression and subcellular localization were observed in MCs as BL significantly increased its levels and modified its nuclear location when compared with dark-controls, through a mechanism dependent on protein synthesis. More importantly, a subpopulation of MCs responded to brief BL pulses by increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels; whereas light-responses were completely abolished with the retinal bleacher hydroxylamine pretreatment. Taken together, our findings show that these two opsins are expressed in inner retinal cells and MCs of the chicken retina at early developmental phases and remain expressed in the mature retina at postnatal days. In addition, the novel photic responses seen in MCs may suggest another important role for the glia in retinal physiology.</content>

 Spinal cord injury is a devastating neurological disorder that damages motor, sensory, and autonomic pathways. Recent advances in stem cell therapy have allowed for the in vitro generation of motor neurons showing electrophysiological and synaptic activity, expression of canonical motor neuron biomarkers, and the ability to graft into spinal lesions. Clinical translation, especially the transplantation of motor neuron precursors in spinal lesions, has thus far been elusive because of stem cell heterogeneity and protocol variability, as well as a hostile microenvironment such as inflammation and scarring, which yield inconsistent pre-clinical results without a consensus best-practice therapeutic strategy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in particular have lower ethical and immunogenic concerns than other stem cells, which could make them more clinically applicable. In this review, we focus on the differentiation of iPSCs into neural precursors, motor neuron progenitors, mature motor neurons, and motor neuron subtype fates. Previous reviews have summarized motor neuron development and differentiation, but an up-to-date summary of technological and experimental advances holding promise for bench-to-bedside translation, especially those targeting individual motor neuron subtypes in spinal cord injury, is currently lacking. We discuss biological mechanisms of motor neuron lineage, recent experimental protocols and techniques for motor neuron differentiation from iPSCs, and  transplantation of neural precursors and motor neuron lineage cells in spinal cord lesions to restore motor function. We emphasize efficient, clinically safe, and personalized strategies for the application of motor neurons and their subtypes as therapy in spinal lesions.</content>

 BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is a significant public health concern in older adults. Identifying new ways to maintain cognitive and brain health throughout the lifespan is of utmost importance. Simultaneous exercise and cognitive engagement has been shown to enhance brain function in animal and human studies. Virtual reality (VR) may be a promising approach for conducting simultaneous exercise and cognitive studies. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of cycling in a cognitively enriched and immersive spatial navigation VR environment in younger and older adults.

METHODS: 20 younger (25.9±3.7 years) and 20 older (63.6±5.6 years) adults participated in this study. Participants completed four trials (2 learning, 2 recall) of cycling while wearing a head-mounted device and navigating a VR park environment. Questionnaires were administered to assess adverse effects, mood, presence, and physical exertion levels associated with cycling in the VR environment.

RESULTS: 4 subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse effects, yielding a 90% completion rate. Simulator sickness levels were enhanced in both age groups with exposure to the VR environment but were within an acceptable range. Exposure to the virtual environment was associated with high arousal and low stress levels, suggesting a state of excitement, and most participants reported enjoyment of the spatial navigation task and VR environment. No association was found between physical exertion levels and simulator sickness levels. 

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that spatial navigation while cycling is feasible and that older adults report similar experiences to younger adults. VR may be a powerful tool for engaging physical and cognitive activity in older adults with acceptable adverse effects and with reports of enjoyment. Future studies are needed to assess the efficacy of a combined exercise and cognitive VR program as an intervention for promoting healthy brain aging, especially in older adults with increased risk of age-related cognitive decline.</content>

 Background: With increasing aging populations worldwide, developing interventions against age-associated cognitive decline is particularly important. Evidence suggests that combination of brain stimulation with cognitive training intervention may enhance training effects in terms of performance gain or transfer to untrained domains. This protocol describes a Phase IIb clinical trial that investigates the intervention effects of training combined with brain stimulation in older adults. 

Methods: The TrainStim study is a monocentric, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled intervention. The study will investigate cognitive training with concurrent anodal tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (target intervention) compared to cognitive training with sham stimulation (control intervention) over nine sessions in three weeks, consisting of a letter updating task and a three-stage Markov decision-making task. Fifty-six older adults will be recruited from the general population. Baseline assessment will be performed including neuropsychological screening and performance on training tasks. Participants will be allocated to one of the two study arms using block-wise randomization stratified by age and baseline performance with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Primary outcome is performance in the letter updating task after training under anodal tDCS compared to sham stimulation. Secondary outcomes include performance changes in the decision-making task and transfer tasks, as well as brain structure and functional networks assessed by structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging that are acquired pre- and post-intervention.

Significance: The main aim of the TrainStim study is to provide evidence for behavioral and neuronal effects of tDCS-accompanied cognitive training and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in older adults. Our findings will contribute towards developing efficient interventions for age-associated cognitive decline.

Trial registration: This trial was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the Identifier: NCT03838211 at February 12, 2019. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03838211

 The phylum Apicomplexa comprises human pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; but are also an under-explored hotspot of evolutionary diversity central to understanding the origins of parasitism and non-photosynthetic plastids. We generated single-cell transcriptomes for all major apicomplexan groups lacking large-scale sequence data. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that apicomplexan-like parasites are polyphyletic and their similar morphologies emerged convergently at least three times. Gregarines and eugregarines are monophyletic, against most expectations, and rhytidocystids and &lt;i&gt;Eleutheroschizon&lt;/i&gt; are sister lineages to medically important taxa. Although previously unrecognized, plastids in deep-branching apicomplexans are common, and they contain some of the most divergent and AT-rich genomes ever found. In eugregarines, however, plastids are either abnormally reduced or absent, thus increasing known plastid losses in eukaryotes from two to four. Environmental sequences of ten novel plastid lineages and structural innovations in plastid proteins confirm that plastids in apicomplexans and their relatives are widespread and share a common, photosynthetic origin.</content>

 Modern humans have more fragile skeletons than other hominins, which may result from physical inactivity. Here we test whether reproductive effort also compromises bone strength, by measuring using computed tomography thoracic vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture prevalence among physically active Tsimane forager-horticulturalists. Earlier onset of reproduction and shorter interbirth intervals are associated with reduced BMD for women. Tsimane BMD is lower versus Americans, but only for women, contrary to simple predictions relying on inactivity to explain skeletal fragility. Minimal BMD differences exist between Tsimane and American men, suggesting that systemic factors other than fertility (e.g. diet) do not easily explain Tsimane women's lower BMD. Tsimane fracture prevalence is also higher versus Americans. Lower BMD increases Tsimane fracture risk, but only for women, suggesting a role of weak bone in women's fracture etiology. Our results highlight the role of sex-specific mechanisms underlying skeletal fragility that operate long before menopause.</content>

 White adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation contributes to the development of insulin resistance in obesity. While the role of adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) pro-inflammatory signalling in the development of insulin resistance has been established, it is less clear how WAT inflammation is initiated. Here, we show that ATMs isolated from obese mice and humans exhibit markers of increased rate of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis. Macrophage-specific knockout of phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase A (CCTa), the rate-limiting enzyme of &lt;i&gt;de novo &lt;/i&gt;PC biosynthesis pathway, alleviated obesity-induced WAT inflammation and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, CCTa-deficient macrophages showed reduced ER stress and inflammation in response to palmitate. Surprisingly, this was not due to lower exogenous palmitate incorporation into cellular PCs. Instead, CCTa-null macrophages had lower membrane PC turnover, leading to elevated membrane polyunsaturated fatty acid levels that negated the pro-inflammatory effects of palmitate. Our results reveal a causal link between obesity-associated increase in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; PC synthesis, accelerated PC turnover and pro-inflammatory activation of ATMs.</content>

 The central regulator of the ethylene (ET) signaling pathway, which controls a plethora of developmental programs and responses to environmental cues in plants, is ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2). Here we identify a chromatin-dependent regulatory mechanism at &lt;i&gt;EIN2&lt;/i&gt; requiring two genes: ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE6 (EIN6), which is a H3K27me3 demethylase also known as &lt;i&gt;RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING6&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;REF6&lt;/i&gt;), and EIN6 ENHANCER (EEN), the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; homolog of the yeast INO80 chromatin remodeling complex subunit &lt;i&gt;IES6 &lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;INO EIGHTY SUBUNIT&lt;/i&gt;). Strikingly, EIN6 (REF6) and the INO80 complex redundantly control the level and the localization of the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 and the histone variant H2A.Z at the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) intron of&lt;i&gt; EIN2&lt;/i&gt;. Concomitant loss of EIN6 (REF6) and the INO80 complex shifts the chromatin landscape at &lt;i&gt;EIN2&lt;/i&gt; to a repressive state causing a dramatic reduction of &lt;i&gt;EIN2&lt;/i&gt; expression. These results uncover a unique type of chromatin regulation which safeguards the expression of an essential multifunctional plant stress regulator.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Deep understanding of tooth regeneration is hampered by the lack of lifelong replacing oral dentition in most conventional models. Here, we show that the bearded dragon, one of the rare vertebrate species with both polyphyodont and monophyodont teeth, constitutes a key model for filling this gap, allowing direct comparison of extreme dentition types. Our developmental and high-throughput transcriptomic data of microdissected dental cells unveils the critical importance of successional dental lamina patterning, in addition to maintenance, for vertebrate tooth renewal. This patterning process happens at various levels, including directional growth but also gene expression levels, dynamics, and regionalization, and involves a large number of yet uncharacterized dental genes. Furthermore, the alternative renewal mechanism of bearded dragon dentition, with dual location of slow-cycling cells, demonstrates the importance of cell migration and functional specialization of putative epithelial stem/progenitor niches in tissue regeneration, while expanding the diversity of dental replacement strategies in vertebrates.</content>

 The testis is a peculiar tissue in many respects. It shows patterns of rapid gene evolution and provides a hotspot for the origination of genetic novelties such as de novo genes, duplications and mutations. To investigate the expression patterns of genetic novelties across cell types, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; testis. We found that new genes were expressed in various cell types, the patterns of which may be influenced by their mode of origination. In particular, lineage-specific de novo genes are commonly expressed in early spermatocytes, while young duplicated genes are often bimodally expressed. Analysis of germline substitutions suggests that spermatogenesis is a highly reparative process, with the mutational load of germ cells decreasing as spermatogenesis progresses. By elucidating the distribution of genetic novelties across spermatogenesis, this study provides a deeper understanding of how the testis maintains its core reproductive function while being a hotbed of evolutionary innovation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Antibiotic resistance typically induces a fitness cost that shapes the fate of antibiotic-resistant bacterial populations. However, the cost of resistance can be mitigated by compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome, and therefore the loss of resistance may proceed too slowly to be of practical importance. We present our study on the efficacy and phenotypic impact of compensatory evolution in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains carrying multiple resistance mutations. We have demonstrated that drug-resistance frequently declines within 480 generations during exposure to an antibiotic-free environment. The extent of resistance loss was found to be generally antibiotic-specific, driven by mutations that reduce both resistance level and fitness costs of antibiotic-resistance mutations. We conclude that phenotypic reversion to the antibiotic-sensitive state can be mediated by the acquisition of additional mutations, while maintaining the original resistance mutations. Our study indicates that restricting antimicrobial usage could be a useful policy, but for certain antibiotics only.</content>

 Sensory maps in layer (L) 2/3 of rodent cortex lack precise functional column boundaries, and instead exhibit locally heterogeneous (salt-and-pepper) tuning superimposed on smooth global topography. Could this organization be a byproduct of impoverished experience in laboratory housing? We compared whisker map somatotopy in L2/3 and L4 excitatory cells of somatosensory (S1) cortex in normally housed vs. tactile-enriched mice, using GCaMP6s imaging. Normally housed mice had a dispersed, salt-and-pepper whisker map in L2/3, but L4 was more topographically precise. Enrichment (P21 to P46-71) sharpened whisker tuning and decreased, but did not abolish, local tuning heterogeneity. In L2/3, enrichment strengthened and sharpened whisker point representations, and created functional boundaries of tuning similarity and noise correlations at column edges. Thus, enrichment drives emergence of functional columnar topography in S1, and reduces local tuning heterogeneity. These changes predict better touch detection by neural populations within each column.</content>

The coding space of protein sequences is shaped by evolutionary constraints set by requirements of function and stability. We show that the coding space of a given protein family—the total number of sequences in that family—can be estimated using models of maximum entropy trained on multiple sequence alignments of naturally occuring amino acid sequences. We analyzed and calculated the size of three abundant repeat proteins families, whose members are large proteins made of many repetitions of conserved portions of ∼30 amino acids. While amino acid conservation at each position of the alignment explains most of the reduction of diversity relative to completely random sequences, we found that correlations between amino acid usage at different positions significantly impact that diversity. We quantified the impact of different types of correlations, functional and evolutionary, on sequence diversity. Analysis of the detailed structure of the coding space of the families revealed a rugged landscape, with many local energy minima of varying sizes with a hierarchical structure, reminiscent of fustrated energy landscapes of spin glass in physics. This clustered structure indicates a multiplicity of subtypes within each family, and suggests new strategies for protein design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HRfB4RWoXCc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Recent developments in cardiovascular modelling allow us to simulate blood flow in an entire human body. Such model can also be used to create databases of virtual subjects, with sizes limited only by computational resources. In this work, we study if it is possible to estimate cardiovascular health indices using machine learning approaches. In particular, we carry out theoretical assessment of estimating aortic pulse wave velocity, diastolic and systolic blood pressure and stroke volume using pulse transit/arrival timings derived from photopletyshmography signals. For predictions, we train Gaussian process regression using a database of virtual subjects generated with a cardiovascular simulator. Simulated results provides theoretical assessment of accuracy for predictions of the health indices. For instance, aortic pulse wave velocity can be estimated with a high accuracy (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.9) when photopletyshmography is measured from left carotid artery using a combination of foot-to-foot pulse transmit time and peak location derived for the predictions. Similar accuracy can be reached for diastolic blood pressure, but predictions of systolic blood pressure are less accurate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.75) and the stroke volume predictions are mostly contributed by heart rate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iycbvHbfhig&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mutational robustness quantifies the effect of random mutations on fitness. When mutational robustness is high, most mutations do not change fitness or have only a minor effect on it. From the point of view of fitness landscapes, robust genotypes form neutral networks of almost equal fitness. Using deterministic population models it has been shown that selection favors genotypes inside such networks, which results in increased mutational robustness. Here we demonstrate that this effect is massively enhanced by recombination. Our results are based on a detailed analysis of mesa-shaped fitness landscapes, where we derive precise expressions for the dependence of the robustness on the landscape parameters for recombining and non-recombining populations. In addition, we carry out numerical simulations on different types of random holey landscapes as well as on an empirical fitness landscape. We show that the mutational robustness of a genotype generally correlates with its recombination weight, a new measure that quantifies the likelihood for the genotype to arise from recombination. We argue that the favorable effect of recombination on mutational robustness is a highly universal feature that may have played an important role in the emergence and maintenance of mechanisms of genetic exchange.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oDNy7X1iT6k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Syringe pumps are a necessary piece of lab equipment used for fluid delivery in behavioral neuroscience labs. Many experiments provide rodents and primates with fluid rewards such as juice, water, or liquid sucrose. Current commercialized syringe pumps are not customizable and do not have the ability to deliver multiple volumes of fluid based on different inputs to the pump. Additionally, many syringe pumps are expensive and cannot be used in experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings due to electrical noise. We developed an open source syringe pump controller using commonly available parts. The controller adjusts the acceleration and speed of the motor to deliver three different volumes of fluid reward within one common time epoch. This syringe pump controller is cost-effective and has been successfully implemented in rodent behavioral experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings in the rat frontal cortex while rats lick for different volumes of liquid sucrose rewards. Our syringe pump controller will enable new experiments to address the potential confound of temporal information in studies of reward signaling by fluid magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The neural basis of reward processing is a major topic in neuroscience. Many studies examine reward coding by varying the amount of fluid given to experimental animals as they perform a behavioral task. Most devices used in these studies are not capable of delivering different volumes over a common period of time. As such, reward coding is confounded by temporal information. To resolve this issue, we developed a syringe pump controller that is capable of delivering different fluid volumes, in the range used in behavioral studies, over common periods of time. Here, we report the designs of all components of the pump and the protocols needed to create and use it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To longitudinally evaluate the role of depression in the development of impulse control disorders (ICD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) we included PD patients without ICD at baseline according to the Questionnaire for Impulsive‐Compulsive Disorders in PD (QUIP). Patients were prospectively evaluated first quarterly and then biannually. Development of ICD was defined as an increase in QUIP scores during follow up. Using survival proportional hazard models we studied the effect of baseline depression on ICD risk. We also evaluated this effect controlling for dopamine agonist use as a time‐dependent variable and for other potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 354 patients, 68 were depressed at baseline. The median follow up was 4.08 years. Depression at baseline was associated with higher ICD risk (hazard ratio, HR: 1.96, 95% CI 1.32‐2.9, p&amp;lt;0.001). This risk remained significant after controlling for dopamine agonists use (HR: 1.97, 95% CI 1.33‐2.9, p&amp;lt;0.001), which was also independently linked to ICD development (HR: 1.87 95% CI 1.3‐2.7, p&amp;lt;0.001). Therefore, depressed patients faced an even higher ICD risk when receiving dopamine agonists. Controlling for multiple potential confounders did not alter these results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression predisposes to the development of ICD in PD. This risk is magnified by dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists should thus be used cautiously in depressed PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited evidence is available to guide treatment of depression for persons with epilepsy. We evaluated the comparative effectiveness of sertraline and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for depression, quality of life, seizures, and adverse treatment effects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We randomly assigned 140 adult outpatients with epilepsy and current major depressive disorder to sertraline or weekly CBT for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was remission from depression based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Secondary outcomes included the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory‐89 (QOLIE‐89) seizure rates, the Adverse Events Profile (AEP), the Beck Depression Inventory, and MINI Suicide Risk Module.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intention‐to‐treat analysis, 38 (52.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = ±12) of the 72 subjects assigned to sertraline and 41 (60.3%; 95% CI = ±11.6) of the 68 subjects in the CBT group achieved remission; the lower bound of efficacy for both groups was greater than our historical placebo control group upper bound of 33.7%. Difference in time to remission between groups was 2.8 days (95% CI = ±0.43; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.79). The percent improvement of mean QOLIE‐89 scores was significant for both the CBT (25.7%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and sertraline (28.3%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) groups. The difference in occurrence of generalized tonic–clonic seizures between groups was 0.3% (95% CI = ±8.6; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.95). Suicide risk at final assessment was associated with persistent depression (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) but not seizures or sertraline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression remitted in just over one‐half of subjects following sertraline or CBT. Despite the complex psychosocial disability associated with epilepsy, improving depression benefits quality of life. Serotonin reuptake inhibition does not appear to increase seizures or suicidality in persons with epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To describe early functional outcomes of nerve transfer surgery in a relatively large cohort of patients with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retrospective case analysis was made of patients with AFM treated with nerve transfer surgery between 2007 and 2018. Surgical criteria were persistent motor deficits after 6 months from onset and available donor nerves. Thirty‐two patients with AFM were evaluated; 16 underwent nerve transfer surgeries. Motor function was evaluated by a licensed occupational therapist using the Active Movement Scale preoperatively and during follow‐up examinations. Patients with 6 or more months of follow‐up were included in the analysis. Patients with procedures other than nerve transfers were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients with AFM had nerve transfers, with a male predominance (75%) and median age of 2.5 years (range = 4 months–12 years). Eleven patients had a minimum 6 months of follow‐up. Nerve transfers to restore elbow function had 87% excellent recovery for elbow flexion and 67% for elbow extension. Finger and thumb extension were full against gravity in 1 patient (100%). Shoulder external rotation was excellent in 50% of patients and shoulder abduction in only 20%. Nine of 10 patients (90%) had resolution of shoulder pseudosubluxation following nerve transfer to the suprascapular nerve.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with AFM with persistent motor deficits 6 to 9 months after onset benefit from nerve transfer surgery. Restoration of elbow function was more reliable than restoration of shoulder function. We recommend early referral of patients with incomplete recovery to a center experienced in nerve transfers for timely evaluation and treatment. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery can result in neurodegeneration and parkinsonism. Recent evidence suggests that immune responses in Parkinson disease patients are dysregulated, leading to an increased inflammatory reaction to unspecific triggers. Although α‐synuclein pathology is the hallmark of Parkinson disease, it has not been investigated whether pathologic α‐synuclein is a specific trigger for excessive inflammatory responses in Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the immune response of primary human monocytes and a microglial cell line to pathologic forms of α‐synuclein by assessing cytokine release upon exposure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that pathologic α‐synuclein (mutations, aggregation) results in a robust inflammatory activation of human monocytes and microglial BV2 cells. The activation is conformation‐ dependent, with increasing fibrillation and early onset mutations having the strongest effect on immune activation. We also found that activation of immune cells by extracellular α‐synuclein is potentiated by extracellular vesicles, possibly by facilitating the uptake of α‐synuclein. Blood extracellular vesicles from Parkinson disease patients induce a stronger activation of monocytes than blood extracellular vesicles from healthy controls. Most importantly, monocytes from Parkinson disease patients are dysregulated and hyperactive in response to stimulation with pathologic α‐synuclein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that α‐synuclein pathology in the CNS is sufficient to induce the monocyte dysregulation in the periphery of a mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our data suggest that α‐synuclein pathology and dysregulation of monocytes in Parkinson disease can act together to induce excessive inflammatory responses to α‐synuclein. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Currently virtual reality (VR) usage in training processes is increasing due
to their usefulness in the learning processes based on visual information
empowered. The information in virtual environments is perceived by sight, sound
and touch, but the relationship or impact that these stimuli can have on the
oscillatory activity of the brain such as the processing, propagation and
synchronization of information still needs to be established in relation to the
cognitive load of attention. Therefore, this study seeks to identify the
suggested epistemological basis through literature review and current research
agendas in the relationship that exists between the immersive virtual
environment and the neurophysiology of learning processes by means of the
analysis of visual information. The suggested dimensional modeling of this
research is composed by the theory of information processing which allows the
incorporation of learning through stimuli with the use of attention, perception
and storage by means of information management and the Kolb's learning model
which defines the perception and processing of information as dimensions of
learning. Regarding to the neurophysiology of learning, the literature has
established he links between the prefrontal cortex and working memory within
the process of information management. The challenges and advances discussed in
this research are based in the relationship between the identified constructs
(Income Stimuli, Information Management and Cognitive Processing) and the
establishment of a research agenda on how to identify the necessary indicators
to measure memory and attention in the virtual immersion environments.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;By extending the crude Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz electrodiffusion model for
resting-state membrane potentials in perfused axons of squid we reformulate the
Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) phenomenological quantitative model to create a model which
is simpler, more quantitative, and based more fundamentally on electrodiffusion
principles. Our dynamical system, like that of HH, behaves as a 4-dimensional
resonator exhibiting subthreshold oscillations. Speeds of propagating action
potentials at 20 degrees Celsius are in very good agreement with the HH
experimental value at 18.5 degrees Celsius. Unlike its HH counterpart it does
not predict spike trains during prolonged constant-current stimulation, in
agreement with recent experiments. Our resonator model predicts rebound spiking
following prolonged hyperpolarizing stimulation, observed at 18.5 degrees
Celsius by HH but not predicted at this temperature by their quantitative
model. Spiking promoted by brief (0.1 ms) hyperpolarization is also predicted
at room temperature by our electrodiffusion model but only at much lower
temperatures (ca. 6 degrees Celsius) by the HH model. Such spiking in giant
axons induced directly by brief hyperpolarizing stimulation at room temperature
does not appear to have been investigated experimentally for either stationary
membrane action potentials or their propagating counterparts.

 &lt;p&gt;Knowledge is a network of interconnected concepts. Yet, precisely how the
topological structure of knowledge constrains its acquisition remains unknown,
hampering the development of learning enhancement strategies. Here we study the
topological structure of semantic networks reflecting mathematical concepts and
their relations in college-level linear algebra texts. We hypothesize that
these networks will exhibit structural order, reflecting the logical sequence
of topics that ensures accessibility. We find that the networks exhibit strong
core-periphery architecture, where a dense core of concepts presented early is
complemented with a sparse periphery presented evenly throughout the
exposition; the latter is composed of many small modules each reflecting more
narrow domains. Using tools from applied topology, we find that the
expositional evolution of the semantic networks produces and subsequently fills
knowledge gaps, and that the density of these gaps tracks negatively with
community ratings of each textbook. Broadly, our study lays the groundwork for
future efforts developing optimal design principles for textbook exposition and
teaching in a classroom setting.

 Whether complement dysregulation directly contributes to the pathogenesis of peripheral nervous system diseases, including sensory neuropathies, is unclear. We addressed this important question in a mouse model of ocular HSV-1 infection, where sensory nerve damage is a common clinical problem. Through genetic and pharmacologic targeting, we uncovered a central role for C3 in sensory nerve damage at the morphological and functional levels. Interestingly, CD4 T cells were central in facilitating this complement-mediated damage. This same C3/CD4 T cell axis triggered corneal sensory nerve damage in a mouse model of ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, this was not the case in a T-dependent allergic eye disease (AED) model, suggesting that this inflammatory neuroimmune pathology is specific to certain disease etiologies. Collectively, these findings uncover a central role for complement in CD4 T cell-dependent corneal nerve damage in multiple disease settings and indicate the possibility for complement-targeted therapeutics to mitigate sensory neuropathies.</content>

 Innovations in metazoan development arise from evolutionary modification of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We report widespread cryptic variation in the requirement for two key regulatory inputs, SKN-1/Nrf2 and MOM-2/Wnt, into the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; endoderm GRN. While some natural isolates show a nearly absolute requirement for these two regulators, in others, most embryos differentiate endoderm in their absence. GWAS and analysis of recombinant inbred lines reveal multiple genetic regions underlying this broad phenotypic variation. We observe a reciprocal trend, in which genomic variants, or knockdown of endoderm regulatory genes, that result in a high SKN-1 requirement often show low MOM-2/Wnt requirement and &lt;i&gt;vice-versa, &lt;/i&gt;suggesting that cryptic variation in the endoderm GRN may be tuned by opposing requirements for these two key regulatory inputs. These findings reveal that while the downstream components in the endoderm GRN are common across metazoan phylogeny, initiating regulatory inputs are remarkably plastic even within a single species.</content>

 A central problem in human biology remains the discovery of causal molecular links between mutations identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and their corresponding disease traits. This challenge is magnified for variants residing in non-coding regions of the genome. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5ʹ untranslated region (5ʹ-UTR) of the ferritin light chain (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt;) gene that cause hyperferritinemia are reported to disrupt translation repression by altering iron regulatory protein (IRP) interactions with the &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt; mRNA 5ʹ-UTR. Here, we show that human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) acts as a distinct repressor of &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt; mRNA translation, and eIF3-mediated &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt; repression is disrupted by a subset of SNPs in &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt; that cause hyperferritinemia. These results identify a direct role for eIF3-mediated translational control in a specific human disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Expressional changes of pain-associated genes in primary sensory neurons of DRG are critical for neuropathic pain genesis. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)-triggered DNA methylation silences gene expression. We show here that DNMT1, a canonical maintenance methyltransferase, acts as the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; DNMT and is required for neuropathic pain genesis likely through repressing at least DRG &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in male mice. Peripheral nerve injury upregulated DNMT1 expression in the injured DRG through the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein-triggered transcriptional activation of &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; gene. Blocking this upregulation prevented nerve injury-induced DNA methylation within the promoter and 5'-untranslated region of &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene, rescued &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; expression and total Kv current, attenuated hyperexcitability in the injured DRG neurons, and alleviated nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivities. Given that &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; is a key player in neuropathic pain, our findings suggest that DRG DNMT1 may be a potential target for neuropathic pain management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the present study, we reported that DNMT1, a canonical DNA maintenance methyltransferase, is upregulated via the activation of the transcription factor CREB in the injured DRG after peripheral nerve injury. This upregulation was responsible for nerve injury-induced &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; DNA methylation within the promoter and 5'-untranslated region of the &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene, reductions in &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; expression and Kv current and increases in neuronal excitability in the injured DRG. Since pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of DRG DNMT1 alleviated nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivities, DRG DNMT1 contributes to neuropathic pain genesis partially through repression of DRG &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Cell transplantation therapy provides a regenerative strategy for neural repair. We tested the hypothesis that selective excitation of transplanted induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPS-NPCs) could recapitulate an activity-enriched microenvironment that confers regenerative benefits for the treatment of stroke. Mouse iPS-NPCs were transduced with a novel optochemogenetics fusion protein, luminopsin 3 (LMO3), which consisted of a bioluminescent luciferase, &lt;i&gt;Gaussia&lt;/i&gt; luciferase, and an opsin, &lt;i&gt;Volvox&lt;/i&gt; Channelrhodopsin 1. These LMO3-iPS-NPCs can be activated by either photostimulation using light or by the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; stimulations of LMO3-iPS-NPCs increased expression of synapsin-1, postsynaptic density 95, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and stromal cell-derived factor 1 and promoted neurite outgrowth. After transplantation into the ischemic cortex of mice, LMO3-iPS-NPCs differentiated into mature neurons. Synapse formation between implanted and host neurons was identified using immunogold electron microscopy and patch-clamp recordings. Stimulation of transplanted cells with daily intranasal administration of CTZ enhanced axonal myelination, synaptic transmission, improved thalamocortical connectivity, and functional recovery. Patch-clamp and multielectrode array recordings in brain slices showed that CTZ or light stimulation facilitated synaptic transmission and induced neuroplasticity mimicking the LTP of EPSPs. Stroke mice received the combined LMO3-iPS-NPC/CTZ treatment, but not cell or CTZ alone, showed enhanced neural network connections in the peri-infarct region, promoted optimal functional recoveries after stroke in male and female, young and aged mice. Thus, excitation of transplanted cells via the noninvasive optochemogenetics treatment provides a novel integrative cell therapy with comprehensive regenerative benefits after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural network reconnection is critical for repairing damaged brain. Strategies that promote this repair are expected to improve functional outcomes. This study pioneers the generation and application of an optochemogenetics approach in stem cell transplantation therapy after stroke for optimal neural repair and functional recovery. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPS-NPCs) expressing the novel optochemogenetic probe luminopsin (LMO3), and intranasally delivered luciferase substrate coelenterazine, we show enhanced regenerative properties of LMO3-iPS-NPCs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and after transplantation into the ischemic brain of different genders and ages. The noninvasive repeated coelenterazine stimulation of transplanted cells is feasible for clinical applications. The synergetic effects of the combinatorial cell therapy may have significant impacts on regenerative approach for treatments of CNS injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Artificial agents are becoming prevalent across human life domains. However, the neural mechanisms underlying human responses to these new, artificial social partners remain unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis predicts that humans prefer anthropomorphic agents but reject them if they become too humanlike—the so-called UV reaction. Using fMRI, we investigated neural activity when subjects evaluated artificial agents and made decisions about them. Across two experimental tasks, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) encoded an explicit representation of subjects' UV reactions. Specifically, VMPFC signaled the subjective likability of artificial agents as a nonlinear function of humanlikeness, with selective low likability for highly humanlike agents. In exploratory across-subject analyses, these effects explained individual differences in psychophysical evaluations and preference choices. Functionally connected areas encoded critical inputs for these signals: the temporoparietal junction encoded a linear humanlikeness continuum, whereas nonlinear representations of humanlikeness in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and fusiform gyrus emphasized a human–nonhuman distinction. Following principles of multisensory integration, multiplicative combination of these signals reconstructed VMPFC's valuation function. During decision making, separate signals in VMPFC and DMPFC encoded subjects' decision variable for choices involving humans or artificial agents, respectively. A distinct amygdala signal predicted rejection of artificial agents. Our data suggest that human reactions toward artificial agents are governed by a neural mechanism that generates a selective, nonlinear valuation in response to a specific feature combination (humanlikeness in nonhuman agents). Thus, a basic principle known from sensory coding—neural feature selectivity from linear–nonlinear transformation—may also underlie human responses to artificial social partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Would you trust a robot to make decisions for you? Autonomous artificial agents are increasingly entering our lives, but how the human brain responds to these new artificial social partners remains unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis—an influential psychological framework—captures the observation that human responses to artificial agents are nonlinear: we like increasingly anthropomorphic artificial agents, but feel uncomfortable if they become too humanlike. Here we investigated neural activity when humans evaluated artificial agents and made personal decisions about them. Our findings suggest a novel neurobiological conceptualization of human responses toward artificial agents: the UV reaction—a selective dislike of highly humanlike agents—is based on nonlinear value-coding in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a key component of the brain's reward system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Overly stable visual perception seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is related to higher-order core symptoms of the condition. However, the neural basis by which these seemingly different symptoms are simultaneously observed in individuals with ASD remains unclear. Here, we aimed to identify such a neuroanatomical substrate linking perceptual stability to autistic cognitive rigidity, a part of core restricted, repetitive behaviors (RRBs). First, using a bistable visual perception test, we measured the perceptual stability of 22 high-functioning adults with ASD and 22 age-, IQ-, and sex-matched typically developing human individuals and confirmed overstable visual perception in autism. Next, using a spontaneous task-switching (TS) test, we showed that the individuals with ASD were more likely to repeat the same task voluntarily and spontaneously, and such rigid TS behavior was associated with the severity of their RRB symptoms. We then compared these perceptual and cognitive behaviors and found a significant correlation between them for individuals with ASD. Finally, we found that this behavioral link was supported by a smaller gray matter volume (GMV) of the posterior superior parietal lobule (pSPL) in individuals with ASD. Moreover, this smaller GMV in the pSPL was also associated with the RRB symptoms and replicated in two independent datasets. Our findings suggest that the pSPL could be one of the neuroanatomical mediators of cognitive and perceptual inflexibility in autism, which could help a unified biological understanding of the mechanisms underpinning diverse symptoms of this developmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Behavioral studies show perceptual overstability in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the neural mechanisms by which such sensory symptoms can coexist and often correlate with seemingly separate core symptoms remain unknown. Here, we have identified such a key neuroanatomical substrate. We have revealed that overstable sensory perception of individuals with ASD is linked with their cognitive rigidity, a part of core restricted, repetitive behavior symptoms, and such a behavioral link is underpinned by a smaller gray matter volume in the posterior superior parietal lobule in autism. These findings uncover a key neuroanatomical mediator of autistic perceptual and cognitive inflexibility and would ignite future studies on how the core symptoms of ASD interact with its unique sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A common symptom of anxiety disorders is the overgeneralization of fear across a broad range of contextual cues. We previously found that the ACC and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) regulate generalized fear. Here, we investigate the functional projections from the ACC and vHPC to the amygdala and their role in governing generalized fear in a preclinical rodent model. A chemogenetic approach (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs) was used to inhibit glutamatergic projections from the ACC or vHPC that terminate within the BLA at recent (1 d) or remote (28 d) time points after contextually fear conditioning male mice. Inactivating ACC or vHPC projections to the BLA significantly reduced generalized fear to a novel, nonthreatening context but had no effect on fear to the training context. Further, our data indicate that the ACC-BLA circuit supports generalization in a time-independent manner. We also identified, for the first time, a strictly time-dependent role of the vHPC-BLA circuit in supporting remote generalized contextual fear. Dysfunctional signaling to the amygdala from the ACC or the HPC could underlie overgeneralized fear responses that are associated with anxiety disorders. Our findings demonstrate that the ACC and vHPC regulate fear expressed in novel, nonthreatening environments via projections to the BLA but do so as a result of training intensity or time, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Anxiety disorders are characterized by a common symptom that promotes overgeneralization of fear in nonthreatening environments. Dysregulation of the amygdala, ACC, or hippocampus (HPC) has been hypothesized to contribute to increased fear associated with anxiety disorders. Our findings show that the ACC and HPC projections to the BLA regulate generalized fear in nonthreatening, environments. However, descending ACC projections control fear generalization independent of time, whereas HPC projections play a strictly time-dependent role in regulating generalized fear. Thus, dysfunctional ACC/HPC signaling to the BLA may be a predominant underlying mechanism of nonspecific fear associated with anxiety disorders. Our data have important implications for predictions made by theories about aging memories and interactions between the HPC and cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent studies showed agreement between how the human brain and neural networks represent objects, suggesting that we might start to understand the underlying computations. However, we know that the human brain is prone to biases at many perceptual and cognitive levels, often shaped by learning history and evolutionary constraints. Here, we explore one such perceptual phenomenon, perceiving animacy, and use the performance of neural networks as a benchmark. We performed an fMRI study that dissociated object appearance (what an object looks like) from object category (animate or inanimate) by constructing a stimulus set that includes animate objects (e.g., a cow), typical inanimate objects (e.g., a mug), and, crucially, inanimate objects that look like the animate objects (e.g., a cow mug). Behavioral judgments and deep neural networks categorized images mainly by animacy, setting all objects (lookalike and inanimate) apart from the animate ones. In contrast, activity patterns in ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VTC) were better explained by object appearance: animals and lookalikes were similarly represented and separated from the inanimate objects. Furthermore, the appearance of an object interfered with proper object identification, such as failing to signal that a cow mug is a mug. The preference in VTC to represent a lookalike as animate was even present when participants performed a task requiring them to report the lookalikes as inanimate. In conclusion, VTC representations, in contrast to neural networks, fail to represent objects when visual appearance is dissociated from animacy, probably due to a preferred processing of visual features typical of animate objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How does the brain represent objects that we perceive around us? Recent advances in artificial intelligence have suggested that object categorization and its neural correlates have now been approximated by neural networks. Here, we show that neural networks can predict animacy according to human behavior but do not explain visual cortex representations. In ventral occipitotemporal cortex, neural activity patterns were strongly biased toward object appearance, to the extent that objects with visual features resembling animals were represented closely to real animals and separated from other objects from the same category. This organization that privileges animals and their features over objects might be the result of learning history and evolutionary constraints.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The way the human brain represents speech in memory is still unknown. An obvious characteristic of speech is its evolvement over time. During speech processing, neural oscillations are modulated by the temporal properties of the acoustic speech signal, but also acquired knowledge on the temporal structure of language influences speech perception-related brain activity. This suggests that speech could be represented in the temporal domain, a form of representation that the brain also uses to encode autobiographic memories. Empirical evidence for such a memory code is lacking. We investigated the nature of speech memory representations using direct cortical recordings in the left perisylvian cortex during delayed sentence reproduction in female and male patients undergoing awake tumor surgery. Our results reveal that the brain endogenously represents speech in the temporal domain. Temporal pattern similarity analyses revealed that the phase of frontotemporal low-frequency oscillations, primarily in the beta range, represents sentence identity in working memory. The positive relationship between beta power during working memory and task performance suggests that working memory representations benefit from increased phase separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Memory is an endogenous source of information based on experience. While neural oscillations encode autobiographic memories in the temporal domain, little is known on their contribution to memory representations of human speech. Our electrocortical recordings in participants who maintain sentences in memory identify the phase of left frontotemporal beta oscillations as the most prominent information carrier of sentence identity. These observations provide evidence for a theoretical model on speech memory representations and explain why interfering with beta oscillations in the left inferior frontal cortex diminishes verbal working memory capacity. The lack of sentence identity coding at the syllabic rate suggests that sentences are represented in memory in a more abstract form compared with speech coding during speech perception and production.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how sensory stimuli give rise to perception, especially when the process is supported by neural activity from an extended network of brain areas. Perception is inherently subjective, so interrogating its neural signatures requires, ideally, a combination of three factors: (1) behavioral tasks that separate stimulus-driven activity from perception per se; (2) human subjects who self-report their percepts while performing those tasks; and (3) concurrent neural recordings acquired at high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we analyzed human electrocorticographic recordings obtained during an auditory task which supported mutually exclusive perceptual interpretations. Eight neurosurgical patients (5 male; 3 female) listened to sequences of repeated triplets where tones were separated in frequency by several semitones. Subjects reported spontaneous alternations between two auditory perceptual states, 1-stream and 2-stream, by pressing a button. We compared averaged auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) associated with 1-stream and 2-stream percepts and identified significant differences between them in primary and nonprimary auditory cortex, surrounding auditory-related temporoparietal cortex, and frontal areas. We developed classifiers to identify spatial maps of percept-related differences in the AEP, corroborating findings from statistical analysis. We used one-dimensional embedding spaces to perform the group-level analysis. Our data illustrate exemplar high temporal resolution AEP waveforms in auditory core region; explain inconsistencies in perceptual effects within auditory cortex, reported across noninvasive studies of streaming of triplets; show percept-related changes in frontoparietal areas previously highlighted by studies that focused on perceptual transitions; and demonstrate that auditory cortex encodes maintenance of percepts and switches between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The human brain has the remarkable ability to discern complex and ambiguous stimuli from the external world by parsing mixed inputs into interpretable segments. However, one's perception can deviate from objective reality. But how do perceptual discrepancies occur? What are their anatomical substrates? To address these questions, we performed intracranial recordings in neurosurgical patients as they reported their perception of sounds associated with two mutually exclusive interpretations. We identified signatures of subjective percepts as distinct from sound-driven brain activity in core and non-core auditory cortex and frontoparietal cortex. These findings were compared with previous studies of auditory bistable perception and suggested that perceptual transitions and maintenance of perceptual states were supported by common neural substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA play essential roles in adaptive motivated behavior, which requires rapid discrimination between positive and negative motivational signature. However, the precise functional DA circuitry processing reward and aversive information remain elusive. Here, we report that the encoding of reward and aversion by the DA system in the NAc is tightly associated with its anatomical location. By recording the dynamics of DA release with genetically encoded fluorescent DA sensor using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; fiber photometry in freely moving male mice, we found that the DA-sensor signal in the dorsomedial NAc shell and dorsolateral NAc shell were increased during rewarding events and decreased during aversive noxious events. In contrast, the release of DA in the ventromedial NAc shell was increased by both rewarding and aversive stimuli, whereas the DA-sensor signal in the central ventromedial NAc shell and ventrolateral NAc shell showed complex dynamics. Furthermore, the activity of DA fibers in different subregions of NAc measured with calcium sensor largely recapitulated the changes of DA-sensor signal in response to rewarding and aversive stimuli. In addition, correlation analysis showed that the response magnitude of DA-sensor or fibers significantly changed along the DV axis of the NAc. These results revealed the distinct role of the mesolimbic DA system in different subregions of NAc in encoding value and salience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adaptive motivated behavior requires rapid discrimination between favorable and harmful events and is dynamically modulated by dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA. However, the precise relationship between distinct DA circuitry and reward/aversion signal encoding is not well understood. Here, by recording the dynamics of DA release and the activity of DA fibers in each subregion of the NAc using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; fiber photometry in freely moving animals, we found that the DA system in the dorsomedial/dorsolateral, ventromedial, and ventrolateral NAc shell plays different roles in encoding value and salience. These results extend our knowledge about how the mesolimbic DA system process motivational information at the circuitry level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Command or Obey? Homologous Neurons Differ in Hierarchical Position for the Generation of Homologous Behaviors</title>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In motor systems, higher-order neurons provide commands to lower-level central pattern generators (CPGs) that autonomously produce rhythmic motor patterns. Such hierarchical organization is often thought to be inherent in the anatomical position of the neurons. Here, however, we report that a neuron that is member of a CPG in one species acts as a higher-order neuron in another species. In the nudibranch mollusc, &lt;i&gt;Melibe leonina&lt;/i&gt;, swim interneuron 1 (Si1) is in the CPG underlying swimming, firing rhythmic bursts of action potentials as part of the swim motor pattern. We found that its homolog in another nudibranch, &lt;i&gt;Dendronotus iris&lt;/i&gt;, serves as a neuromodulatory command neuron for the CPG of a homologous swimming behavior. In &lt;i&gt;Dendronotus&lt;/i&gt;, Si1 fired irregularly throughout the swim motor pattern. The burst and spike frequencies of &lt;i&gt;Dendronotus&lt;/i&gt; swim CPG neurons correlated with Si1 firing frequency. Si1 activity was both necessary and sufficient for the initiation and maintenance of the swim motor pattern. Each Si1 was electrically coupled to all of the CPG neurons and made monosynaptic excitatory synapses with both Si3s. Si1 also bilaterally potentiated the excitatory synapse from Si3 to Si2. &quot;Virtual neuromodulation&quot; of both Si3-to-Si2 synapses using dynamic clamp combined with depolarization of both Si3s mimicked the effects of Si1 stimulation on the swim motor pattern. Thus, in &lt;i&gt;Dendronotus&lt;/i&gt;, Si1 is a command neuron that turns on, maintains, and accelerates the motor pattern through synaptic and neuromodulatory actions, thereby differing from its homolog in &lt;i&gt;Melibe&lt;/i&gt; in its functional position in the motor hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cross-species comparisons of motor system organization can provide fundamental insights into their function and origin. Central pattern generators (CPGs) are lower in the functional hierarchy than the neurons that initiate and modulate their activity. This functional hierarchy is often reflected in neuroanatomical organization. This paper definitively shows that an identified cerebral ganglion neuron that is a member of a CPG underlying swimming in one nudibranch species serves as a command neuron for the same behavior in another species. We describe and test the synaptic and neuromodulatory mechanisms by which the command neuron initiates and accelerates rhythmic motor patterns. Thus, the functional position of neurons in a motor hierarchy can shift from one level to another over evolutionary time.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal circuits regulating hunger and satiety synthesize information encoding the energy state of the animal and translate those signals into motivated behaviors to meet homeostatic needs. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are activated by energy surfeits and inhibited by energy deficits. When activated, these cells inhibit food intake and facilitate weight loss. Conversely, decreased activity in POMC cells is associated with increased food intake and obesity. Circulating nutrients and hormones modulate the activity of POMC neurons over protracted periods of time. However, recent work indicates that calcium activity in POMC cells changes in response to food cues on times scales consistent with the rapid actions of amino acid transmitters. Indeed, the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) onto POMC neurons increases during caloric deficits. However, the afferent brain regions responsible for this inhibitory modulation are currently unknown. Here, through the use of brain region-specific deletion of GABA release in both male and female mice we show that neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) are responsible for the majority of sIPSCs in POMC neurons as well as the fasting-induced increase in sIPSC frequency. Further, the readily releasable pool of GABA vesicles and the release probability of GABA is increased at DMH-to-POMC synapses following an overnight fast. Collectively these data provide evidence that DMH-to-POMC GABA circuitry conveys inhibitory neuromodulation onto POMC cells that is sensitive to the animal's energy state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Activation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) cells signals satiety, whereas GABAergic cells in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) can increase food consumption. However, communication between these cells, particularly in response to changes in metabolic state, is unknown. Here, through targeted inhibition of DMH GABA release, we show that DMH neurons contribute a significant portion of spontaneously released GABA onto POMC cells and are responsible for increased GABAergic inhibition of POMC cells during fasting, likely mediated through increased release probability of GABA at DMH terminals. These data provide important information about inhibitory modulation of metabolic circuitry and provide a mechanism through which POMC neurons could be inhibited, or disinhibited, rapidly in response to food availability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/33/6439?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Abacus-based mental calculation (AMC) involves temporary storage and manipulation of an imaginary abacus closely related to the function of visuospatial working memory (VSWM). The present study thus investigated the effects of AMC training on VSWM and its neural correlates. A total of 144 human subjects (67 boys) were assigned to AMC or control groups at their entry to primary school. The AMC group received 2 h AMC training per week for 5 school years, whereas the control group spent the time in activities, such as conventional calculation and reading. Raven's Intelligence Test was administered both before and after training. Two arithmetic tests and a VSWM task were conducted after training. Among these participants, fMRI data were collected from 64 children for the VSWM task. Behavioral results indicated that the AMC group outperformed controls on both arithmetic and VSWM tasks, but not on Raven's Intelligence Test. While the two groups activated similar regions during the VSWM task, the AMC group showed greater activation than the controls in frontal, parietal, and occipital areas. Interestingly, the activation of right middle frontal gyrus mediated the relation between the arithmetic ability and the VSWM performance in the AMC group, suggesting that the frontal region may be the neural substrate underlying the transfer effect from AMC training to VSWM. Although the transfer effects seem quite limited considering the length and intensity of the training, these findings suggest that long-term AMC training not only improves arithmetic ability but also has a potential positive effect on VSWM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Plasticity of working memory is one of the most rapidly expanding research fields in the developmental and cognitive sciences. Previous studies suggest that abacus-based mental calculation (AMC) relies on a visuospatial imaginary strategy, which is closely related to visuospatial working memory (VSWM). However, the impacts of AMC training on VSWM and the underlying neural basis remain unclear. Here, we found that AMC training enhanced VSWM in children, which was accompanied by altered activation in frontal, parietal, and occipital areas. Moreover, we observed that activation in right middle frontal gyrus played a significant mediation role in the transfer of AMC training to VSWM. These findings provide a new perspective to VSWM training and also advance our understanding of related brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/33/6425?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;During nervous system development, axons often undergo elaborate changes in branching patterns before circuits have achieved their mature patterns of innervation. In the auditory system, type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) project their peripheral axons into the cochlear epithelium and then undergo a process of branch refinement before forming synapses with sensory hair cells. Here, we report that Semaphorin-5B (Sema5B) acts as an important mediator of this process. During cochlear development in mouse, immature hair cells express Sema5B, whereas the SGNs express both PlexinA1 and PlexinA3, which are known Sema5B receptors. In these studies, genetic sparse labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques were leveraged to determine the morphologies of individual type I SGNs after manipulations of Sema5B signaling. Treating cultured mouse cochleae with Sema5B-Fc (to activate Plexin-As) led to type I SGNs with less numerous, but longer terminal branches. Conversely, cochleae from &lt;i&gt;Sema5b&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice showed type I SGNs with more numerous, but shorter terminal branches. In addition, conditional loss of &lt;i&gt;Plxna1&lt;/i&gt; in SGNs (using &lt;i&gt;Bhlhb5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;) led to increased type I SGN branching, suggesting that PlexinA1 normally responds to Sema5B in this process. In these studies, mice of either sex were used. The data presented here suggest that Sema5B-PlexinA1 signaling limits SGN terminal branch numbers without causing axonal repulsion, which is a role that distinguishes Sema5B from other Semaphorins in cochlear development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The sensorineural components of the cochlea include hair cells, which respond mechanically to sound waves, and afferent spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which respond to glutamate released by hair cells and transmit auditory information into the CNS. An important component of synapse formation in the cochlea is a process of SGN &quot;debranching&quot; whereby SGNs lose extraneous branches before developing unramified bouton endings that contact the hair cells. In this work, we have found that the transmembrane ligand Semaphorin-5B and its receptor PlexinA1 regulate the debranching process. The results in this report provide new knowledge regarding the molecular control of cochlear afferent innervation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/33/6414?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In addition to analgesia, opioids produce opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) and neuroplasticity characterized by prolongation of inflammatory-mediator-induced hyperalgesia (hyperalgesic priming). We evaluated the hypothesis that hyperalgesia and priming induced by opioids are mediated by similar nociceptor mechanisms. In male rats, we first evaluated the role of nociceptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in OIH and priming induced by systemic low-dose morphine (LDM, 0.03 mg/kg). Intrathecal oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to TLR4 mRNA (TLR4 AS-ODN) prevented OIH and prolongation of prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hyperalgesia (priming) induced by LDM. In contrast, high-dose morphine (HDM, 3 mg/kg) increased nociceptive threshold (analgesia) and induced priming, neither of which was attenuated by TLR4 AS-ODN. Protein kinase C  (PKC) AS-ODN also prevented LDM-induced hyperalgesia and priming, whereas analgesia and priming induced by HDM were unaffected. Treatment with isolectin B4 (IB4)-saporin or SSP-saporin (which deplete IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and peptidergic nociceptors, respectively), or their combination, prevented systemic LDM-induced hyperalgesia, but not priming. HDM-induced priming, but not analgesia, was markedly attenuated in both saporin-treated groups. In conclusion, whereas OIH and priming induced by LDM share receptor and second messenger mechanisms in common, action at TLR4 and signaling via PKC, HDM-induced analgesia, and priming are neither TLR4 nor PKC dependent. OIH produced by LDM is mediated by both IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and peptidergic nociceptors, whereas priming is not dependent on the same population. In contrast, priming induced by HDM is mediated by both IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and peptidergic nociceptors. Implications for the use of low-dose opioids combined with nonopioid analgesics and in the treatment of opioid use disorder are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) and priming are common side effects of opioid agonists such as morphine, which acts at μ-opioid receptors. We demonstrate that OIH and priming induced by systemic low-dose morphine (LDM) share action at Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and signaling via protein kinase C  (PKC) in common, whereas systemic high-dose morphine (HDM)-induced analgesia and priming are neither TLR4 nor PKC dependent. OIH produced by systemic LDM is mediated by isolectin B4-positive (IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and peptidergic nociceptors, whereas priming is dependent on a different class of nociceptors. Priming induced by systemic HDM is, however, mediated by both IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings may provide useful information for the use of low-dose opioids combined with nonopioid analgesics to treat pain and opioid use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/33/6399?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal activity from the entorhinal cortex propagates through the perforant path (PP) to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) where information is filtered and converted into sparse hippocampal code. Nearly simultaneous signaling to both granule cells (GC) and local interneurons (INs) engages network interactions that will modulate input integration and output generation. When triggered, GABA release from interneurons counteracts the glutamatergic signals of PP terminals, scaling down the overall DG activation. Inhibition occurs at fast or slow timescales depending on the activation of ionotropic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-R or metabotropic GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;-R. Although postsynaptic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;-R differ in their location at the synapse, mixed GABA&lt;sub&gt;A/B&lt;/sub&gt;-R IPSPs can also occur. Here we describe a slow inhibition mechanism in mouse GCs recorded from either sex, mediated by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A/B&lt;/sub&gt;-R in combination with metabotropic glutamate receptors. Short burst PP stimulation in the gamma frequency range lead to a long-lasting hyperpolarization (LLH) of the GCs with a duration that exceeds GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;-R IPSPs. As a result, LLH alters GC firing patterns and the responses to concomitant excitatory signals are also affected. Synaptic recruitment of feedforward inhibition and subsequent GABA release from interneurons, also successfully trigger mixed GABA responses in GCs. Together these results suggest that slow inhibition through LLH leads to reduced excitability of GCs during entorhinal input integration. The implication of LLH in regulation of neuronal excitability suggests it also contributes to the sparse population coding in DG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our study describes a long-lasting hyperpolarization (LLH) in hippocampal granule cells. We used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and an optogenetic approach to characterize this event. LLH is a slow inhibitory mechanism that occurs following the stimulation of the perforant pathway in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. We found that it is mediated via postsynaptic ionotropic and metabotropic GABA and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The duration of LLH exceeds previously described IPSPs mediated by any of these receptors. The activation of LLH requires presynaptic gamma frequency bursts and recruitment of the local feedforward inhibition. LLH defines prolonged periods of low excitability of GCs and a restrained neuronal discharge. Our results suggest that LLH can contribute to sparse activation of GCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The human cerebral cortex is a complex structure with tightly interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks. In order to study human cortical function, we recently developed a method to generate cortical neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that form both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks resembling the composition of the human cortex. These cultures and organoids recapitulate neuronal populations representative of the six cortical layers and a balanced excitatory and inhibitory network that is functional and homeostatically stable. To determine if hiPSC-derived neurons can integrate and retain physiologic activities &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we labeled hiPSCs with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and introduced hiPSC-derived neural progenitors to rat brains. Efficient neural induction, followed by differentiation resulted in a RFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neural population with traits of forebrain identity and a balanced synaptic activity composed of both excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Ten weeks after transplantation, grafted cells structurally integrated into the rat forebrain. Remarkably, these hiPSC-derived neurons were able to fire, exhibiting both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which culminates in the establishment of neuronal connectivity with the host circuitry. This study demonstrates that neural progenitors derived from hiPSCs can differentiate into functional cortical neurons and can participate in neural network activity through functional synaptic integration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, thereby contributing to information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We recently developed a differentiation method based on rosette neural aggregates (termed RONAs) to generate balanced excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). It is not yet known whether human neurons derived from this method can survive and function following transplantation into an intact rat brain. To address this question, we studied the properties of grafted hiPSC-derived neurons labeled with RFP, which display stereotypical neuronal behavior, including firing, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity, and receive synaptic inputs from host neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) are pentameric ionotropic channels. Subunit composition of the receptors is associated with the affinity of GABA binding and its downstream inhibitory actions. Fluctuations in subunit expression levels with increasing age have been demonstrated in animal and human studies. However, our knowledge regarding the age-related hippocampal GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R expression changes is limited and based on rat studies. This study is the first analysis of the aging-related changes of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R subunit expression in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus regions of the mouse hippocampus. Using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry we found that the GABAergic system is robust, with no significant age-related differences in GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α1, α2, α3, α5, β3, and 2 subunit expression level differences found between the young (6 months) and old (21 months) age groups in any of the hippocampal regions examined. However, we detected a localized decrease of α2 subunit expression around the soma, proximal dendrites, and in the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions that is accompanied by a pronounced upregulation of the α2 subunit immunoreactivity in the neuropil of aged mice. In summary, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs are well preserved in the mouse hippocampus during normal aging although GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs in the hippocampus are severely affected in age-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neural processing of language is still among the most poorly understood functions of the human brain, whereas a need to objectively assess the neurocognitive status of the language function in a participant-friendly and noninvasive fashion arises in various situations. Here, we propose a solution for this based on a short task-free recording of MEG responses to a set of spoken linguistic contrasts. We used spoken stimuli that diverged lexically (words/pseudowords), semantically (action-related/abstract), or morphosyntactically (grammatically correct/ungrammatical). Based on beamformer source reconstruction we investigated intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) in five canonical bands (α, β, and low, medium, and high ) using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Using this approach, we could successfully classify brain responses to meaningful words from meaningless pseudowords, correct from incorrect syntax, as well as semantic differences. The best classification results indicated distributed patterns of activity dominated by core temporofrontal language circuits and complemented by other areas. They varied between the different neurolinguistic properties across frequency bands, with lexical processes classified predominantly by broad , semantic distinctions by α and β, and syntax by low  feature patterns. Crucially, all types of processing commenced in a near-parallel fashion from ~100 ms after the auditory information allowed for disambiguating the spoken input. This shows that individual neurolinguistic processes take place simultaneously and involve overlapping yet distinct neuronal networks that operate at different frequency bands. This brings further hope that brain imaging can be used to assess neurolinguistic processes objectively and noninvasively in a range of populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Human skill learning is marked by a gradual decrease in reaction time (RT) and errors as the skill is acquired. To better understand the influence of brain areas thought to be involved in skill learning, we trained mice to associate visual-spatial cues with specific motor behaviors for a water reward. Task acquisition occurred over weeks and performance approximated a power function as often found with human skill learning. Using optogenetics we suppressed the primary visual cortex (V1), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), or dorsal hippocampus (dHC) on 20% of trials at different stages of learning. Intermittent suppression of the V1 greatly reduced task performance on suppressed trials across multiple stages but did not change the overall rate of learning. In accord with some recent models of skill learning, ACC suppression produced higher error rates on suppressed trials throughout learning the skill, with effects intensifying in the later stages. This would suggest that cognitive influences mediated by the anterior cingulate continue throughout learning. Suppression of the hippocampus only modestly affected performance, with largely similar effects seen across stages. These results indicate different degrees of V1, ACC, and dHC involvement in acquisition and performance of this visual-spatial task and that the structures operate in parallel, and not in series, across learning stages.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as focal neurological deficit caused by ischemia resolving within 24 hours. In a secondary analysis of a large monocentric cohort of 446 TIA patients, we explored the frequency and determinants of diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) lesions on high‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, 240 (54%) of all TIA patients presented with DWI lesions. These patients had higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and ABCD2 scores and presented more frequently with vessel occlusion and perfusion deficits, but had similar functional outcome at 3 months. Taken together, high‐resolution DWI provides evidence of ischemic brain injury in the majority of TIA patients. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:452–457&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) starts in early childhood with loss of visual acuity and color vision deficits. &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are responsible for the majority of cases, but in a portion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of ADOA, the cause remains unknown. This study aimed to identify novel ADOA‐associated genes and explore their causality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage analysis and sequencing were performed in multigeneration families and unrelated patients to identify disease‐causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated in silico and confirmed experimentally using the zebrafish model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We defined a new ADOA locus on 7q33‐q35 and identified 3 different missense variants in &lt;i&gt;SSBP1&lt;/i&gt; (NM_001256510.1; c.113G&amp;gt;A [p.(Arg38Gln)], c.320G&amp;gt;A [p.(Arg107Gln)] and c.422G&amp;gt;A [p.(Ser141Asn)]) in affected individuals from 2 families and 2 singletons with ADOA and variable retinal degeneration. The mutated arginine residues are part of a basic patch that is essential for single‐strand DNA binding. The loss of a positive charge at these positions is very likely to lower the affinity of SSBP1 for single‐strand DNA. Antisense‐mediated knockdown of endogenous &lt;i&gt;ssbp1&lt;/i&gt; messenger RNA (mRNA) in zebrafish resulted in compromised differentiation of retinal ganglion cells. A similar effect was achieved when mutated mRNAs were administered. These findings point toward an essential role of &lt;i&gt;ssbp1&lt;/i&gt; in retinal development and the dominant‐negative nature of the identified human variants, which is consistent with the segregation pattern observed in 2 multigeneration families studied.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSBP1 is an essential protein for mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance. Our data have established pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SSBP1&lt;/i&gt; as a cause of ADOA and variable retinal degeneration. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:368–383&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In this work, we present 3 patients with SMA type 0 who survived &amp;gt;1 year and presented diffuse and progressive brain abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging, which are not usually seen in patients with SMA. Thus, severe brain involvement may likely be the full end manifestation of an already extreme SMA phenotype caused by substantial reduction of the SMN protein in the brain.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantification of gait with wearable technology is promising; recent cross‐sectional studies showed that gait characteristics are potential prodromal markers for Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of this longitudinal prospective observational study was to establish gait impairments and trajectories in the prodromal phase of PD, identifying which gait characteristics are potentially early diagnostic markers of PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 696 healthy controls (mean age = 63 ± 7 years) recruited in the Tubingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration study were included. Assessments were performed longitudinally 4 times at 2‐year intervals, and people who converted to PD were identified. Participants were asked to walk at different speeds under single and dual tasking, with a wearable device placed on the lower back; 14 validated clinically relevant gait characteristics were quantified. Cox regression was used to examine whether gait at first visit could predict time to PD conversion after controlling for age and sex. Random effects linear mixed models (RELMs) were used to establish longitudinal trajectories of gait and model the latency between impaired gait and PD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen participants were diagnosed with PD on average 4.5 years after first visit (converters; PDC). Higher step time variability and asymmetry of all gait characteristics were associated with a shorter time to PD diagnosis. RELMs indicated that gait (lower pace) deviates from that of non‐PDC approximately 4 years prior to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with other prodromal markers, quantitative gait characteristics can play an important role in identifying prodromal PD and progression within this phase. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:357–367&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;In a sample of children with intractable epilepsy who underwent prospective resting‐state seizure onset zone (SOZ)‐targeted epilepsy surgery, postoperative resting‐state functional MRI (rs‐fMRI) was performed 6 to 12 months later. Graded normalization of the postoperative resting‐state SOZ was compared to seizure outcomes, patient, surgery, and anatomical MRI characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 64 cases were evaluated. Network‐targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs‐fMRI normalization was significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) correlated with seizure reduction, with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.83. Of 39 cases with postoperative rs‐fMRI SOZ normalization, 38 (97%) became completely seizure free. In contrast, of the 25 cases without complete rs‐fMRI SOZ normalization, only 3 (5%) became seizure free. The accuracy of rs‐fMRI as a biomarker predicting seizure freedom is 94%, with 96% sensitivity and 93% specificity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among seizure localization techniques in pediatric epilepsy, network‐targeted surgery, followed by postoperative rs‐fMRI normalization, has high correlation with seizure freedom. This study shows that rs‐fMRI SOZ can be used as a biomarker of the epileptogenic zone, and postoperative rs‐fMRI normalization is a biomarker for SOZ quiescence.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether soluble growth stimulation expressed gene 2 (sST2), a prognostic marker in cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders, is associated with neurological injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied SAH patients from 2 independent cohorts. Outcome assessments included functional status at 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), mortality, and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The relationships between sST2 plasma level and outcome measures were assessed in both cross‐sectional and longitudinal analysis. Primary blood mononuclear cells from SAH patients and elective aneurysm controls were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discovery cohort, sST2 predicted 90‐day mRS 3–6 (C index = 0.724, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and mortality in Kaplan–Meier analysis (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The association with functional status was independent of age, sex, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies score, modified Fisher score, treatment modality, and cardiac comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio = 2.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.04–5.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.039). Higher sST2 concentration was observed in those patients with DCI (90.8 vs 53.7ng/ml, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). These associations were confirmed in a replication cohort. In patients with high sST2, flow cytometry identified decreased expression of CD14 (4.27 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ± 2,950 arbitrary unit (AU) vs 5.64 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ± 1,290 AU, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and increased expression of CD16 (39,960 ± 272 AU vs 34,869 ± 183 AU, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma sST2 predicts DCI, functional outcome, and mortality after SAH, independent of clinical and radiographic markers. Elevated sST2 is also associated with changes in CD14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:384–394&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substantial clinical improvement in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT), combined with the poor response of proximal intracranial occlusions to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), led to questions regarding the utility of bridging therapy (BT; IVT followed by MT) compared to direct mechanical thrombectomy (dMT) for AIS patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to investigate the comparative safety and efficacy of BT and dMT in AIS patients. We included all observational studies and post hoc analyses from randomized controlled clinical trials that provided data on the outcomes of AIS patients with LVO stratified by IVT treatment status prior to MT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 38 eligible observational studies (11,798 LVO patients, mean age = 68 years, 56% treated with BT). In unadjusted analyses, BT was associated with a higher likelihood of 3‐month functional independence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32–1.76), 3‐month functional improvement (common OR [cOR] for 1‐point decrease in modified Rankin Scale score = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.18–1.97), early neurological improvement (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.83–1.76), successful recanalization (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.02–1.46), and successful recanalization with ≤2 device passes (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.43–3.64) compared to dMT. BT was also related to a lower likelihood of 3‐month mortality (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.57–0.73). In the adjusted analyses, BT was independently associated with a higher likelihood of 3‐month functional independence (adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.26–1.91) and lower odds of 3‐month mortality (adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66–0.97) compared to dMT. The two groups did not differ in functional improvement (adjusted cOR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.89–1.74) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.61–1.25).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT appears to be associated with improved functional independence without evidence for safety concerns, compared to dMT, for AIS patients with LVO. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:395–406&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to older Caucasians, older African Americans have higher risks of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) and lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau biomarker levels. It is not known whether tau‐related differences begin earlier in life or whether race modifies other AD‐related biomarkers such as inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed multiplex cytokine analysis in a healthy middle‐aged cohort with family history of AD (n = 68) and an older cohort (n = 125) with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment, or AD dementia. After determining baseline interleukin (IL)‐9 level and AD‐associated IL‐9 change to differ according to race, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for proteins mechanistically linked to IL‐9 in brains of African Americans and Caucasians (n = 38), and analyzed postmortem IL‐9–related gene expression profiles in the publicly available Mount Sinai cohort (26 African Americans and 180 Caucasians).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Caucasians with NC, African Americans with NC had lower CSF tau, p‐Tau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;, and IL‐9 levels in both living cohorts. Conversely, AD was only correlated with increased CSF IL‐9 levels in African Americans but not Caucasians. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed perivascular, neuronal, and glial cells immunoreactive to IL‐9, and quantitative analysis in independent US cohorts showed AD to correlate with molecular changes (upstream differentiation marker and downstream effector cell marker) of IL‐9 upregulation only in African Americans but not Caucasians.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline and AD‐associated IL‐9 differences between African Americans and Caucasians point to distinct molecular phenotypes for AD according to ancestry. Genetic and nongenetic factors need to be considered in future AD research involving unique populations. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:407–418&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Higher plasma total‐tau level is associated with incident dementia, but its relationship with stroke risk is unknown. In this prospective community‐based study, we evaluated plasma total‐tau level as a biomarker of stroke risk in 2,794 Framingham Heart Study participants. Persons with plasma total‐tau levels in the top quintile, versus the bottom 4, had an increased risk of incident stroke over a mean follow‐up of 8.3 years (hazard ratio = 2.01; 95% confidence interval = 1.32–3.08) following adjustments for age, sex, and stroke risk factors. Our findings demonstrate that plasma total‐tau relates to the risk of stroke in a community sample. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:463–467&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Mounting experimental evidence and decades of computational work have decisively shown that dendrites leverage a host of nonlinear biophysical phenomena and actively participate in sophisticated computations, at the level of the single neuron and at the level of the network. However, a coherent view of their processing power is still lacking and dendrites are largely neglected in neural network models. Here, we describe four classes of dendritic information processing and delineate their implications at the algorithmic level. We propose that beyond the well-known spatiotemporal filtering of their inputs, dendrites are capable of selecting, routing and multiplexing information. By separating dendritic processing from axonal outputs, neuron networks gain a degree of freedom with implications for perception and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Analyzing the force that a walking individual applies to the ground has been
proposed for identification purpose. Using end-to-end learning, I investigated
whether the center-of-pressure trajectory is sufficiently unique to identify a
person with a high certainty. Thirty-six adults walked on a treadmill equipped
with a force platform that recorded the positions of the center of pressure.
The raw two-dimensional signals were sliced into segments of two gait cycles. A
set of 20,250 segments from 30 subjects was used to configure and train
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best CNN classified a separated set
containing 2,250 segments with 99.9% overall accuracy. A second set of 4,500
segments from the six remaining subjects was then used for transfer learning.
Several small subsamples of this set were selected randomly and used for fine
tuning. Training with two segments per subject was sufficient to achieve 100%
accuracy. The results suggest that every person produces a unique trajectory of
underfoot pressures and that CNNs can learn the distinctive features of these
trajectories. Using transfer learning, a few strides could be sufficient to
learn and identify new gaits.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Continuous control and planning remains a major challenge in robotics and
machine learning. Neuroscience offers the possibility of learning from animal
brains that implement highly successful controllers, but it is unclear how to
relate an animal's behavior to control principles. Animals may not always act
optimally from the perspective of an external observer, but may still act
rationally: we hypothesize that animals choose actions with highest expected
future subjective value according to their own internal model of the world.
Their actions thus result from solving a different optimal control problem from
those on which they are evaluated in neuroscience experiments. With this
assumption, we propose a novel framework of model-based inverse rational
control that learns the agent's internal model that best explains their actions
in a task described as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).
In this approach we first learn optimal policies generalized over the entire
model space of dynamics and subjective rewards, using an extended Kalman filter
to represent the belief space, a neural network in the actor-critic framework
to optimize the policy, and a simplified basis for the parameter space. We then
compute the model that maximizes the likelihood of the experimentally
observable data comprising the agent's sensory observations and chosen actions.
Our proposed method is able to recover the true model of simulated agents
within theoretical error bounds given by limited data. We illustrate this
method by applying it to a complex naturalistic task currently used in
neuroscience experiments. This approach provides a foundation for interpreting
the behavioral and neural dynamics of highly adapted controllers in animal
brains.

 &lt;p&gt;Considering the very large body of knowledge which neuroimaging has put at
our fingertips over the last three decades we looked at the brain with a fresh
view which could unveil those 'old' things in new ways, in a framework which
could help us making predictions tailored made for a scrutiny with the
outstanding imaging instruments to come, such as ultra high field MRI. By doing
so, switching back and forth between physics and neurobiology, we came across
the view that time and space in the brain, as in the Universe, were, indeed,
tightly mingled, and could fade away to be unified through a brain 'spacetime'.
Considering that there is a speed limit for action potentials flowing along
myelinated axons further thinking led us to envision that this 4-dimensional
brain spacetime would obey a kind of relativistic pseudo-diffusion principle
and present a functional curvature governed by brain activity, in a similar way
gravitational masses give our 4-dimensional Universe spacetime its curvature.
We then looked at how this whole-brain framework may shed light on brain
dysfunction phenotypes (clinical expression of diseases) observed in some
neuropsychiatric and consciousness disorders.

 &lt;p&gt;Accurate diagnosis is crucial for preventing the progression of Parkinson's,
as well as improving the quality of life with individuals with Parkinson's
disease. In this paper, we develop a sex-specific and age-dependent
classification method to diagnose the Parkinson's disease using the online
handwriting recorded from individuals with
Parkinson's(n=37;m/f-19/18;age-69.3+-10.9years) and healthy
controls(n=38;m/f-20/18;age-62.4+-11.3 years).The sex specific and age
dependent classifier was observed significantly outperforming the generalized
classifier. An improved accuracy of 83.75%(SD+1.63) with female specific
classifier, and 79.55%(SD=1.58) with old age dependent classifier was observed
in comparison to 75.76%(SD=1.17) accuracy with the generalized classifier.
Finally, combining the age and sex information proved to be encouraging in
classification. We performed a rigorous analysis to observe the dominance of
sex specific and age dependent features for Parkinson's detection and ranked
them using the support vector machine(SVM) ranking method. Distinct set of
features were observed to be dominating for higher classification accuracy in
different category of classification.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05288"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We consider clustered small-world networks with both inhibitory (I) and
excitatory (E) populations. This I-E neuronal network has adaptive dynamic I to
E and E to I interpopulation synaptic strengths, governed by interpopulation
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDPs, fast
sparsely synchronized rhythms, related to diverse cognitive functions, were
found to appear in a range of noise intensity $D$ for static synaptic
strengths. By varying $D$, we investigate the effect of interpopulation STDPs
on diverse population and individual properties of fast sparsely synchronized
rhythms that emerge in both the I- and the E-populations. Depending on values
of $D$, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) for
population-averaged values of saturated interpopulation synaptic strengths are
found to occur, and they make effects on the degree of fast sparse
synchronization. In a broad region of intermediate $D$, the degree of good
synchronization (with higher spiking measure) becomes decreased, while in a
region of large $D$, the degree of bad synchronization (with lower spiking
measure) gets increased. Consequently, in each I- or E-population, the
synchronization degree becomes nearly the same in a wide range of $D$. This
kind of &quot;equalization effect&quot; is found to occur via cooperative interplay
between the average occupation and pacing degrees of fast sparsely synchronized
rhythms. We note that the equalization effect in interpopulation synaptic
plasticity is distinctly in contrast to the Matthew (bipolarization) effect in
intrapopulation (I to I and E to E) synaptic plasticity where good (bad)
synchronization gets better (worse). Finally, emergences of LTP and LTD of
interpopulation synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via a
microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre-
and the post-synaptic spike times.

		<content type="html">
 General anesthesia reversibly alters consciousness, without shutting down the brain globally. Depending on the anesthetic agent and dose, it may produce different consciousness states including a complete absence of subjective experience (unconsciousness), a conscious experience without perception of the environment (disconnected consciousness, like during dreaming), or episodes of oriented consciousness with awareness of the environment (connected consciousness). Each consciousness state may potentially be followed by explicit or implicit memories after the procedure. In this respect, anesthesia can be considered as a proxy to explore consciousness. During the recent years, progress in the exploration of brain function has allowed a better understanding of the neural correlates of consciousness, and of their alterations during anesthesia. Several changes in functional and effective between-region brain connectivity, consciousness network topology, and spatio-temporal dynamics of between-region interactions have been evidenced during anesthesia. Despite a set of effects that are common to many anesthetic agents, it is still uneasy to draw a comprehensive picture of the precise cascades during general anesthesia. Several questions remain unsolved, including the exact identification of the neural substrate of consciousness and its components, the detection of specific consciousness states in unresponsive patients and their associated memory processes, the processing of sensory information during anesthesia, the pharmacodynamic interactions between anesthetic agents, the direction-dependent hysteresis phenomenon during the transitions between consciousness states, the mechanisms of cognitive alterations that follow an anesthetic procedure, the identification of an eventual unitary mechanism of anesthesia-induced alteration of consciousness, the relationship between network effects and the biochemical or sleep-wake cycle targets of anesthetic agents, as well as the vast between-studies variations in dose and administration mode, leading to difficulties in between-studies comparisons. In this narrative review, we draw the picture of the current state of knowledge in anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, from insights gathered on propofol, halogenated vapors, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines and xenon. We also describe how anesthesia can help understanding consciousness, we develop the above-mentioned unresolved questions, and propose tracks for future research.</content>

 Properties of synaptic release dictates the core of information transfer in neural circuits. 
Despite decades of technical and theoretical advances, distinguishing bona fide information content from the multiple sources of synaptic variability remains a challenging problem. Here, we employed a combination of computational approaches with cellular electrophysiology, two-photon uncaging of MNI-Glutamate and imaging at single synapses. We describe and calibrate the use of the fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR  and  found that its kinetic profile is close to that of AMPA receptors, therefore providing several distinct advantages over slower methods relying on NMDA receptor activation (i.e., chemical or genetically encoded Calcium indicators). Using an array of statistical methods, we further developed, and validated on surrogate data, an expectation-maximization algorithm that, by biophysically constraining release variability, extracts the quantal parameters n (maximum number of released vesicles) and p (unitary probability of release) from single-synapse iGluSnFR-mediated transients. Together, we present a generalizable mathematical formalism which, when applied to optical recordings, paves the way to an increasingly precise investigation of information transfer at central synapses.</content>

 Secreted amyloid precursor protein-α (sAPPα) is a neuroprotective and memory-enhancing molecule, however the mechanisms through which sAPPα promotes these effects are not well understood. Recently, we have shown that sAPPα enhances cell-surface expression of glutamate receptors. Activity-related cytoskeletal-associated protein Arc (Arg3.1) is an immediate early gene capable of modulating long-term potentiation, long-term depression and homeostatic plasticity through regulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor localization. Accordingly, we hypothesized that sAPPα may enhance synaptic plasticity, in part, by the de novo synthesis of Arc. Using primary cortical and hippocampal neuronal cultures we found that sAPPα (1 nM, 2 h) enhances levels of Arc mRNA and protein. Arc protein levels were increased in both the neuronal somata and dendrites in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent manner. Additionally, dendritic Arc expression was dependent upon activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase G. The enhancement of dendritic Arc protein was significantly reduced by antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptors, and fully eliminated by dual application of these antagonists. This effect was further corroborated in area CA1 of acute hippocampal slices. These data suggest sAPPα-regulated plasticity within hippocampal neurons is mediated by cooperation of NMDA and α7nACh receptors to engage a cascade of signal transduction molecules to enhance the transcription and translation of Arc.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Since subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was standardized in 2014, there have been few studies reporting the risk factors and neuropsychological assessment characteristics of SCD (plus) in memory clinic.
Objective: To characterize SCD (plus) by comparing it with normal control (NC), amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and Alzheimer Disease (AD) regarding their demographics, lifestyle, family history of dementia, multimorbidity and the neuropsychological assessments.
Methods: A total of 135 participants were recruited, including 23 NC, 30 SCD (plus), 45 aMCI and 37 AD. Descriptive statistics were provided. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the affecting factors of SCD (plus), and finally the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to distinguish between SCD (plus) and NC.
Results: (1) SCD (plus) group was younger than both the aMCI group and AD group. It consisted of more participants with mental work and higher body mass index (BMI) than the AD group. (2) Scores of Auditory Verbal Learning Test - Immediate recall (AVLT-IR) and AVLT-Long delayed recall (AVLT-LR) decreased in the following order: NC→SCD (plus)→aMCI→AD. (3) The Area Under Curve (AUC) for discriminating SCD (plus) and NC group was from 0.673 to 0.838.
Conclusions: Ageing is an important risk factor of both NC progressing to SCD (plus), and SCD (plus) progressing to aMCI or AD. In addition to ageing, lower education level and lower BMI were significantly associated with greater odds of SCD (plus) progressing to aMCI or AD patients, whereas mental work was a protective factor of SCD (plus) progressing to AD. Finally, AVLT is a sensitive indicator of the cognitive decline and impairment in SCD (plus) in relative to normal controls.</content>

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common memory-impairment disorder frequently accompanied by olfactory identification (OI) impairments. In fact, OI is a valuable marker for distinguishing AD from normal age-related cognitive impairment and may predict the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-AD transition. However, current olfactory tests were developed based on Western social and cultural conditions, and are not very suitable for Chinese patients. Moreover, the neural substrate of OI in AD is still unknown. The present study investigated the utility of a newly developed Chinese Smell Identification Test (CSIT) for OI assessment in Chinese AD and MCI patients. We then performed a correlation analysis of gray matter volume (GMV) at the voxel and region-of-interest (ROI) levels to reveal the neural substrates of OI in AD. Thirty-seven AD, 27 MCI, and 30 normal controls (NCs) completed the CSIT and MRI scans. Patients (combined AD plus MCI) scored significantly lower on the CSIT compared to NCs (F (2, 91) = 62.597, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Voxel-level GMV analysis revealed strong relationships between CSIT score and volumes of the left precentral gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG). In addition, ROI-level GMV analysis revealed associations between CSIT score and left amygdala volumes. Our results suggest the following: 1) OI, as measured by the CSIT, is impaired in AD and MCI patients compared with healthy controls in the Chinese population; 2) the severity of OI dysfunction can distinguish patients with cognitive impairment from controls and AD from MCI patients; and 3) the left-precentral cortex and L-IFG may be involved in the processing of olfactory cues.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in probing cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor excitability can be induced using a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which TMS stimulation over the primary motor cortex is conditioned with an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand. PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effects in cortical excitability. However, the response to a PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across individuals. In this study, we used univariate and multivariate data-driven methods to investigate various previously proposed determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures. 
Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 19 healthy controls, underwent the PAS protocol. Prior to stimulation, demographic, genetic, clinical, as well as structural and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in any of the variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed that only 61 % of all participants were classified as PAS responders, irrespective of a group membership. Higher PAS response was associated with lower TMS intensity and with higher resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but only in responders, as opposed to non-responders. We also found an overall positive correlation between PAS response and structural connectivity within the corticospinal tract, which did not differ between groups. 
A multivariate random forest (RF) model identified age, gender, education, IQ, global cognitive status, sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and neuroimaging measures (functional and structural connectivity, grey matter volume, and cortical thickness) as poor predictors of PAS response. The model resulted in low accuracy of the RF classifier (58 %; 95% CI: 42% - 74%), with a higher relative importance of brain connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that PAS variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to influence PAS efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication studies.</content>

 Advances in fMRI acquisition have improved signal to noise to the point where the physiology of the subject is the dominant noise source in resting state fMRI data (rsfMRI).  Among these systemic, non-neuronal physiological signals, respiration and to some degree cardiac fluctuations can be removed through modeling, or in the case of newer, faster acquisitions such as simultaneous multislice acquisition, simple spectral filtering. However, significant low frequency physiological oscillation (~0.01-0.15 Hz) remains in the signal. This is problematic, as it is the precise frequency band occupied by the neuronally modulated hemodynamic responses used to study brain connectivity, precluding its removal by spectral filtering.
The source of this signal, and its method of production and propagation in the body, have not been conclusively determined.  Here we summarize the defining characteristics of the systemic low frequency noise signal, and review some current theories about the signal source and the evidence supporting them. 
The strength and distribution of the systemic LFO signal make characterizing and removing it essential for accurate quantification, especially for resting state connectivity, when no stimulation can be compared with the signal. Widespread correlated non-neuronal signals obscure and distort the more localized patterns of neuronal correlations between interacting brain regions; they may even cause apparent connectivity between regions with no neuronal interaction. Here we discuss a simple method we have developed to parse the global, moving, blood-borne signal from the stationary, neuronal connectivity signals, substantially reducing the negative correlations that result from global signal regression.	
Finally, we will discuss some of the uses to which the moving systemic low frequency oscillation can be put if we consider it a “signal” carrying information, rather than simply “noise” complicating the interpretation of resting state connectivity. Properly utilizing this signal may offer insights into subtle hemodynamic alterations that can be used as early indicators of circulatory dysfunction in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as prodromal stroke, moyamoya, and Alzheimer’s disease.</content>

 Spexin (SPX) is an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide that is expressed in the mammalian brain and peripheral tissue. Two orthologues are present in the teleost, SPX1 and SPX2. SPX1 is involved in reproduction and food intake. Recently, SPX1 neurons have been found to be located in the specific nuclei of dorsal habenula (dHb) and to project into the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), in which galanin receptor 2a/2b (GALR2a/2b) expression was also observed. This indicates that habenula SPX1 neurons may interact with GALR2a/2b in the IPN; however, the function of SPX1 in the dHb-IPN neuronal circuit remains unknown. To determine the role of SPX1 in the dHb-IPN neural circuit, we generated transgenic zebrafish overexpressing SPX1 specifically in the dHb. We found that transgenic zebrafish overexpressing SPX1 in the dHb had anxiolytic behaviors compared with their wildtype siblings. Furthermore, quantitative PCR revealed that mRNA expression of galr2a and galr2b in the IPN and serotonin-related genes in the raphe was upregulated in the brains of transgenic zebrafish. Taken together, our data suggest that SPX1 function in the dHb-IPN neural circuits is implicated in the regulation of anxiety behaviors via modulation of the serotoninergic system in zebrafish.</content>

 Previous studies have reported the possible neuroprotective effects of xenon treatment. The purpose of this study was to define the range of effective xenon ratio, most effective xenon ratio, and time-window for intervention in the kainic acid (KA)- induced status epilepticus (SE) rat model. Different ratios of xenon (35% xenon/21% oxygen/44% nitrogen, 50% xenon/21% oxygen/29% nitrogen, and 70% xenon/21% oxygen/9% nitrogen) were used to treat the KA-induced SE. Our results confirmed the anti-seizure role of 50% and 70% xenon mixture, with a stronger effect from the latter. Further, 70% xenon mixture was dispensed at three time points (0 min, 15 min delayed, and 30 min delayed) after KA administration, and the results indicated the anti-seizure effect at all treated time points. The results also established that the neuronal injury, assessed using Fluoro-Jade B staining, in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) were reversed by the xenon inhalation and within 30 min after KA administration. Our study, therefore, indicates the appropriate effective xenon ratio and time-window for intervention that can depress seizures. The prevention of neuronal injury and further reversal of the loss of effective control of depress network in the hippocampus and EC may be the mechanisms underlying the anti-seizure effect of xenon.</content>

 LIS1 is the main causative gene for lissencephaly, while MeCP2 is the main causative gene for Rett syndrome, both of which are neurodevelopmental diseases. Here we report nuclear functions for LIS1 and identify previously unrecognized physical and genetic interactions between the products of these two genes in the cell nucleus, that has implications on MeCP2 organization, neuronal gene expression and mouse behavior. Reduced LIS1 levels affect the association of MeCP2 with chromatin. Transcriptome analysis of primary cortical neurons derived from wild type, Lis1+/-, MeCP2-/y, or double mutants mice revealed a large overlap in the differentially expressed (DE) genes between the various mutants.  Overall, our findings are important for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the neurodevelopmental disorders lissencephaly and Rett syndrome caused by dysfunction of LIS1 and MeCP2, respectively.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are the second most common cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. SOD1 neurotoxicity has been attributed to aberrant accumulation of misfolded SOD1, which in its soluble form binds to intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria and ER, disrupting their functions. Here, we demonstrate that mutant SOD1 binds specifically to the N-terminal domain of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1), an outer mitochondrial membrane protein controlling cell energy, metabolic and survival pathways. Mutant SOD1G93A and SOD1G85R, but not wild type SOD1, directly interact with VDAC1 and reduce its channel conductance. No such interaction with N-terminal-truncated VDAC1 occurs. Moreover, a VDAC1-derived N-terminal peptide inhibited mutant SOD1-induced toxicity. Incubation of motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing mutant SOD1 or mouse embryonic stem cell-derived motor neurons with different VDAC1 N-terminal peptides resulted in enhanced cell survival. Taken together, our results establish a direct link between mutant SOD1 toxicity and the VDAC1 N-terminal domain and suggest that VDAC1 N-terminal peptides targeting mutant SOD1 provide potential new therapeutic strategies for ALS.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Introduction: Age-related health, brain and cognitive impairment is a great challenge in current society. Cognitive training, aerobic exercise and their combination have been shown to benefit health, brain, cognition and psychological status in healthy older adults. Inconsistent results across studies may be related to several variables. We need to better identify cognitive changes, individual variables that may predict the effect of these interventions and changes in structural and functional brain outcomes as well as physiological molecular correlates that may be mediating these effects. Projecte Moviment is a multi-domain randomized trial examining the effect of these interventions applied 5 days per week for 3 months compared to a passive control group. The aim of this paper is to describe the sample, procedures and planned analyses.
Methods: 140 healthy physically inactive older adults will be randomly assigned to computerized cognitive training (CCT), aerobic exercise (AE), combined training (COMB) or a control group. The intervention consists of a 3-month home-based program 5 days per week in sessions of 45 minutes. Data from cognitive, physical and psychological tests, cardiovascular risk factors, structural and functional brain scans and blood samples will be obtained before and after the intervention.
Results: Effects of the interventions on cognitive outcomes will be described in intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses. We will also analyze potential genetic, demographic, brain and physiological molecular correlates that may predict the effects of intervention as well as the association between cognitive effects and changes in these variables using the per protocol sample. 
Discussion: Projecte Moviment is a multi-domain intervention trial based on prior evidence that aims to understand the effects of CCT, AE and COMB on cognitive and psychological outcomes compared to a passive control group and to determine related biological correlates and predictors of the intervention effects.

 Objectives: To explore the transfer effects of cognitive training on working memory among Chinese older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Methods: 62 MCI participants aged more than 60 years old were recruited by holding recruitment sessions at communities in China (33 for cognitive training, and 29 for mental leisure activities (MLA) control). Cognitive functions, including working memory, execution function, reasoning ability, verbal ability, ability of daily living, were measured at 3 time-points (baseline, post-training and three months after training). 
Results: Compared to the MLA control, the cognitive training group showed significant effects on both the trained (working memory) and untrained (execution function and ability of daily living) domains. The effects of cognitive training on overall cognitive function, working memory and daily life ability of daily living of MCI could be maintained for at least three months even without the cognitive training. Besides, complete mediating effects of cognitive training were found on executive function through working memory and working memory on ability of daily living though executive function which suggested the presence of transfer effect of cognitive training.
Conclusions: The present study supported that cognitive training could effectively improve working memory in elders with MCI. The training effects on working memory could transfer to other untrained areas (such as executive function), which also improved the comprehensive ability (ability of daily living). And the effects of training could largely persist for three months.

 This study investigates the association between intelligence and brain power responses to a passive audiovisual stimulation. We measure the power of gamma-range steady-state responses (SSRs) as well as intelligence and other aspects of neurocognitive function in 40 healthy males born in 1953. The participants are a part of a Danish birth cohort study and the data therefore include additional information measured earlier in life. Our main power measure is the difference in power between a visual stimulation and a combined audiovisual stimulation. We hypothesize and establish empirically that the power measure is associated with intelligence. In particular, we find a highly significant correlation between the power measure and present intelligence scores. The association is robust to controlling for size-at-birth measures, length of education, speed of processing as well as a range of other potentially confounding factors. Interestingly, we find that intelligence scores measured earlier in life (childhood, youth, late midlife), are also correlated with the present-day power measure, suggesting a deep connection between intelligence and the power measure. Finally, we find that the power measure has a high sensitivity for detection of an intelligence score below the average.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) antagonistically modulate metabolism and aging. However, how they coordinate to determine longevity and if they act via separable mechanisms is unclear. Here, we show that neuronal AMPK is essential for lifespan extension from TORC1 inhibition, and that TORC1 suppression increases lifespan cell non autonomously via distinct mechanisms from global AMPK activation. Lifespan extension by null mutations in genes encoding &lt;i&gt;raga-1&lt;/i&gt; (RagA) or &lt;i&gt;rsks-1&lt;/i&gt; (S6K) is fully suppressed by neuronal-specific rescues. Loss of RAGA-1 increases lifespan via maintaining mitochondrial fusion. Neuronal RAGA-1 abrogation of &lt;i&gt;raga-1 &lt;/i&gt;mutant longevity requires UNC-64/syntaxin, and promotes mitochondrial fission cell nonautonomously. Finally, deleting the mitochondrial fission factor DRP-1 renders the animal refractory to the pro-aging effects of neuronal RAGA-1. Our results highlight a new role for neuronal TORC1 in cell nonautonomous regulation of longevity, and suggest TORC1 in the central nervous system might be targeted to promote healthy aging.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Recent studies showed activation of the GABAergic neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) triggered cataplexy of sleep disorder narcolepsy. However, there is still no direct evidence on CeA GABAergic neurons' real-time dynamic during cataplexy. We used a deep brain calcium imaging tool to image the intrinsic calcium transient as a marker of neuronal activity changes in the narcoleptic VGAT-Cre mice by expressing the calcium sensor GCaMP6 into genetically defined CeA GABAergic neurons. Two distinct GABAergic neuronal groups involved in cataplexy were identified: spontaneous cataplexy-ON and predator odor-induced cataplexy-ON neurons. Majority in the latter group were inactive during regular sleep/wake cycles but were specifically activated by predator odor and continued their intense activities into succeeding cataplexy bouts. Furthermore, we found that CeA GABAergic neurons became highly synchronized during predator odor-induced cataplexy. We suggest that the abnormal activation and synchronization of CeA GABAergic neurons may trigger emotion-induced cataplexy.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Post-transcriptional regulation plays important roles to finely tune gene expression in bacteria. In particular, regulation of type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems is achieved through sophisticated mechanisms involving toxin mRNA folding. Here, we set up a genetic approach to decipher the molecular underpinnings behind the regulation of a type I TA in &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt;. We used the lethality induced by chromosomal inactivation of the antitoxin to select mutations that suppress toxicity. We found that single point mutations are sufficient to allow cell survival. Mutations located either in the 5' untranslated region or within the open reading frame of the toxin hamper its translation by stabilizing stem-loop structures that sequester the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. We propose that these short hairpins correspond to metastable structures that are transiently formed during transcription to avoid premature toxin expression. This work uncovers the co-transcriptional inhibition of translation as an additional layer of TA regulation in bacteria.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The advent of high-yield electrophysiology using Neuropixels probes is now enabling researchers to simultaneously record hundreds of neurons with remarkably high signal to noise. However, these probes have not been well-suited to use in freely moving mice. It is critical to study neural activity in unrestricted animals for many reasons, such as leveraging ethological approaches to study neural circuits. We designed and implemented a novel device that allows Neuropixels probes to be customized for chronically-implanted experiments in freely moving mice. We demonstrate the ease and utility of this approach in recording hundreds of neurons during an ethological behavior across weeks of experiments. We provide the technical drawings and procedures for other researchers to do the same. Importantly, our approach enables researchers to explant and reuse these valuable probes, a transformative step which has not been established for recordings with any type of chronically-implanted probe.</content>

 Multiple features distinguish the mitochondria of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients from those of unaffected individuals. The causes and consequences of these differences are informed by the recent finding by Fleck et al. (J. Neurosci., 2019) that pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein 1 (PTCD1) gene variants associate with AD. This suggests a proximal or initiating role for mitochondria in AD.</content>

 Implantation of the blastocyst into the uterus is the gateway for further embryonic development in mammals. Programming of blastocyst to an implantation-competent state known as blastocyst activation is the determining factor for implantation into the receptive uterus. However, it remains largely unclear how the blastocyst is globally programmed for implantation....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/XHdsbwaBtqw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Associative learning and sensory integration are two behavioral processes that involve the sensation and processing of stimuli followed by an altered behavioral response to these stimuli, with learning requiring memory formation and retrieval. We found that the cellular and molecular actions of &lt;i&gt;scd-2&lt;/i&gt; dissociate sensory integration and associative learning. This was discovered through investigation of a &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; mutation (&lt;i&gt;lrn-2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;mm99&lt;/i&gt;)) affecting both processes. After mapping and sequencing, &lt;i&gt;lrn-2&lt;/i&gt; was found to be allelic to the gene, &lt;i&gt;scd-2&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;scd-2&lt;/i&gt;-mediated associative learning and sensory integration operate in separate neurons as separate processes. We also find that memories can form from associations that are processed and stored independently from the integration of stimuli preceding an immediate behavioral decision.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;One way that drugs of abuse perturb the dopamine system is by triggering large amounts of extracellular dopamine to efflux into limbic regions. The basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA) nuclei of the amygdala have been shown to play distinct roles in value representation of primary and conditioned reward. However, the precise role of dopaminergic receptors in the BLA and the CeA during reward-related behaviors remains to be determined. Here we investigate the effects of dopamine D1 receptor blockade in the BLA and the CeA during asymptotic performance of cocaine self-administration and in a novel application of contextual renewal under continued access conditions. After more than three weeks of chained seek-take self-administration of cocaine, male Long Evans rats were given a bilateral intra-BLA or intra-CeA infusion of the D1 antagonist SCH-23390 (2 µg/0.3 µl) for multiple days. Intra-BLA D1 receptor blockade before, but not after the self-administration session, gradually suppressed drug seeking and taking responses and persisted with a change in context with continued D1 blockade. In contrast, intra-CeA D1 receptor blockade caused a rapid reduction in self-administration that showed renewal with a change in context with continued D1 blockade. Further, conditioned place aversion developed with intra-BLA but not intra-CeA infusions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that dopamine D1 receptors in the BLA and CeA both contribute to drug seeking and taking, but may do so through distinct mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), inhibitory interneurons play an essential role in gating behaviors elicited by sensory exposure to social odors. Several morphological classes have been described, but the full complement of interneurons remains incomplete. In order to develop a more comprehensive view of interneuron function in the AOB, we performed targeted patch clamp recordings from partially overlapping subsets of genetically labeled and morphologically defined interneuron types. &lt;i&gt;Gad2&lt;/i&gt; (GAD65), &lt;i&gt;Calb2&lt;/i&gt; (calretinin), and &lt;i&gt;Cort&lt;/i&gt; (cortistatin)-cre mouse lines were used to drive selective expression of tdTomato in AOB interneurons. &lt;i&gt;Gad2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Calb2-&lt;/i&gt;labeled interneurons were found in the internal, external, and glomerular (GL) layers, whereas &lt;i&gt;Cort&lt;/i&gt;-labeled interneurons were enriched within the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) and external cellular layer (ECL). We found that external granule cells (EGCs) from all genetically labeled subpopulations possessed intrinsic functional differences that allowed them to be readily distinguished from internal granule cells (IGCs). EGCs showed stronger voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and non-inactivating voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents, decreased I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; currents, and robust excitatory synaptic input. These specific intrinsic properties did not correspond to any genetically labeled type, suggesting that transcriptional heterogeneity among EGCs and IGCs is not correlated with expression of these particular marker genes. Intrinsic heterogeneity was also seen among AOB juxtaglomerular cells (JGCs), with a major subset of &lt;i&gt;Calb2&lt;/i&gt;-labeled JGCs exhibiting spontaneous and depolarization-evoked plateau potentials. These data identify specific physiological features of AOB interneurons types that will assist in future studies of AOB function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural coding is a key problem in neuroscience, which can promote people's
understanding of the mechanism that brain processes information. Among the
classical theories of neural coding, the population rate coding has been
studied widely in many works. Most computational studies considered the neurons
and the corresponding presynaptic synapses as pre-determined excitatory or
inhibitory types. According to physiological evidence, however, that the real
effect of a synapse is inhibitory or excitatory is determined by the type of
the activated receptors. The co-release of excitatory and inhibitory receptors
in the same synapse exists widely in the brain. In this paper, we study the
population rate coding in recurrent neuronal networks with undetermined neurons
and synapses, different from the traditional works, in which one neuron can
perform either excitatory or inhibitory effect to the corresponding
postsynaptic neurons. We find such neuronal networks can encode the stimuli
information in population firing rate well. We find that intermediate recurrent
probability together with moderate Inhibitory-Excitatory strength ratio can
enhance the encoding performance. Suitable combinations of the previous two
parameters with the noise intensity, the excitatory synaptic strength and the
synaptic time constant have promoting effects on the performance of population
rate coding. Finally, we compare the performance of population rate coding
between the traditional (determined) model and ours, and we find that it is
rational to consider the co-release of inhibitory and excitatory receptors.

 &lt;p&gt;Paced finger tapping is one of the simplest tasks to study sensorimotor
synchronization. The subject is instructed to tap in synchrony with a periodic
sequence of brief tones, and the time difference (called asynchrony) between
each response and the corresponding stimulus is recorded. Despite its
simplicity, this task helps to unveil interesting features of the underlying
neural system and the error correction mechanism responsible for
synchronization. Perturbation experiments are usually performed to probe the
subject's response, for example in the form of a &quot;step change&quot;, i.e. an
unexpected change in tempo. The asynchrony is the usual observable in such
experiments and it is chosen as the main variable in many mathematical models
that attempt to describe the phenomenon. In this work we show that although
asynchrony can be perfectly described in operational terms, it is not well
defined as a model variable when tempo perturbations are considered. We
introduce an alternative variable and a mathematical model that intrinsically
takes into account the perturbation, and make theoretical predictions about the
response to novel perturbations based on the geometrical organization of the
trajectories in phase space. Our proposal is relevant to understand
interpersonal synchronization and the synchronization to non-periodic stimuli.

 &lt;p&gt;Permutation of any two hidden units yields invariant properties in typical
deep generative neural networks. This permutation symmetry plays an important
role in understanding the computation performance of a broad class of neural
networks with two or more hidden units. However, a theoretical study of the
permutation symmetry is still lacking. Here, we propose a minimal model with
only two hidden units in a restricted Boltzmann machine, which aims to address
how the permutation symmetry affects the critical learning data size at which
the concept-formation (or spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics language)
starts, and moreover semi-rigorously prove a conjecture that the critical data
size is independent of the number of hidden units once this number is finite.
Remarkably, we find that the embedded correlation between two receptive fields
of hidden units reduces the critical data size. In particular, the
weakly-correlated receptive fields have the benefit of significantly reducing
the minimal data size that triggers the transition, given less noisy data.
Inspired by the theory, we also propose an efficient fully-distributed
algorithm to infer the receptive fields of hidden units. Furthermore, our
minimal model reveals that the permutation symmetry can also be spontaneously
broken following the spontaneous symmetry breaking. Overall, our results
demonstrate that the unsupervised learning is a progressive combination of
spontaneous symmetry breaking and permutation symmetry breaking which are both
spontaneous processes driven by data streams (observations). All these effects
can be analytically probed based on the minimal model, providing theoretical
insights towards understanding unsupervised learning in a more general context.

 Individuals differ in their vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence, which is determined by innate and environmental factors. The corticostriatal circuit is heavily involved in the development of alcohol dependence and may contain neural information regarding vulnerability to drink excessively. In the current experiment, we hypothesized that we could characterize high and low alcohol-drinking rats (HD and LD, respectively) based on corticostriatal oscillations, and that these subgroups would differentially respond to corticostriatal brain stimulation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 13) were trained to drink 10% alcohol in a limited access paradigm. In separate sessions, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Based on training alcohol consumption levels, we classified rats using a median split as HD or LD. Then, using machine-learning, we built predictive models to classify rats as HD or LD by corticostriatal LFPs and compared the model performance from real data to the performance of models built on data permutations. Additionally, we explored the impact of NAcSh or mPFC stimulation on alcohol consumption in HD vs. LD. Corticostriatal LFPs were able predict HD vs. LD group classification with greater accuracy than expected by chance (&amp;gt;80% accuracy). Moreover, NAcSh stimulation significantly reduced alcohol consumption in HD, but not LD (p&amp;lt;0.05), while mPFC stimulation did not alter drinking behavior in either HD or LD (p&amp;gt;0.05). These data collectively show that the corticostriatal circuit is differentially involved in regulating alcohol intake in HD vs. LD rats, and suggests that corticostriatal activity may have the potential to predict a vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence in a clinical population.</content>

 Despite recent extensive genomic and genetic studies on behavioral responses to ethanol, relatively few new therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder have been validated. Here we describe a cross-species genomic approach focused on identifying gene networks associated with chronic ethanol consumption. To identify brain mechanisms underlying a chronic ethanol consumption phenotype highly relevant to human alcohol use disorder, and to elucidate potential future therapeutic targets, we conducted a genomic study in a nonhuman primate model of chronic open-access ethanol consumption. Microarray analysis of RNA expression in anterior cingulate and subgenual cortices from rhesus macaques was performed across multiple cohorts of animals. Gene networks correlating with ethanol consumption or showing enrichment for ethanol-regulated genes were identified, as were major ethanol-related hub genes within these networks.  A subsequent consensus module analysis was used to co-analyze monkey data with expression data from a chronic intermittent ethanol vapor-exposure and consumption model in C57BL/6J mice. Ethanol-related gene networks conserved between primates and rodents were enriched for genes involved discrete biological functions, including; myelination, synaptic transmission, chromatin modification, Golgi apparatus function, translation, cellular respiration, and RNA processing.  The myelin-related network, in particular, showed strong correlations with ethanol consumption behavior and displayed marked network reorganization between control and ethanol-drinking animals. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that these networks also showed highly significant overlap with other ethanol-regulated gene sets. Altogether, these studies provide robust primate and rodent cross-species validation of gene networks associated with chronic ethanol consumption. Our results also suggest potential novel focal points for future therapeutic interventions in alcohol use disorder.</content>

 Hyperglycemia-induced neuronal apoptosis is one of the important reasons for diabetic neuropathy. Long time exposure to high glucose accelerates many aberrant glucose metabolic pathways and eventually leads to neuronal injury. However, the underlying mechanisms of metabolic alterations remain unknown. TP53 inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) is an endogenous inhibitor of glycolysis and increases the flux of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by regulating glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). TIGAR is highly expressed in neuron. But the role of TIGAR in hyperglycemia-induced neuronal injury is still unclear. In this study, we observed that TIGAR and G6PD are decreased in the hippocampus of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Correspondingly, in cultured primary neurons and Neuro-2a cell line, stimulation with high glucose induced significant neuronal apoptosis and down-regulation of TIGAR expression. Overexpression of TIGAR reduced the number of TUNEL-positive neurons and prevented the activation of Caspase-3 in cultured neurons. Furthermore, enhancing the expression of TIGAR rescued high glucose-induced autophagy impairment and the decrease of G6PD. Nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), a negative regulator of autophagy, is also inhibited by overexpression of TIGAR. Inhibition of autophagy abolished the protective effect of TIGAR in neuronal apoptosis in Neuro-2a. Importantly, overexpression of TIGAR in the hippocampus ameliorated STZ-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Therefore, our data demonstrated that TIGAR may play anti-apoptosis effect via up-regulation of autophagy in diabetic neuropathy.</content>

 GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission contributes to diverse aspects of brain development and adult plasticity, including the expression of complex cognitive processes. This is afforded for in part by the dynamic adaptations occurring at inhibitory synapses, which show great heterogeneity both in terms of upstream signalling and downstream effector mechanisms. Single-particle tracking and live imaging have revealed that complex receptor-scaffold interactions critically determine adaptations at GABAergic synapses. Super-resolution imaging studies have shown that protein interactions at synaptic sites contribute to nano-scale scaffold re-arrangements through post-translational modifications, facilitating receptor and scaffold recruitment to synaptic sites. Additionally plasticity mechanisms may be affected by the protein composition at individual synapses and the type of pre-synaptic input. This mini-review examines recent discoveries of plasticity mechanisms that are operational within GABAergic synapses, and discusses their contribution towards functional heterogeneity in inhibitory neurotransmission.</content>

 Social behavior exhibits a wide diversity among vertebrates though it is controlled by a conserved neural network, the social behavior network (SBN). The activity of the SBN is shaped by hypothalamic nonapeptides of the vasopressin-oxytocin family. The weakly electric fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio emits social electrical signals during courtship. Three types of vasotocin (AVT) cells occur in the preoptic area (POA), one of the SBN nodes. In this study, we aimed to test if POA neurons of the nucleus preopticus ventricularis anterior (PPa) and posterior (PPp), and in particular AVT+ cells, were activated by social stimuli using a 2-day behavioral protocol. During the first night, male-female dyads were recorded to identify courting males. During the second night, these males were divided in two experimental conditions: isolated and social (male with a female). Both AVT cells and the cellular activation of the POA neurons (measured by FOS) were identified.  We found that the PPa of social males showed more FOS+ cells than the PPa of isolated males, and that the PPa had more AVT+ cells in social males than in isolated males. The double-immunolabeling for AVT and FOS indicated the activation of AVT+ neurons. No significant differences in the activation of AVT+ cells were found between conditions, but a clear association was observed between the number of AVT+ cells and certain behavioral traits. In addition, a different activation of AVT+ cell-types was observed for social versus isolated males. We conclude that the POA of B. gauderio exhibits      changes induced by social stimuli in reproductive context, involving an increase in AVT production and a different profile activation among AVT+ cell populations.</content>

 The transition of tau proteins from its soluble physiological conformation to the pathological aggregate forms found in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, is poorly understood.  Therefore, understanding the process that modulates the formation of toxic tau oligomers and their conversion to putative neuroprotective neurofibrillary tangles will lead to better therapeutic strategies.  We previously identified that EFhd2 is associated with aggregated tau species in AD brains and the coiled-coil domain in EFhd2 mediates the interaction with tau. To further characterize the association between EFhd2 and tau, we examined whether EFhd2 could affect the liquid-liquid phase separation properties of tau under molecular crowding conditions.  We demonstrate that EFhd2 alters tau liquid phase behavior in a calcium and coiled-coil domain dependent manner.  Co-incubation of EFhd2 and tau in the absence of calcium leads to the formation of solid-like structures containing both proteins, while in the presence of calcium these two proteins phase separate together into liquid droplets.  EFhd2’s coiled-coil domain is necessary to alter tau’s liquid phase separation, indicating that protein-protein interaction is required.  The results demonstrate that EFhd2 affects the liquid-liquid phase separation of tau proteins in vitro, suggesting that EFhd2 modulates the structural dynamics of tau proteins.</content>

 Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an indispensable tool in neuroscience research. Despite this, rs-fMRI signals are easily contaminated by artifacts arising from movement of the head during data collection. The artifacts can be problematic even for motions on the millimetre scale, with complex spatiotemporal properties that can lead to substantial errors in functional connectivity estimates. Effective correction methods must be employed, therefore, to distinguish true functional networks from motion-related noise. Research over the last three decades has produced numerous correction methods, many of which must be applied in combination to achieve satisfactory data quality. Subject instruction, training and mild restraints are helpful at the outset, but usually insufficient. Improvements come from applying multiple motion correction algorithms retrospectively after rs-fMRI data are collected, although residual artifacts can still remain in cases of elevated motion, which are especially prevalent in patient populations. Although not commonly adopted at present, &quot;real-time&quot; correction methods are emerging that can be combined with retrospective methods and that promise better correction and increased rs-fMRI signal sensitivity. While the search for the ideal motion correction protocol continues, rs-fMRI research will benefit from good disclosure practices, such as: 1) reporting motion-related quality control metrics to provide better comparison between studies; and 2) including motion covariates in group-level analyses to limit the extent of motion-related confounds when studying group differences.</content>

 Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia, represents a common cause of disability and one of the most relevant challenges in the health world. In addition, this condition does not have, at moment, a pharmacological treatment that can stop the pathological progress. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined as the borderline between normal aging and early dementia, represents a meaningful field of study because, in the transition to dementia, clinicians have defined a useful therapeutic window. Additionally, due to the lack of effective pharmacological interventions, recent years have seen an increase in research into new technological solutions to assess, stimulate, and assist patients afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease. This review aims to outline the use of information and communication technologies in the field studying MCI. Particularly, attention was focused on the use of sensors, both wearable and environmental; personal devices, including TV, PC, tablet, and smartphone; and finally, robots, both standalone and cloud networked. The idea is to depict the framework and describe the most meaningful research efforts in this field of study to display the current technologies available, describe the research objectives, and depict prospective future research. Regarding data sources, the research was conducted within three databases, PubMed Central, Web of Science, and Scopus, between January 2009 and December 2017. A total of 646 articles were found in the initial search. Accurate definition of the exclusion criteria and selection strategy allowed identification of the most relevant papers to use for the study. Finally, 56 papers were fully evaluated and included in this review.</content>

 In our daily life, we frequently need to make decisions between competing behavioral options while we are exposed to various contextual factors containing emotional/social information. We examined how changes in emotional/arousal state influence resolving conflict between behavioural rules. Visual stimuli with emotional content (positive, negative and neutral) and music, which could potentially alter emotional/arousal states, were included in the task context while participants performed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The WCST requires the application of abstract matching rules, to resolve conflict between competing behavioural options. We found that conflict influenced both accuracy and response time in implementing rules. Measuring event-related autonomic responses indicated that these behavioural effects were accompanied by concomitant alterations in arousal levels. Performance in the WCST was modulated by the emotional content of visual stimuli and appeared as a faster response and higher accuracy when trials commenced with negative emotional stimuli. These effects were dependent on the level of conflict but were not accompanied by changes in arousal levels. Here, we report that conflict-induced behavioural alterations are accompanied by concomitant changes in participants’ arousal/emotional state. Visual stimuli with emotional content influence conflict resolution and conflict-induced behavioural adjustments without trial-by-trial changes in arousal level. Our findings indicate intricate interactions between emotional context and various aspects of executive control such as conflict resolution and suggest that these interactions are not necessarily mediated through alterations in arousal level.</content>

 Trust and reciprocity are cornerstones of human nature, both at the levels of close interpersonal relationships and economic/societal structures. Being able to both place trust in others and decide whether to reciprocate trust placed in us is rooted in implicit and explicit processes that guide expectations of others, help reduce social uncertainty and build relationships. This review will highlight neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity, through the lens of implicit and explicit social appraisal and learning processes.  Significant consideration will be given to the neural underpinnings of these implicit and explicit processes, and special focus will center on the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms facilitating the integration of implicit and explicit signals supporting trust and reciprocity. Finally, this review will conclude with discussion of how we can leverage findings regarding the neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity to better inform our understanding of mental health disorders characterized by social dysfunction.</content>

 Automatic segmentation of brain tumors from medical images is important for clinical assessment and treatment planning of brain tumors. Recent years have seen an increasing use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task, but most of them use either 2D networks with relatively low memory requirement while ignoring 3D context, or 3D networks exploiting 3D features while with large memory consumption. In addition, existing methods rarely provide uncertainty information associated with the segmentation result. We propose a cascade of CNNs to segment brain tumors with hierarchical subregions from multi-modal Magnetic Resonance images (MRI), and introduce a 2.5D network that is a trade-off between  memory consumption, model complexity and receptive field. In addition, we employ test-time augmentation to achieve improved segmentation accuracy, which also provides voxel-wise and structure-wise uncertainty information of the segmentation result. Experiments with BraTS 2017 dataset showed that our cascaded framework with 2.5D CNNs was one of the top performing methods (second-rank) for the BraTS challenge. We also validated our method with BraTS 2018 dataset and found that test-time augmentation improves brain tumor segmentation accuracy and that the resulting uncertainty information can indicate potential mis-segmentations and help to improve segmentation accuracy.</content>

 Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are important building blocks in technical applications. They rely on noiseless continuous signals in stark contrast to the discrete action potentials stochastically exchanged among the neurons in real brains. We propose to bridge this gap with Spike-by-Spike (SbS) networks which represent a compromise between non-spiking and spiking versions of generative models. What is missing, however, are algorithms for finding weight sets that would optimize the output performances of deep SbS networks with many layers.

Here, a learning rule for feed-forward SbS networks is derived. The properties of this approach are investigated and its functionality is demonstrated by simulations. In particular, a Deep Convolutional SbS network for classifying handwritten digits achieves a classification performance of roughly 99.3% on the MNIST test data when the learning rule is applied together with an optimizer. Thereby it approaches the benchmark results of ANNs without extensive parameter optimization. We envision this learning rule for SBS networks to provide a new basis for research in neuroscience and for technical applications, especially when they become implemented on specialized computational hardware.</content>

 Introduction. While the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases, our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms, outcome predictors, or therapeutic targets is limited. In this work, we demonstrate how computational multi-scale brain modelling links phenomena of different scales and therefore identifies potential disease mechanisms leading the way to improved diagnostics and treatment. Methods. The Virtual Brain (TVB; thevirtualbrain.org) neuroinformatics platform allows standardized large-scale structural connectivity-based simulations of whole brain dynamics. We provide proof of concept for a novel approach that quantitatively links the effects of altered molecular pathways onto neuronal population
1
dynamics. As a novelty, we connect chemical compounds measured with positron emission tomography (PET) with neural function in TVB addressing the phenomenon of hyperexcitability in AD related to the protein amyloid beta (Abeta). We construct personalized virtual brains based on an averaged healthy connectome and individual PET derived distributions of Abeta in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N=8) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD, N=10) and in age-matched healthy controls (HC, N=15) using data from ADNI-3 data base (http://adni.lni.usc.edu). In the personalized virtual brains, individual Abeta burden modulates regional Excitation-Inhibition balance, leading to local hyperexcitation with high Abeta loads. We analyze simulated regional neural activity and electroencephalograms (EEG). Results. Known empirical alterations of EEG in patients with AD compared to HCs were reproduced by simulations. The virtual AD group showed slower frequencies in simulated local field potentials and EEG compared to MCI and HC groups. The heterogeneity of the Abeta load is crucial for the virtual EEG slowing which is absent for control models with homogeneous Abeta distributions. Slowing phenomena primarily affect the network hubs, independent of the spatial distribution of Abeta. Modeling the N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism of memantine in local population models, reveals potential functional reversibility of the observed large-scale alterations (reflected by EEG slowing) in virtual AD brains. Discussion. We demonstrate how TVB enables the simulation of systems effects caused by pathogenetic molecular candidate mechanisms in human virtual brains.</content>

 Since brain glycogen is stored mainly in astrocytes, the role of this polysaccharide in neurons has been largely overlooked. To study the existence and relevance of an active neuronal glycogen metabolism in vivo, we generated a mouse model lacking glycogen synthase specifically in the Camk2a-expressing postnatal forebrain pyramidal neurons (GYS1Camk2a-KO), which include the prefrontal cortex and the CA3 and CA1 cell layers of the hippocampus. The latter are involved in memory and learning processes and participate in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse, the function of which can be analyzed electrophysiologically. Long-term potentiation evoked in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse was decreased in alert behaving GYS1Camk2a-KO mice. They also showed a significant deficiency in the acquisition of an instrumental learning task—a type of associative learning involving prefrontal and hippocampal circuits. Interestingly, GYS1Camk2a-KO animals did not show the greater susceptibility to hippocampal seizures and myoclonus observed in animals completely depleted of glycogen in the whole CNS. 
These results unequivocally demonstrate the presence of an active glycogen metabolism in neurons in vivo and reveal a key role of neuronal glycogen in the proper acquisition of new motor and cognitive abilities and in the changes in synaptic strength underlying such acquisition.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is well recognized for its neuroprotective functions, via activation of its high affinity receptor, tropomysin related kinase B (TrkB). In addition, BDNF/ TrkB neuroprotective functions can also be elicited indirectly via activation of adenosine 2A receptors (A2aRs), which in turn transactivates TrkB. Evidence suggests that alterations in BDNF/TrkB , including TrkB transactivation by A2aRs, can occur in several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. Although enhancing BDNF  has been a major goal for protection of dying motor neurons (MNs), this has not been successful. Indeed, there is emerging in vitro and in vivo evidence suggesting that an upregulation of BDNF/TrkB  can cause detrimental effects on MNs, making them more vulnerable to pathophysiological insults. For example, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), early synaptic hyper-excitability of MNs is thought to enhance BDNF-mediated signalling, thereby causing glutamate excitotoxicity, and ultimately MN death. Moreover, direct inhibition of TrkB and A2aRs has been shown to protect MNs from these pathophysiological insults, suggesting that modulation of BDNF/TrkB and/or A2aRs receptors  may be important in early disease pathogenesis in ALS. This review highlights the relevance of pathophysiological actions of BDNF/TrkB  under certain circumstances, so that manipulation of BDNF/TrkB and A2aRs  may give rise to alternate neuroprotective therapeutic strategies in the treatment of neural diseases such as ALS.</content>

 Hippocampal neuron death is a key factor in vascular dementia (VD) induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) is a multiple-effects drug. Therefore, the potential molecular mechanisms underlying CCH and its feasible treatment should be investigated. This study had two main purposes: first, to identify a potential biomarker in a rat model of CCH induced VD using antibody microarrays, and second, to explore the neuroprotective role of NBP at targeting the potential biomarker. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)/GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFRα1)/receptor tyrosine kinase (Ret) signaling is altered in the hippocampus of CCH rats; however, NBP treatment improved cognitive function, protected against hippocampal neuron apoptosis via regulation of GDNF/GFRα1/Ret, and activated the phosphorylation AKT (p-AKT) and ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) signaling. We also found that 1 h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 48 h reperfusion (R) in cultured hippocampal neurons led to downregulation of GDNF/GFRα1/Ret. NBP upregulatied the signaling and increased neuronal survival. Ret inhibitor (NVP-AST487) inhibits Ret and downstream effectors, including p-AKT and p-ERK1/2. Additionally, both GDNF and GFRα1 expression are markedly inhibited in hippocampal neurons by coincubation with NVP-AST487, particularly under conditions of OGD/R. GDNF/GFRα1/Ret signaling and neuronal viability can be maintained by NBP, which activates p-AKT and p-ERK1/2, increases expression of Bcl-2, and decreases expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3. The current study showed that GDNF/GFRα1/Ret signaling plays an essential role in the CCH induced VD. NBP was protective against hippocampal neuron apoptosis, and this was associated with regulation of GDNF/GFRα1/Ret and AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathways, thus reducing cognitive impairment.</content>

 The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for function and morphology of neuronal synapses. Moreover, altered regulation of the neuronal actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Myosin XVI is a neuronally expressed unconventional myosin known to bind the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), a regulator of filamentous actin (F-actin) polymerization. Notably, the gene encoding the myosin's heavy chain (MYO16) shows genetic association with neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. Here, we investigated whether myosin XVI plays a role for actin cytoskeleton regulation in the dendritic spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells, a neuronal cell type crucial for motor learning, social cognition and vocalization. We provide evidence that both myosin XVI and the WRC component WAVE1 localize to Purkinje cell spines. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of GFP-actin in cultured Purkinje cells shows that Myo16 knockout as well as Purkinje cell-specific Myo16 knockdown, lead to faster F-actin turnover in the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells. We also detect accelerated F-actin turnover upon interference with the WRC, and upon inhibition of Arp2/3 that drives formation of branched F-actin downstream of the WRC. In contrast, inhibition of formins that are responsible for polymerization of linear actin filaments does not cause faster F-actin turnover. Together, our data establish myosin XVI as a regulator of the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton and suggest that it is an upstream activator of the WRC-Arp2/3 pathway in Purkinje cell spines. Furthermore, ultra-structural and electrophysiological analyses of Myo16 knockout cerebellum reveals the presence of reduced numbers of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic terminals in the absence of the myosin. Therefore, we here define myosin XVI as an F-actin regulator important for presynaptic organization in the cerebellum.</content>

 Traumatic brain injury is an important cause of human mortality and morbidity, which can induce serious neurological damage. At present, clinical treatments for neurological dysfunction after traumatic brain injury include hyperbaric oxygen, brain stimulation and behavioral therapy, but the therapeutic effect is not satisfactory. Recent studies have found that exogenous stem cells can migrate to damaged brain tissue, then participate in the repair of damaged brain tissue by further differentiation to replace damaged cells, while releasing anti-inflammatory factors and growth factors, thereby significantly improving neurological function. This article will mainly review the effects, deficiencies and related mechanisms of different types of stem cells in traumatic brain injury.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;To understand the pathogenesis of specific neuronal circuit dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we investigated the fate of three subclasses of “modulatory interneurons” in hippocampal CA1 using the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;AppNL-F/NL-F&lt;/span&gt; knock-in mouse model of AD. Cholecystokinin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons were aberrantly hyperactive preceding the presence of the typical AD hallmarks: neuroinflammation and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. These interneurons showed an age-dependent vulnerability to Aβ penetration and a reduction in density and coexpression of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA synthesis enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), suggesting a loss in their inhibitory function. However, calretinin (CR) interneurons—specialized to govern &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; inhibition, showed resilience to Aβ accumulation, preservation of structure, and displayed synaptic hyperinhibition, despite the lack of inhibitory control of CA1 excitatory pyramidal cells from midstages of the disease. This aberrant inhibitory homeostasis observed in CA1 CR cells and pyramidal cells was “normalized” by blocking P2Y1 purinoreceptors, which were “upregulated” and strongly expressed in CR cells and astrocytes in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;AppNL-F/NL-F&lt;/span&gt; mice in the later stages of AD. In summary, AD-associated cell-type selective destruction of inhibitory interneurons and disrupted inhibitory homeostasis rectified by modulation of the upregulated purinoreceptor system may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to normalize selective dysfunctional synaptic homeostasis during pathogenesis of AD.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While the hippocampus (HPC) is a prime candidate combining object identity and location due to its strong connections to the ventral and dorsal pathways via surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas, recent physiological studies have reported spatial information in the ventral pathway and its downstream target in MTL. However, it remains unknown whether the object–location association proceeds along the ventral MTL pathway before HPC. To address this question, we recorded neuronal activity from MTL and area anterior inferotemporal cortex (TE) of two macaques gazing at an object to retain its identity and location in each trial. The results showed significant effects of object–location association at a single-unit level in TE, perirhinal cortex (PRC), and HPC, but not in the parahippocampal cortex. Notably, a clear area difference emerged in the association form: 1) representations of object identity were added to those of subjects’ viewing location in TE; 2) PRC signaled both the additive form and the conjunction of the two inputs; and 3) HPC signaled only the conjunction signal. These results suggest that the object and location signals are combined stepwise at TE and PRC each time primates view an object, and PRC may provide HPC with the conjunctional signal, which might be used for encoding episodic memory.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Electrical activity is important for brain development. In brain slices, human subplate neurons exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that is highly sensitive to lanthanum. Based on the results of pharmacological experiments in human fetal tissue, we hypothesized that hemichannel-forming connexin (Cx) isoforms 26, 36, and 45 would be expressed on neurons in the subplate (SP) zone. RNA sequencing of dissected human cortical mantles at ages of 17–23 gestational weeks revealed that Cx45 has the highest expression, followed by Cx36 and Cx26. The levels of Cx and pannexin expression between male and female fetal cortices were not significantly different. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Cx45- and Cx26-expressing neurons in the upper segment of the SP zone. Cx45 was present on the cell bodies of human SP neurons, while Cx26 was found on both cell bodies and dendrites. Cx45, Cx36, and Cx26 were strongly expressed in the cortical plate, where newborn migrating neurons line up to form cortical layers. New information about the expression of 3 “neuronal” Cx isoforms in each cortical layer/zone (e.g., SP, cortical plate) and pharmacological data with cadmium and lanthanum may improve our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal development in human fetuses and potential vulnerabilities.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain asymmetry is inherent to cognitive processing and seems to reflect processing efficiency. Lower frontal asymmetry is often observed in older adults during memory retrieval, yet it is unclear whether lower asymmetry implies an age-related increase in contralateral recruitment, whether less asymmetry reflects compensation, is limited to frontal regions, or predicts neurocognitive stability or decline. We assessed age-related differences in asymmetry across the entire cerebral cortex, using functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 89 young and 76 older adults during successful retrieval, and surface-based methods allowing direct homotopic comparison of activity between cortical hemispheres 
. An extensive left-asymmetric network facilitated retrieval in both young and older adults, whereas diverse frontal and parietal regions exhibited lower asymmetry in older adults. However, lower asymmetry was not associated with age-related increases in contralateral recruitment but primarily reflected either less deactivation in contralateral regions reliably signaling retrieval failure in the young or lower recruitment of the dominant hemisphere—suggesting that functional deficits may drive lower asymmetry in older brains, not compensatory activity. Lower asymmetry predicted neither current memory performance nor the extent of memory change across the preceding ~ 8 years in older adults. Together, these findings are inconsistent with a compensation account for lower asymmetry during retrieval and aging.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The aim of this study was to develop and validate a method of disease classification for bipolar disorder (BD) by functional activity and connectivity using radiomics analysis. Ninety patients with unmedicated BD II as well as 117 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). A total of 4 types of 7018 features were extracted after preprocessing, including mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Then, predictive features were selected by Mann–Whitney &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt; test and removing variables with a high correlation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was further used to select features. At last, support vector machine (SVM) model was used to estimate the state of each subject based on the selected features after LASSO. Sixty-five features including 54 RSFCs, 7 mALFFs, 1 mReHo, and 3 VMHCs were selected. The accuracy and area under curve (AUC) of the SVM model built based on the 65 features is 87.3% and 0.919 in the training dataset, respectively, and the accuracy and AUC of this model validated in the validation dataset is 80.5% and 0.838, respectively. These findings demonstrate a valid radiomics approach by rs-fMRI can identify BD individuals from healthy controls with a high classification accuracy, providing the potential adjunctive approach to clinical diagnostic systems.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The pulvinar is the largest extrageniculate visual nucleus in mammals. Given its extensive reciprocal connectivity with the visual cortex, it allows the cortico-thalamocortical transfer of visual information. Nonetheless, knowledge of the nature of the pulvinar inputs to the cortex remains elusive. We investigated the impact of silencing the pulvinar on the contrast response function of neurons in 2 distinct hierarchical cortical areas in the cat (areas 17 and 21a). Pulvinar inactivation altered the response gain in both areas, but with larger changes observed in area 21a. A theoretical model was proposed, simulating the pulvinar contribution to cortical contrast responses by modifying the excitation-inhibition balanced state of neurons across the cortical hierarchy. Our experimental and theoretical data showed that the pulvinar exerts a greater modulatory influence on neuronal activity in area 21a than in the primary visual cortex, indicating that the pulvinar impact on cortical visual neurons varies along the cortical hierarchy.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Behavioral change studies and interventions focus on self-control and external reinforcements to influence preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) has been shown to induce preference changes lasting months by merely associating items with neutral cues and speeded responses. We utilized this paradigm to study neural representation of preferences and their modification without external reinforcements. We scanned 36 participants with fMRI during a novel passive viewing task before, after and 30 days following CAT. We preregistered the predictions that activity in memory, top-down attention, and value-processing regions will underlie preference modification. While most theories associate preferences with prefrontal regions, we found that “bottom-up” perceptual mechanisms were associated with immediate change, whereas reduced “top-down” parietal activity was related to long-term change. Activity in value-related prefrontal regions was enhanced immediately after CAT for trained items and 1 month after for all items. Our findings suggest a novel neural mechanism of preference representation and modification. We suggest that nonreinforced change of preferences occurs initially in perceptual representation of items, putatively leading to long-term changes in “top-down” processes. These findings offer implementation of bottom-up instead of top-down targeted interventions for long-lasting behavioral change.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Measuring brain morphology with non-invasive structural magnetic resonance imaging is common practice, and can be used to investigate neuroplasticity. Brain morphology changes have been reported over the course of weeks, days, and hours in both animals and humans. If such short-term changes occur even faster, rapid morphological changes while being scanned could have important implications. In a randomized within-subject study on 47 healthy individuals, two high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired (á 263 s) per individual. The images were acquired during passive viewing of pictures or a fixation cross. Two common pipelines for analyzing brain images were used: voxel-based morphometry on gray matter (GM) volume and surface-based cortical thickness. We found that the measures of both GM volume and cortical thickness showed increases in the visual cortex while viewing pictures relative to a fixation cross. The increase was distributed across the two hemispheres and significant at a corrected level. Thus, brain morphology enlargements were detected in less than 263 s. Neuroplasticity is a far more dynamic process than previously shown, suggesting that individuals’ current mental state affects indices of brain morphology. This needs to be taken into account in future morphology studies and in everyday clinical practice.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Accurately predicting and testing the types of Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) of each patient using cost-effective microarray-based expression data and machine learning algorithms could greatly help either identifying the most targeting medicine or adopting other therapeutic measures that could correct/restore defective genetic signaling at the early stage. Furthermore, the prediction model construction processes can also help identifying highly informative genes controlling PAH, leading to enhanced understanding of the disease etiology and molecular pathways. In this study, we used several different gene filtering methods based on microarray expression data obtained from a high-quality patient PAH dataset. Following that, we proposed a novel feature selection and refinement algorithm in conjunction with well-known machine learning methods to identify a small set of highly informative genes. Results indicated that clusters of small-expression genes could be extremely informative at predicting and differentiating different forms of PAH. Additionally, our proposed novel feature refinement algorithm could lead to significant enhancement in model performance. To summarize, integrated with state-of-the-art machine learning and novel feature refining algorithms, the most accurate models could provide near-perfect classification accuracies using very few (close to ten) low-expression genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P1OQe1SrVTc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Antimicrobial resistance is one of the major public health threats of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. There is a pressing need to adopt more efficient treatment strategies in order to prevent the emergence and spread of resistant strains. The common approach is to treat patients with high drug doses, both to clear the infection quickly and to reduce the risk of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; resistance. Recently, several studies have argued that, at least in some cases, low-dose treatments could be more suitable to reduce the within-host emergence of antimicrobial resistance. However, the choice of a drug dose may have consequences at the population level, which has received little attention so far. Here, we study the influence of the drug dose on resistance and disease management at the host and population levels. We develop a nested two-strain model and unravel trade-offs in treatment benefits between an individual and the community. We use several measures to evaluate the benefits of any dose choice. Two measures focus on the emergence of resistance, at the host level and at the population level. The other two focus on the overall treatment success: the outbreak probability and the disease burden. We find that different measures can suggest different dosing strategies. In particular, we identify situations where low doses minimize the risk of emergence of resistance at the individual level, while high or intermediate doses prove most beneficial to improve the treatment efficiency or even to reduce the risk of resistance in the population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v7Bz51lbV7o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Large-scale brain networks are increasingly recognized as important for the generation of seizures in epilepsy. However, how a network evolves from a healthy state through the process of epileptogenesis remains unclear. To address this question, here, we study longitudinal epicranial background EEG recordings (30 electrodes, EEG free from epileptiform activity) of a mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We analyze functional connectivity networks and observe that over the time course of epileptogenesis the networks become increasingly asymmetric. Furthermore, computational modelling reveals that a set of nodes, located outside of the region of initial insult, emerges as particularly important for the network dynamics. These findings are consistent with experimental observations, thus demonstrating that ictogenic mechanisms can be revealed on the EEG, that computational models can be used to monitor unfolding epileptogenesis and that both the primary focus and epileptic network play a role in epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Standard artificial neural networks model key cognitive aspects of brain
function, such as learning and classification, but they do not model the
affective (emotional) aspects; however primary and secondary emotions play a
key role in interactions with the physical, ecological, and social environment.
These emotions are associated with memories when neuromodulators such as
dopamine and noradrenaline affect entire patterns of synaptically activated
neurons. Standard artificial neural networks (ANNs) do not model this non-local
effect of neuromodulators, which are a significant feature in the brain (the
associated `ascending systems' have been hard-wired into the brain by
evolutionary processes). In this paper we present a salience-affected neural
network (SANN) model which, at the same time as local network processing of
task-specific information, includes non-local salience (significance) effects
responding to an input salience signal. We show that during training, a SANN
allows for single-exposure learning of an image and associated salience signal.
During pattern recognition, input combinations similar to the salience-affected
inputs in the training data sets will produce reverse salience signals
corresponding to those experienced when the memories were laid down. In
addition, training with salience affects the weights of connections between
nodes, and improves the overall accuracy of a classification of images similar
to the salience-tagged input after just a single iteration of training.

 &lt;p&gt;Predicting how the brain can be driven to specific states by means of
internal or external control requires a fundamental understanding of the
relationship between neural connectivity and activity. Network control theory
is a powerful tool from the physical and engineering sciences that can provide
insights regarding that relationship; it formalizes the study of how the
dynamics of a complex system can arise from its underlying structure of
interconnected units. Given the recent use of network control theory in
neuroscience, it is now timely to offer a practical guide to methodological
considerations in the controllability of structural brain networks. Here we
provide a systematic overview of the framework, examine the impact of modeling
choices on frequently studied control metrics, and suggest potentially useful
theoretical extensions. We ground our discussions, numerical demonstrations,
and theoretical advances in a dataset of high-resolution diffusion imaging with
730 diffusion directions acquired over approximately 1 hour of scanning from
ten healthy young adults. Following a didactic introduction of the theory, we
probe how a selection of modeling choices affects four common statistics:
average controllability, modal controllability, minimum control energy, and
optimal control energy. Next, we extend the current state of the art in two
ways: first, by developing an alternative measure of structural connectivity
that accounts for radial propagation of activity through abutting tissue, and
second, by defining a complementary metric quantifying the complexity of the
energy landscape of a system. We close with specific modeling recommendations
and a discussion of methodological constraints.

 &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges in medicine is to dampen the pathophysiological
stress induced by an episode of ischemia. Such stress, due to various
pathological or clinical situations, follows a restriction in blood and oxygen
supply to tissue, causing a shortage of oxygen and nutrients that are required
for cellular metabolism. Ischemia can cause irreversible damage to target
tissue leading to a poor physiological recovery outcome for the patient.
Contrariwise, preconditioning by brief periods of ischemia has been shown in
multiple organs to confer tolerance against subsequent normally lethal
ischemia. By definition, preconditioning of organs must be applied
preemptively. This limits the applicability of preconditioning in clinical
situations, which arise unpredictably, such as myocardial infarction and
stroke. There are, however, clinical situations that arise as a result of
ischemia-reperfusion injury, which can be anticipated, and are therefore
adequate candidates for preconditioning. Organ and more particularly kidney
transplantation, the optimal treatment for suitable patients with end stage
renal disease (ESRD), is a predictable surgery that permits the use of
preconditioning protocols to prepare the organ for subsequent
ischemic/reperfusion stress. It therefore seems crucial to develop appropriate
preconditioning protocols against ischemia that will occur under
transplantation conditions, which up to now mainly referred to mechanical
ischemic preconditioning that triggers innate responses. It is not known if
preconditioning has to be applied to the donor, the recipient, or both. No
drug/target pair has been envisioned and validated in the clinic. Options for
identifying new target/drug pairs involve the use of model animals, such as
drosophila, in which some physiological pathways, such as the management of
oxygen, are highly conserved across evolution. Oxygen is the universal element
of life existence on earth. In this review we focus on a very specific pathway
of pharmacological preconditioning identified in drosophila that was
successfully transferred to mammalian models that has potential application in
human health. Very few mechanisms identified in these model animals have been
translated to an upper evolutionary level. This review highlights the
commonality between oxygen regulation between diverse animals.

 &lt;p&gt;Standard fMRI connectivity analyses depend on aggregating the time series of
individual voxels within regions of interest (ROIs). In certain cases, this
spatial aggregation implies a loss of valuable functional and anatomical
information about smaller subsets of voxels that drive the ROI level
connectivity. We use two recently published graphical search methods to
identify subsets of voxels that are highly responsible for the connectivity
between larger ROIs. To illustrate the procedure, we apply both methods to
longitudinal high-resolution resting state fMRI data from regions in the medial
temporal lobe from a single individual. Both methods recovered similar subsets
of voxels within larger ROIs of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus subfields
that also show spatial consistency across different scanning sessions and
across hemispheres. In contrast to standard functional connectivity methods,
both algorithms applied here are robust against false positive connections
produced by common causes and indirect paths (in contrast to Pearson's
correlation) and common effect conditioning (in contrast to partial correlation
based approaches). These algorithms allow for identification of subregions of
voxels driving the connectivity between regions of interest, recovering
valuable anatomical and functional information that is lost when ROIs are
aggregated. Both methods are specially suited for voxelwise connectivity
research, given their running times and scalability to big data problems.

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The cortical code that underlies perception must enable subjects to perceive the world at time scales relevant for behavior. We find that mice can integrate visual stimuli very quickly (&amp;lt;100 ms) to reach plateau performance in an orientation discrimination task. To define features of cortical activity that underlie performance at these time scales, we measured single-unit responses in the mouse visual cortex at time scales relevant to this task. In contrast to high-contrast stimuli of longer duration, which elicit reliable activity in individual neurons, stimuli at the threshold of perception elicit extremely sparse and unreliable responses in the primary visual cortex such that the activity of individual neurons does not reliably report orientation. Integrating information across neurons, however, quickly improves performance. Using a linear decoding model, we estimate that integrating information over 50–100 neurons is sufficient to account for behavioral performance. Thus, at the limits of visual perception, the visual system integrates information encoded in the probabilistic firing of unreliable single units to generate reliable behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Memory traces and associations between them are fundamental for cognitive brain function. Neuron recordings suggest that distributed assemblies of neurons in the brain serve as memory traces for spatial information, real-world items, and concepts. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding neural codes for associated memory traces. Some studies suggest the emergence of overlaps between assemblies during an association, while others suggest that the assemblies themselves remain largely unchanged and new assemblies emerge as neural codes for associated memory items. Here we study the emergence of neural codes for associated memory items in a generic computational model of recurrent networks of spiking neurons with a data-constrained rule for spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The model depends critically on 2 parameters, which control the excitability of neurons and the scale of initial synaptic weights. By modifying these 2 parameters, the model can reproduce both experimental data from the human brain on the fast formation of associations through emergent overlaps between assemblies, and rodent data where new neurons are recruited to encode the associated memories. Hence, our findings suggest that the brain can use both of these 2 neural codes for associations, and dynamically switch between them during consolidation.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Theoretical works suggested a wide array of possible mechanisms for rhythmogenesis ranging from the regulation of cellular properties to top–down control. Here we discuss theories of rhythmogenesis with an emphasis on spike timing-dependent plasticity. We argue that even though the specifics of different mechanisms vary greatly they all share certain key features. Namely, rhythmogenesis can be described as a flow on the phase diagram leading the system into a rhythmic region and stabilizing it on a specific manifold characterized by the desired rhythmic activity. Functionality is retained despite biological diversity by forcing the system into a specific manifold, but allowing fluctuations within that manifold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Plasticity in the oculomotor system ensures that saccadic eye movements reliably meet their visual goals—to bring regions of interest into foveal, high-acuity vision. Here, we present a comprehensive description of sensorimotor learning in saccades. We induced continuous adaptation of saccade amplitudes using a double-step paradigm, in which participants saccade to a peripheral target stimulus, which then undergoes a surreptitious, intra-saccadic shift (ISS) as the eyes are in flight. In our experiments, the ISS followed a systematic variation, increasing or decreasing from one saccade to the next as a sinusoidal function of the trial number. Over a large range of frequencies, we confirm that adaptation gain shows (1) a periodic response, reflecting the frequency of the ISS with a delay of a number of trials, and (2) a simultaneous drift towards lower saccade gains. We then show that state-space-based linear time-invariant systems (LTIS) represent suitable generative models for this evolution of saccade gain over time. This &lt;i&gt;state-equation&lt;/i&gt; algorithm computes the prediction of an internal (or hidden state-) variable by learning from recent feedback errors, and it can be compared to experimentally observed adaptation gain. The algorithm also includes a forgetting rate that quantifies per-trial leaks in the adaptation gain, as well as a systematic, non-error-based bias. Finally, we study how the parameters of the generative models depend on features of the ISS. Driven by a sinusoidal disturbance, the state-equation admits an exact analytical solution that expresses the parameters of the phenomenological description as functions of those of the generative model. Together with statistical model selection criteria, we use these correspondences to characterize and refine the structure of compatible state-equation models. We discuss the relation of these findings to established results and suggest that they may guide further design of experimental research across domains of sensorimotor adaptation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fhHPZoP9o_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Social recognition in mammals depends on complex interactions between sensory and other brain areas as well as modulatory inputs by specific neuropeptides such as oxytocin (OXT). Social recognition memory specifically has been shown to depend among others on olfactory processing, and can be probed using methods similar to those used when probing non-social odor memory. We here use a computational model of two interconnected olfactory networks in the mouse, the olfactory bulb and anterior olfactory nucleus, to propose a mechanism for olfactory short term recognition memory and its modulation in social situations. Based on previous experiments, we propose one early locus for memory to be the olfactory bulb. During social encounters in mice, pyramidal cells in the AON, themselves driven by olfactory input, are rendered more excitable by OXT release, resulting in stronger feedback to olfactory bulb local interneurons. This additional input to the OB creates stronger dynamics and improves signal to noise ratio of odor responses in the OB proper. As a consequence, mouse social olfactory memories are more strongly encoded and their duration is modulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Oxytocin has long been associated with modulating neural networks during social encounters. We here use a computational model to show how neural plasticity, modulation and memory for social odors interact when animals encounter conspecific odors. To date the exact neural processes of oxytocin modulation of social odor memory are not elucidated; our modeling approach allows us to draw from a number of experimental data from different levels of analyses to create a coherent framework for how oxytocin modulates odor processing to match behavioral demands.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurons in the adult mammalian CNS fails to regenerate after severe injury. However, it is known that an increase in neural activity occurs in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after extrinsic stimulation and this can induce axon growth. In the present study, we applied an optogenetic approach using a mouse model, specifically involving channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression in RGCs. We investigated whether modulation of RGC neural activity exclusively by blue light stimulation is able to promote neurite outgrowth of postnatal retinal explants. The results showed that activation of RGCs expressing ChR2 by 20 Hz blue light for 1 h is a most effective way of enhancing neurite outgrowth in postnatal retinas. This is achieved via gap junctions that spread neural activity across the whole retina. Moreover, we found that activation of intrinsic photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) by blue light also contributes significantly to the promotion of neurite outgrowth in the same postnatal retinal explants. Our findings not only demonstrate that a short-term increase in RGC neural activity is sufficient to facilitate the neurite outgrowth of retinal explants, but also highlight the fact that the temporal pattern of neural activity in RGCs is a critical factor in regulating axon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background: Nrf2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2) is believed to play a major role in neurodegenerative diseases. The present study attempted to investigate the hippocampal circRNA and lncRNA expression profiles associated with Nrf2-mediated neuroprotection.
Methods: The hippocampal mRNA, circRNA and lncRNA expression profiles of Nrf2 (-/-) mice were determined by microarray analysis. Bioinformatics analyses, including identification of differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), DEcircRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA interaction network construction, DElncRNA-DEmRNA co-expression network construction, and biological function annotation, were conducted. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the dysregulated expression of circRNAs and lncRNAs derived from the microarray data of the hippocampus of Nrf2 (-/-) mice.
Results: Compared to wild-type Nrf2 (+/+) mice, 412 DEmRNAs (109 up- and 303 down-regulated mRNAs), 1279 DEcircRNAs (632 up- and 647 down-regulated circRNAs), and 303 DElncRNAs (50 up- and 253 down-regulated lncRNAs) were identified in the hippocampus of Nrf2 (-/-) mice. Additionally, in qRT-PCR validation results, the expression patterns of selected DEcircRNAs and DElncRNAs were generally consistent with results in the microarray data. The DEcircRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA interaction networks revealed that mmu_circRNA_44531, mmu_circRNA_34132, mmu_circRNA_000903, mmu_circRNA_018676, mmu_circRNA_45901, mmu_circRNA_33836, mmu_circRNA_34137, mmu_circRNA_34106, mmu_circRNA_008691, and mmu_circRNA_003237 were predicted to compete with 47, 54, 45, 57, 63, 81, 121, 85, 181, and 43 DEmRNAs, respectively. ENSMUST00000125413, NR_028123, uc008nfy.1, AK076764, AK142725, AK080547 and AK035903 were co-expressed with 178, 89, 149, 179, 142, 55 and 112 DEmRNAs in the Nrf2 (-/-) hippocampus, respectively.
Conclusions: In conclusion, our study might contribute to exploring the key circRNAs and lncRNAs associated with Nrf2-mediated neuroprotection.</content>

 Neurological deficits and cognitive dysfunctions caused by acute ischemic stroke pose enormous burden to the stroke families and the communities. Restoration of the normal function of the neurovascular unit following ischemic stroke is critical for improving neurological recovery and cognitive functions after stroke. Recent evidences suggest that the myeloid cells including both the resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils are highly plastic in response to the environmental cues. They intimately interact with multiple components of the neurovascular unit in response to the alarmins, danger associated pattern molecules (DAMPs) and other signals released from the ischemic brain. The aim of this review is to discuss the reciprocal interactions between the myeloid cells and the ischemic neurovascular unit during the late repair phase of cerebral ischemic stroke. We also summarize potential immunotherapeutic targets on myeloid cells and new therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, such as cell transplantation, mitochondrial dynamic and extracellular vesicles-based therapy and et al to enhance neurovascular repair for better stroke recovery.</content>

 Optical stimulation and imaging of neurons deep in the brain require implantable optical neural probes. External optical access to deeper regions of the brain is limited by scattering and absorption of light as it propagates through tissue. Implantable optoelectronic probes capable of high-resolution light delivery and high-density neural recording are needed for closed-loop manipulation of neural circuits. Micro-light-emitting diodes (µLEDs) have been used for optical stimulation, but predominantly on rigid silicon or sapphire substrates. Flexible polymer neural probes would be preferable for chronic applications since they cause less damage to brain tissue. Flexible LED neural probes have been recently implemented by flip-chip bonding of commercially available µLED chips onto flexible substrates. Here, we demonstrate a monolithic design for flexible optoelectronic neural interfaces with embedded gallium nitride µLEDs that can be microfabricated at wafer-scale. Parylene C is used as the substrate and insulator due to its biocompatibility, compliance, and optical transparency. We demonstrate one-dimensional and two-dimensional individually-addressable µLED arrays. Our µLEDs have sizes as small as 22 µm × 22 µm in arrays of up to 32 µLEDs per probe shank. These devices emit blue light at a wavelength of 445 nm, suitable for stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2, with output power greater than 200 µW at 2 mA. Our flexible optoelectronic probes are double-sided and can illuminate brain tissue from both sides of the flexible probe. Recording electrodes are co-fabricated with µLEDs on the front- and backside of the optoelectronic probes for electrophysiology recording of neuronal activity from the volumes of tissue on the front- and backside simultaneously with bi-directional optical stimulation.</content>

 Minimally-invasive monitoring of electrophysiological neural activities in real-time—that enables quantification of neural functions without a need for invasive craniotomy and the longer time constants of fMRI and PET—presents a very challenging yet significant task for neuroimaging. In this paper, we present in vivo functional PA (fPA) imaging of chemoconvulsant rat seizure model with intact scalp using a fluorescence quenching-based cyanine voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) characterized by a lipid vesicle model mimicking different levels of membrane potential variation. The framework also involves use of a near-infrared VSD delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Our normalized time-frequency analysis presented in vivo VSD response in the seizure group significantly distinguishable from those of the control groups at sub-mm spatial resolution. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that the near-infrared fPA VSD imaging is a promising tool for in vivo recording of brain activities through intact scalp, which would pave a way to its future translation.</content>

 In experimental psychology, subjects are confronted with computer-based
experimental paradigms. Creating such paradigms can require quite an effort.
PyParadigm is a newly developed Python library to ease the development of such
paradigms by employing a declarative approach to build user interfaces (UIs).
This approach is a highly code-efficient alternative to currently
available libraries. Although PyParadigm was initially developed for the
creation of experimental paradigms, it is generally suited to build UIs that
display or interact with 2D objects.</content>

 The purpose of this study is to clarify whether there is a learning effect on brain activity after writing with an ink pen vs. a digital pen. Previous studies have reported the superiority of handwriting to typing in terms of learning performance, but differences between the use of an ink pen vs. a digital pen remain unclear. In the present study, the participants learned to read difficult words by writing with an ink pen vs. a digital pen. After the learning period, electroencephalography signals were measured, while the participants underwent a repetition priming paradigm with the use of the learned words. The repetition priming effect of the N400 event-related potential was quantified as an index of the learning effect and the effects between pen types were compared. The groups were also subdivided according to whether a digital pen is frequently used (familiar vs. unfamiliar group). The number of writing repetitions for each word within 10 min during the learning activity and the post-learning test scores were not affected by the pen type or familiarity with a digital pen. However, the repetition priming effect of the N400 was greater for words written with a digital pen in the learning session, as compared with an ink pen, in the familiar group, but not the unfamiliar group. These results suggest that for those familiar with its use, writing with a digital pen may improve learning relative to the use of an ink pen.</content>

 Background: Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, has tremendous social and economic impact worldwide. This study aimed to analyze global trends in Alzheimer's disease research and to investigate China’s contribution to this research. 
Methods: The quantity and influence of publications related to Alzheimer's disease in China and elsewhere were compared. The Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched from 1988 to 2017 using the terms “Alzheimer's disease” or “Alzheimers disease.” Global Alzheimer's disease publications were classified and analyzed. Keywords, countries, and institutions publishing articles on Alzheimer’s disease were analyzed, and citations of these articles were examined.
Results: A total of 181,116 articles regarding Alzheimer's disease research were identified and analyzed. Neuroscience and neurology were the main research categories both globally and in China. Basic research dominated Alzheimer’s publications, accounting for 30.93% of global publications and 95.31% of publications in China. A total of 8,935 journals published articles related to Alzheimer’s disease. The journal Neurobiology of Aging published the most Alzheimer’s disease-related articles, numbering 5,206 over the time period examined. The National Institutes of Health, the National Institute on Aging, and the Department of Health and Human Services jointly sponsored 11,809 articles, ranking first in the world. The National Natural Science Foundation of China funded the largest number of studies on Alzheimer's disease in China and recognized the importance of traditional Chinese medicine in Alzheimer’s disease research. 
Conclusions: The present study provides data for global researchers to understand research perspectives and develop future research directions. In recent years, Chinese researchers have contributed significantly to global Alzheimer’s research. Still, strengthening international cooperation could improve the quality and number of publications regarding Alzheimer’s disease.</content>

 The cerebellar involvement in cognitive functions such as attention, language, working memory, emotion, goal-directed behavior and spatial navigation is constantly growing. However, an exact connectivity map between the hippocampus and cerebellum in mice is still unknown. Here, we conducted a tracing study to identify the sequence of transsynaptic, cerebellar-hippocampal connections in the mouse brain using combinations of recombinant adeno-associated (rAAV) and pseudotyped deletion-mutant rabies (RABV) viruses. Stereotaxic injection of a primarily anterograde rAAV-WGA (wheat germ agglutinin)-Cre tracer virus in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter mouse resulted in strong tdTomato labeling in hippocampal CA1 neurons, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), rhinal cortex (RC) as well as thalamic and cerebellar areas. Whereas hippocampal injections with the retrograde tracer virus rAAV-TTC (tetanus toxin C fragment)-eGFP, displayed eGFP positive cells in the rhinal cortex and subiculum. To determine the sequence of mono-transsynaptic connections between the cerebellum and hippocampus, we used the retrograde tracer RABVΔG-eGFP(EnvA). The tracing revealed a direct connection from the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), RC and subiculum (S), which are monosynaptically connected to thalamic laterodorsal and ventrolateral areas. These thalamic nuclei are directly connected to cerebellar fastigial (FN), interposed (IntP) and lateral (Lat) nuclei, discovering a new projection route from the fastigial to the laterodorsal thalamic nucleus in the mouse brain. Collectively, our findings suggest a new cerebellar-hippocampal connection via the laterodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus to RSC, RC and S. These results strengthen the notion of the cerebellum’s involvement in cognitive functions such as spatial navigation via a polysynaptic circuitry.</content>

 The complex and elaborate architecture of a neuron poses a great challenge to the cellular machinery which localizes proteins and organelles, such as mitochondria, to necessary locations. Proper mitochondrial localization in neurons is particularly important as this organelle provides energy and metabolites essential to form and maintain functional neural connections. Consequently, maintenance of a healthy pool of mitochondria and removal of damaged organelles are essential for neuronal homeostasis. Long distance transport of the organelle itself as well as components necessary for maintaining mitochondria in distal compartments are important for a constant supply of healthy mitochondria at the right time and place. Accordingly, many neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with mitochondrial abnormalities. Here we review our current understanding on transport-dependent mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial replenishment. We focus on axonal transport and import of mRNAs and proteins destined for mitochondria as well as mitochondrial fusion and fission to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in distal compartments of the neuron.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition whose primary features include social communication and interaction impairments with restricted or repetitive motor movements. No approved treatment for the core symptoms is available and considerable research efforts aim at identifying effective therapeutic strategies.
Emerging evidence suggests that altered endocannabinoid signaling and immune dysfunction might contribute to ASD pathogenesis. In this scenario, phytocannabinoids could hold great pharmacological potential due to their combined capacities to act either directly or indirectly on components of the endocannabinoid system and to modulate immune functions. Among all plant-cannabinoids, the phytocannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) was recently shown to reduce motor impairments and cognitive deficits in animal models of Rett Syndrome, a condition showing some degree of overlap with autism, raising the possibility that CBDV might have therapeutic potential in ASD.
Here, we investigated the ability of CBDV treatment to reverse or prevent ASD-like behaviors in male rats prenatally exposed to VPA (500mg/kg i.p.; gestation day 12.5). The offspring received CBDV according to two different protocols: symptomatic (0.2/2/20/100mg/kg i.p.; postnatal days 34-58) and preventative (2/20mg/kg i.p.; postnatal days 19-29). The major efficacy of CBDV was observed at the dose of 20mg/kg for both treatment schedules. CBDV in symptomatic rats recovered social impairments, social novelty preference, short-term memory deficits, repetitive behaviors and hyperlocomotion whereas preventative treatment reduced sociability and social novelty deficits, short-term memory impairments and hyperlocomotion, without affecting stereotypies. As dysregulations in the endocannabinoid system and neuroinflammatory markers contribute to the development of some ASD phenotypes in the VPA model, neurochemical studies were performed after symptomatic treatment to investigate possible CBDV’s effects on the endocannabinoid system, inflammatory markers and microglia activation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Prenatal VPA exposure increased CB1 receptor, FAAH and MAGL levels, enhanced GFAP, CD11b and TNFα levels and triggered microglia activation restricted to the hippocampus. All these alterations were restored after CBDV treatment.
These data provide preclinical evidence in support of the ability of CBDV to ameliorate behavioral abnormalities resembling core and associated symptoms of ASD. At the neurochemical level, symptomatic CBDV restores hippocampal endocannabinoid signaling and neuroinflammation induced by prenatal VPA exposure.</content>

 Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord is a promising rehabilitation intervention to restore/augment motor function after spinal cord injury. Combining sensory feedback with stimulation of remaining motor circuits has been shown to be a prerequisite for the functional improvement of spinal cord injury patients. However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms potentially underlying this functional benefit in the injured spinal cord.  Here, we combine computer simulations with an isolated whole-tissue adult mouse spinal cord preparation to examine synaptic, cellular, and system potentials measured from single motoneurons and ventral roots. The stimulation protocol included separate and combined activation of the sensory inputs (evoked by dorsal root stimulation) and motor inputs (evoked by stimulation of spinal cord tissue) at different frequencies, intensities, and neuromodulatory states. Our data show that, while sensory inputs exhibit short-term depression in response to a train of stimulation, motor inputs exhibit short-term facilitation. However, the concurrent activation of both inputs elicits a stronger and steadier motor output. This effect is enhanced by the application of pharmacological neuromodulators. Furthermore, sensorimotor excitatory postsynaptic potentials summate sublinearly (i.e., their combination produces an excitatory potential smaller than the sum of the excitatory potentials they would individually produce). However, ventral root compound action potentials summate supralinearly generating much higher outputs. Computer simulations revealed that the contrasting summation and disproportionality in plasticity between the excitatory postsynaptic potentials and compound action potentials result from the motoneuronal firing threshold acting as an amplitude-selective filter. Together, these results provide the mechanistic basis for the cellular processes contributing to the generation of steady motor outputs using spinal stimulation. This data has great potential to guide the design of more effective stimulation protocols in spinal cord injury patients.</content>

 The identification of biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important and urgent area of study, not only to aid in the early diagnosis of AD, but also to evaluate potentially new anti-AD drugs. The aim of this study was to explore cofilin 2 in serum as a novel biomarker for AD. The upregulation was observed in AD patients and different AD animal models compared to the controls, as well as in AD cell models. Memantine and donepezil can attenuate the upregulation of cofilin 2 expression in APP/PS1 mice. The serum levels of cofilin 2 in AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients were significantly higher compared to controls (AD: 167.9±35.3 pg/mL; MCI: 115.9±15.4 pg/mL; Control: 90.5±27.1 pg/mL; p&amp;lt;0.01). A significant correlation between cofilin 2 levels and cognitive decline was observed (r=–0.792; p&amp;lt;0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of cofilin 2 was 0.957, and the diagnostic accuracy was 80%, with 93% sensitivity and 87% specificity. The optimal cut-off value was 130.4 pg/ml. Our results indicate the possibility of serum cofilin 2 as a novel and non-invasive biomarker for AD. In addition, the expression of cofilin 2 was found to be significantly increased in AD compared to vascular dementia (VaD), and only an increased trend but not significant was detected in VaD compared to the controls. ROC analysis between AD and VaD showed that the AUC was 0.824, which could indicate a role of cofilin 2 as a biomarker in the differential diagnosis between AD and VaD.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The multiplex role of cadherin-based adhesion complexes during development of pallial excitatory neurons has been thoroughly characterized. In contrast, much less is known about their function during interneuron development. Here, we report that conditional removal of N-cadherin (Cdh2) from postmitotic neuroblasts of the subpallium results in a decreased number of Gad65-GFP-positive interneurons in the adult cortex. We also found that interneuron precursor migration into the pallium was already delayed at E14. Using immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay in the embryonic subpallium, we excluded decreased mitosis and elevated cell death as possible sources of this defect. Moreover, by analyzing the interneuron composition of the adult somatosensory cortex, we uncovered an unexpected interneuron-type-specific defect caused by &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Cdh2&lt;/span&gt;-loss. This was not due to a fate-switch between interneuron populations or altered target selection during migration. Instead, potentially due to the migration delay, part of the precursors failed to enter the cortical plate and consequently got eliminated at early postnatal stages. In summary, our results indicate that Cdh2-mediated interactions are necessary for migration and survival during the postmitotic phase of interneuron development. Furthermore, we also propose that unlike in pallial glutamatergic cells, Cdh2 is not universal, rather a cell type-specific factor during this process.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain aging is highly variable and represents a challenge to delimit aging from disease processes. Moreover, genetic factors may influence both aging and disease. Here we focused on this issue and investigated effects of multiple genetic loci previously identified to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) on brain structure of older adults from a population sample. We calculated a genetic risk score (GRS) using genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms from genome-wide association studies of AD and tested its effect on cortical thickness (CT). We observed a common pattern of cortical thinning (right inferior frontal, left posterior temporal, medial occipital cortex). To identify CT changes by specific biological processes, we subdivided the GRS effect according to AD-associated pathways and performed follow-up analyses. The common pattern from the main analysis was further differentiated by pathway-specific effects yielding a more bilateral pattern. Further findings were located in the superior parietal and mid/anterior cingulate regions representing 2 unique pathway-specific patterns. All patterns, except the superior parietal pattern, were influenced by apolipoprotein E. Our step-wise approach revealed atrophy patterns that partially resembled imaging findings in early stages of AD. Our study provides evidence that genetic burden for AD contributes to structural brain variability in normal aging.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Spontaneous sub-cellular calcium release events (SCRE) are conjectured to promote rapid arrhythmias associated with conditions such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation: they can underlie the emergence of spontaneous action potentials in single cells which can lead to arrhythmogenic triggers in tissue. The multi-scale mechanisms of the development of SCRE into arrhythmia triggers, and their dynamic interaction with the tissue substrate, remain elusive; rigorous and simultaneous study of dynamics from the nanometre to the centimetre scale is a major challenge. The aim of this study was to develop a computational approach to overcome this challenge and study potential bi-directional coupling between sub-cellular and tissue-scale arrhythmia phenomena. A framework comprising a hierarchy of computational models was developed, which includes detailed single-cell models describing spatio-temporal calcium dynamics in 3D, efficient non-spatial cell models, and both idealised and realistic tissue models. A phenomenological approach was implemented to reproduce SCRE morphology and variability in the efficient cell models, comprising the definition of analytical Spontaneous Release Functions (SRF) whose parameters may be randomly sampled from appropriate distributions in order to match either the 3D cell models or experimental data. Pro-arrhythmogenic pacing protocols were applied to initiate re-entry and promote calcium overload, leading to the emergence of SCRE. The SRF accurately reproduced the dynamics of SCRE and its dependence on environment variables under multiple different conditions. Sustained re-entrant excitation promoted calcium overload, and led to the emergence of focal excitations after termination. A purely functional mechanism of re-entry and focal activity localisation was demonstrated, related to the unexcited spiral wave core. In conclusion, a novel approach has been developed to dynamically model SCRE at the tissue scale, which facilitates novel, detailed multi-scale mechanistic analysis. It was revealed that complex re-entrant excitation patterns and SCRE may be bi-directionally coupled, promoting novel mechanisms of arrhythmia perpetuation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3M0-4_0aT3Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

From the microscopic to the macroscopic level, biological life exhibits directed migration in response to environmental conditions. Chemotaxis enables microbes to sense and move towards nutrient-rich regions or to avoid toxic ones. Socio-economic factors drive human populations from rural to urban areas. The effect of collective movement is especially significant when triggered in response to the generation of public goods. Microbial communities can, for instance, alter their environment through the secretion of extracellular substances. Some substances provide antibiotic-resistance, others provide access to nutrients or promote motility. However, in all cases the maintenance of public goods requires costly cooperation and is consequently susceptible to exploitation. The threat of exploitation becomes even more acute with motile individuals because defectors can avoid the consequences of their cheating. Here, we propose a model to investigate the effects of targeted migration and analyze the interplay between social conflicts and migration in ecological public goods. In particular, individuals can locate attractive regions by moving towards higher cooperator densities or avoid unattractive regions by moving away from defectors. Both migration patterns not only shape an individual’s immediate environment but also affects the entire population. For example, defectors hunting cooperators have a homogenizing effect on population densities. This limits the production of the public good and hence inhibits the growth of the population. In contrast, aggregating cooperators promote the spontaneous formation of patterns through heterogeneous density distributions. The positive feedback between cooperator aggregation and public goods production, however, poses analytical and numerical challenges due to its tendency to develop discontinuous distributions. Thus, different modes of directed migration bear the potential to enhance or inhibit the emergence of complex and sometimes dynamic spatial arrangements. Interestingly, whenever patterns emerge, cooperation is promoted, on average, population densities rise, and the risk of extinction is reduced.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hiilMIqWD-c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is known to be an effective treatment for a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor (ET). At present, it involves administering a train of pulses with constant frequency via electrodes implanted into the brain. New ‘closed-loop’ approaches involve delivering stimulation according to the ongoing symptoms or brain activity and have the potential to provide improvements in terms of efficiency, efficacy and reduction of side effects. The success of closed-loop DBS depends on being able to devise a stimulation strategy that minimizes oscillations in neural activity associated with symptoms of motor disorders. A useful stepping stone towards this is to construct a mathematical model, which can describe how the brain oscillations should change when stimulation is applied at a particular state of the system. Our work focuses on the use of coupled oscillators to represent neurons in areas generating pathological oscillations. Using a reduced form of the Kuramoto model, we analyse how a patient should respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude, provided a number of conditions are satisfied. For such patients, we predict that the best stimulation strategy should be phase specific but also that stimulation should have a greater effect if applied when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. We compare this surprising prediction with data obtained from ET patients. In light of our predictions, we also propose a new hybrid strategy which effectively combines two of the closed-loop strategies found in the literature, namely phase-locked and adaptive DBS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Jm---ynrOEA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the resting state, heartbeats evoke cortical responses called heartbeat-evoked responses (HERs), which reflect cortical cardiac interoceptive processing. While previous studies have reported that the heartbeat evokes cortical responses at a regional level, whether the heartbeat induces synchronization between regions to form a network structure remains unknown. Using resting-state MEG data from 85 human subjects of both genders, we first showed that heartbeat increases the phase synchronization between cortical regions in the theta frequency but not in other frequency bands. This increase in synchronization between cortical regions formed a network structure called the heartbeat-induced network (HIN), which did not reflect artificial phase synchronization. In the HIN, the left inferior temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus played a central role as hubs. Furthermore, the HIN was modularized, containing five subnetworks called modules. In particular, module 1 played a central role in between-module interactions in the HIN. Furthermore, synchronization within module 1 had a positive association with the mood of an individual. In this study, we show the existence of the HIN and its network properties, advancing the current understanding of cortical heartbeat processing and its relationship with mood, which was previously confined to region level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Approach-avoidance conflict arises when the drives to pursue reward and avoid harm are incompatible. Previous neuroimaging studies of approach-avoidance conflict have shown large variability in reported neuroanatomical correlates. These prior studies have generally neglected to account for potential sources of variability, such as individual differences in choice preferences and modeling of hemodynamic response during conflict. In the present study, we controlled for these limitations using a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). This enabled us to measure participant-specific per-trial estimates of conflict during an approach-avoidance task. We also employed a variable epoch method to identify brain structures specifically sensitive to conflict. In a sample of 28 human participants, we found that only a limited set of brain structures [inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and right pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA)] are specifically correlated with approach-avoidance conflict. These findings suggest that controlling for previous sources of variability increases the specificity of the neuroanatomical correlates of approach-avoidance conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The ability to recognize and identify a smell is highly dependent on multisensory context and expectation, for example, hearing the name of the odor source. Here, we develop a novel auditory-odor association task in rats, wherein the animal learns that a specific auditory tone, when associated with a specific odor, predicts reward (Go signal), whereas the same tone associated with a different odor, or vice versa, is not (No-Go signal). The tone occurs prior to the onset of the odor, allowing physiological analyses of sensory-evoked local field potential (LFP) activity to each stimulus in primary auditory cortex and anterior piriform cortex (aPCX). In trained animals that have acquired the task, both auditory and subsequent olfactory cues activate β band oscillations in both the auditory cortex and PCX, suggesting multisensory integration. Naive animals show no such multisensory responses, suggesting the response is learned. In addition to the learned multisensory evoked responses, functional connectivity between auditory cortex and PCX, as assessed with spectral coherence and phase lag index (PLI), is enhanced. Importantly, both the multi-sensory evoked responses and the functional connectivity are context-dependent. In trained animals, the same auditory stimuli presented in the home cage evoke no responses in auditory cortex or PCX, and functional connectivity between the sensory cortices is reduced. Together, the results demonstrate how learning and context shape the expression of multisensory cortical processing. Given that odor identification impairment is associated with preclinical dementia in humans, the mechanisms suggested here may help develop experimental models to assess effects of neuropathology on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The orphan receptor GPR88 is highly expressed in D1 receptor (D1R)- and D2R-medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and has been associated to striatum-dependent functions in rodents. The total deletion of &lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; in mice was shown to decrease anxiety-like behaviors, increase stereotypies and locomotion, and impair motor coordination and motor learning. Knowing the opposing role of D1R- and D2R-MSNs, we here investigated the respective roles of GPR88 in the two MSN subtypes for these behaviors. To do so, we compared effects of a conditional &lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; gene knock-out (KO) in D1R-MSNs (D1R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice) or D2R-MSNs (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice) with effects of the total &lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; KO (CMV-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice). Overall, most phenotypes of CMV-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice were recapitulated in A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice, including reduced marble burying, increased social interactions, increased locomotor activity and stereotypies in the open field, and reduced motor coordination in the rotarod. Exceptions were the reduced habituation to the open field and reduced motor skill learning, which were observed in CMV-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; and D1R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice, but not in A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice. D1R-&lt;i&gt;Gpr88&lt;/i&gt; mice otherwise showed no other phenotype in this study. Our data together show that GPR88 modulates the function of both D1R- and D2R-MSNs, and that GPR88 activity in these two neuron populations has very different and dissociable impacts on behavior. We suggest that GPR88 in D2R-MSNs shapes defensive and social behavior and contributes in maintaining the inhibition of basal ganglia outputs to control locomotion, stereotypies and motor coordination, while GPR88 in D1R-MSNs promotes novelty habituation and motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;A critical aspect of behavior is that mobile organisms must be able to precisely determine where and when to move. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying precise movement timing and action planning is therefore crucial to understanding how we interact with the world around us. Recent evidence suggest that our experience of time is directly and intrinsically computed within the motor system, consistent with the theory of embodied cognition. In order to investigate the role of the motor system, we tested human subjects (n=40) on a novel task combining reaching and time estimation. In this task, subjects were required to move a robotic manipulandum to one of two physical locations to categorize a concurrently timed suprasecond. Critically, subjects were divided into two groups: one in which movement during the interval was unrestricted and one in which they were restricted from moving until the stimulus interval had elapsed. Our results revealed a higher degree of precision for subjects in the free-moving group. A further experiment (n=14) verified that these findings were not due to proximity to the target, counting strategies, bias, or movement length. A final experiment (n=10) replicated these findings using a within-subjects design, performing a time reproduction task, in which movement during encoding of the interval led to more precise performance. Our findings suggest that time estimation may be instantiated within the motor system as an ongoing readout of timing judgment and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Perception is inherently a noisy process, wherein the nervous system must find a tradeoff between measurement noise, bias, distractions, and expectations. Recent evidence has begun to demonstrate that our perceptions and sensations are influenced by motor movements and actions. One area where this is of particular importance is the perception of time. Recent work has shown that our temporal perception fluidly changes with the length of our movements. Further, there is also evidence suggesting that movement not only biases perceived time, but can enhance it, suggesting the motor system directly influences temporal perception. We here show that when subjects are free to move during the timing of an auditory interval, the representation of that interval is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Depression is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a high rate of relapse and low rate of response to antidepressant treatment. However, there is a dearth of new drugs, attributed to our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in its etiopathology. Chronic stress appears to be one of the foremost underlying causes of depression. Using various animal models, efforts in the past decade has implicated epigenetic mechanisms in mediating the negative effects of chronic stressful events on the progression/manifestation of depression and other co-morbid neuropsychiatric disorders. However, non-coding RNAs, another layer of epigenetic regulation is relatively lesser studied in this context. Here, using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced depression model, we aimed to uncover dysregulation in miRNA-mRNA networks in the neurogenic dentate gyrus (DG) region of  male C57BL/6 mice. Among several dysregulated miRNAs, identified via miRNA arrays, the most striking finding was attenuated expression of miRNAs of the miR-30 family in stressed/defeated mice. To investigate miRNAs in the DG-resident neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs), we used the in vitro neurosphere culture, where proliferating NSCs/NPCs were subjected to differentiation. Among several differentially exprerssed miRNAs, we observed an upregulation of miR-30 miRNAs upon differentiation. To search for the gene targets of these miRNAs, we performed gene arrays followed by bioinformatics analysis, miRNA manipulations and luciferase assays. Our results suggest that miR-30 miRNAs mediate chronic stress-induced depression by altering hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity via controlling the epigenetic/transcription regulators such as Mll3 and Runx1 and cell signaling regulators like Socs3, Ppp3r1, Gpr125, and Nrp1.</content>

 Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), also known as NG2 glia, arise from neural progenitor cells in the embryonic ganglionic eminences that also generate inhibitory neurons. They are ubiquitously distributed in the central nervous system, remain proliferative through life, and generate oligodendrocytes in both gray and white matter. OPCs exhibit some lineage plasticity, and attempts have been made to reprogram them into neurons, with varying degrees of success. However, little is known about how epigenetic mechanisms affect the ability of OPCs to undergo fate switch and whether OPCs have a unique chromatin environment around neuronal genes that might contribute to their lineage plasticity. Our bioinformatic analysis of histone posttranslational modifications at interneuron genes in OPCs revealed that OPCs had significantly fewer bivalent and repressive histone marks at interneuron genes compared to astrocytes or fibroblasts. Conversely, OPCs had a greater degree of deposition active histone modifications at bivalently marked interneuron genes than other cell types, and this was correlated with higher expression levels of these genes in OPCs. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of interneuron genes in OPCs than in other cell types lacked the histone posttranslational modifications examined. These genes had a moderately high level of expression, suggesting that the “no mark” interneuron genes could be in a transcriptionally “poised” or “transitional” state. Thus, our findings suggest that OPCs have a unique histone code at their interneuron genes that may obviate the need for erasure of repressive marks during their fate switch to inhibitory neurons.</content>

 Progressive neurological deterioration poses enormous burden on the aging population with ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative disease patients, such as Alzheimers’ disease and Parkinson’s disease. The past two decades have witnessed remarkable advances in the research of neurovascular unit dysfunction, which is emerging as an important pathological feature that underlies these neurological disorders. Dysfunction of the unit allows penetration of blood-derived toxic proteins or leukocytes into the brain and contributes to white matter injury, disturbed neurovascular coupling and neuroinflammation, which all eventually lead to cognitive dysfunction. Recent evidences suggest that aging-related oxidative stress, accumulated DNA damage and impaired DNA repair capacities compromises the genome integrity not only in neurons, but also in other cell types of the neurovascular unit, such as endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Combating DNA damage or enhancing DNA repair capacities in the neurovascular unit represents a promising therapeutic strategy for vascular and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we focus on aging related mechanisms that underlie DNA damage and repair in the neurovascular unit and introduce several novel strategies that target the genome integrity in the neurovascular unit to combat the vascular and neurodegenerative disorders in the aging brain.</content>

 Background: Flow states are considered a positive, subjective experience during an optimal balance between skills and task demands. Previously, experimentally induced flow experiences have relied solely on adaptive tasks.
Objective: To investigate whether cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) area and anodal tDCS over the right parietal cortex area during video game play will promote an increased experience of flow states. 
Methods: Two studies had participants play Tetris or first-person shooter (FPS) video games while receiving either real tDCS or sham stimulation. Tetris recruited nineteen untrained players who infrequently played video games while the ten FPS participants played FPS frequently. Flow experience was assessed before and after stimulation.
Results: Compared to sham stimulation, real stimulation increased flow experience for both untrained Tetris and trained FPS players. No ceiling effects were noticed between trained and untrained groups.
Conclusion: Cathodal and anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC and right parietal areas respectively may encourage flow experiences in complex real-life motor tasks that occur during sports, games and everyday life.</content>

 In the study of human cognitive activity using electroencephalogram (EEG), the brain dynamics parameters and characteristics play a crucial role. They allow to investigate the changes in functionality depending on the environment and task performance process, and also to access the intensity of the brain activity in various locations of the cortex and its dependencies. Usually, the dynamics of activation of different brain areas during the cognitive tasks are being studied by spectral analysis based on power spectral density (PSD) estimation, and coherence analysis, which are de facto standard tools in quantitative characterization of brain activity. PSD and coherence reflect the strength of oscillations and similarity of the emergence of these oscillations in the brain, respectively, while the concept of stability of brain activity over time is not well defined and less formalized.   
We propose to employ the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) as a measure of the EEG persistence over time, and use the DFA scaling exponent as its quantitative characteristics. We applied DFA to the study of the changes in activation in brain dynamics during mental calculations and united it with PSD and coherence estimation. In the experiment, EEGs during resting state and mental serial subtraction from 36 subjects were recorded and analyzed in four frequency ranges: θ1 (4.1 - 5.8 Hz), θ2 (5.9 - 7.4 Hz), β1 (13 - 19.9 Hz), and β2 (20 - 25 Hz). PSD maps to access the intensity of cortex activation and coherence to quantify the connections between different brain areas were calculated, the distribution of DFA scaling exponent over the head surface was exploited to measure the time characteristics of the dynamics of brain activity.   
Obtained arrangements of DFA scaling exponent suggest that normal functioning of the brain is characterized by long-term temporal correlations in the cortex. Topographical distribution of the DFA scaling exponent was comparable for θ and β frequency bands, demonstrating the largest values of DFA scaling exponent during cognitive activation. The study shows that the long-term temporal correlations evaluated by DFA can be of great interest for diagnosis of the variety of brain dysfunctions of different etiology in future.</content>

 Cognitive decline is common in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and precise cognitive assessment is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. To date, there are no studies in PD investigating cultural bias on neuropsychological tests. Clinical practice in multicultural societies such as Toronto Canada, where nearly half of the population is comprised of first generation immigrants, presents important challenges as most neuropsychological tools were developed in Anglosphere cultures (e.g., USA, UK) and normed in more homogeneous groups. We examine total scores and rates of deficits on tests of visuoperceptual/visuospatial, attention, memory, and executive functions in Canadians with PD born in Anglosphere countries (n = 248) versus in Canadians with PD born in other regions (International group; n = 167). The International group shows lower scores and greater rates of deficits on all visuoperceptual and some executive function tasks, but not on attention or memory measures. These biases are not explained by demographic and clinical variables as groups were comparable. Age at immigration, years in Canada, and English proficiency also do not account for the observed biases. In contrast, group differences are strongly mediated by the Historical Index of Human Development of the participants’ country of birth, which reflects economic, health, and educational potential of a country at the time of birth. In sum, our findings demonstrate lasting biases on neuropsychological tests despite significant exposure to, and participation in, Canadian culture. These biases are most striking on visuoperceptual measures and non-verbal executive tasks which many clinicians still considered to be “culture-fair” despite the growing evidence from the field of cross-cultural neuropsychology to the contrary. Our findings also illustrate that socio-development context captures important aspects of culture that relate to cognition, and have important implications for clinical practice.</content>

 Transcranial direct current stimulation is a promising neuromodulation method for treating depression. However, compared with pharmacological treatment, previous studies have reported that a relatively limited proportion of patients respond to tDCS treatment. In addition, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tDCS treatment remain unclear, making it difficult to identify response predictors for tDCS treatment based on neurophysiological function. Because treatment effects are achieved by repetitive application of tDCS, studying the immediate effects of tDCS in depressive patients could extend understanding of its treatment mechanisms. However, immediate changes in a single session of tDCS are not well documented. Thus, in the current study, we focused on the immediate impact of tDCS and its association with pre-stimulus brain activity. 
To address this question, we applied anodal tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in 14 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 20 healthy controls, at an intensity of 1.5 mA for 20 minutes in a single session. To evaluate anxiety, the state trait anxiety inventory was completed before and after tDCS. We recorded resting electroencephalography before tDCS, and calculated electrical neuronal activity in the theta and alpha frequency bands using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. 
We found that, during application of left DLPFC tDCS to patients with MDD, the anxiety reduction effect of tDCS was related to higher baseline theta-band activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. For DMPFC stimulation in MDD, the anxiety reduction effect was associated with lower baseline alpha-band activity in the left inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, the anxiety reduction effect was associated with greater alpha activity in the left inferior parietal lobule during left DLPFC stimulation in healthy controls, whereas it was associated with lower baseline alpha activity in the precuneus during DMPFC stimulation.
The current results suggest that the association between pre-tDCS brain activity and the anxiety reduction effect of tDCS depends on psychopathology (depressed or non-depressed) as well as the site of stimulation (DMPFC or left DLPFC). Furthermore, the results suggest that tDCS response might be predicted by baseline resting state electrophysiological neural activity.</content>

 Abstract
Background/Aim: 
Using a within-subjects, within-wound care design, this pilot study tested for the first time, the whether immersive virtual reality (VR) can serve as an adjunctive non-opioid analgesic for children with large severe burn wounds during burn wound cleaning in the ICU, in a regional burn center in the United States. 

Methods: Participants included 48 children from 6 years old to 17 years of age with &amp;gt; 10% TBSA burn injuries reporting moderate or higher worst pain during no VR on Day 1. Forty-four of the 48 children were from developing Latin American countries. Patients played adjunctive SnowWorld, an interactive 3D snowy canyon in virtual reality during some portions of wound care, vs. No VR during comparable portions of the same wound care session (initial treatment condition randomized). Using Graphic Rating scales, children's worst pain ratings during “No VR” (treatment as usual pain medications) vs. their worst pain during “Yes VR” was measured during at least one day of wound care, and was measured for up to ten study days the patient used VR.  

Results: VR significantly reduced children’s “worst pain” ratings during burn wound cleaning procedures in the ICU on Day 1. Worst pain during No VR = 8.52 (SD = 1.75) vs. during Yes VR = 5.10 (SD = 3.27), t(47) = 7.11, p &amp;lt; .001, SD = 3.33, CI = 2.45 to 4.38, Cohen’s d = 1.21 (indicating large effect size). Patients continued to report the predicted pattern of lower pain and more fun during VR, during multiple sessions.
 
Conclusion:Immersive virtual reality can help reduce the pain of children with large severe burn wounds during burn wound cleaning in the Intensive Care Unit. . Additional research and development is recommended.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Viral vectors are attractive tools to express genes in neurons. Transduction of neurons with a recombinant, replication-deficient Sindbis viral vector is a method of choice for studying the effects of short-term protein overexpression on neuronal function. However, to which extent Sindbis by itself may affect neurons is not fully understood. We assessed effects of neuronal transduction with a Sindbis viral vector on the transcriptome and proteome in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, and analyzed the electrophysiological properties of individual CA1 neurons, at 24h and 72h after viral vector injection. Whereas Sindbis caused substantial gene expression alterations, changes at the protein level were less pronounced. Alterations in transcriptome and proteome were predominantly limited to proteins involved in mediating anti-viral innate immune responses. Sindbis transduction did not affect the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of individual neurons: the membrane potential and neuronal excitability were similar between transduced and non-transduced CA1 neurons up to 72h after Sindbis injection. Synaptic currents also remained unchanged upon Sindbis transduction, unless slices were massively infected for 72h. We conclude that Sindbis viral vectors at low transduction rates are suitable for studying short-term effects of a protein of interest on electrophysiological properties of neurons, but not for studies on the regulation of gene expression.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The neuroinflammatory response to Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is critical to both neurotoxicity and neuroprotection and has been proposed as a potentially modifiable driver of secondary injury in animal and human studies. Attempts to broadly target immune activation have been unsuccessful in improving outcomes, in part because the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms driving injury and outcome at acute, subacute and chronic time points after TBI remain poorly defined.  Microglia play a critical role in neuroinflammation and their persistent activation may contribute to long-term functional deficits. Activated microglia are characterized by morphological transformation and transcriptomic changes associated with specific inflammatory states. We analyzed the temporal course of changes in inflammatory genes of microglia isolated from injured brains at 2, 14 and 60 days after controlled cortical impact in mice, a well-established model of focal cerebral contusion. We identified a time dependent, injury-associated change in the microglial gene expression profile toward a reduced ability to sense tissue damage, perform housekeeping, and maintain homeostasis in the early stages following injury, with recovery and transition to a specialized inflammatory state over time. This later state starts at 14 days post injury and is characterized by a biphasic pattern of IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-10 gene expression changes, with concurrent proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene changes. Our transcriptomic data sets are an important step to understand microglial role in TBI pathogenesis at the molecular level and identify common pathways that affect outcome. More studies to evaluate gene expression at the single cell level and focusing on subacute and chronic timepoint are warranted.</content>

 A better and non-invasive characterization of the preclinical phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is important to advance its diagnosis and obtain more effective benefits from potential treatments. The TgF344-AD rat model has been well characterized and shows molecular, behavioral and brain connectivity alterations that resemble the silent period of the pathology. Our aim was to longitudinally investigate functional brain connectivity in established resting-state networks (RSNs) obtained by independent component analysis (ICA) in a cohort of TgF344-AD and control rats every 3 months, from 5 to 18 months of age, to cover different stages of the disease. Before each acquisition, working memory performance was evaluated by the delayed non match-to-sample (DNMS) task.

Differences in the temporal evolution were observed between groups in the amplitude and shape of the somatosensorial and sensorimotor networks but not in the whole default mode network (DMN). Subsequent high dimensional ICA analysis showed early alterations in the anterior DMN subnetwork activity of TgF344-AD rats compared to controls. Performance of DNMS task was positively correlated with somatosensorial network at 5 months of age in the wild-type animals but not in the Tg-F344 rats. At different time points, DMN showed negative correlation with cognitive performance in the control group while in the transgenic group the correlation was positive. In addition, behavioral differences observed at 5 months of age correlated with alterations in the posterior DMN subnetwork.

We have demonstrated that functional connectivity using ICA represents a useful biomarker also in animal models of AD such as the TgF344AD rats, as it allows the identification of alterations associated with the progression of the disease, detecting differences in specific networks even at very early stages.</content>

 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between the cognitive changes in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which induces abnormalities in specific brain regions. Previous studies showed that paired helical filaments Tau (PHF-Tau) protein is a potential pathogenic protein which may cause abnormal brain function and structure in MCI and AD patients. However, the understanding of the PHF-Tau protein network in MCI patients is limited. In this study, 225 subjects with PHF-Tau PET images were divided into four groups based on whether they carried Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE 4) or abnormal cerebrospinal fluid Total-Tau (CSF T-Tau). They are two important pathogenic factors that might cause cognitive function impairment. The four groups were: individuals harboring CSF T-Tau pathology but no APOE 4 (APOE 4-T+); APOE 4 carriers with normal CSF T-Tau (APOE 4+T-); APOE 4 carriers with abnormal CSF T-Tau (APOE 4+T+); and APOE 4 noncarriers with abnormal CSF T-Tau (APOE 4-T-). We explored the topological organization of PHF-Tau networks in these four groups and calculated five kinds of network properties: clustering coefficient, shortest path length, Q value of modularity, nodal centrality and degree. Our findings showed that compared with APOE 4-T-group, the other three groups showed different alterations in the clustering coefficient, shortest path length, Q value of modularity, nodal centrality and degree. Simultaneously, voxel level analysis was conducted and the results showed that compared with APOE 4-T- group, the other three groups were found increased PHF-Tau distribution in some brain regions. For APOE 4+T+ group, positive correlation was found between the value of PHF-Tau distribution in altered regions and Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) score. Our results indicated that the effects of APOE 4 and abnormal CSF T-Tau may induce abnormalities of PHF-Tau protein and APOE 4 has a greater impact on PHF-Tau than abnormal CSF T-Tau. Our results may be particularly helpful in uncovering the pathophysiology underlying the cognitive dysfunction in MCI patients.</content>

 BACKGROUND: Aging population undergoing surgery are at risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Exploring effective and reliable early predictor of POCD is essential to identify high-risk patients and make prospective decisions. The purpose of this study was to examine whether preoperative insulin resistance, is an independent predictor of POCD.
METHODS: A total of 124 aged 60 years older patients for gastrointestinal surgery were enrolled in a prospective observational clinical study. All participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests before surgery and at 7 days afterwards. POCD was defined as a decline of at least 1.5 SD on two or more of neuropsychological tests. Plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), and S-100β protein were measured. The status of insulin resistance was assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment–Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). The relationship between HOMA-IR and POCD was assessed by Multivariable logistic regression models and the receiver operating characteristic curve.

RESULTS: 51 patients (41.1%) were diagnosed with POCD at 7 days after surgery. Preoperative HOMA-IR values of the POCD group were significantly higher than the non-POCD group, besides, CRP and TNF-α levels of the POCD group were significantly higher at each postoperative time point (P&amp;lt;0.05). Preoperative HOMA-IR value was an independent predictor of POCD (adjusted OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.18-2.99) even after adjust for confounding variables, and when dichotomized, individuals above the HOMA-IR threshold (HOMA-IR &amp;gt;2.6) had a three time’s higher risk of POCD (OR 3.26; 95% CI 1.07–9.91) compared individuals below the threshold. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of HOMA-IR was 0.804 (95% CI, 0.725–0.883; P &amp;lt;0 .001).The optimal cutoff value was found to be 0.583, with sensitivity of 84.3% and specificity of 74%. HOMA-IR value was positively associated with TNF-α concentration at baseline (R2= 0.43, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and 1 days after surgery (R2= 0.3861, P &amp;lt; 0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative insulin resistance is an effective predictor for the occurrence of POCD. Targeted prevention and treatment strategies of insulin resistance may be effective interventions of patients at risk for POCD.</content>

 Soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers have been shown to induce oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits which have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Administration of γ-glutamylcysteine (GGC), a precursor to glutathione (GSH) can replenish depleted GSH levels, by circumventing the regulation of GSH biosynthesis and providing the limiting substrate. In this study, we examined the effect of exogenous Aβ40 oligomers on biomarkers of apoptosis and cell death, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, in primary adult human astrocytes. Treatment with Aβ40 oligomers significantly reduced the cell viability and apoptosis of astrocyte brain cultures and decreased oxidative modifications of DNA, lipids, and protein after 24 hours. Co-treatment with GGC at 200µM also attenuated increased the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and led to significant increases in the levels of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and GSH and reduced the GSSG/GSH ratio. GGC also upregulated the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and reduced the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in Oligomeric Aβ40-treated astrocytes. Our data provides renewed insight on the beneficial effects of increased GSH levels by GGC in human astrocytes, and identifies yet another potential therapeutic strategy to attenuate the cytotoxic effects of Aβ oligomers in AD.</content>

Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in combination with metabolic labeling has become the &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; standard approach to study alterations in RNA transcription, processing or decay. Regardless of advances in the experimental protocols and techniques, every experimentalist needs to specify the key aspects of experimental design: For example, which protocol should be used (biochemical separation vs. nucleotide conversion) and what is the optimal labeling time? In this work, we provide approximate answers to these questions using the asymptotic theory of optimal design. Specifically, we investigate, how the variance of degradation rate estimates depends on the time and derive the optimal time for any given degradation rate. Subsequently, we show that an increase in sample numbers should be preferred over an increase in sequencing depth. Lastly, we provide some guidance on use cases when laborious biochemical separation outcompetes recent nucleotide conversion based methods (such as SLAMseq) and show, how inefficient conversion influences the precision of estimates.

Although Polycomb group proteins (PcG) are key factors for both temporary and persistent repression of the developmental genes, how the same group of proteins can differentially repress target genes remains unclarified. The identification of a variety of PcG complexes and activities sheds light on these issues. In this review, based on the recent findings including those with the use of interactome and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)-type analyses, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of PcG-mediated gene regulation and discuss how PcG regulates cell fate specification during neural development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) is a PI3K-like kinase best known for its role in the DNA damage response (DDR), especially after double-strand breaks. Mutations in the ATM gene result in a condition known as ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) that is characterized by cancer predisposition, radiosensitivity, neurodegeneration, sterility, and acquired immune deficiency. We show here that the innate immune system is not spared in A-T. ATM-deficient microglia adopt an active phenotype that includes the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines that are toxic to cultured neurons and likely contribute to A-T neurodegeneration. Causatively, ATM dysfunction results in the accumulation of DNA in the cytoplasm of microglia as well as a variety of other cell types. In microglia, cytoplasmic DNA primes an antiviral response via the DNA sensor, STING (stimulator of interferon genes). The importance of this response pathway is supported by our finding that inhibition of STING blocks the overproduction of neurotoxic cytokines. Cytosolic DNA also activates the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) containing inflammasome and induces proteolytic processing of cytokine precursors such as pro-IL-1β. Our study furthers our understanding of neurodegeneration in A-T and highlights the role of cytosolic DNA in the innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Conventionally, the immune deficiencies found in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients are viewed as defects of the B and T cells of the acquired immune system. In this study, we demonstrate the microglia of the innate immune system are also affected and uncover the mechanism by which this occurs. Loss of ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) activity leads to a slowing of DNA repair and an accumulation of cytoplasmic fragments of genomic DNA. This ectopic DNA induces the antivirus response, which triggers the production of neurotoxic cytokines. This expands our understanding of the neurodegeneration found in A-T and offers potentially new therapeutic options.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The glymphatic system is a brainwide CSF transport system that uses the perivascular space for fast inflow of CSF. Arterial pulsations are a major driver of glymphatic CSF inflow, and hypertension that causes vascular pathologies, such as arterial stiffening and perivascular alterations, may impede the inflow. We used dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to assess the effect of hypertension on glymphatic transport kinetics in male young and adult spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats compared with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). We anesthetized the rats with dexmedetomidine/isoflurane and infused paramagnetic contrast (Gd-DOTA) into the cisterna magna during dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantify glymphatic transport kinetics. Structural MRI analysis showed that cerebroventricular volumes are larger and brain volumes significantly smaller in SHR compared with WKY rats, regardless of age. We observed ventricular reflux of Gd-DOTA in SHR rats only, indicating abnormal CSF flow dynamics secondary to innate hydrocephalus. One-tissue compartment analysis revealed impeded glymphatic transport of Gd-DOTA in SHR compared with WKY rats in both age groups, implying that glymphatic transport, including solute clearance from brain parenchyma, is impaired during evolving hypertension in young SHR, an effect that worsens in states of chronic hypertension. The study demonstrates the suppression of glymphatic clearance in SHR rats and thus offers new insight into the coexistence of hypertension and concomitant vascular pathologies in Alzheimer's disease. The study further highlights the importance of considering the distribution of tracers in the CSF compartment in the analysis of the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The glymphatic system contributes to the removal of amyloid β from the brain and is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease and aging. Using a rat model of hypertension, we measured gross CSF flow and tracked glymphatic influx and efflux rates with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, showing that glymphatic transport is compromised in both early and advanced stages of hypertension. The study provides a new perspective on the importance for brain metabolite and fluid homeostasis of maintaining healthy blood vessels, an increasingly pertinent issue in an aging population that in part may explain the link between vascular pathology and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Many people drink to alleviate negative affect, reflecting an avoidance strategy which can lead to alcohol misuse. Individuals with heightened sensitivity to punishment (SP) are especially susceptible to problem drinking via this maladaptive coping mechanism. As imaging studies have largely focused on sensation-seeking traits and approach behavior, the neural substrates underlying behavioral avoidance as well as their relationship with punishment sensitivity and alcohol use remain unclear. Here, we examined in humans the cerebral correlates of response inhibition to avoid a penalty in relation to both problem drinking and SP, as evaluated by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, respectively. Seventy nondependent female and male drinkers performed a reward go/no-go task with approximately two-thirds go and one-third no-go trials. Correct go and no-go responses were rewarded, and incorrect responses were punished. The results showed that SP and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test scores were both positively correlated with brain activations during response inhibition, and these activations overlapped in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Thus, the PCC may represent a shared neural substrate for avoidance, punishment sensitivity, and problem drinking. Mediation analyses further suggested that PCC response to avoidance completely and bidirectionally mediated the relationship between SP and hazardous alcohol use. These findings substantiated the role of the PCC in behavioral avoidance and its link to problem drinking in punishment-sensitive nondependent drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many people drink to alleviate negative affect, reflecting an avoidance strategy that can lead to alcohol misuse. Individuals with heightened punishment sensitivity (SP) trait are particularly vulnerable to this maladaptive coping mechanism. The current study examined the neural substrates underlying behavioral avoidance and their relationship with SP and problem drinking. Using a reward go/no-go task, we showed both SP and drinking severity were positively correlated with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activation during action inhibition. Thus, the PCC may represent a shared neural substrate for avoidance behavior, punishment sensitivity, and problem drinking. Further, PCC response to avoidance mediated the relationship between SP and alcohol use. These findings substantiated the neural processes linking avoidance tendency to alcohol misuse in punishment-sensitive drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Glutamatergic transmission in the brain typically occurs at well-defined synaptic connections, but increasing evidence indicates that neural excitation can also occur through activation of &quot;extrasynaptic&quot; glutamate receptors. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms and functional properties of extrasynaptic signals that are part of a feedforward path of information flow in the olfactory bulb. This pathway involves glutamatergic interneurons, external tufted cells (eTCs), that are excited by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and in turn excite output mitral cells (MCs) extrasynaptically. Using pair-cell and triple-cell recordings in rat bulb slices (of either sex), combined with ultrastructural approaches, we first present evidence that eTC-to-MC signaling results from &quot;spillover&quot; of glutamate released at eTC synapses onto GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells in glomeruli. Thus, feedforward excitation is an indirect result of and must cooccur with activation of inhibitory circuitry. Next, to examine the dynamics of the competing signals, we assayed the relationship between the number of spikes in eTCs and excitation of MCs or PG cells in pair-cell recordings. This showed that extrasynaptic excitation in MCs is very weak due to single spikes but rises sharply and supralinearly with increasing spikes, differing from sublinear behavior for synaptic excitation of PG cells. Similar dynamics leading to a preference for extrasynaptic excitation were also observed during recordings of extrasynaptic and inhibitory currents in response to OSN input of increasing magnitude. The observed alterations in the balance between extrasynaptic excitation and inhibition in glomeruli with stimulus strength could underlie an intraglomerular mechanism for olfactory contrast enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS). GABAARs belong to the Cys-loop superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC) and are assembled from 19 different subunits. As dysfunctional GABAergic neurotransmission manifests itself in neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy and anxiety, GABAARs are key drug targets. The majority of synaptic GABA(A)Rs are anchored at the inhibitory postsynaptic membrane by the principal scaffolding protein gephyrin, which acts as the central organizer in maintaining the architecture of the inhibitory postsynaptic density (iPSD). This interaction is mediated by the long intracellular loop located in between transmembrane helices 3 and 4 (M3-M4 loop) of the receptors and the universal receptor-binding pocket residing in the C-terminal domain of gephyrin. In 2014, the crystal structure of the beta3-homopentameric GABA(A)R provided crucial information regarding the architecture of the receptor; however, a clear understanding of the structure and assembly of heteropentameric receptors, as well as the mechanism of action of these receptors, remained enigmatic. This review will highlight recent advances in understanding the structure of heteropentameric synaptic GABA(A)Rs and how these structures have provided fundamental insights into the assembly of these multi-subunit receptors as well as their modulation by diverse ligands including the physiological agonist GABA. We will further discuss the role of gephyrin in anchoring of synaptic GABAARs and also glycine receptors, thus maintaining the architecture of the iPSD. Finally, we will also summarize how anti-malarial artemisinin drugs modulate gephyrin-specific inhibitory neurotransmission.</content>

 Extracellular adenine nucleotides play important roles in cell-cell communication and tissue homeostasis. High concentrations of extracellular ATP released by dying cells are sensed as a danger signal by the P2X7 receptor, a non-specific cation channel. Studies in P2X7 knockout mice and numerous disease models have demonstrated an important role of this receptor in inflammatory processes. P2X7 activation has been shown to induce a variety of cellular responses that are not usually associated with ion channel function, for example changes in the plasma membrane composition and morphology, ectodomain shedding, activation of lipases, kinases, and transcription factors, as well as cytokine release and apoptosis. In contrast to all other P2X family members, the P2X7 receptor contains a long intracellular C-terminus that constitutes 40% of the whole protein and is considered essential for most of these effects. So far, over 50 different proteins have been identified to physically interact with the P2X7 receptor. However, few of these interactions have been confirmed in independent studies and for the majority of these proteins, the interaction domains and the physiological consequences of the interactions are only poorly described. Also, while the structure of the P2X7 extracellular domain has recently been resolved, information about the organisation and structure of its C-terminal tail remains elusive. After shortly describing the structure and assembly of the P2X7 receptor, this review gives an update of the identified or proposed interaction domains within the P2X7 C-terminus, describes signalling pathways in which this receptor has been involved, and provides an overlook of the identified interaction partners.</content>

 The high mortality and morbidity rate of stroke has been a chronic problem plaguing human society. The activation of microglia is one of the principal reasons why neuroinflammation induces cerebral dysfunction. Because of their vital functions in the regulation of neuroinflammation, microglia constitute an important target for stroke. Given that there is an innate self-preservation mechanism between neurons and microglia, the transmembrane glycoproteins on the surface of their membranes, namely CD200 and CD200R, have become a popular topic of research. Numerous studies have demonstrated that CD200-CD200R interaction, microglial activation, and poststroke neuroinflammatory damage are inextricably linked. In this review, we describe the above relationship from a new perspective. Specifically, we will focus on neuroinflammation after stroke. The role of crosstalk of CD200-CD200R inhibitory immune ligand receptors in immune regulation will also be illustrated.  Thus, we will see how poststroke injury can be influenced by the CD200-CD200R crosstalk. Finally, we will discuss the possibility of clinical application of the result of CD200-CD200R interaction to manage the neuroinflammatory injury after stroke.</content>

 The interaction between the gut microbiota and alpha-synuclein (Syn) aggregation in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is receiving increasing attention. The objective of this study was to investigate gut microbiota, and effects of an inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) trigger in a human Syn over-expressing mouse model of PD (Thy1-αSyn). Stool samples from patients with confirmed PD and Thy1-Syn mice were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing.  Compared to healthy controls, the relative abundance of mucin-degrading Verrucomicrobiae and LPS-producing Gammaproteobacteria were greater in PD patients. In mice, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was negligible in both Thy1-αSyn and wild-type (WT) animals, while Verrucomicrobiae were reduced in Thy1-αSyn mice. The effect of LPS on intestinal barrier function was investigated in vitro using intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells, and in vivo via administration of LPS in drinking water to Thy1-Syn mice. Acute exposure to LPS in vitro resulted in a reduction and altered distribution of the tight junction markers ZO-1 and e-Cadherin around the cell membrane in IEC-6 cells, as shown by immunohistochemistry. LPS administration in Thy1-Syn mice resulted in the emergence of early motor manifestations at 10 weeks, compared to untreated mice who were still asymptomatic at this age. This study reaffirms that an altered microbiome exists in patients with PD, and supports the notion of  a proinflammatory gut microbiome environment as a trigger for PD pathogenesis.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00822"/>

		<content type="html">
 In recent years, electroencephalography (EEG) measured around the ears, called ear-EEG, has been introduced to develop unobtrusive and ambulatory EEG-based applications. When measuring ear-EEGs, the availability of a reference site is restricted due to the miniaturized device structure, and therefore a reference electrode is generally placed near the recording electrodes. As the electrical brain activity recorded at a reference electrode closely placed to recording electrodes may significantly cancel or influence the brain activity recorded by the recording electrodes, an appropriate re-referencing method is often required to mitigate the impact of the reference brain activity. In this study, therefore, we systematically investigated the impact of different re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs spontaneously generated from endogenous paradigms. To this end, we used two ear-EEG datasets recorded behind both ears while subjects performed an alpha modulation task (eyes-closed and eyes-open) and two mental tasks (mental arithmetic and mental singing). The measured ear-EEGs were independently re-referenced using five different methods: i) all-mean, ii) contralateral-mean, iii) ipsilateral-mean, iv) contralateral-bipolar, and v) ipsilateral-bipolar. We investigated the changes in alpha power during eyes-open and eyes-closed tasks, as well as event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) during mental arithmetic and mental singing. To evaluate the effects of re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs, we also estimated the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the two ear-EEG datasets, as well as assessed the classification performance of the two mental tasks (mental arithmetic vs. mental singing). Overall patterns of changes in alpha power and ERD/ERS were similar among the five re-referencing methods, but the contralateral-mean method showed statistically higher SNRs than did the other methods for both ear-EEG datasets, except in the contralateral-bipolar method for the two mental tasks. In concordance with the SNR results, classification performance was also statistically higher for the contralateral-mean method than it was for the other re-referencing methods. The results suggest that employing contralateral mean information can be an efficient way to re-reference spontaneously generated ear-EEGs, thereby maximizing the reliability of ear-EEG-based applications in endogenous paradigms.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00783"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00783</id>

		<content type="html">
 Background
While alternating current stimulation (ACS) is gaining relevance as a tool in research and approaching clinical applications, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. A review by Schutter and colleagues argues for a retinal origin of transcranial ACS’ neuromodulatory effects. Interestingly, there is an alternative application form of ACS specifically targeting α-oscillations in the visual cortex via periorbital electrodes (retinofugal alternating current stimulation, rACS). To further compare these two methods and investigate retinal effects of ACS, we first aim to establish the safety and tolerability of rACS. 

Objective
The goal of our research was to evaluate the safety of retinofugal alternating current stimulation (rACS) via finite-element modeling, theoretical safety limits and subjective report.

Methods
20 healthy subjects were stimulated with rACS as well as photic stimulation and reported adverse events following stimulation. We analyzed stimulation parameters at electrode level as well as distributed metric estimates from an ultra-high spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived finite element human head model and compared them to existing safety limits.

Results
Topographical modeling revealed the highest current densities in the anterior visual pathway, particularly retina and optic nerve. Stimulation parameters and finite element modeling estimates of rACS were found to be well below existing safety limits. No serious adverse events occurred. 
 
Conclusion
Our findings are in line with existing safety guidelines for retinal and neural damage and establish the tolerability and feasibility of rACS. In comparison to tACS, retinofugal stimulation of the visual cortex provides an anatomically circumscribed model to systematically study the mechanisms of action of ACS.</content>

 Background: Tumor necrosis factor, which exists both as a soluble (solTNF) and a transmembrane (tmTNF) protein, plays an important role in post-stroke inflammation. The objective of the present study was to test the effect of topical versus intracerebroventricular administration of XPro1595 (a solTNF inhibitor) and etanercept (a solTNF and tmTNF inhibitor) compared to saline on output measures such as infarct volume and post-stroke inflammation in mice.
Methods: Adult male C57BL/6 mice were treated topically (2.5 mg/ml/1µl/hr for 3 consecutive days) or intracerebroventricularly (1.25 mg/kg/0.5 ml, once) with saline, XPro1595, or etanercept immediately after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Mice were allowed to survive 1 or 3 days. Infarct volume, microglial and leukocyte profiles, and inflammatory markers were evaluated.
Results: We found that topical, and not intracerebroventricular, administration of XPro1595 reduced infarct volume at both 1 day and 3 days after pMCAO. Etanercept showed no effect. We observed no changes in microglial or leukocyte populations. XPro1595 increased gene expression of P2ry12 at 1 day and Trem2 at 1 and 3 days, while decreasing Cx3cr1 expression at 1 and 3 days after pMCAO, suggesting a change in microglial activation towards a phagocytic phenotype.
Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that topical administration of XPro1595 for three consecutive days decreases infarct volumes after ischemic stroke, while modifying microglial activation and the inflammatory response post-stroke. This suggests that inhibitors of solTNF hold great promise for future neuroprotective treatment in ischemic stroke.</content>

 Despite extensive neuroimaging research of primary sensory cortices involved in auditory and visual functions, subcortical structures within these domains, such as the inferior and superior colliculi, the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei and the superior olivary complex, are currently understudied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in living humans. This is because a precise localization of these nuclei is hampered by the limited contrast and sensitivity of conventional neuroimaging methods for deep brain nuclei. In this work, we used 7 Tesla multi-modality (T2-weighted and diffusion fractional anisotropy) 1.1mm isotropic resolution MRI to achieve high sensitivity and contrast for single-subject brainstem and thalamic nuclei delineation. After precise coregistration to stereotactic space, we generated an in vivo human probabilistic atlas of auditory (medial geniculate nucleus, inferior colliculus, and superior olivary complex) and visual (lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus) subcortical nuclei. We foresee the use of this atlas as a tool to precisely identify the location and shape of auditory/visual deep nuclei in research as well as clinical studies.</content>

 Decades of research on neuromotor circuits and systems has provided valuable information on neuronal control of movement.  Computational models of several elements of the neuromotor system have been developed at various scales, from  sub-cellular to system.   While several small models abound, their structured integration is the key to building larger and more biologically realistic models which can predict the behavior of the system in different scenarios.  This effort calls for integration of elements across neuroscience and musculoskeletal biomechanics. There is also a need for development of methods and tools for structured integration that yield larger \textit{in silico} models demonstrating a set of desired system responses.  
We take a small step in this direction with the NEUROmotor integration and Design (NEUROiD) platform.  NEUROiD helps integrate results from motor systems anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics into an integrated neuromotor system model.  Simulation and visualization of the model across multiple scales is supported.  Standard electrophysiological operations such as slicing, current injection, recording of membrane potential and local field potential are part of NEUROiD. The platform allows traceability of model parameters to primary literature.  We illustrate the power and utility of NEUROiD by building a simple ankle model and its controlling neural circuitry by curating a set of published components. NEUROiD allows researchers to utilize remote high-performance computers for simulation, while controlling the model using a web browser.</content>

 Memory research remains focused on just a few brain structures – in particular, the hippocampal formation (the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex). Three key discoveries promote this continued focus:  the striking demonstrations of enduring anterograde amnesia after bilateral hippocampal damage; the realisation that synapses in the hippocampal formation are plastic e.g., when responding to short bursts of patterned stimulation (‘long-term potentiation’ or LTP); and the discovery of a panoply of spatially-tuned cells, principally surveyed in the hippocampal formation (place cells coding for position; head-direction cells, providing compass-like information; and grid cells, providing a metric for 3D space). Recent anatomical, behavioural, and electrophysiological work extends this picture to a growing network of subcortical brain structures, including the anterior thalamic nuclei, rostral midline thalamic nuclei, and the claustrum. There are, for example, spatially-tuned cells in all of these regions, including cells with properties similar to place cells of the hippocampus proper. These findings add new perspectives to what had been originally been proposed - but often overlooked - half a century ago: that damage to an extended network of structures connected to the hippocampal formation results in diencephalic amnesia. We suggest these new findings extend spatial signalling in the brain far beyond the hippocampal formation, with profound implications for theories of the neural bases of spatial and mnemonic functions.</content>

 Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a key molecule involved in plastic changes related to learning and memory. The expression of BDNF is highly regulated, and can lead to great variability in BDNF levels in healthy subjects. Changes in BDNF expression are associated with both normal and pathological aging and also psychiatric disease, in particular in structures important for memory processes such as the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas. Some interventions like exercise or antidepressant administration enhance the expression of BDNF in normal and pathological conditions. In this review, we will describe studies from rodents and humans to bring together research on how BDNF expression is regulated, how this expression changes in the pathological brain and also exciting work on how interventions known to enhance this neurotrophin could have clinical relevance. We propose that, although BDNF may not be a valid biomarker for neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric diseases because of its disregulation common to many pathological conditions, it could be thought of as a marker that specifically relates to the occurrence and/or progression of the mnemonic symptoms that are common to many pathological conditions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) represents a group of inherited retinopathies with early-onset nyctalopia followed by progressive photoreceptor degeneration causing irreversible vision loss. Mutations in USH2A are the most common cause of nonsyndromic RP. Here, we reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a RP patient with a mutation in USH2A (c.8559-2A&amp;gt;G/c.9127_9129delTCC). Then, multilayer retinal organoids including neural retina (NR) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were generated by three-step “induction-reversal culture”. The early retinal organoids derived from the RP patient with the USH2A mutation exhibited significant defects in terms of morphology, immunofluorescence staining and transcriptional profiling. To the best of our knowledge, the pathogenic mutation (c.9127_9129delTCC) in USH2A has not been reported previously among RP patients. Notably, the expression of laminin in the USH2A mutation organoids was significantly lower than in the iPSCs derived from healthy, age- and sex-matched controls during the retinal organogenesis. We also observed that abnormal retinal neuroepithelium differentiation and polarization caused defective retinal progenitor cell development and retinal layer formation, disordered organization of neural retinas in the presence of the USH2A mutation. Furthermore, the USH2A mutation bearing RPE cells presented abnormal morphology, lacking pigmented foci and showing an apoptotic trend and reduced expression of specific makers, such as MITF, PEDF and RPE65. In addition, the USH2A mutation organoids had lower expression of cilium-associated (especially CFAP43, PIFO) and dopaminergic synapse-related genes (including DLGAP1, GRIK1, SLC17A7 and SLC17A8), while there was higher expression of neuron apoptotic process-related genes (especially HIF1A, ADARB1 and CASP3). This study may provide essential assistance in the molecular diagnosis and screening of RP. This work recapitulates the pathogenesis of USH2A using patient-specific organoids and demonstrated that alterations in USH2A function due to mutations may lead to cellular and molecular abnormalities.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a novel gaseous mediator, has been recognized as an important neuromodulator and neuroprotective agent in the central nervous system. The present study was undertaken to study the effects of exogenous H2S on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and the underlying mechanisms. The effects of exogenous H2S on ICH were examined by using measurement of brain edema, behavior assessment, injury volume, propidium iodide (PI) staining, and Western blotting, respectively. ICH induced significant downregulation of endogenous H2S production in the brain, which may be the result of decreasing in CBS, the predominant cerebral H2S-generating enzyme. Administration of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a classical exogenous H2S donor, not only restored brain CBS expression and H2S content but also attenuated brain edema, improved motor performance and ameliorated performance in Morris water maze test after ICH. Immunoblotting results showed that H2S pretreatment reversed ICH-induced cleavage of caspase-3 and decline of Bcl-2, suppressed LC3-II and Beclin-1 activation and maintained p62 level in injured striatum post ICH. However, H2S could not restore brain CBS expression and H2S content, reduce brain edema and improve motor performance and memory function after ICH through modulating autophagy and apoptosis when pretreated with the CBS inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). We also found that AOAA reduced the endogenous H2S production through inhibiting the enzyme activity of CBS rather than modulating the expression of CBS protein level. These results suggest a protective effect and therapeutic potential of H2S in the treatment of brain injury after ICH and the protective effect of exogenous H2S against ICH may be not a direct action but an indirect effect through inducing endogenous H2S metabolism responses.</content>

 Although the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease are diverse and unclear, the past 20 years have witnessed the unprecedented development of the AD inflammation theory. As a key inflammatory receptor family, the C-C chemokine receptor family is a remarkable participant in the cause of Alzheimer's disease; of this family, CCR5 is the most widely studied. CCR5 is an essential entrance when HIV infects immune cells and is also involved in other inflammatory and immune activities. New evidence on the inevitably intertwined link between Alzheimer's disease and CCR5 indicates that CCR5 accelerates the development of Alzheimer's disease, and few studies disputed it. The role of CCR5 in Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. However, as the research progresses, this intricate relationship will gradually be uncovered.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Microtubules (MTs) play a fundamental role in many vital processes such as cell division and neuronal activity. They are key structural and functional elements in axons, supporting neurite differentiation and growth, as well as transport along the axons by the motor proteins, which use MTs as support tracks. Tau is a stabilizing MT associated protein, whose functions are mainly regulated by phosphorylation. A disruption of the MT network, which might be caused by Tau loss of function, is observed in a group of related diseases called tauopathies, which includes Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Tau is found hyperphosphorylated in AD, which might account for its loss of MT stabilizing capacity. Since destabilization of MTs after dissociation of Tau could contribute to toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases, a molecular understanding of this interaction and its regulation, is essential.</content>

Model-based phylodynamic approaches recently employed generalized linear models (GLMs) to uncover potential predictors of viral spread. Very recently some of these models have allowed both the predictors and their coefficients to be time-dependent. However, these studies mainly focused on predictors that are assumed to be constant through time. Here we inferred the phylodynamics of avian influenza A virus H9N2 isolated in 12 Asian countries and regions under both discrete trait analysis (DTA) and structured coalescent (MASCOT) approaches. Using MASCOT we applied a new time-dependent GLM to uncover the underlying factors behind H9N2 spread. We curated a rich set of time-series predictors including annual international live poultry trade and national poultry production figures. This time-dependent phylodynamic prediction model was compared to commonly employed time-independent alternatives. Additionally the time-dependent MASCOT model allowed for the estimation of viral effective sub-population sizes and their changes through time, and these effective population dynamics within each country were predicted by a GLM. International annual poultry trade is a strongly supported predictor of virus migration rates. There was also strong support for geographic proximity as a predictor of migration rate in all GLMs investigated. In time-dependent MASCOT models, national poultry production was also identified as a predictor of virus genetic diversity through time and this signal was obvious in mainland China. Our application of a recently introduced time-dependent GLM predictors integrated rich time-series data in Bayesian phylodynamic prediction. We demonstrated the contribution of poultry trade and geographic proximity (potentially unheralded wild bird movements) to avian influenza spread in Asia. To gain a better understanding of the drivers of H9N2 spread, we suggest increased surveillance of the H9N2 virus in countries that are currently under-sampled as well as in wild bird populations in the most affected countries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WuyKSDZx6Cs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

As malignant transformation requires synchronization of growth-driving signaling (S) and metabolic (M) pathways, defining cancer-specific S-M interconnected networks (SMINs) could lead to better understanding of oncogenic processes. In a systems-biology approach, we developed a mathematical model for SMINs in mutated EGF receptor (EGFRvIII) compared to wild-type EGF receptor (EGFRwt) expressing glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Starting with experimentally validated human protein-protein interactome data for S-M pathways, and incorporating proteomic data for EGFRvIII and EGFRwt GBM cells and patient transcriptomic data, we designed a dynamic model for EGFR-driven GBM-specific information flow. Key nodes and paths identified by &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; perturbation were validated experimentally when inhibition of signaling pathway proteins altered expression of metabolic proteins as predicted by the model. This demonstrated capacity of the model to identify unknown connections between signaling and metabolic pathways, explain the robustness of oncogenic SMINs, predict drug escape, and assist identification of drug targets and the development of combination therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9vkkfNSOLvI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Pathological aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies (LB) which play a central role in pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Differential expression of α-syn isoforms has been shown in PD. Isoform α-syn98 is generated by excision of exon-3 and exon-5 of the α-syn gene. In contrast to the canonical full-length α-syn isoform (α-syn140), little is known about function of the α-syn98 isoform. In the present study, to identify the potential role of α-syn98 protein in PD, we examined effects of exogenous recombinant insoluble α-syn98 aggregates on α-syn pathology and inflammatory responses in the midbrain. After injection of α-syn98 aggregates into the substantia nigra (SN), mice exhibited motor dysfunction accompanied by nigral dopaminergic neuron loss. In addition, α-syn98 aggregates injection resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylation of endogenous α-syn. Accumulations of α-syn were co-localized with p62 and ubiquitin, which suggests α-syn98 aggregates-induced pathology exhibits properties similar to human LB. Many glial cells were activated after α-syn98 aggregates injection. In addition, expression of NF-κB, interleukin 6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and levels of oxidative stress increased after α-syn98 aggregates injection. Our results suggest that α-syn98 may play a crucial role in pathogenesis of PD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Vulvodynia is an idiopathic chronic pain disorder and a leading cause of dyspareunia, or pain associated with sexual intercourse, for women. The key pathophysiological features of vulvodynia are vaginal hyperinnervation and nociceptor sensitization. These features have been described consistently by research groups over the past 30 years, but currently there is no first-line recommended treatment that targets this pathophysiology. Instead, psychological interventions, pelvic floor physiotherapy and surgery to remove painful tissue are recommended, as these are the few interventions that have shown some benefit in clinical trials. Recurrence of vulvodynia is frequent, even after vestibulectomy and questions regarding etiology remain. Vestibular biopsies from women with vulvodynia contain increased abundance of immune cells including macrophages as well as increased numbers of nerve fibers. Macrophages have multiple roles in the induction and resolution of inflammation and their function can be broadly described as pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory depending on their polarization state. This state is not fixed and can alter rapidly in response to the microenvironment. Essentially, M1, or classically activated macrophages, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote nociceptor sensitization and mechanical allodynia, whereas M2, or alternately activated macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and promote functions such as wound healing. Signaling between macrophages and neurons has been shown to promote axonal sprouting and nociceptor sensitization. This mini review considers emerging evidence that macrophages may play a role in nociceptor sensitization and hyperinnervation relevant to vulvodynia and considers the implications for development of new therapeutic strategies.</content>

 Background: Fall risk has increased among elders and young adult sequentially prior to any cause. Occult balance disorder may become one of the morbidity cause of fall in young adult and eventually to elders. Occult balance can be predicted by one leg stance test as an evidenced test to measure static balance function which leading to dynamic balance function. Treadmill exercise has been proven as a dynamic balance exercise aside from cardiopulmonary exercise. As inclination and speed are the components of treadmill exercise, supposingly increase the balance function through the the act of brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF).  Brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) was one of tropic hormones produced in neuron, muscle, hematopoietic tissue characterized in neurons morphology regulation and neuroplasticity. Material and method: 20 healthy young adult men were included, divided to inclination and speed treadmill exercise groups. We observed the immediate effect of serum BDNF in blood as first blood drawn for BDNF taken before exercise and 30 minutes after exercise at the first training, second blood drawn taken before exercise and  30 minutes after exercise at the last training in 2nd  week completion of treadmill exercise. Result: Significant increased of serum BDNF value in speed group before exercise first day and before exercise last day (p=0,001), after exercise first day and after exercise last day (p=0,001). No significant increase of BDNF serum at speed group before exercise first day and after exercise first day (p=0,159), before exercise last day and after exercise last day (p=0,892). There were no significant increase BDNF serum at inclination group at all parameters (p&amp;gt;0,05). BDNF serum was an actual neurotropic factor affect not only neuronal system, but also molecular energy and metabolism regulation. BDNF serum production depend on the aerobic capacity, lactate production, muscle calcium uptake, and muscle fiber type used in exercise. Treadmill exercise with gradual speed increase the BDNF serum in blood stream that also reflect the BDNF percentage in brain. Conclusion: Treadmill exercise with gradual escalation of speed increase the BDNF serum</content>

 Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a clinical syndrome that encompasses all forms of cognitive deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease, from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Vascular dementia (VD),the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), accounts for approximately 20% of dementia patients.Ferroptosis is a recently defined iron-dependent form of cell death, which is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and other forms of cell death. Emerging evidence suggested that ferroptosis has significant implications in neurological diseases such as stroke, traumatic brain injury and AD.And  ferroptosis inhibition have obvious neuroprotective effect and ameliorate cognitive impairment in various animals models . Here,we summarizes the underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis, and reviews the close relationship between ferroptosis and VCI.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Patients who survive brain injuries may develop Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) such as Coma,  Vegetative State (VS) or Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Unfortunately, the rate of misdiagnosis between VS and MCS due to clinical judgment is high. Therefore, diagnostic decision support systems aiming to correct any differentiation between VS and MCS are essential for the characterization of an adequate treatment and an effective prognosis. In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in the new EEG computational techniques. We have reviewed how resting-state EEG is computationally analyzed to support differential diagnosis between VS and MCS in view of applicability of these methods in clinical practice. The studies available so far have used different techniques and analyses; it is therefore hard to draw general conclusions. Studies using a discriminant analysis with a combination of various factors and reporting a cut-off are among the most interesting ones for a future clinical application.</content>

 Within the wide range of neurodegenerative brain diseases, the differential diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) frequently poses a challenge. Often, signs and symptoms are not characteristic of the disease and may instead reflect atypical presentations. Consequently, the use of disease biomarkers is of importance to correctly identify the patients.. 
Here, we describe how neuropsychological characteristics, neuroimaging and neurochemical biomarkers and screening for causal gene mutations can be used to differentiate FTD from other neurodegenerative diseases as well as to distinguish between FTD subtypes. Summarizing current evidence, we propose a stepwise approach in the diagnostic evaluation.
Clinical consensus criteria that take into account a full neuropsychological examination have relatively good accuracy (sensitivity [se] 75-95%, specificity [sp] 82-95%) to diagnose FTD, although misdiagnosis (mostly AD) is common. Structural brain MRI (se 70-94%, sp 89-99%) and FDG PET (se 47-90%, sp 68-98%) or SPECT (se 36-100%, sp 41-100%) brain scans greatly increase diagnostic accuracy, showing greater involvement of frontal and anterior temporal lobes, with sparing of hippocampi and medial temporal lobes. If these results are inconclusive, we suggest detecting amyloid and tau cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that can indicate the presence of AD with good accuracy (se 74-100%, sp 82-97%). The use of P-tau181 and the Aβ1–42/ Aβ1–40 ratio significantly increases the accuracy of correctly identifying FTD vs AD. Alternatively, an amyloid brain PET scan can be performed to differentiate FTD from AD.   
When autosomal dominant inheritance is suspected, or in early onset dementia, mutation screening of causal genes is indicated and may also be offered to at-risk family members. We have summarized genotype-phenotype correlations for several genes that are known to cause familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which is the neuropathological substrate of FTD. The genes most commonly associated with this disease (C9orf72, MAPT, GRN, TBK1) are discussed, as well as some less frequent ones (CHMP2B, VCP). 
Several other techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, tau PET imaging and measuring serum neurofilament levels, show promise for future implementation as diagnostic biomarkers.</content>

 The neural interface is a critical factor in governing efficient and safe charge transfer between a stimulating electrode and biological tissue. The interface plays a crucial role in the efficacy of electric stimulation in chronic implants and both electromechanical properties and biological properties shape this.  In the case of cochlear implants, it has long been recognized that neurotrophins can stimulate growth of the target auditory nerve fibers into a favorable apposition with the electrode array, and recently such arrays have been re-purposed to enable electrotransfer (electroporation)-based neurotrophin gene augmentation to improve the ‘bionic ear’. For both this acute bionic array-directed electroporation and for chronic conventional cochlear implant arrays, the electric fields generated in target tissue during pulse delivery are central to efficacy, but are challenging to map. We present a computational model for predicting electric fields generated by array-driven DNA electrotransfer in the cochlea. The anatomically-realistic model geometry was reconstructed from magnetic resonance images of the guinea pig cochlea and an eight-channel electrode array embedded within this geometry. The model incorporates a description of both Faradaic and non-Faradaic mechanisms occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface with frequency dependency optimized to match experiment impedance spectrometry measurements. Our simulations predict that a tandem electrode configuration with four ganged cathodes and four ganged anodes produces three- to four-fold larger area in target tissue where the electric field is within the range for successful gene transfer compared to an alternate paired anode-cathode electrode configuration. These findings matched in vivo transfection efficacy of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter following array-driven electrotransfer of the reporter-encoding plasmid DNA. This confirms utility of the developed model as a tool to optimize the safety and efficacy of electroporation protocols for delivery of neurotrophin growth factors, with the ultimate aim of using gene augmentation approaches to improve the characteristics of the electrode-neural interfaces in chronically-implanted neurostimulation devices.</content>

 Brain injuries causing chronic sensory or motor deficit, such as stroke, are among the leading causes of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization; furthermore, they carry heavy social and economic burdens due to decreased quality of life and need of assistance. Given the limited effectiveness of rehabilitation, novel therapeutic strategies are required to enhance functional recovery. Since cell-based approaches have emerged as an intriguing and promising strategy to promote brain repair, many efforts have been made to study the functional integration of neurons  derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), or fetal neurons, after grafting into the damaged host tissue. 
PSCs hold great promises for their clinical applications, such as cellular replacement of damaged neural tissues with autologous neurons. They also offer the possibility to create in vitro models to assess the efficacy of drugs and therapies. Notwithstanding these potential applications, PSC-derived transplanted neurons have to match the precise sub-type, positional and functional identity of the lesioned neural tissue. Thus, the requirement of highly specific and efficient differentiation protocols of PSCs in neurons with appropriate neural  identity constitutes the main challenge limiting the clinical use of stem cells in the near future.
In this Review, we discuss the recent advances in the derivation of telencephalic (cortical and hippocampal) neurons from PSCs, assessing specificity and efficiency of the differentiation protocols, with particular emphasis on the genetic  and molecular characterization of PSC-derived neurons. Second, we address the remaining challenges for cellular replacement therapies in cortical brain injuries, focusing on electrophysiological properties, functional integration and therapeutic effects of the transplanted neurons.</content>

 An imbalance of iron metabolism with consecutive aggregation of α-synuclein and an axonal degeneration of neurons has been postulated as main pathological feature in the development of Parkinson's disease. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a new imaging technique, which enables to measure structural changes caused by defective iron deposition in parkinsonian brains. Due to its novelty, its potential for disease specific characterisation of motor and non-motor symptoms (characterizing the individual parkinsonian phenotype) as new imaging technique remains elusive. Functional network changes associated with these symptoms are however frequently described for both, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and resting state functional magnetic imaging (rs-fMRI). 
Here, we performed a systematic review of the current literature about QSM imaging, MEG and rs-fMRI in order to collect existing data about structural and functional changes caused by motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
Whereas all three techniques provide an affection in the motor domain, the understanding of network changes caused by non-motor symptoms is much more lacking for MEG and rs-fMRI, and do not yet really exist for QSM imaging. 
In order to better understand the influence of pathological iron distribution onto the functional outcome, whole brain QSM analyses should be integrated in functional analyses (especially for the non-motor domain), to enable a proper pathophysiological interpretation of MEG and rs-fMRI network changes in Parkinson's disease. Herewith, a better understanding of the relationship between neuropathological changes, functional network changes and clinical phenotype might become possible.</content>

 The inflammatory response plays a pivotal role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) destruction following ischemic brain injury. Enhanced leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells is an essential event in the inflammatory process. TMEM16A, a newly discovered protein regulating calcium-activated chloride channels, is widely expressed in eukaryotes. Recent studies have suggested that upregulated expression of TMEM16A is associated with the occurrence and development of many diseases. However, the role of TMEM16A in regulating BBB integrity after ischemic stroke has not been fully investigated. In this study, we found that TMEM16A is mainly expressed in brain endothelial cells and upregulated after ischemic stroke in the mouse brain. Caccinh-A01, an TMEM16A inhibitor that reduced its upregulation, attenuated brain infarct size and neurological deficits after ischemic stroke. ICAM-1 and MPO expression and BBB permeability were decreased after TMEM16A inhibitor administration. In addition, TMEM16A silencing rescued oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced transendothelial permeability in vitro accompanied by decreased ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion. Furthermore, our mechanistic study showed that TMEM16A knockdown alleviated NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation, indicating that TMEM16A knockdown downregulated OGD/R-induced ICAM-1 expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Finally, NF-κB inhibitor treatment also alleviated OGD/R-induced BBB permeability, confirming that activated NF-κB and increased ICAM-1 are essential factors involved in ischemia-induced BBB damage. Thus, our research provides a promising treatment strategy against BBB destruction after ischemic stroke, and TMEM16A may become a potential target for the treatment of ischemic stroke.</content>

 Obtaining a catalog of cell-types is a fundamental building block for understanding the brain. The ideal classification of cell-types is based on the profile of molecules expressed by a cell, in particular the profile of genes expressed. One strategy is therefore to obtain as many single-cell transcriptomes as possible and isolate clusters of neurons with similar gene expression profiles. In this study, we explored an alternative strategy. We explored whether cell-types can be algorithmically derived by combining protein tissue stains with transcript expression profiles on 3D space. We developed an algorithm that aims to distribute cell-types in the different layers of a column of cortical tissue of the developing rat constrained by the tissue- and cellular level data. We found that the spatial distribution of major inhibitory cell types can be approximated using the available data. The result is a mini atlas of inhibitory cell-types of the rat somatosensory cortex. In principle, any data that constrains what can occur in a particular part of the brain can also strongly constrain the derivation of cell-types. This draft inhibitory cell-type mapping is therefore dynamic and can iteratively converge towards the ground truth as further data is integrated. It is made available as a public resource and open for collaborative improvement. The approach developed should scale to the whole brain. 
Neurons are known to express particular combinations of molecules, which can be used as markers to classify different cell types (Rudy et al. 2011). However, we still lack actual numbers of each type of interneuron through the cortical depth. This is largely due to the time-consuming methods classically used, which rely on large-scale sampling and characterization of cellular composition. To overcome these challenges and to systematically describe cellular composition throughout the cortical depth, we apply a marker-fitting method that combines immunohistochemistry data with RNA transcript expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) profiles of individual cells to predict interneuron cell types. We show the layer-dependent distribution of major inhibitory cell types can be predicted in P14 rat somatosensory cortex, based on protein and transcriptome markers.</content>

 Homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are abundantly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS, respectively), and spinal cord. In addition, expression and functional responses have been reported in non-neuronal tissue. In the nervous system, α7 nAChR subunit expression appears early during embryonic development and is often transiently upregulated, but little is known about their prenatal expression outside of the nervous system.  For understanding potential short-term and long-term effects of gestational nicotine exposure, it is important to know the temporal and spatial expression of α7 nAChRs throughout the body. To that end, we studied the expression of α7 nAChR subunit mRNA using highly sensitive isotopic in situ hybridization in embryonic and neonatal whole-body mouse sections starting at gestational day 13.  The results revealed expression of α7 mRNA as early as embryonic day 13 in the PNS, including dorsal root ganglia, parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia, with the strongest expression in the superior cervical ganglion, and low to moderate levels were detected in brain and spinal cord, respectively, which rapidly increased in intensity with embryonic age. In addition, robust α7 mRNA expression was detected in the adrenal medulla, and low to moderate expression in selected peripheral tissues during embryonic development, potentially related to cells derived from the neural crest. Little or no mRNA expression was detected in thymus or spleen, sites of immune cell maturation. The results suggest that prenatal nicotine exposure could potentially affect cells in neuronal tissue with limited effects in non-neural tissues.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The molecular basis of Parkinson’s (PD) disease is currently unknown. There is increasing evidence that fat metabolism is at the crossroad of key molecular pathways associated with the pathophysiology of PD. Fatty acid desaturases catalyze synthesis of saturated fatty acids from monounsaturated fatty acids thereby mediating several cellular mechanisms that are associated with diseases including cancer and metabolic disorders. The role of desaturases in modulating age related neurodegenerative manifestations such as PD is poorly understood. Here we investigated the effect of silencing Δ9 desaturase enzyme encoding fat-5 and fat-7 genes which are known to reduce fat content, on α-synuclein expression, neuronal morphology and dopamine related behaviors in transgenic PD-like models of C. elegans. The silencing of the fat-5 and fat-7 genes rescued both degeneration of dopamine neurons and deficits in dopamine-dependent behaviors, including basal slowing and ethanol avoidance in worm models of PD. Similarly, silencing of these genes also decreased the formation of protein aggregates in a nematode model of PD expressing α-synuclein in the body wall muscles and rescued deficits in resistance to heat and osmotic stress. On the contrary, silencing of nhr-49 and tub-1 genes that are known to increase total fat content did not alter behavioral and pathological endpoints in the PD worm strains. Interestingly, the genetic manipulation of all four selected genes resulted in differential fat levels in the PD models without having significant effect on the lifespan, further indicating a complex fat homeostasis unique to neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Overall, we provide a comprehensive understanding of how Δ9 desaturase can alter PD-like pathology due to environmental exposures and proteotoxic stress, suggesting new avenues in deciphering the disease etiology and possible therapeutic targets.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background and Purpose: Ambulatory blood pressure variability (ABPV), ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) are closely associated with  white matter hyperintensities (WMH), few studies focused on establishing  effective models based on ABP, ABPV and IMT to predict the WMH burden, we aimed to evaluate the value of predictive model based on metrics of ABP, ABPV and IMT which were independently associated with the WMH burden.
Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 140 hypertensive inpatients for physical examinations in Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine between February, 2018 to January, 2019. The basic clinical information of all subjects were recorded and we also collected the metrics of  ABP, ABPV and IMT.  Patients with Fazekas scale grade ≥2 were classified into heavy burden of WMH group.  Then we analyzed the association between all characteristics and the WMH burden. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess whether metrics of ABP, ABPV and IMT were independently associated with WMH and we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to evaluate the value of predictive model based on metrics of ABP, ABPV and IMT. 
Results: Higher WMH grade was associated with increasing age, diabetes mellitus, higher TC, higher LDL, higher IMT, higher 24-hSBP, higher daytime SBP, higher nocturnal SBP, 24-h and daytime SD of SBP, and 24-h SBP weight SD; 24-h SBP, 24-h SBP-SD and IMT were independently related to the burden of WMH even after adjusting for the clinical variables; In addition, we also established a model which has a higher predictive capacity using 24-h SBP, 24-h SBP-SD and IMT in ROC analysis to assess the WMH burden in hypertensive patients.
Conclusions: Higher 24-h SBP, higher 24-h SBP-SD, and larger IMT were independently associated with greater burden of WMH among elderly Asian primary hypertension patients, establishing a model based on these factors might provide a new approach for enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis of WMH using metrics in 24-h ABPM and carotid ultrasound.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Motor skills emerge when practicing individual movements enables the motor system to extract building instructions that facilitate the generation of future diverse movements. Here we asked how practicing stereotyped movements for minutes affects motor synergies that encode human motor skills acquired over years of training. Participants trained a kinematically highly constrained combined index-finger and thumb movement. Before and after training, finger movements were evoked at rest by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Post-training, the angle between posture vectors describing TMS-evoked movements and the training movements temporarily decreased, suggesting the presence of a short-term memory for the trained movement. Principal component analysis was used to identify joint covariance patterns in TMS-evoked movements. The quality of reconstruction of training or grasping movements from linear combinations of a small subset of these TMS-derived synergies was used as an index of neural efficiency of movement generation. The reconstruction quality increased for the trained movement but remained constant for grasping movements. These findings suggest that the motor system rapidly reorganizes to enhance the coding efficiency of a difficult movement without compromising the coding efficiency of overlearned movements. Practice of individual movements may drive an unsupervised bottom-up process that ultimately shapes synergistic neuronal organization by constant competition of action memories.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 There are three neural feedback pathways to the primary visual cortex (V1): corticocortical, pulvinocortical, and cholinergic. What are the respective functions of these three projections? Possible functions range from contextual modulation of stimulus processing and feedback of high-level information to predictive processing (PP). How are these functions subserved by different pathways and can they be integrated into an overarching theoretical framework? We propose that corticocortical and pulvinocortical connections are involved in all three functions, whereas the role of cholinergic projections is limited by their slow response to stimuli.</content>

During thrombosis, thrombin generates fibrin, however fibrin reversibly binds thrombin with low affinity E-domain sites (K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.8 μM) and high affinity γ’-fibrin sites (K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1 μM). For blood clotting on collagen/tissue factor (1 TF-molecule/μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 200 s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; wall shear rate, high μM-levels of intraclot thrombin suggest robust prothrombin penetration into clots. Setting intraclot zymogen concentrations to plasma levels (and neglecting cofactor rate limitations) allowed the linearization of 7 Michaelis-Menton reactions between 6 species to simulate intraclot generation of: Factors FXa (via TF/VIIa or FIXa), FIXa (via TF/FVIIa or FXIa), thrombin, fibrin, and FXIa. This reduced model [7 rates, 2 K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;’s, enzyme half-lives~1 min] predicted the measured clot elution rate of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) and fragment F1.2 in the presence and absence of the fibrin inhibitor Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro. To predict intraclot fibrin reaching 30 mg/mL by 15 min, the model required fibrinogen penetration into the clot to be strongly diffusion-limited (actual rate/ideal rate = 0.05). The model required free thrombin in the clot (~100 nM) to have an elution half-life of ~2 sec, consistent with measured albumin elution, with most thrombin (&amp;gt;99%) being fibrin-bound. Thrombin-feedback activation of FXIa became prominent and reached 5 pM FXIa at &amp;gt;500 sec in the simulation, consistent with anti-FXIa experiments. In predicting intrathrombus thrombin and fibrin during 15-min microfluidic experiments, the model revealed “cascade amplification” from 30 pM levels of intrinsic tenase to 15 nM prothrombinase to 15 μM thrombin to 90 μM fibrin. Especially useful for multiscale simulation, this reduced model predicts thrombin and fibrin co-regulation during thrombosis under flow.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8Nw3gP6JH3k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Seemingly minor details of mathematical and computational models of evolution are known to change the effect of population structure on the outcome of evolutionary processes. For example, birth-death dynamics often result in amplification of selection, while death-birth processes have been associated with suppression. In many biological populations the interaction structure is not static. Instead, members of the population are in motion and can interact with different individuals at different times. In this work we study populations embedded in a flowing medium; the interaction network is then time dependent. We use computer simulations to investigate how this dynamic structure affects the success of invading mutants, and compare these effects for different coupled birth and death processes. Specifically, we show how the speed of the motion impacts the fixation probability of an invading mutant. Flows of different speeds interpolate between evolutionary dynamics on fixed heterogeneous graphs and well-stirred populations; this allows us to systematically compare against known results for static structured populations. We find that motion has an active role in amplifying or suppressing selection by fragmenting and reconnecting the interaction graph. While increasing flow speeds suppress selection for most evolutionary models, we identify characteristic responses to flow for the different update rules we test. In particular we find that selection can be maximally enhanced or suppressed at intermediate flow speeds.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NoRzxfIPq78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We have previously shown that the physiological size of postsynaptic currents maximises energy efficiency rather than information transfer across the retinothalamic relay synapse. Here, we investigate information transmission and postsynaptic energy use at the next synapse along the visual pathway: from relay neurons in the thalamus to spiny stellate cells in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (L4SS). Using both multicompartment Hodgkin-Huxley-type simulations and electrophysiological recordings in rodent brain slices, we find that increasing or decreasing the postsynaptic conductance of the set of thalamocortical inputs to one L4SS cell decreases the energy efficiency of information transmission from a single thalamocortical input. This result is obtained in the presence of random background input to the L4SS cell from excitatory and inhibitory corticocortical connections, which were simulated (both excitatory and inhibitory) or injected experimentally using dynamic-clamp (excitatory only). Thus, energy efficiency is not a unique property of strong relay synapses: even at the relatively weak thalamocortical synapse, each of which contributes minimally to the output firing of the L4SS cell, evolutionarily-selected postsynaptic properties appear to maximise the information transmitted per energy used.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e0Kf8m4eeWA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Poor sleep quality, low physical activity (PA), and high sedentary behaviour (SB) are common following stroke, which can limit stroke recovery and contribute to greater cognitive decline post-stroke. There is also increasing evidence that sleep quality, PA, and SB are dynamically related to each other and to cognitive health. Hence, the sleep quality, PA, and SB of adults with stroke should be measured concurrently using objective methods. One currently available method for objectively measuring PA, SB, and sleep is the MotionWatch8© (MW8), a wrist-worn accelerometer we have previously shown has evidence of validity and reliability for healthy older adults. However, adults with stroke can have significant mobility restrictions (depending on stroke severity) and thus it is important to determine separate PA and SB cut-points for adults with stroke, as well as validate separate cut-points 1) when the MW8 is worn on the stroke affected side compared to the non-affected side; and 2) for adults with mild stroke versus adults with moderate-to-severe stroke. In the current study, we concurrently measured MW8 actigraphy (worn on both the stroke affected side and the non-affected side) and indirect calorimetry during 10 different activities of daily living for 43 adults with stroke (aged 55-87 years). Using intra-class correlations, we first investigated the reliability and consistency of the MW8 when placed on the stroke affected side as compared to the non-affected side for 1) all participants irrespective of stroke severity; 2) participants with mild stroke, classified as a Fugl Meyer motor score of ≥ 79/100; and 3) participants with moderate-to-severe stroke (i.e., Fugl Meter &amp;lt; 79/100). We then determined cut-points for all participants—as well as separate cut-points based on stroke severity—on both the stroke affected side and non-affected side for SB, light PA, and moderate-to-vigorous PA using receiver operating characteristic curves. Our results support using different cut-points for the stroke affected side vs. non-affected side, and for different levels of stroke severity. Hence, these data provide a new measure for concurrently examining the dynamic relationships between PA, SB, and sleep quality among adults with stroke.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;To go beyond the disconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia, directed (effective) connectivity was measured between 94 brain regions, to provide evidence on the source of the changes in schizophrenia and a mechanistic model. Effective connectivity (EC) was measured in 180 participants with schizophrenia and 208 controls. For the significantly different effective connectivities in schizophrenia, on average the forward (stronger) effective connectivities were smaller, whereas the backward connectivities tended to be larger. Further, higher EC in schizophrenia was found from the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to areas such as the parahippocampal, hippocampal, temporal, fusiform, and occipital cortices. These are backward effective connectivities and were positively correlated with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower effective connectivities were found from temporal and other regions and were negatively correlated with the symptoms, especially the negative and general symptoms. Further, a signal variance parameter was increased for areas that included the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, consistent with the hypothesis that hippocampal overactivity is involved in schizophrenia. This investigation goes beyond the disconnectivity hypothesis by drawing attention to differences in schizophrenia between backprojections and forward connections, with the backward connections from the precuneus and PCC implicated in memory stronger in schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The striatum has long been associated with cognitive functions, but the mechanisms behind this are still unclear. Here we tested a new hypothesis that the striatum contributes to executive function (EF) by strengthening cortico-cortical connections. Striatal connectivity was evaluated by measuring the resting-state functional connectivity between ventral and dorsal striatum in 570 individuals, aged 3–20 years. Using structural equation modeling, we found that inter-individual differences in striatal connectivity had an indirect effect (via fronto-parietal functional connectivity) and a direct effect on a compound EF measure of working memory, inhibition, and set-shifting/flexibility. The effect of fronto-parietal connectivity on cognition did not depend on age: the influence was as strong in older as younger children. In contrast, striatal connectivity was closely related to changes in cognitive ability during childhood development, suggesting a specific role of the striatum in cognitive plasticity. These results support a new principle for striatal functioning, according to which striatum promotes cognitive development by strengthening of cortico-cortical connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Lorna A Farrelly, Ian Maze&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last two decades have witnessed explosive advances in our understanding as to how the organization of chromatin, the association of DNA with histones and vast numbers of non-histone regulatory proteins, controls the expression of specific genes in brain. Prominent among such regulatory mechanisms are modifications of histones, along with the ‘writers,’ ‘erasers,’ and ‘readers’ of these modifications. Much of the work delineating these mechanisms has contributed to the idea that a ‘histone code’ may be a central determinant of a gene’s activity and its potential to be activated or repressed in response to environmental perturbations (both beneficial and aberrant). Indeed, increasing evidence has demonstrated the significance of histone regulation in neurological plasticity and disease, although we are still at the earliest stages of examining all of the many potential chromatin changes involved. In this short review, we provide an emerging perspective on putative roles for histones, and their combinatorial readouts, in the context of neural plasticity, and we provide a conceptual framework for future mechanistic studies aimed at uncovering causal links between the neural ‘histone code’ and brain function/disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objectives: To test the hypothesis that there are differences in neuroradiological measures between single and repeated mild TBI using multimodal MRI.
Methods: A closed-head momentum exchange model was used to produce one or three mild head injuries in young adult male rats as compared to non-injured, age and weight-matched controls. Six-seven weeks post-injury, rats were studied for deficits in cognitive and motor function.  Seven-eight weeks post-injury changes in brain anatomy and function were evaluated through analysis of high resolution T2 weighted images, resting state BOLD functional connectivity, and diffusion weighted imaging with quantitative anisotropy. 
Results: Head injuries occurred without skull fracture or signs of intracranial bleeding or contusion. There were no significant differences in cognitive or motors behaviors between experimental groups. With a single mild hit, the affected areas were limited to the caudate/putamen and central amygdala.  Rats hit three times showed altered diffusivity in white matter tracts, basal ganglia, central amygdala, brainstem, and cerebellum.  Comparing three hits to one hit showed a similar pattern of change underscoring a dose effect of repeated head injury on the brainstem and cerebellum.  Disruption of functional connectivity was pronounced with three mild hits. The midbrain dopamine system, hippocampus, and brainstem/cerebellum showed hypoconnectivity. Interestingly, rats exposed to one hit showed enhanced functional connectivity (or hyperconnectivity) across brain sites, particularly between the olfactory system and the cerebellum.
Interpretation: Neuroradiological evidence of altered brain structure and function, particularly in striatal and midbrain dopaminergic areas, persists long after mild repetitive head injury. These changes may serve as biomarkers of neurodegeneration and risk for dementia later in life.</content>

 Background: Early identification and treatment of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) improves outcomes, but specific evidence needed to individualize treatment recommendations is lacking. Biomarkers that could be routinely measured within the clinical setting could potentially transform clinical care for patients with ASD. This demonstration project employed collection of biomarker data during regular autism specialty clinical visits and explored the relationship of biomarkers with clinical ASD symptoms. 
Methods: Eighty-three children with ASD, aged 5-10 years, completed a multi-site feasibility study integrating the collection of biochemical (blood serotonin, urine melatonin sulfate excretion) and clinical (head circumference, dysmorphology exam, digit ratio, cognitive and behavioral function) biomarkers during routine ASD clinic visits. Parents completed a demographic survey and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community. Cognitive function was determined by record review. Data analysis utilized Wilcoxon two-sample tests and Spearman correlations.
Results: Participants were 82% male, 63% White, 19% Hispanic, with a broad range of functioning. Group means indicated hyperserotonemia. In a single regression analysis adjusting for race and median household income, higher income was associated with higher levels of blood serotonin and urine melatonin sulfate excretion levels (p=.004 and p=.04, respectively). Melatonin correlated negatively with age (p= 0.048) and reported neurologic problems (p=0.02). Dysmorphic status correlated with higher reported stereotyped behavior (p=0.02) and inappropriate speech (p=0.04).
Conclusions: This demonstration project employed collection of multiple biomarkers, allowed for examination of associations between biochemical and clinical measures, and identified several findings that suggest direction for future studies. This clinical research model has promise for integrative biomarker research in individuals with complex, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.</content>

 Almost 50 million people in the world are affected by dementia; the most prevalent form of which is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although aging is considered to be the main risk factor for AD, growing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) increases the risk of dementia including AD. Defective brain insulin signaling has been suggested as an early event  in AD and other tauopathies but the mechanisms that link these diseases are largely unknown. Tau hyperphosphorylation is a hallmark of neurofibrillary pathology and insulin resistance increases the number of neuritic plaques particularly in AD. Utilizing a combination of our Drosophila models of tauopathy (expressing the 2N4R-Tau) and neuroblastoma cells, we have attempted to decipher the pathways downstream of the insulin signaling cascade that lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation and autophagic defects. Using cell-based, genetic and biochemical approaches we have demonstrated that tau phosphorylation at AT8 and PHF1 residues is enhanced in an insulin-resistant environment. We also show that insulin-induced changes in total and phospho-tau are mediated by the crosstalk of AKT, GSK-3β and ERK located downstream of the insulin receptor pathway. Finally, we demonstrate a significant change in the levels of the key proteins in the mTOR/autophagy pathway, implying an increased impairment of aggregated protein clearance in our transgenic Drosophila models and cultured neuroblastoma cells.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Despite advances in the field of dynamic connectivity, fixed sliding window approaches for the detection of fluctuations in functional connectivity are still widely used. The use of conventional connectivity metrics in conjunction with a fixed sliding window comes with the arbitrariness of the chosen window lengths. In this paper we use multivariate autoregressive and neural mass models with a-priori defined ground truths to systematically analyse the sensitivity of conventional metrics in combination with different window lengths to detect genuine fluctuations in connectivity for various underlying state durations. Metrics of interest are the coherence, imaginary coherence, phase lag index, phase locking value and the amplitude envelope correlation. We performed analysis for two nodes and at the network level. We demonstrate that these metrics show indeed higher variability for genuine temporal fluctuations in connectivity compared to a static connectivity state superimposed by noise. Overall, the error of the connectivity estimates themselves decreases for longer state durations (order of seconds). The reverse was true for the correlations of the connectivity fluctuations with the ground truth. In general, metrics, in combination with a sliding window, perform poorly for very short state durations. Increasing the SNR of the system only leads to a moderate improvement. A window length that matches the temporal duration of the underlying states usually leads to the highest correlation with the ground truth. This also indicates that a mismatch between underlying state duration and window length could lead to an underestimation of functional connectivity. In addition, at the network level, only longer window widths were sufficient to detect plausible resting state networks that matched the underlying ground truth, especially for the phase locking value, amplitude envelope correlation and coherence. We conclude that fixed sliding window approaches for connectivity can detect modulations of connectivity, but mostly if the underlying dynamics operate on moderate to slow timescales. In practice, this can be a drawback, as state durations can vary significantly in empirical data.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background &amp;amp; Purpose: The potential for adaptive plasticity in the post-stroke brain is difficult to estimate, as is the demonstration of central nervous system (CNS) target engagement of drugs that show promise in facilitating stroke recovery. We set out to determine if paired associative stimulation (PAS) can be used a) as an assay of CNS plasticity in patients with chronic stroke, and b) to demonstrate CNS engagement by memantine, a drug which has potential plasticity-modulating effects for use in motor recovery following stroke. 

Methods: We examined the effect of PAS in fourteen participants with chronic hemiparetic stroke at five time-points in a within-subjects repeated measures design study: baseline off-drug, and following a week of orally administered memantine at doses of 5, 10, 15, and 20mg, comprising a total of seventy sessions. Each week, MEP amplitude pre and post-PAS was assessed in the contralesional hemisphere as a marker of enhanced or diminished plasticity. Strength and dexterity were recorded each week to monitor motor-specific clinical status across the study period. 

Results: We found that MEP amplitude was significantly larger after PAS in baseline sessions off-drug, and responsiveness to PAS in these sessions was associated with increased clinical severity. There was no observed increase in MEP amplitude after PAS with memantine at any dose. Motor threshold, strength, and dexterity remained unchanged during the study.

Conclusions: PAS successfully induced corticospinal excitability enhancement in chronic stroke subjects at the group level. However, this response did not occur in all participants, and was associated with increased clinical severity. This could be an important way to stratify patients for future PAS-drug studies. PAS was suppressed by memantine at all doses, regardless of responsiveness to PAS off-drug, indicating CNS engagement.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Stroke remains the leading cause of long-term disability with limited options available to aid in recovery. Significant effort has been made to try and minimize neuronal damage following stroke with use of neuroprotective agents, however, these treatments have yet to show clinical efficacy. Regenerative interventions have since become of huge interest as they provide the potential to restore damaged neural tissue without being limited by a narrow therapeutic window. Neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and their high affinity receptors are actively produced throughout the brain and are involved in regulating neuronal activity and normal day-to-day function. Furthermore, neurotrophins are known to play a significant role in both protection and recovery of function following neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. Unfortunately, exogenous administration of these neurotrophins is limited by a lack of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability, poor half-life and rapid degradation. Therefore, we have focused this review on approaches that provide a direct and sustained neurotrophic support using pharmacological therapies and mimetics, physical activity and potential drug delivery systems, including discussion around advantages and limitations for use of each of these systems. Finally, we discuss future directions of biomaterial drug-delivery systems, including the incorporation of heparan sulfate in conjunction with neurotrophin-based interventions.using pharmacological therapies and mimetics, physical activity and potential drug delivery systems, including discussion around advantages and limitations for use of each of these systems.

		<content type="html">
 In older adults, hearing loss is independently associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline, and has been identified to be a modifiable risk factor for dementia.  The mechanism underlying the cognitive decline associated with hearing loss is not understood, but it is known that the greater the hearing loss, the faster the rate of decline.  It is unknown whether remediation of hearing loss with hearing devices can delay cognitive decline. This 5-year international longitudinal study is investigating the impact of cochlear implants on cognitive function in older people with severe-profound hearing loss, and whether remediation of hearing loss could delay the onset of cognitive impairment.  This is the first study to examine the major primary risk factors associated with dementia in the same cohort.  Participants were assessed before cochlear implantation and 18 months later using an identical battery including a visually presented cognitive assessment tool (Cogstate battery) that is highly sensitive to small changes in cognition and suitable for use with people with hearing loss.  Hearing and speech perception ability were assessed in sound -treated conditions by an audiologist, and a range of questionnaire tools was administered to assess self-perceived ease of listening, quality of life, physical activity, diet, social and emotional loneliness, isolation, anxiety and depression.  A detailed medical health history was taken.  Pre-operatively despite the small initial sample size (n = 59), increased hearing loss and age predicted significantly poorer executive function and visual attention, while tertiary education predicted better executive function. Better self-reported quality of life was correlated with better visual learning performance, and engaging in frequent vigorous physical activity was correlated with poorer visual learning performance.  At 18 months, for the first 20 participants, significant benefits of cochlear implants were seen in terms of speech perception, communication ability, and quality of life.  Multiple linear regression modelling showed executive function improved significantly for non-tertiary educated males, while cognitive function remained stable for other participants.  Further follow-up at 18 month intervals with a larger sample will reveal the effects of cochlear implant intervention on all outcomes, and whether this can delay cognitive decline.</content>

 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and neuroinflammation has been identified as one of its key pathological characteristics. Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) amplifies the inflammatory response and plays a role in sepsis and cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that the attenuation of TREM-1 activity produces cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages. However, no study has examined the role of TREM-1 in neurodegeneration. We showed that LP17, a synthetic peptide blocker of TREM-1, significantly inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cascades of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2, and nuclear factor-B. Moreover, LP17 enhanced the LPS-induced upregulation of autophagy-related proteins such as light chain-3 and histone deacetylase-6. We also knocked down TREM-1 expression in a BV2 cell model to further confirm the role of TREM-1. LP17 inhibited 6-hydroxydopamine-induced locomotor deficit and iNOS messenger RNA expression in zebrafish. We also observed therapeutic effects of LP17 administration in 6-OHDA-induced PD syndrome using a rat model. These data suggest that the attenuation of TREM-1 could ameliorate neuroinflammatory responses in PD and that this neuroprotective effect might occur via the activation of autophagy and anti-inflammatory pathways.</content>

 Many cognitive, sensory and motor processes have correlates in oscillatory neural source activity, which is embedded as a subspace in the recorded brain signals. Decoding such processes from noisy magnetoencephalogram/electroencephalogram (M/EEG) signals usually requires data-driven analysis methods. The objective evaluation of such decoding algorithms on experimental raw signals, however, is a challenge: the amount of available M/EEG data typically is limited, labels can be unreliable, and raw signals often are contaminated with artifacts. To overcome some of these problems, simulation frameworks have been introduced which support the development of data-driven decoding algorithms and their benchmarking. For generating artificial brain signals, however, most of the existing frameworks make strong and partially unrealistic assumptions about brain activity. This limits the generalization of results observed in the simulation to real-world scenarios.

In the present contribution, we show how to overcome several shortcomings of existing simulation frameworks. We propose a versatile alternative, which allows for an objective evaluation and benchmarking of novel decoding algorithms using real neural signals. It allows to generate comparatively large datasets with labels being deterministically recoverable from the arbitrary M/EEG recordings.
A novel idea to generate these labels is central to this framework: we determine a subspace of the true M/EEG recordings and utilize it to derive novel labels. These labels contain realistic information about the oscillatory activity of some underlying neural sources. For two categories of subspace-defining methods, we showcase how such labels can be obtained---either by an exclusively data-driven approach  (independent component analysis---ICA), or by a method exploiting additional anatomical constraints (minimum norm estimates---MNE). We term our framework \textit{post-hoc labeling} of M/EEG recordings.
To support the adoption of the framework by practitioners, we have exemplified its use by benchmarking three standard decoding methods---i.e., common spatial patterns (CSP),  source power-comodulation (SPoC), and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)---wrt. Varied dataset sizes, label noise, and label variability. Source code and data are made available to the reader for facilitating the application of our post-hoc labeling framework.</content>

 The nature of abstract and concrete semantics and differences between them have remained a debated issue in psycholinguistic and cognitive studies for decades. Most of the available behavioral and neuroimaging studies reveal distinctions between these two types of semantics, typically associated with a so-called “concreteness effect”. Many attempts have been made to explain these differences using various approaches, from purely theoretical linguistic and cognitive frameworks to neuroimaging experiments. In this brief overview, we will try to provide a snapshot of these diverse views and relationships between them and highlight the crucial issues preventing this problem from being solved. We will argue that one potentially beneficial way forward is to identify the neural mechanisms underpinning acquisition of the different types of semantics (e.g., by using neurostimulation techniques to establish causal relationships), which may help explain the distinctions found between the processing of concrete and abstract semantics.</content>

 Background: Trust and reciprocity towards others have often been found to increase from childhood to adulthood. Gender differences in these social behaviors have been reported in adults. While adolescence is a key-period of change in social behavior, gender differences in trust and reciprocity during this developmental stage have rarely been investigated. 

Method: Here we investigate age-related gender differences in trust and reciprocity (n = 100, 51 female) and associated neural mechanisms (n = 44, 20 female) in adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age. Participants played two multi-round trust games with a pre-programmed cooperative and an unfair partner. Forty-four of 100 participants completed the trust game while undergoing functional brain imaging.

Results: Participants’ investments were greater towards a cooperative than unfair game partner (p &amp;lt; 0.01), showing sensitivity to the degree of trustworthiness. There were no gender or age or related differences in baseline trust. In repeated cooperative interactions no gender differences were found, but younger adolescents showed slightly steeper increase of investments than older adolescents. In unfair interactions, younger males reacted with stronger decrease of investments than older males. Region of interest analysis of brain areas associated with in mentalizing, reward learning, conflict processing, and cognitive control revealed gender-by-age interactions on trusting behavior in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the caudate, showing stronger influence of age in males than in females during cooperation, and the reverse in unfair interactions. Additionally, main effects of gender were found in the TPJ, with higher activation in males, and in the caudate, with females showing greater activation. 

Conclusion: In first interactions and during repeated cooperative interactions, adolescent males and females showed similar trusting behavior. Younger males showed stronger responses to unfairness by others. Gender-by-age interactions in specific ROIs suggest differential development in mentalizing and reward related cognitive processes. In conjunction with previous research, our findings suggest the presence of subtle gender and age-related changes in trust and cooperation that are only detectable using larger age windows.</content>

 The present study introduces a novel cognitive intervention aimed at improving fluid intelligence (Gf), based on a framework we refer to as FAST: Flexible, Adaptive, Synergistic Training. FAST leverages a combination of novel game-based executive function training -- designed specifically to enhance the likelihood of transfer -- and transcranial electrical stimulation, with aims to synergistically activate and strengthen mechanisms of cognitive control critical to Gf. To test our intervention we collected three Gf measures from 113 participants (the advanced short Bochumer Matrizen-Test [BOMAT], Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices, and matrices similar to Raven’s generated by Sandia labs), prior to and following one of three interventions: (1) the FAST+tRNS intervention, a combination of 30 minutes of daily training with our novel training game, Robot Factory, and 20 minutes of concurrent transcranial random noise stimulation applied to bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, (2) an adaptively difficult active control intervention comprised of visuospatial tasks that specifically do not target Gf, or (3) a no-contact control condition. Analyses of changes in a Gf factor from pre- to posttest found numerical increases for the FAST+tRNS group compared to the two control conditions, with a .3 sd increase relative to Active Control (p = .07), and a .19 sd increase relative to a No-contact Control condition (p = .26). This increase was found to be largely driven by significant differences in pre- and posttest Gf as measured on the BOMAT test. Progression through the FAST training game (Robot Factory) was significantly correlated with changes in Gf. This is in contrast with progress in the Active Control condition, as well as with changes in individual executive functions (EFs) during FAST training, which did not significantly correlate with changes in Gf. Taken together, this research represents a useful step forward in providing new insights into, and new methods for studying the nature of Gf and its malleability. Though our results await replication and extension, they provide preliminary evidence that the crucial characteristic of Gf may in fact be the ability to combine executive functions rapidly and adaptively according to changing demand, and that Gf may be susceptible to targeted training.</content>

 Neural network simulation is an important tool for generating and evaluating hypotheses on the structure, dynamics and function of neural circuits. For scientific questions addressing organisms operating autonomously in their environments, in particular where learning is involved, it is crucial to be able to operate such simulations in a closed-loop fashion. In such a set-up, the neural agent continuously receives sensory stimuli from the environment and provides motor signals that manipulate the environment or move the agent within it. So far, most studies requiring such functionality have been conducted with custom simulation scripts and manually implemented tasks. This makes it difficult for other researchers to reproduce and build upon previous work and nearly impossible to compare the performance of different learning architectures. In this work, we present a novel approach to solve this problem, connecting benchmark tools from the field of machine learning and state-of-the-art neural network simulators from computational neuroscience. The resulting toolchain enables researchers in both fields to make use of well-tested high-performance simulation software supporting biologically plausible neuron, synapse and network models and allows them to evaluate and compare their approach on the basis of standardized environments with various levels of complexity. We demonstrate the functionality of the toolchain by implementing a neuronal actor-critic architecture for reinforcement learning in the NEST simulator and successfully training it on two different environments from the OpenAI Gym. We compare its performance to a previously suggested neural network model of reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia and a generic Q-learning algorithm.</content>

 Recent work has indicated the potential utility of automated language analysis for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Most studies combining language processing and machine learning for the prediction of MCI focus on a single language task; here, we consider a cascaded approach to combine data from multiple language tasks. A cohort of 26 MCI participants and 29 healthy controls completed three language tasks: picture description, reading silently, and reading aloud. Information from each task is captured through different modes (audio, text, eye-tracking, and comprehension questions). Features are extracted from each mode, and used to train a series of cascaded classifiers which output predictions at the level of features, modes, tasks, and finally at the overall session level. The best classification result is achieved through combining the data at the task level (AUC = 0.88, accuracy = 0.83). This outperforms a classifier trained on neuropsychological test scores (AUC = 0.75, accuracy = 0.65) as well as the 'early fusion' approach to multimodal classification (AUC = 0.79, accuracy = 0.70). In a correlation analysis, classifier predictions are found to be moderately correlated () with participant scores on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). The cascaded approach for multimodal classification improves both system performance and interpretability. This modular architecture can be easily generalized to incorporate different types of classifiers as well as other heterogeneous sources of data (imaging, metabolic, etc.).</content>

		<content type="html">
 Obesity is a risk factor for cognitive decline and gray matter volume loss in aging. Studies have shown that different metabolic factors, e.g. dysregulated glucose metabolism and systemic inflammation, might mediate this association. Yet, even though these risk factors tend to co-occur, they have mostly been investigated separately, making it difficult to establish their joint contribution to gray matter volume structure in aging. Here, we therefore aimed to determine a metabolic profile of obesity that takes into account different anthropometric and metabolic measures to explain differences in gray matter volume in aging. We included 748 elderly, cognitively healthy participants (age range: 60 – 79 years, BMI range: 17 – 42 kg/m2) of the LIFE-Adult Study. All participants had complete information on body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, glycated hemoglobin, total blood cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, adiponectin and leptin. Voxelwise gray matter volume was extracted from T1-weighted images acquired on a 3T Siemens MRI scanner. We used partial least squares correlation to extract latent variables with maximal covariance between anthropometric, metabolic and gray matter volume and applied permutation/bootstrapping and cross-validation to test significance and reliability of the result. We further explored the association of the latent variables with cognitive performance.
Permutation tests and cross-validation indicated that the first pair of latent variables was significant and reliable. The metabolic profile was driven by negative contributions from body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein and leptin and a positive contribution from adiponectin. It positively covaried with gray matter volume in temporal, frontal and occipital lobe as well as subcortical regions and cerebellum. 
This result shows that a metabolic profile characterized by high body fat, visceral adiposity and systemic inflammation is associated with reduced gray matter volume and potentially reduced executive function in older adults. We observed the highest contributions for body weight and fat mass, which indicates that factors underlying sustained energy imbalance, like sedentary lifestyle or intake of energy-dense food, might be important determinants of gray matter structure in aging.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objectives
To assess the influence of age and sex on ten cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics parameters measured with an MR phase contrast (PC) sequence within the cerebral aqueduct at the level of the intercollicular sulcus.
Materials and Methods
128 healthy subjects (66 female subjects with a mean age of 52.9 years and 62 male subjects with a mean age of 51.8 years) with a normal Evans index, normal medial temporal atrophy score (MTA) and without known disorders of the cerebrospinal fluid circulation were included in the study. A phase contrast MR sequence on a 3T MR scanner was used. Ten different flow parameters were analyzed using postprocessing software. Ordinal and linear regression models were calculated.
Results
The parameters stroke volume (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.003), forward flow volume (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.002), backward flow volume (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.018), absolute stroke volume (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.005), mean flux (sex: p&amp;lt;0.001, age: p=0.001), peak velocity (sex: p=0.009, age: p=0.0016) and peak pressure gradient (sex: p=0.029, age: p=0.028) are significantly influenced by sex and age. The parameters regurgitant fraction, stroke distance and mean velocity are not significantly influenced by sex and age. 
Conclusions
CSF flow dynamics parameters measured in the cerebral aqueduct are partly age and sex dependent. For establishment of reliable reference values for clinical use in future studies, the impact of sex and age should be considered and incorporated.</content>

 The prevalence of the most severe forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders is decreasing due to worldwide availability and high efficacy of antiretroviral treatment (ART). However, several grades of HIV-related cognitive impairment persist with effective ART and remain a clinical concern for people with HIV.
The pathogenesis of these cognitive impairments has yet to be fully understood and probably multifactorial. In people with HIV (PWH) with undetectable peripheral HIV-RNA, the presence of viral escapes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) might explain a proportion of cases, but not all. Many other mechanisms have been hypothesized to be involved in disease progression, in order to identify possible therapeutic targets. As potential indicators of disease staging and progression, numerous biomarkers have been used to characterize and implicate chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury, such as certain phenotypes of activated monocytes/macrophages, in the context of persistent immune-activation. 
Despite none of them being disease-specific, the correlation of several CSF cellular biomarkers to HIV-induced neuronal damage have been investigated. Furthermore, recent studies have been evaluating specific microRNA profiles in the CSF of PWH with neurocognitive impairment.
The aim of the present study is to review the body of evidence on different biomarkers use in research and clinical settings, focusing on PWH on ART with undetectable plasma HIV-RNA.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The acquisition of novel motor skills is a fundamental process of lifelong learning and crucial for everyday behavior. Performance gains acquired by training undergo a transition from an initially labile state to a state that is progressively robust towards interference, a phenomenon referred to as motor consolidation. Previous work has demonstrated that the primary motor cortex (M1) is a neural key region for motor consolidation. However, it remains unknown whether physiological processes underlying posttraining motor consolidation in M1 are active already during an ongoing training phase or only after completion of the training. We examined whether 10-Hz interleaved repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (i-rTMS) of M1 during rest periods between active motor training in an explicit motor learning task affects posttraining offline consolidation. Relative to i-rTMS to the vertex (control region), i-rTMS to the M1&lt;sub&gt;hand&lt;/sub&gt; area of the nondominant hand facilitated posttraining consolidation assessed 6 h after training without affecting training performance. This facilitatory effect generalized to delayed performance of the mirror-symmetric sequence with the untrained (dominant) hand. These findings indicate that posttraining consolidation can be facilitated independently from training-induced performance increments and suggest that consolidation is initiated already during offline processing in short rest periods between active training phases.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Language is a fundamental part of human cognition. The question of whether language is processed independently of speech, however, is still heavily discussed. The absence of speech in deaf signers offers the opportunity to disentangle language from speech in the human brain. Using probabilistic tractography, we compared brain structural connectivity of adult deaf signers who had learned sign language early in life to that of matched hearing controls. Quantitative comparison of the connectivity profiles revealed that the core language tracts did not differ between signers and controls, confirming that language is independent of speech. In contrast, pathways involved in the production and perception of speech displayed lower connectivity in deaf signers compared to hearing controls. These differences were located in tracts towards the left pre-supplementary motor area and the thalamus when seeding in Broca’s area, and in ipsilateral parietal areas and the precuneus with seeds in left posterior temporal regions. Furthermore, the interhemispheric connectivity between the auditory cortices was lower in the deaf than in the hearing group, underlining the importance of the transcallosal connection for early auditory processes. The present results provide evidence for a functional segregation of the neural pathways for language and speech.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Univariate analyses of structural neuroimaging data have produced heterogeneous results regarding anatomical sex- and gender-related differences. The current study aimed at delineating and cross-validating brain volumetric surrogates of sex and gender by comparing the structural magnetic resonance imaging data of cis- and transgender subjects using multivariate pattern analysis. Gray matter (GM) tissue maps of 29 transgender men, 23 transgender women, 35 cisgender women, and 34 cisgender men were created using voxel-based morphometry and analyzed using support vector classification. Generalizability of the models was estimated using repeated nested cross-validation. For external validation, significant models were applied to hormone-treated transgender subjects (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 32) and individuals diagnosed with depression (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 27). Sex was identified with a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 82.6% (false discovery rate [p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt;] &amp;lt; 0.001) in cisgender, but only with 67.5% (p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.04) in transgender participants indicating differences in the neuroanatomical patterns associated with sex in transgender despite the major effect of sex on GM volume irrespective of the self-identification as a woman or man. Gender identity and gender incongruence could not be reliably identified (all p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). The neuroanatomical signature of sex in cisgender did not interact with depressive features (BAC = 74.7%) but was affected by hormone therapy when applied in transgender women (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction hypothesis has been proposed to help understand the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This hypothesis was based on early observations that NMDAR antagonists could induce a full range of symptoms of schizophrenia in normal human subjects. Accumulating evidence in humans and animal studies points to NMDAR hypofunctionality as a convergence point for various symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we review animal models of NMDAR hypofunction generated by pharmacological and genetic approaches, and how they relate to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In addition, we discuss the limitations of animal models of NMDAR hypofunction and their potential utility for therapeutic applications.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Lgr5+ cochlear supporting cells have been reported to be hair cell (HC) progenitor cells that have the ability to regenerate HCs in the neonatal mouse cochlea, and these cells are regulated by Wnt signaling. Frizzled-9 (Fzd9), one of the Wnt receptors, has been reported to be used to mark neuronal stem cells in the brain together with other markers and mesenchymal stem cells from human placenta and bone marrow. Here we used Fzd9-CreER mice to lineage label and trace Fzd9+ cells in the postnatal cochlea in order to investigate the progenitor characteristic of Fzd9+ cells. Lineage labeling showed that inner phalangeal cells, inner border cells, and third-row Deiters’ cells were Fzd9+ cells, but not inner pillar cells or GER cells at postnatal day (P)3, which suggests that Fzd9+ cells are a much smaller cell population than Lgr5+ progenitors. The expression of Fzd9 progressively decreased and was too low to allow lineage tracing after P14. Lineage tracing for 6 days in vivo showed that Fzd9+ cells could also generate similar numbers of new HCs compared to Lgr5+ progenitors. A sphere-forming assay showed that Fzd9+ cells could form spheres after sorting by flow cytometry, and when we compared the isolated Fzd9+ cells and Lgr5+ progenitors there were no significant differences in sphere number or sphere diameter. In a differentiation assay, the same number of Fzd9+ cells could produce similar amounts of Myo7a+ cells compared to Lgr5+ progenitors after 10 days of differentiation. All these data suggest that the Fzd9+ cells have a similar capacity for proliferation, differentiation, and HC generation as Lgr5+ progenitors and that Fzd9 can be used as a more restricted marker of HC progenitors.</content>

 Background: A fundamental question in Alzheimer’s disease is whether amyloid-β peptides and their deposition in the brain signify a direct pathological role, or they are mere outcome of the disease pathophysiological events affecting neuronal function. It is therefore important to decipher their physiological role in the brain. So far, the overwhelming focus has been on the potential toxicity of amyloid-β, often studied outside the crucial Alzheimer’s disease characteristics, i.e. i) the slow, decades-long disease progression that precedes clinical symptoms; ii) the link to apolipoprotein-E ε4 allele as major risk factor; iii) the selective early degeneration of cholinergic neurons. Previous studies, in vitro and CSF only, indicated one possible native function of amyloid-β peptides is the allosteric modulation of acetylcholine homeostasis, via molecular interactions between amyloid-β, apolipoprotein-E, and the acetylcholine-degrading enzymes, cholinesterases, resulting in formation of acetylcholine-hydrolyzing complexes (BaβACs).
Methods: Here, by combining sucrose-density gradient fractionation of post-mortem brain and in-house developed sensitive ELISA assays on the obtained fractions, we investigated presence, levels and molecular interactions between amyloid-β, apolipoprotein-E and cholinesterases for the first time in brain tissues. We examined three distinct brain regions of Alzheimer and non-demented subjects, plus a large number of Alzheimer CSF samples.
Results: We report that both monomeric and oligomeric (homomeric and heteromeric) forms of amyloid-β peptides are present in the brain of Alzheimer and non-demented individuals. Heteromeric amyloid-β was found in stable complexes with apolipoprotein-E and/or cholinesterases, irrespective of APOE genotype or disease status, arguing in favor of a physiological dynamic formation and function for these complexes in the brain. The patterns and molecular sizes of the detected soluble amyloid-β forms were closely matched between CSF and brain samples. This evinces that the detected amyloid-β-apolipoprotein-E complexes and BAβACs in CSF most likely originate from the interstitial fluids of the brain.
Conclusions: In conclusion, both light homomeric amyloid-β oligomers and heteromeric amyloid-β -ApoE and BAβACs are present and readily detectable in the brain, regardless of disease status and APOE4 genotype. Deeper knowledge of the physiological function of amyloid-β is crucial for better understanding the early pathological events that decades later lead to manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease.</content>

 Active sensory systems have evolved to properly encode natural stimuli including those created by conspecifics, yet little is known about the properties of such stimuli. We consider the electrosensory signal at the skin of a fixed weakly electric fish in the presence of a swimming conspecific. The dipole recordings are obtained in parallel with video tracking of the position of the animals. This enables the quantification of the relationships between the recording dipole and the positions of the head, midbody and tail of the freely swimming fish. The contrast of the signal at the skin is shown to be well-fitted by a decreasing exponential function of distance. It is thus anti-correlated with distance; it is also correlated with the second envelope (i.e. the envelope of the envelope) of the raw recorded signal. The variance of the contrast signal is highest at short range. However, the coefficient of variation of this signal increases with distance. We find a range of position and associated contrast patterns under quasi-2D swimming conditions.  This is quantified using global measures of the visit times of the free fish within measurable range, with each visit causing a bump in contrast. The durations of these bumps as well as the times between these bumps are well reproduced by a doubly stochastic process formed by a dichotomous (two-state) noise with Poisson statistics multiplying a colored noise (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). Certain rapid body movements such as bending or turning are seen to produce contrast drops that may be part of cloaking strategies.</content>

 The purinergic P2X7 receptor is a key mediator in (neuro)inflammation, a process that is associated with neurodegeneration and excitotoxicity in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recently, P2X7 imaging has become possible with [11C]JNJ-(54173)717. We investigated P2X7 availability, in comparison with availability of the translocator protein (TSPO), in two well-characterized rat models of PD using in vitro autoradiography at multiple time points throughout the disease progression. Rats received either a unilateral injection with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the striatum, or with recombinant adeno-associated viral vector overexpressing human A53T alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) in the substantia nigra. Transverse cryosections were incubated with [11C]JNJ-717 for P2X7 or [18F]DPA-714 for TSPO. [11C]JNJ-717 binding ratios were transiently elevated in the striatum of 6-OHDA rats at day 14-28 post-injection, with peak P2X7 binding at day 14. This largely coincided with the time course of striatal [18F]DPA-714 binding which was elevated at day 7-21, with peak TSPO binding at day 7. Increased P2X7 availability co-localized with microglial, but not astrocyte or neuronal markers. In the chronic α-SYN model, no significant differences were found in P2X7 binding, although in vitro TSPO overexpression was reported previously. This first study showed an increased P2X7 availability in the acute PD model in a time window corresponding with elevated TSPO binding and motor behavior changes. In contrast, the dynamics of TSPO and P2X7 were divergent in the chronic α-SYN model where no P2X7 changes were detectable. Overall, extended P2X7 phenotyping is warranted prior to implementation of P2X7 imaging for monitoring of neuroinflammation.</content>

 In the last decade, much attention has been devoted to the effects of nutrient-related signals on brain development and cognitive functions. A turning point was the discovery that brain areas other than the hypothalamus expressed receptors for hormones related to metabolism. In particular, insulin signaling has been demonstrated to impact on molecular cascades underlying hippocampal plasticity, learning and memory. Here, we summarize the molecular evidence linking alteration of hippocampal insulin sensitivity with changes of both adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. We also review the epidemiological studies and experimental models emphasizing the critical role of brain insulin resistance at the crossroad between metabolic and neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we brief novel findings suggesting how biomarkers of brain insulin resistance, involving the study of brain-derived extracellular vesicles and brain glucose metabolism, may predict the onset and/or the progression of cognitive decline.</content>

 Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are established imaging modalities for the study of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, dementia, psychiatric disorders and so on. Since these two available modalities vary in imaging principle and physical performance, each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages over the other. To acquire the mutual complementary information and reinforce each other, there is a need for the fusion of PET and MRI. This combined dual-modality (either sequential or simultaneous) could generate preferable soft tissue contrast of brain tissue, flexible acquisition parameters and minimized exposure to radiation. The most unique superiority of PET/MRI is mainly manifested in MRI-based improvement for the inherent limitations of PET, such as motion artifacts, partial volume effect and invasive procedure in quantitative analysis. Head motion during scanning significantly deteriorates the effective resolution of PET image, especially for the dynamic scan with lengthy time. Hybrid PET/MRI device can offer motion correction (MC) for PET data through MRI information acquired simultaneously. Regarding the partial volume effect (PVE) associated with limited spatial resolution, the process and reconstruction of PET data can be further optimized by using acquired MRI either sequentially or simultaneously. The quantitative analysis of dynamic PET data mainly relies upon an invasive arterial blood sampling procedure to acquire arterial input function (AIF). An image-derived input function (IDIF) method without the need of arterial cannulization, can serve as a potential alternative estimation of AIF. Compared with using PET data only, combining anatomical or functional information from MRI for improving the accuracy in IDIF approach has been demonstrated. Yet, due to the interference and inherent disparity between the two modalities, these methods for optimizing PET image based on MRI still have many technical challenges. This review discussed upon the most recent progress, current challenges and future directions of MRI-driven PET data optimization for neurological applications, with either sequential or simultaneous acquisition approach.</content>

 Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. However, little is known about the cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and functional connectivity changes in the disease. In this study, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data including 24 MSA-c-type patients and 20 healthy controls were collected. By using voxel wise arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion analysis, several regions of the altered rCBF were identified in the MSA c-type patients. And then, the changes of the functional connectivities of identified rCBF regions were analyzed by using functional MRI (fMRI). Finally, rCBF value of cerebellum was extracted to differentiate the MSA c-type patients and controls. Compared with the controls, the MSA c-type patients showed distinct disruption of rCBF in the cerebellum. The disconnection of the identified cerebellar regions was revealed in several regions in the MSA c-type patients, including right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right precuneus, left superior temporal gyrus (STG), right lingual gyrus, left postcentral gyrus (PoCG), right cerebellum 7b, right cerebellum 8, and left cerebellum 4,5. These regions were involved in the default mode network (DMN), sensorimoter network, visual associated cortices and cerebellum. Using the rCBF value of vermis as biomarker, the two groups can be differentiated and reached a sensitivity of 95.8% and speciﬁcity of 100%. This is the first study to demonstrate the MSA-specific rCBF abnormalities using the ASL method, which are closely associated with several functional networks on resting state fMRI. The rCBF of vermis might be used as the potential imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of MSA c-type.</content>

 All cells respond to extracellular signals by altering their intracellular biochemical state. In neurons, such signaling regulates many aspects of cell and synapse biology and induces changes that are thought to be important for nervous system development, its adaptation in the face of a changing environment, and ongoing homeostatic maintenance.  Although great advances have been made in developing novel fluorescent reporters of intracellular signaling as well as in methods of fluorescence detection for use in freely moving animals, these approaches have generally not been combined. Thus, we know relatively little about how the intracellular biochemical state of neurons, and other cell classes, is dynamically regulated during animals’ behavior. Here we describe a single multi-mode fiber based fluorescent lifetime photometry system (FLiP) designed to monitor the state of fluorescence reporters of biochemical state in freely moving animals.  We demonstrate the utility of FLiP by monitoring the lifetime of FLIM-AKAR, a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter of PKA phosphorylation, in populations of direct and indirect pathway striatal projection neurons in mice receiving food rewards. We find that the activity of PKA in each pathway is transiently regulated by reward acquisition, with PKA phosphorylation being enhanced and repressed in direct and indirect pathway neurons, respectively. This study demonstrates the power of FLiP to detect changes in biochemical state induced by naturalistic experiences in behaving animals.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective:
A minimally conscious state (MCS) is characterized by discernible behavioral evidence of consciousness that cannot be reproduced consistently. This condition is highly challenging to treat. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential therapeutic effect of noninvasive brain stimulation in patients with MCS. In one patient in an MCS, we delivered simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) based on an individual brain network analysis and evaluated the therapeutic effect.
Methods:
The directional transfer function (DTF) was calculated based on electroencephalograph (EEG) analysis. Global brain connectivity was calculated based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. By referring to the EEG and fMRI results, we identified inferior parietal lobes (IPLs) as targets. In the two-week treatment period, fourteen sessions were applied to the identified bilateral parietal regions. Simultaneous 1.5 mA anodal tDCS and 5 Hz rTMS were delivered for 20 minutes per hemisphere in each session. Clinical evaluation scores were recorded weekly throughout the treatment. A second patient given the routine treatment was evaluated as a control.
Results:
The clinical scores of patient 1 with MCS improved after 2 weeks of stimulation treatment, and the effect lasted for up to 1 month. EEG analysis showed a significant increase (p &amp;lt; 0.001) in the DTF value in the gamma band in a bilateral set of posterior regions, and fMRI showed a trend toward normalized activity in the IPLs. The clinical scores of patient 2 with coma did not improve much after two weeks of routine treatment. The EEG analysis showed a significant increase (p = 0.021) in the DTF value in the gamma band in a bilateral set of posterior regions.
Conclusions:
The application of EEG and fMRI to characterize the functional connectivity features of the network in an MCS patient provided a reasonable and accurate stimulation target and verified the changes in functional connectivity resulting from stimulation.</content>

 Stroke causes behavioral deficits in multiple cognitive domains and there is a growing interest in predicting patient performance from neuroimaging data using machine learning techniques. Here we investigated a deep learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for predicting the severity of language disorder from 3D MRI lesion images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a heterogeneous sample of stroke patients. CNN performance was compared to that of conventional (shallow) machine learning methods, including Ridge Regression on the images’ principal components and Support Vector Regression. We also devised a hybrid method based on re-using CNN’s high-level features as additional input to the Ridge Regression model. Predictive accuracy of the four different methods was further investigated in relation to the size of the training set and the level of redundancy across lesion images in the dataset, which was evaluated in terms of location and topological properties of the lesions. The hybrid model achieved the best performance in most cases, thereby suggesting that the high-level features extracted by CNNs are complementary to PCA features and improve the model’s predictive accuracy. Moreover, our analyses indicate that both the size of training data and image redundancy are critical factors in determining the accuracy of a computational model in predicting behavioural outcome from the structural brain imaging data of stroke patients.</content>

 Insula plays an essential role in maintaining the addiction to cigarette smoking and smoking-related alterations on the insular volume and density have been reported in smokers. However, less is known about the effects of chronic cigarette smoking on the insular cortical thickness. In this study, we explored the region-specific changes of insular cortical thickness in heavy smokers and their relations with smoking-related variables. Thirty-seven heavy smokers (29 males; mean age 47.19±7.22 years) and 37 nonsmoking healthy controls (29 males; mean age 46.95±8.45 years) participated in the study. Subregional insular cortical thickness was evaluated and compared between the two groups. Correlation analysis was performed to investigate relationships between the insular cortical thickness and clinical characteristics in heavy smokers. There was no statistical difference on the cortical thickness in the left insula (p=0.536) between the two groups while heavy smokers had a slightly thinner cortical thickness in the right insula (p=0.048). In addition, heavy smokers showed a greater cortical thinning in the anterior (p=0.0084) and superior (p=0.0054) segment of the circular sulcus of the right insula as well as the inferior (p=0.012) segment of the circular sulcus of the left insula. Moreover, the cortical thickness of the superior segment of the circular sulcus of the left insula was correlated negatively with nicotine severity (r=-0.423; p=0.009) and the longer cigarette exposure was associated with the cortical thinning in the long insular gyrus and central sulcus of the right insula (r=-0.475; p=0.003). Our findings indicate that chronic cigarette use is associated with region-specific insular thinning, which has the potential to improve our understanding of the specific roles of insular subregions in nicotine addiction.</content>

 Decision making often requires making arbitrary choices (‘picking’) between alternatives that make no difference to the agent, that are equally desirable, or when the potential rewards are unknown. Using event-related potentials we tested the effect of age on this common type of decision making. We compared two age groups: ages 18-25, and ages 41-67 on a masked-priming paradigm while recording EEG and EMG. Participants pressed a right or left button following either an instructive arrow cue or a neutral free-choice picking cue, both preceded by a masked arrow or neutral prime. The prime affected the behavior on the Instructed and the Free-choice picking conditions both in the younger and older groups. Moreover, electrophysiological ‘Change of Intention’ was observed via Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) in both age groups – the polarity of the LRP indicated first preparation to move the primed hand and then preparation to move the other hand. However, the older participants were more conservative in responding to the instructive cue, exhibiting a speed-accuracy trade-off, with slower response times, less errors in incongruent trials, and reduced probability of EMG activity in the non-responding hand. Additionally, ‘Change of Intention’ was observed in both age groups in slow RT trials with a neutral prime as a result of an endogenous early intention to respond in a direction opposite the eventual instructing arrow cue. We conclude that the basic behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of implicit change of intention are common to a wide range of ages. However, older subjects, despite showing a similar dynamic decision trajectory as younger adults, are slower, more prudent and finalize the decision making process before letting the information affect the peripheral motor system. In contrast, the flow of information in younger subjects occurs in parallel to the decision process.</content>

 Recent applications of simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) suggest that adapting stimulation to underlying brain states may enhance neuroplastic effects of TMS. It is often assumed that longer-lasting effects of TMS on brain function may be mediated by phasic interactions between TMS pulses and endogenous cortical oscillatory dynamics. The mechanisms by which TMS exerts its neuromodulatory effects, however, remain unknown. Here we discuss evidence concerning the functional effects on synaptic plasticity of oscillatory cross-frequency coupling in cortical networks as a potential framework for understanding the neuromodulatory effects of TMS. We first discuss evidence for interactions between endogenous oscillatory brain dynamics and externally induced electromagnetic field activity. Alpha band (8-12 Hz) activities are of special interest here because of the wide application and therapeutic effectiveness of rhythmic TMS (rTMS) using a stimulus repetition frequency at or near 10 Hz. We discuss the large body of literature on alpha oscillations suggesting that alpha oscillatory cycles produce periodic inhibition or excitation of neuronal processing through phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of low-frequency oscillations with high-frequency broadband (or gamma) bursting. Such alpha-gamma coupling may reflect excitability of neuronal ensembles underlying neuroplasticity effects of TMS. We propose that TMS delivery with simultaneous EEG recording and near-real time estimation of source-resolved alpha-gamma PAC might be used to select the precise timing of TMS pulse deliveries so as to enhance the neuroplastic effects of TMS therapies.</content>

 A new approach to understanding the interaction between cortical areas is provided by a mathematical analysis of biased competition, which describes many interactions between cortical areas, including those involved in top-down attention. The analysis helps to elucidate the principles of operation of such cortical systems, and in particular the parameter values within which biased competition operates. The analytic results are supported by simulations that illustrate the operation of the system with parameters selected from the analysis. The findings provide a detailed mathematical analysis of the operation of these neural systems with nodes connected by feedforward (bottom-up) and feedback (top-down) connections. The analysis provides the critical value of the top-down attentional bias that enables biased competition to operate for a range of input values to the network, and derives this as a function of all the parameters in the model. The critical value of the top-down bias depends linearly on the value of the other inputs, but the coefficients in the function reveal non-linear relations between the remaining parameters. The results provide reasons why the backprojections should not be very much weaker than the forward connections between two cortical areas. The major advantage of the analytical approach is that it discloses relations between all the parameters of the model. This task cannot be fulfilled purely by numerical simulations.</content>

 The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), surrounding the genu of the corpus callosum, plays important roles in emotional processing and is functionally divided into the dorsal, perigenual, and subgenual subregions (dACC, pgACC, and sgACC, respectively). Previous studies have suggested that the pgACC and sgACC are involved in mood disorders in different manners. Anatomically, the ACC has rich connections with other emotion-related areas including the amygdala and the medial temporal and temporal pole (TP) areas. To understand the neuroanatomical basis of the functional differences between the ACC subregions, we injected neuronal tracers into the pgACC, sgACC, and dACC and compared the afferent connections. Previously, we analyzed the afferent projections from the amygdala, and found a distinct pattern for the sgACC. In the present study, the patterns of the afferent projections were analyzed in the temporal pole and medial temporal areas. After injections in the sgACC, many labeled neurons were found in the TP and the subiculum of the hippocampal formation. In the TP, a majority of the labeled cell bodies was found in the superficial layers (“feedforward” type projections). The pgACC received afferent projections from the TP, the entorhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal cortex, but not from the hippocampus. In each area, the labeled cells were mainly found in the deep layers (“feedback” type projection). The pattern for the dACC was similar to that for the pgACC. Within the ACC, the projections from the sgACC to the pgACC originated predominantly in the deep layers (“feedback” type projection). These data suggest that the sgACC ranks higher than the pgACC in the hierarchy of the emotional system.</content>

 Similar to humans, the normal aged rat population is not homogenous in terms of cognitive function. Two distinct subpopulations of aged Sprague-Dawley rats can be identified on the basis of spatial memory performance in the hole-board paradigm. It was the aim of the study to reveal protein changes relevant to aging and spatial memory performance.
Aged impaired (AI) and unimpaired (AU) male rats, 22-24 months old were selected from a large cohort of 160 animals; young animals served as controls. Enriched synaptosomal fraction from dentate gyrus from behaviourally characterized old animals were used for isobaric tags labelling based quantitative proteomic analysis. As differences in peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) levels were a pronounced finding, PRDX6 levels were also quantified by immunoblotting.
AI showed impaired spatial memory abilities while AU performed comparable to young animals. Our study demonstrates substantial quantitative alteration of proteins involved in energy metabolism, inflammation and synaptic plasticity during aging. Moreover, we identified protein changes specifically coupled to memory performance of aged rats. PRDX6 levels clearly differentiated AI from AU and levels in AU were comparable to those of young animals. In addition, it was observed that stochasticity in protein levels increased with age and discriminate between AI and AU groups. Moreover, there was a significantly higher variability of protein levels in AI.  
PRDX6 is a member of the peroxiredoxin family and well-defined as a cystein-1 PRDX that reduces and detoxifies hydroxyperoxides. It is well-known and documented that the aging brain shows increased active oxygen species but so far no study proposed a potential target with antioxidant activity that would discriminate between impaired and unimpaired memory performers. Current data, representing so far the largest proteomics data set in aging DG, provide first evidence for a probable role of PRDX6 in memory performance.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/div&gt;Cortical structure has been consistently related to cognitive abilities in children and adults, yet we know little about how the cortex develops to support emergent cognition in infancy and toddlerhood when cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) are maturing rapidly. In this report, we assessed how regional and global measures of CT and SA in a sample (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 487) of healthy neonates, 1-year-olds, and 2-year-olds related to motor, language, visual reception, and general cognitive ability. We report novel findings that thicker cortices at ages 1 and 2 and larger SA at birth, age 1, and age 2 confer a cognitive advantage in infancy and toddlerhood. While several expected brain–cognition relationships were observed, overlapping cortical regions were also implicated across cognitive domains, suggesting that infancy marks a period of plasticity and refinement in cortical structure to support burgeoning motor, language, and cognitive abilities. CT may be a particularly important morphological indicator of ability, but its impact on cognition is relatively weak when compared with gestational age and maternal education. Findings suggest that prenatal and early postnatal cortical developments are important for cognition in infants and toddlers but should be considered in relation to other child and demographic factors.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining is a commonly used method to determine the volume of the cerebral infarction in experimental stroke models. The TTC staining protocol is considered to interfere with downstream analyses, and it is unclear whether TTC-stained brain samples can be used for biochemistry analyses. However, there is evidence indicating that, with proper optimization and handling, TTC-stained brains may remain viable for protein analyses. In the present study, we aimed to rigorously assess whether TTC can reliably be used for western blotting of various markers. In this study, brain samples obtained from C57BL/6 male mice were treated with TTC (TTC+) or left untreated (TTC-) at 1 week after photothrombotic occlusion or sham surgery. Brain regions were dissected into infarct, thalamus and hippocampus and proteins were extracted by using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Protein levels of apoptosis, autophagy, neuronal, glial, vascular and neurodegenerative related markers were analyzed by western blotting. Our results showed that TTC+ brains display similar relative changes in most of the markers compared with TTC- brains. In addition, we validated that these analyses can be performed in the infarct as well as other brain regions such as the thalamus and hippocampus. Our findings demonstrate that TTC+ brains are reliable for protein analyses using western blotting.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Malocclusion is an important risk factor for temporomandibular disorder (TMD), a series of disorders characterized by dysfunction in the orofacial region involving the temporomandibular joint and jaw muscles. We recently showed that experimental unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) produced masseter hyperactivity through a circuit involving the periodontal proprioception, trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (Vme), and trigeminal motor nucleus (Vmo). Anxiety is a common complication in patients with TMD. The lateral habenula (LHb) is involved in emotional modulation and has direct projections to the Vme. Therefore, the present research examined whether UAC facilitates excitatory input from the LHb to the Vme and subsequently anxiety-like behaviors in rats. The LHb activation was evaluated by the electrophysiological recording, assessment of vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGLUT2) mRNA expression, and measurement of anxiety-like behaviors. The effects of LHb activity on Vme were evaluated by electrophysiological recording from Vme neurons and local changes in VGLUT2 protein density. UAC produced anxiety in modelled rats and increased neuronal activity in the LHb. VGLUT2 mRNA expression was also increased in the LHb. Further, VGLUT2-positive boutons were observed in close apposite upon parvalbumin-labelled Vme neurons. VGLUT2 protein expression was also increased in the Vme. Significantly, injection of VGLUT2-targeted shRNA into the LHb reduced the expression of VGLUT2 protein in the Vme, attenuated UAC-associated anxiety-like behaviors, and attenuated electrophysiological changes in the Vme neurons. In conclusion, we show that UAC activates the LHb neurons as well as the periodontal proprioceptive pathway to provide excitatory input to the Vme and produce anxiety in rats. These findings provide a rationale for suppressing activity of the LHb to attenuate both the physical and psychological effects of TMD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Taste perception changes with obesity but the underlying neural changes remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we recorded taste responses from single cells in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS, the first synapse in the central gustatory circuit) in awake, diet-induced obese [(DIO; ≥ 8wks on a high-energy diet (45%fat, 17% sugar; HED)] and lean rats. Rats were implanted with a bundle of microelectrodes in the NTS and allowed to recover. Water-deprived rats were allowed to freely lick various tastants in an experimental chamber. Taste stimuli included an array of sapid stimuli dissolved in artificial saliva (AS). Each taste trial consisted of five consecutive licks followed by five AS licks presented on a VR5 schedule. Results showed that taste responses in NTS cells in DIO rats (n=49) were smaller in magnitude, shorter in duration and longer in latency that those in lean rats (n=74).  However, there were proportionately more taste-responsive cells in DIO than in lean rats. Lick coherence in DIO rats was significantly lower than in lean rats, both in taste-responsive and lick-related cells (n=172 in lean; n=65 in DIO). Analyses of temporal coding showed that taste cells in DIO rats conveyed less information about taste quality than cells in lean rats. Collectively, results suggest that a HED produces blunted, but more prevalent, responses to taste in the NTS and a weakened association of taste responses with ingestive behavior. These neural adaptations may represent both negative effects and compensatory mechanisms of a HED that may underlie deficits in taste-related behavior associated with obesity.</content>

 The olfactory involvement is an early feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The olfactory functional MRI (fMRI) is an objective method to evaluate the olfactory function, but might be affected by the individual variation and the magnetic susceptibility artifact of basis cranii. To improve the reliability of olfactory fMRI, we explored the response of primary olfactory cortex (POC) across three different concentrations of odors. 44 normal controls, 46 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 44 patients with AD underwent olfactory fMRI using lavender stimuli of three different (0.10%, 0.33%, and 1.00%) concentrations during one fMRI sequence with a 3.0T MRI scanner. The numbers of activated voxels in the POC especially the activation changes during different concentrations were analyzed. The POC activation pattern of controls showed olfactory adaptation at the higher concentration, whereas the AD patients showed not only increased olfactory threshold but also lack of olfactory habituation. Five types of activation patterns across different concentrations were summarized to evaluate the olfactory function. The result showed the activation pattern could effectively found 40/44(90.9%) of the ADs showed impaired habituation, whereas 31/44(70.5%) of the normal controls showed normal olfactory habituation. In MCIs, 29/46(63.0%) of subjects showed impaired habituation. This finding indicates that the POC activation pattern of olfactory fMRI across different concentrations is useful in evaluating the olfactory function, which is important in the detection of early AD among MCI cases.</content>

 Electrical stimulation of the brain through the implantation of electrodes is an effective treatment for certain diseases and the focus of a large body of research investigating new cell mechanisms, neurological phenomena, and treatments. Electrode devices developed for stimulation in rodents vary widely in size, cost, and functionality, with the majority of recent studies presenting complex, multi-functional designs. While some experiments require these added features, others are in greater need of reliable, low cost, and readily available devices that will allow surgeries to be scheduled and completed without delay. In this work, we utilize 3D printing and common electrical hardware to produce an effective 2-channel stimulation device that meets these requirements. Our stimulation electrode has not failed in over 60 consecutive surgeries, costs less than $1 USD, and can be assembled in less than 20 minutes. 3D printing minimizes the amount of material used in manufacturing the device and enables one to match the curvature of the connector’s base with the curvature of the mouse skull, producing an ultra-lightweight, low size device with improved adhesion to the mouse skull. The range of the stimulation parameters used with the proposed device was: pulse amplitude 1-200 μA, pulse duration 50-500 μs and pulse frequency 1-285Hz.</content>

 Analysis of spike and local field potential (LFP) data is an essential part of neuroscientific research. Today there exist many open-source toolboxes for spike and LFP data analysis implementing various functionality. Here we aim to provide a practical guidance for neuroscientists in the choice of an open-source toolbox best satisfying their needs. We overview major open-source toolboxes for spike and LFP data analysis as well as toolboxes with tools for connectivity analysis, dimensionality reduction and generalized linear modeling. We focus on comparing toolboxes functionality, statistical and visualization tools, documentation and support quality. To give a better insight, we compare and illustrate functionality of the toolboxes on open-access dataset or simulated data and make corresponding MATLAB scripts publicly available.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The functional features of neural circuits are determined by a combination of properties that range in scale from projections systems across the whole brain to molecular interactions at the synapse. The burgeoning field of neurocartography seeks to map these relevant features of brain structure—spanning a volume ~20 orders of magnitude—to determine how neural circuits perform computations supporting cognitive function and complex behavior. Recent technological breakthroughs in tissue sample preparation, high-throughput electron microscopy imaging, and automated image analyses have produced the first visualizations of all synaptic connections between neurons of invertebrate model systems. However, the sheer size of the central nervous system in mammals implies that reconstruction of the first full brain maps at synaptic scale may not be feasible for decades. In this review, we outline existing and emerging technologies for neurocartography that complement electron microscopy-based strategies and are beginning to derive some basic organizing principles of circuit hodology at the mesoscale, microscale, and nanoscale. Specifically, we discuss how a host of light microscopy techniques including array tomography have been utilized to determine both long-range and subcellular organizing principles of synaptic connectivity. In addition, we discuss how new techniques, such as two-photon serial tomography of the entire mouse brain, have become attractive approaches to dissect the potential connectivity of defined cell types. Ultimately, principles derived from these techniques promise to facilitate a conceptual understanding of how connectomes, and neurocartography in general, can be effectively utilized towards reaching a mechanistic understanding of circuit function.

 This study compared the predictive power and robustness of texture, topological, and convolutional neural network (CNN) based image features for measuring tumors in MRI.  These features were used to predict 1p/19q codeletion in the MICCAI BRATS 2017 challenge dataset.  Topological data analysis (TDA) based on persistent homology had predictive performance as good as or better than texture-based features and was also less susceptible to image-based perturbations.  Features from a pre-trained convolutional neural network had similar predictive performances and robustness as TDA, but also performed better using an alternative classification algorithm, k-top scoring pairs.  Feature robustness can be used as a filtering technique without greatly impacting model performance and can also be used to evaluate model stability.</content>

 Propagating waves with complex dynamics have been widely observed in neural population activity. To understand their formation mechanisms, we investigate a type of two-dimensional neural field model by systematically varying its recurrent excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We show that the neural field model exhibits a rich repertoire of dynamical activity states when the relevant strength of excitation and inhibition is increased, ranging from localized rotating and traveling waves to global waves. Particularly, near the transition between stable states of rotating and traveling waves, the model exhibits a bistable state; that is, both the rotating and the travelling waves can exist, and the inclusion of noise can induce spontaneous transitions between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when there are multiple propagating waves, they exhibit rich collective propagation dynamics with variable propagating speeds and trajectories. We use techniques from time series analysis such detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the effect of the strength of excitation and inhibition on these collective dynamics, which range from purely random motion to motion with long-range spatiotemporal correlations. These results provide insights into the possible contribution of excitation and inhibition towards a range of previously observed spatiotemporal wave phenomena.</content>

 Myotonic dystrophy (Dystrophia Myotonica; DM) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy and brain symptoms seriously affect patient’s quality of life. The Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins are splicing factors regulating posttranscriptional RNA during development. Previously, Mbnl KO mouse lines showed molecular and phenotypic evidences that recapitulating DM brains, however, detail morphological study has not yet been accomplished. In our studies, control (Mbnl1+/+; Mbnl2cond/cond; Nestin-Cre-/-), Mbnl2 conditional knockout (2KO, Mbnl1+/+; Mbnl2cond/cond; Nestin-Cre+/-) and Mbnl1/2 DKO (DKO, Mbnl1ΔE3/ΔE3; Mbnl2cond/cond; Nestin-Cre+/-) mice were generated by crossing three individual lines. Immunohistochemistry for evaluating densities and distributions of cortical neurons; Golgi staining for depicting the dendrites/dendritic spines; and electron microscopy for analyzing postsynaptic ultrastructure were performed. We found migratory defects in cortical neurons, reduction in dendritic complexity, immature dendritic spines and alterations of postsynaptic densities in the mutants. In conclusion, loss of function of Mbnl1/2 caused fundamental defects affecting neuronal positioning during migration, dendritic morphology and postsynaptic architectures that are reminiscent of predominantly immature and fetal phenotypes in DM patients.</content>

 Neurons in the primate cortical area V4 have been recognized as being selective for intermediate-level visual features, including shape, texture, and color. But, there is no a priori reason why V4 neurons should respond to easily describable categories of visual stimuli. In a recent study Bashivan et al. (Science, 2019) used an artificial neural network to synthesize images that acted as ‘super-stimuli’ for recorded neurons in V4, pushing the boundaries of known neural responses in this brain region and raising broader questions about the potential for synergies between biological and artificial neural networks.</content>
