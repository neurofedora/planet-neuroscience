 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to drive many important neuroscientific advances. However, progress in uncovering reproducible associations between individual differences in brain structure/function and behavioral phenotypes (e.g., cognition, mental health) may have been undermined by typical neuroimaging sample sizes (median N=25)1,2. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study3 (N=11,878), we estimated the effect sizes and reproducibility of these brain wide associations studies (BWAS) as a function of sample size. The very largest, replicable brain wide associations for univariate and multivariate methods were r=0.14 and r=0.34, respectively. In smaller samples, typical for brain wide association studies, irreproducible, inflated effect sizes were ubiquitous, no matter the method (univariate, multivariate). Until sample sizes started to approach consortium levels, BWAS were underpowered and statistical errors assured. Multiple factors contribute to replication failures4,5,6; here, we show that the pairing of small brain behavioral phenotype effect sizes with sampling variability is a key element in widespread BWAS replication failure. Brain behavioral phenotype associations stabilize and become more reproducible with sample sizes of N&amp;gt;2,000. While investigator initiated brain behavior research continues to generate hypotheses and propel innovation, large consortia are needed to usher in a new era of reproducible human brain wide association studies.</content>

Management strategies for control of vector-borne diseases, for example Zika or dengue, include using larvicide and/or adulticide, either through large-scale application by truck or plane or through door-to-door efforts that require obtaining permission to access private property and spray yards. The efficacy of the latter strategy is highly dependent on the compliance of local residents. Here we develop a model for vector-borne disease transmission between mosquitoes and humans in a neighborhood setting, considering a network of houses connected via nearest-neighbor mosquito movement. We incorporate large-scale application of adulticide via aerial spraying through a uniform increase in vector death rates in all sites, and door-to-door application of larval source reduction and adulticide through a decrease in vector emergence rates and an increase in vector death rates in compliant sites only, where control efficacies are directly connected to real-world experimentally measurable control parameters, application frequencies, and control costs. To develop mechanistic insight into the influence of vector motion and compliance clustering on disease controllability, we determine the the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for the system, provide analytic results for the extreme cases of no mosquito movement, infinite hopping rates, and utilize degenerate perturbation theory for the case of slow but non-zero hopping rates. We then determine the application frequencies required for each strategy (alone and combined) in order to reduce &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to unity, along with the associated costs. Cost-optimal strategies are found to depend strongly on mosquito hopping rates, levels of door-to-door compliance, and spatial clustering of compliant houses, and can include aerial spray alone, door-to-door treatment alone, or a combination of both. The optimization scheme developed here provides a flexible tool for disease management planners which translates modeling results into actionable control advice adaptable to system-specific details.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5-4Cq1nPXDU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Tissue morphogenesis relies on repeated use of dynamic behaviors at the levels of intracellular structures, individual cells, and cell groups. Rapidly accumulating live imaging datasets make it increasingly important to formalize and automate the task of mapping recurrent dynamic behaviors (motifs), as it is done in speech recognition and other data mining applications. Here, we present a “template-based search” approach for accurate mapping of sub- to multi-cellular morphogenetic motifs using a time series data mining framework. We formulated the task of motif mapping as a subsequence matching problem and solved it using dynamic time warping, while relying on high throughput graph-theoretic algorithms for efficient exploration of the search space. This formulation allows our algorithm to accurately identify the complete duration of each instance and automatically label different stages throughout its progress, such as cell cycle phases during cell division. To illustrate our approach, we mapped cell intercalations during germband extension in the early &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo. Our framework enabled statistical analysis of intercalary cell behaviors in wild-type and mutant embryos, comparison of temporal dynamics in contracting and growing junctions in different genotypes, and the identification of a novel mode of iterative cell intercalation. Our formulation of tissue morphogenesis using time series opens new avenues for systematic decomposition of tissue morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TK83tSWZtVg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Shear stress induces directed endothelial cell (EC) migration in blood vessels leading to vessel diameter increase and induction of vascular maturation. Other factors, such as EC elongation and interaction between ECs and non-vascular areas are also important. Computational models have previously been used to study collective cell migration. These models can be used to predict EC migration and its effect on vascular remodelling during embryogenesis. We combined live time-lapse imaging of the remodelling vasculature of the quail embryo yolk sac with flow quantification using a combination of micro-Particle Image Velocimetry and computational fluid dynamics. We then used the flow and remodelling data to inform a model of EC migration during remodelling. To obtain the relation between shear stress and velocity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; for EC cells, we developed a flow chamber to assess how confluent sheets of ECs migrate in response to shear stress. Using these data as an input, we developed a multiphase, self-propelled particles (SPP) model where individual agents are driven to migrate based on the level of shear stress while maintaining appropriate spatial relationship to nearby agents. These agents elongate, interact with each other, and with avascular agents at each time-step of the model. We compared predicted vascular shape to real vascular shape after 4 hours from our time-lapse movies and performed sensitivity analysis on the various model parameters. Our model shows that shear stress has the largest effect on the remodelling process. Importantly, however, elongation played an especially important part in remodelling. This model provides a powerful tool to study the input of different biological processes on remodelling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jh8yMFKwZnU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genomic epidemiology can provide a unique, real-time understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. Yet the potential for genomic analyses to guide local policy and community-based behavioral decisions is limited because they are often oriented towards specially trained scientists and conducted on a national or global scale. Here, we propose a new paradigm: Phylogenetic analyses performed on a local level (municipal, county, or state), with results communicated in a clear, timely, and actionable manner to strengthen public health responses. We believe that presenting results rapidly, and tailored to a non-expert audience, can serve as a template for effective public health response to COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QU8piv4kS-E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

High levels of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide have been shown to disrupt neuronal function and induce hyperexcitability, but it is unclear what effects Aβ-associated hyperexcitability may have on tauopathy pathogenesis or propagation in vivo. Using a novel transgenic mouse line to model the impact of human APP (hAPP)/Aβ accumulation on tauopathy in the entorhinal cortex–hippocampal (EC-HIPP) network, we demonstrate that hAPP overexpression aggravates EC-Tau aggregation and accelerates pathological tau spread into the hippocampus. In vivo recordings revealed a strong role for hAPP/Aβ, but not tau, in the emergence of EC neuronal hyperactivity and impaired theta rhythmicity. Chronic chemogenetic attenuation of EC neuronal hyperactivity led to reduced hAPP/Aβ accumulation and reduced pathological tau spread into downstream hippocampus. These data strongly support the hypothesis that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Aβ-associated hyperactivity accelerates the progression of pathological tau along vulnerable neuronal circuits, and demonstrates the utility of chronic, neuromodulatory approaches in ameliorating AD pathology in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/72Wsaso3B-M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder and is suggested to be caused by central nervous system abnormalities. Non-invasive transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) was recently used for RLS therapy. However, the neurophysiological basis of tsDCS treatment is still unknown. In this study, we explored the neural basis of tsDCS in 15 RLS patients and 20 gender- and age-matched healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We calculated the whole-brain voxel-wise fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and weighted degree centrality (DC) to characterize the intrinsic functional activities, local and global functional integration. We found that tsDCS can effectively improve the sleep and RLS symptoms in RLS patients. Moreover, after tsDCS therapy, RLS patients showed decreased fALFF in right anterior insula/temporal pole, decreased ReHo in supplementary motor area, increased weighted DC in left primary visual cortex and decreased weighted DC in right posterior cerebellum. The changed patterns were consistent with that found between RLS patients and healthy controls. The weighted DC in left primary visual cortex after treatment and the fALFF in right anterior insula/temporal pole before treatment were significantly and marginally correlated with sleep and RLS symptom scores, respectively. These results revealed that tsDCS can normalize the functional patterns of the RLS patients and is an effective way for RLS therapy. Our findings provide the neurophysiological basis for tsDCS treatment and may facilitate understanding the neuropathology of RLS and directing other neuromodulation treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In recent years, machine learning has seen an increasing presencein a large
variety of fields, especially in health care and bioinformatics.More
specifically, the field where machine learning algorithms have found most
applications is Genetic Algorithms.The objective of this paper is to conduct a
survey of articles published from 2015 onwards that deal with Genetic
Algorithms(GA) and how they are used in bioinformatics.To achieve the
objective, a scoping review was conducted that utilized Google Scholar
alongside Publish or Perish and the Scimago Journal &amp;amp; CountryRank to search for
respectable sources. Upon analyzing 31 articles from the field of
bioinformatics, it became apparent that genetic algorithms rarely form a full
application, instead they rely on other vital algorithms such as support vector
machines.Indeed, support vector machines were the most prevalent algorithms
used alongside genetic algorithms; however, while the usage of such algorithms
contributes to the heavy focus on accuracy by GA programs, it often sidelines
computation times in the process. In fact, most applications employing GAs for
classification and feature selectionare nearing or at 100% success rate, and
the focus of future GA development should be directed elsewhere.
Population-based searches, like GA, are often combined with other machine
learning algorithms. In this scoping review, genetic algorithms combined with
Support Vector Machines were found to perform best. The performance metric that
was evaluated most often was accuracy. Measuring the accuracy avoids measuring
the main weakness of GAs, which is computational time. The future of genetic
algorithms could be open-ended evolutionary algorithms, which attempt to
increase complexity and find diverse solutions, rather than optimize a fitness
function and converge to a single best solution from the initial population of
solutions.

 &lt;p&gt;Prototype-based learning (PbL) using a winner-take-all (WTA) network based on
minimum Euclidean distance (ED-WTA) is an intuitive approach to multiclass
classification. By constructing meaningful class centers, PbL provides higher
interpretability and generalization than hyperplane-based learning (HbL)
methods based on maximum Inner Product (IP-WTA) and can efficiently detect and
reject samples that do not belong to any classes. In this paper, we first prove
the equivalence of IP-WTA and ED-WTA from a representational point of view.
Then, we show that naively using this equivalence leads to unintuitive ED-WTA
networks in which the centers have high distances to data that they represent.
We propose $\pm$ED-WTA which models each neuron with two prototypes: one
positive prototype representing samples that are modeled by this neuron and a
negative prototype representing the samples that are erroneously won by that
neuron during training. We propose a novel training algorithm for the
$\pm$ED-WTA network, which cleverly switches between updating the positive and
negative prototypes and is essential to the emergence of interpretable
prototypes. Unexpectedly, we observed that the negative prototype of each
neuron is indistinguishably similar to the positive one. The rationale behind
this observation is that the training data that are mistaken with a prototype
are indeed similar to it. The main finding of this paper is this interpretation
of the functionality of neurons as computing the difference between the
distances to a positive and a negative prototype, which is in agreement with
the BCM theory. In our experiments, we show that the proposed $\pm$ED-WTA
method constructs highly interpretable prototypes that can be successfully used
for detecting outlier and adversarial examples.

 &lt;p&gt;Many sensory pathways in the brain rely on sparsely active populations of
neurons downstream from the input stimuli. The biological reason for the
occurrence of expanded structure in the brain is unclear, but may be because
expansion can increase the expressive power of a neural network. In this work,
we show that expanding a neural network can improve its generalization
performance even in cases in which the expanded structure is pruned after the
learning period. To study this setting we use a teacher-student framework where
a perceptron teacher network generates labels which are corrupted with small
amounts of noise. We then train a student network that is structurally matched
to the teacher and can achieve optimal accuracy if given the teacher's synaptic
weights. We find that sparse expansion of the input of a student perceptron
network both increases its capacity and improves the generalization performance
of the network when learning a noisy rule from a teacher perceptron when these
expansions are pruned after learning. We find similar behavior when the
expanded units are stochastic and uncorrelated with the input and analyze this
network in the mean field limit. We show by solving the mean field equations
that the generalization error of the stochastic expanded student network
continues to drop as the size of the network increases. The improvement in
generalization performance occurs despite the increased complexity of the
student network relative to the teacher it is trying to learn. We show that
this effect is closely related to the addition of slack variables in artificial
neural networks and suggest possible implications for artificial and biological
neural networks.

 &lt;p&gt;We use an elementary argument building on group actions to prove that the
selection-free steady state genetic algorithm analyzed by Sutton and Witt
(GECCO 2019) takes an expected number of $\Omega(2^n / \sqrt n)$ iterations to
find any particular target search point, regardless of the population size
$\mu$. This improves over the previous best lower bound of
$\Omega(\exp(n^{\delta/2}))$ valid for population sizes $\mu = O(n^{1/2 -
\delta})$, $0 &amp;lt; \delta &amp;lt; 1/2$.

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-us">Comprehensive SNN Compression Using ADMM Optimization and Activity Regularization. (arXiv:1911.00822v3 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>

 &lt;p&gt;As well known, the huge memory and compute costs of both artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) greatly hinder their
deployment on edge devices with high efficiency. Model compression has been
proposed as a promising technique to improve the running efficiency via
parameter and operation reduction. Whereas, this technique is mainly practiced
in ANNs rather than SNNs. It is interesting to answer how much an SNN model can
be compressed without compromising its functionality, where two challenges
should be addressed: i) the accuracy of SNNs is usually sensitive to model
compression, which requires an accurate compression methodology; ii) the
computation of SNNs is event-driven rather than static, which produces an extra
compression dimension on dynamic spikes. To this end, we realize a
comprehensive SNN compression through three steps. First, we formulate the
connection pruning and weight quantization as a constrained optimization
problem. Second, we combine spatio-temporal backpropagation (STBP) and
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem with
minimum accuracy loss. Third, we further propose activity regularization to
reduce the spike events for fewer active operations. These methods can be
applied in either a single way for moderate compression or a joint way for
aggressive compression. We define several quantitative metrics to evaluation
the compression performance for SNNs. Our methodology is validated in pattern
recognition tasks over MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, where
extensive comparisons, analyses, and insights are provided. To our best
knowledge, this is the first work that studies SNN compression in a
comprehensive manner by exploiting all compressible components and achieves
better results.

 &lt;p&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have become competitive forecasting methods,
as most notably shown in the winning method of the recent M4 competition.
However, established statistical models such as ETS and ARIMA gain their
popularity not only from their high accuracy, but they are also suitable for
non-expert users as they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas,
RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and
an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for
forecasting, that allow us to develop guidelines and best practices for their
use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality
directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns,
otherwise we recommend a deseasonalization step. Comparisons against ETS and
ARIMA demonstrate that the implemented (semi-)automatic RNN models are no
silver bullets, but they are competitive alternatives in many situations.

Here the authors investigate amide-based electrolyte that lead to desirable interface species, resulting in dense Li-metal plating and top-down Li-metal stripping, responsible for the highly reversible cycling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/S1GEwHzhbQQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There are a pressing and unmet need for effective therapies for freezing of gait (FOG) and other neurological gait disorders. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a midbrain target known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) was proposed as a potential treatment based on its postulated involvement in locomotor control as part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). However, DBS trials fell short of expectations, leading many clinicians to abandon this strategy. Here, we discuss the potential reasons for this failure and review recent clinical data along with preclinical optogenetics evidence to argue that another nearby nucleus, the cuneiform nucleus (CnF), may be a superior target.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or any other dementia subtype. The renaissance in psychedelic research in recent years, in particular studies involving psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), coupled with anecdotal reports of cognitive benefits from micro-dosing, suggests that they may have a therapeutic role in a range of psychiatric and neurological conditions due to their potential to stimulate neurogenesis, provoke neuroplastic changes and reduce neuroinflammation. This inevitably makes them interesting candidates for therapeutics in dementia. This mini-review will look at the basic science and current clinical evidence for the role of psychedelics in treating dementia, especially early AD, with a particular focus on micro-dosing of the classical psychedelics LSD and psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Although the incidence of AD is high, the rates of diagnosis and treatment are relatively low. Moreover, effective means for the diagnosis and treatment of AD are still lacking. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are non-coding RNAs that play regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs. The expression of miRNAs is conserved, temporal, and tissue-specific. Impairment of microRNA function is closely related to AD pathogenesis, including the beta-amyloid and tau hallmarks of AD, and there is evidence that the expression of some microRNAs differs significantly between healthy people and AD patients. These properties of miRNAs endow them with potential diagnostic and therapeutic value in the treatment of this debilitating disease. This review provides comprehensive information about the regulatory function of miRNAs in AD, as well as potential applications as diagnostic biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The inability of individual neurons to compensate for aging-related damage leads to a gradual loss of functional plasticity in the brain accompanied by progressive impairment in learning and memory. Whereas this loss in neuroplasticity is gradual during normal aging, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), this loss is accelerated dramatically, leading to the incapacitation of patients within a decade of onset of cognitive symptoms. The mechanisms that underlie this accelerated loss of neuroplasticity in AD are still not completely understood. While the progressively increasing proteinopathy burden, such as amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, definitely contribute directly to a neuron’s functional demise, the role of non-neuronal cells in controlling neuroplasticity is slowly being recognized as another major factor. These non-neuronal cells include astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, which through regulating brain homeostasis, structural stability, and trophic support, play a key role in maintaining normal functioning and resilience of the neuronal network. It is believed that chronic signaling from these cells affects the homeostatic network of neuronal and non-neuronal cells to an extent to destabilize this harmonious milieu in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Here, we will examine the experimental evidence regarding the direct and indirect pathways through which astrocytes and microglia can alter brain plasticity in AD, specifically as they relate to the development and progression of tauopathy. In this review article, we describe the concepts of neuroplasticity and glial plasticity in healthy aging, delineate possible mechanisms underlying tau-induced plasticity dysfunction, and discuss current clinical trials as well as future disease-modifying approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There is increasing evidence that sex differences in the brain may contribute to gender-related behavioral differences, including cognitive function. Literature has revealed gender dimorphisms in cognitive function between males and females. Additionally, several risk factors associated with cognitive decline depend on chronological age. It is well recognized that the process of aging is associated with a decline in cognitive ability and brain function. Various explanations may account for these gender-related cognitive differences and age-associated cognitive changes. Recent investigations have highlighted the importance of vitamin C in maintaining brain health and its association with cognitive function in both cognitively intact and impaired cohorts. The present review explores previous literature that has evaluated differences in plasma/brain vitamin C between genders and during aging. It then assesses whether these age and gender-related differences may affect the relationship between plasma/brain vitamin C and cognition. The purpose of this review was to examine the evidence for a link between plasma/brain vitamin C and cognition and the impact of gender and age on this relationship. Epidemiological studies have frequently shown higher vitamin C plasma concentrations in women. Similarly, aging has been systematically associated with reductions in plasma vitamin C levels. A range of animal studies has demonstrated potential gender and age-related differences in vitamin C brain distribution and utilization. The reviewed literature suggests that gender differences in plasma and brain vitamin C may potentially contribute to differences in gender-associated cognitive ability, particularly while females are pre-menopausal. Additionally, we can propose that age-associated differences in plasma and brain vitamin C may be potentially linked to age-associated cognitive differences, with older cohorts appearing more vulnerable to experience declines in plasma vitamin C concentrations alongside compromised vitamin C brain regulation. This review encourages future investigations to take into account both gender and age when assessing the link between plasma vitamin C concentrations and cognitive function. Further large scale investigations are required to assess whether differences in cognitive function between genders and age groups may be causally attributed to plasma vitamin C status and brain distribution and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disorder due to loss of function of TSC1/TSC2 resulting in increased mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling. In the brain, TSC is characterized by the formation of specific lesions that include subependymal and white matter nodules and cortical tubers. Cells that constitute TSC lesions are mainly Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons and astrocytes, but normal cells also populate the tubers. Although considered as a developmental disorder, the histopathological features of brain lesions have been described in only a limited number of fetal cases, providing little information on how these lesions develop. In this report we characterized the development of TSC lesions in 14 fetal brains ranging from 19 gestational weeks (GW) to term and 2 postnatal cases. The study focused on the telencephalon at the level of the caudothalamic notch. Our data indicate that subcortical lesions, forming within and at the vicinity of germinative zones, are the first alterations (already detected in 19GW brains), characterized by the presence of numerous dysmorphic astrocytes and Giant, balloon-like, cells. Our data show that cortical tuber formation is a long process that initiates with the presence of dysmorphic astrocytes (by 19–21GW), progress with the apparition of Giant cells (by 24GW) and mature with the appearance of dysmorphic neurons by the end of gestation (by 36GW). Furthermore, the typical tuberal aspect of cortical lesions is only reached when bundles of neurofilament positive extensions delineate the bottom of the cortical lesion (by 36GW). In addition, our study reveals the presence of Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons immunopositive for interneuron markers such as calbindin and parvalbumin, suggesting that TSC lesions would be mosaic lesions generated from different classes of progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a part of the cerebellar neurodegenerative disease group that is diverse in genetics and phenotypes. It usually shows autosomal dominant inheritance. SCAs, always together with the cerebellar degeneration, may exhibit clinical deficits in brainstem or eye, especially retina or optic nerve. Interestingly, autosomal dominant SCAs share a common genetic mechanism; the length of the glutamine chain is abnormally expanded due to the increase in the cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) repeats of the disease causing gene. Studies have suggested that the mutant ataxin induces alteration of protein conformation and abnormal aggregation resulting in nuclear inclusions, and causes cellular loss of photoreceptors through a toxic effect. As a result, these pathologic changes induce a downregulation of genes involved in the phototransduction, development, and differentiation of photoreceptors such as CRX, one of the photoreceptor transcription factors. However, the exact mechanism of neuronal degeneration by mutant ataxin restricted to only certain type of neuronal cell including cerebellar Purkinje neurons and photoreceptor is still unclear. The most common SCAs are types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 which contain about 80% of autosomal dominant SCA cases. Various aspects of eye movement abnormalities are evident depending on the degree of cerebellar and brainstem degeneration in SCAs. In addition, certain types of SCAs such as SCA7 are characterized by both cerebellar ataxia and visual loss mainly due to retinal degeneration. The severity of the retinopathy can vary from occult macular photoreceptor disruption to extensive retinal atrophy and is correlated with the number of CAG repeats. The value of using optical coherence tomography in conjunction with electrodiagnostic and genetic testing is emphasized as the combination of these tests can provide critical information regarding the etiology, morphological evaluation, and functional significances. Therefore, ophthalmologists need to recognize and differentiate SCAs in order to properly diagnose and evaluate the disease. In this review, we have described and discussed SCAs showing ophthalmic abnormalities with particular attention to their ophthalmic features, neurodegenerative mechanisms, genetics, and future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective&lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether introducing gamification in BCI rehabilitation of the upper limbs of post-stroke patients has a positive impact on their experience without altering their efficacy in creating motor mental images (MI).&lt;/p&gt;Design&lt;p&gt;A game was designed purposely adapted to the pace and goals of an established BCI-rehabilitation protocol. Rehabilitation was based on a double feedback: functional electrostimulation and animation of a virtual avatar of the patient’s limbs. The game introduced a narrative on top of this visual feedback with an external goal to achieve (protecting bits of cheese from a rat character). A pilot study was performed with 10 patients and a control group of six volunteers. Two rehabilitation sessions were done, each made up of one stage of calibration and two training stages, some stages with the game and others without. The accuracy of the classification computed was taken as a measure to compare the efficacy of MI. Users’ opinions were gathered through a questionnaire. No potentially identifiable human images or data are presented in this study.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The gamified rehabilitation presented in the pilot study does not impact on the efficacy of MI, but it improves users experience making it more fun.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These preliminary results are encouraging to continue investigating how game narratives can be introduced in BCI rehabilitation to make it more gratifying and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Observation of a goal-directed motor action can excite the respective mirror neurons, and this is the theoretical basis for action observation (AO) as a novel tool for functional recovery during stroke rehabilitation. To explore the therapeutic potential of AO for dysphagia, we conducted a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to identify the brain areas activated during observation and execution of swallowing in healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine healthy volunteers viewed the following stimuli during fMRI scanning: an action-video of swallowing (condition 1, defined as AO), a neutral image with a Chinese word for “watching” (condition 2), and a neutral image with a Chinese word for “swallowing” (condition 3). Action execution (AE) was defined as condition 3 minus condition 2. One-sample t-tests were performed to define the brain regions activated during AO and AE.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Many brain regions were activated during AO, including the middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, hippocampus, brainstem, and pons. AE resulted in activation of motor areas as well as other brain areas, including the inferior parietal lobule, vermis, middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Two brain areas, BA6 and BA21, were activated with both AO and AE.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The left supplementary motor area (BA6) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA21), which contains mirror neurons, were activated in both AO and AE of swallowing. In this study, AO activated mirror neurons and the swallowing network in healthy participants, supporting its potential value in the treatment of dysphagia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study examines the atrophy patterns in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices of subjects that converted from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment. The regions were manually segmented from 3T MRI, then corrected for variability in boundary definition over time using an automated approach called longitudinal diffeomorphometry. Cortical thickness was calculated by deforming the gray matter-white matter boundary surface to the pial surface using an approach called normal geodesic flow. The surface was parcellated based on four atlases using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping. Average cortical thickness was calculated for (1) manually-defined entorhinal cortex, and (2) manually-defined transentorhinal cortex. Group-wise difference analysis was applied to determine where atrophy occurred, and change point analysis was applied to determine when atrophy started to occur. The results showed that by the time a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is made, the transentorhinal cortex and entorhinal cortex was up to 0.6 mm thinner than a control with normal cognition. A change point in atrophy rate was detected in the transentorhinal cortex 9–14 years prior to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, and in the entorhinal cortex 8–11 years prior. The findings are consistent with autopsy findings that demonstrate neuronal changes in the transentorhinal cortex before the entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Macular degeneration (MD) is one of the most frequent causes of visual deficit, resulting in alterations affecting not only the retina but also the entire visual pathway up to the brain areas. This would seem related not just to signal deprivation but also to a compensatory neuronal reorganization, having significant implications in terms of potential rehabilitation of the patient and therapeutic perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This paper aimed to outline, by analyzing the existing literature, the current understanding of brain structural and functional changes detected with neuroimaging techniques in subjects affected by juvenile and age-related maculopathy.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Articles using various typologies of central nervous system (CNS) imaging in at least six patients affected by juvenile or age-related maculopathy were considered. A total of 142 were initially screened. Non-pertinent articles and duplicates were rejected. Finally, 19 articles, including 649 patients, were identified.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In these sources, both structural and functional modifications were found in MD subjects’ CNS. Changes in visual cortex gray matter volume were observed in both age-related MD (AMD) and juvenile MD (JMD); in particular, an involvement of not only its posterior part but also the anterior one suggests further causes besides an input-deprivation mechanism only. White matter degeneration was also found, more severe in JMD than in AMD. Moreover, functional analysis revealed differences in cortical activation patterns between MD and controls, suggesting neuronal circuit reorganization. Interestingly, attention and oculomotor training allowed better visual performances and correlated to a stronger cortical activation, even of the area normally receiving inputs from lesioned macula.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In MD, structural and functional changes in cerebral circuits and visual pathway can happen, involving both cerebral volume and activation patterns. These modifications, possibly due to neuronal plasticity (already observed and described for several brain areas), can allow patients to compensate for macular damage and gives therapeutic perspectives which could be achievable through an association between oculomotor training and biochemical stimulation of neuronal plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;With recent technological advances in microscopy and image acquisition of tissue sections, further developments of tools are required for viewing, transforming, and analyzing the ever-increasing amounts of high-resolution data produced. In the field of neuroscience, histological images of whole rodent brain sections are commonly used for investigating brain connections as well as cellular and molecular organization in the normal and diseased brain, but present a problem for the typical neuroscientist with no or limited programming experience in terms of the pre- and post-processing steps needed for analysis. To meet this need we have designed Nutil, an open access and stand-alone executable software that enables automated transformations, post-processing, and analyses of 2D section images using multi-core processing (OpenMP). The software is written in C++ for efficiency, and provides the user with a clean and easy graphical user interface for specifying the input and output parameters. Nutil currently contains four separate tools: (1) A transformation toolchain named “Transform” that allows for rotation, mirroring and scaling, resizing, and renaming of very large tiled tiff images. (2) “TiffCreator” enables the generation of tiled TIFF images from other image formats such as PNG and JPEG. (3) A “Resize” tool completes the preprocessing toolset and allows downscaling of PNG and JPEG images with output in PNG format. (4) The fourth tool is a post-processing method called “Quantifier” that enables the quantification of segmented objects in the context of regions defined by brain atlas maps generated with the QuickNII software based on a 3D reference atlas (mouse or rat). The output consists of a set of report files, point cloud coordinate files for visualization in reference atlas space, and reference atlas images superimposed with color-coded objects. The Nutil software is made available by the Human Brain Project (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu) at https://www.nitrc.org/projects/nutil/.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: The ability to detect frequency variation is a fundamental skill necessary for speech perception. It is known that musical expertise is associated with a range of auditory perceptual skills, including discriminating frequency change, which suggests the neural encoding of spectral features can be enhanced by musical training. In this study, we measured auditory cortical responses to frequency change in musicians to examine the relationships between N1/P2 responses and behavioral performance/musical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Behavioral and electrophysiological data were obtained from professional musicians and age-matched non-musician participants. Behavioral data included frequency discrimination detection thresholds for no threshold-equalizing noise (TEN), +5, 0, and −5 signal-to-noise ratio settings. Auditory-evoked responses were measured using a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) system in response to frequency changes in ongoing pure tones consisting of 250 and 4,000 Hz, and the magnitudes of frequency change were 10%, 25% or 50% from the base frequencies. N1 and P2 amplitudes and latencies as well as dipole source activation in the left and right hemispheres were measured for each condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to the non-musician group, behavioral thresholds in the musician group were lower for frequency discrimination in quiet conditions only. The scalp-recorded N1 amplitudes were modulated as a function of frequency change. P2 amplitudes in the musician group were larger than in the non-musician group. Dipole source analysis showed that P2 dipole activity to frequency changes was lateralized to the right hemisphere, with greater activity in the musician group regardless of the hemisphere side. Additionally, N1 amplitudes to frequency changes were positively related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination while enhanced P2 amplitudes were associated with a longer duration of musical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that auditory cortical potentials evoked by frequency change are related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination in musicians. Larger P2 amplitudes in musicians compared to non-musicians reflects musical training-induced neural plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Many pieces of research have focused on pain within individuals, but little attention has been paid to whether pain can change an individual’s empathic ability and affect social relationships. The purpose of this study is to explore how chronic low back pain changes empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-four chronic low back pain patients and 22 healthy controls were recruited. We set up an experimental pain-exposed model for each healthy subject. All subjects received a painful-empathic magnetic resonance scan. After the scan, all subjects rated the pain intensity and multiple empathy-related indicators. The clinical assessment scale was the 20-item Basic Empathy Scale in Adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The chronic low back pain patients reported lower scores on the total scores of BES-A, the subscale scores of emotional disconnection and cognitive empathy, and the discomfort rating. The fMRI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were multiple abnormal brain pathways centered on the anterior insula. The DTI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were reduced fractional anisotropy values in the corpus callosum, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left anterior corona radiate (ACR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study found that patients with chronic low back pain have impaired empathy ability. The abnormal functional connectivity of multiple brain networks, multiple damaged white matter tracts, and the lower behavioral scores in chronic low back pain patients supported our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Glia, a non-excitable cell type once considered merely as the connective tissue between neurons, is nowadays acknowledged for its essential contribution to multiple physiological processes including learning, memory formation, excitability, synaptic plasticity, ion homeostasis, and energy metabolism. Moreover, as glia are key players in the brain immune system and provide structural and nutritional support for neurons, they are intimately involved in multiple neurological disorders. Recent advances have demonstrated that glial cells, specifically microglia and astroglia, are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While there is compelling evidence for glial modulation of synaptic formation and regulation that affect neuronal signal processing and activity, in this manuscript we will review recent findings on neuronal activity that affect glial function, specifically during neurodegenerative disorders. We will discuss the nature of each glial malfunction, its specificity to each disorder, overall contribution to the disease progression and assess its potential as a future therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Pericytes play a central role in regulating the structure and function of capillaries in the brain. However, molecular mechanisms that drive pericyte proliferation and differentiation are unclear. In our study, we immunostained NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-deficient and wild-type littermate mice and observed that NLRP3 deficiency reduced platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)-positive pericytes and collagen type IV immunoreactive vasculature in the brain. In Western blot analysis, PDGFRβ and CD13 proteins in isolated cerebral microvessels from the NLRP3-deficient mouse brain were decreased. We further treated cultured pericytes with NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, and demonstrated that NLRP3 inhibition attenuated cell proliferation but did not induce apoptosis. NLRP3 inhibition also decreased protein levels of PDGFRβ and CD13 in cultured pericytes. On the contrary, treatments with IL-1β, the major product of NLRP3-contained inflammasome, increased protein levels of PDGFRβ, and CD13 in cultured cells. The alteration of PDGFRβ and CD13 protein levels were correlated with the phosphorylation of AKT. Inhibition of AKT reduced both protein markers and abolished the effect of IL-1β activation in cultured pericytes. Thus, NLRP3 activation might be essential to maintain pericytes in the healthy brain through phosphorylating AKT. The potential adverse effects on the cerebral vascular pericytes should be considered in clinical therapies with NLRP3 inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Myelin facilitates the fast transmission of nerve impulses and provides metabolic support to axons. Differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and Schwann cell (SC) precursors is critical for myelination during development and myelin repair in demyelinating disorders. Myelination is tightly controlled by neuron-glia communication and requires the participation of a wide repertoire of signals, including neurotransmitters such as glutamate, ATP, adenosine, or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and it is also present in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The composition and function of GABA receptors (GABARs) are well studied in neurons, while their nature and role in glial cells are still incipient. Recent studies demonstrate that GABA-mediated signaling mechanisms play relevant roles in OPC and SC precursor development and function, and stand out the implication of GABARs in oligodendrocyte (OL) and SC maturation and myelination. In this review, we highlight the evidence supporting the novel role of GABA with an emphasis on the molecular identity of the receptors expressed in these glial cells and the possible signaling pathways involved in their actions. GABAergic signaling in myelinating cells may have potential implications for developing novel reparative therapies in demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) system plays a role in many physiological processes including reproduction and lactation. However, research regarding the function of MCH on different aspects of the reproductive function lags, due in part to a lack of validated genetic models with which to interrogate the system. This is particularly true in the case of female reproduction, as the anatomy and function of the MCH system is not well-characterized in the female mouse. We set out to determine whether the commercially available Pmch-Cre transgenic mouse line is a viable model to study the role of MCH neurons in distinct female reproductive states. We found that Pmch is transiently expressed in several nuclei of the rostral forebrain at the end of lactation. This includes the medial subdivision of the medial preoptic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the ventral subdivision of the lateral septum, the anterodorsal preoptic nucleus and the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. The Pmch expression in these sites, however, does not reliably induce Cre expression in the Pmch-Cre (BAC) transgenic mouse, making this line an inadequate model with which to study the role of MCH in behavioral and/or neuroendocrine adaptations of lactation. We also contribute to the general knowledge of the anatomy of the murine MCH system by showing that lactation-induced Pmch expression in the rostral forebrain is mostly observed in GABAergic (VGAT) neurons, in contrast to the typical MCH neurons of the tuberal and posterior hypothalamus which are glutamatergic (VGLUT2).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The high synaptic density in the nervous system results from the ability of neurites to branch. Neuronal cell surface molecules play central roles during neurite branch formation. The underlying mechanisms of surface molecule activity have often been elucidated using invertebrates with simple nervous systems. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurite branching in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We discuss how cell surface receptor complexes link to and modulate actin dynamics to regulate dendritic and axonal branch formation. The mechanisms of neurite branching are often coupled with other neural circuit developmental processes, such as synapse formation and axon guidance, via the same cell-cell surface molecular interactions. We also cover ectopic and sex-specific neurite branching in C. elegans in an attempt to illustrate the importance of these studies in contributing to our understanding of conserved cell surface molecule regulation of neurite branch formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The evolution of the brain in apes and man followed a joint pathway stemming from common ancestors 5–10 million years ago. However, although apparently sharing similar organization and neurochemical properties, association areas of the isocortex remain one of the cornerstones of what sets humans aside from other primates. Brodmann’s area 44, the area of Broca, is known for its implication in speech, and thus indirectly is a key mark of human uniqueness. This latero-caudal part of the frontal lobe shows a marked functional asymmetry in humans, and takes part in other complex functions, including learning and imitation, tool use, music and contains the mirror neuron system (MNS). Since the main features in the cytoarchitecture of Broca’s area remains relatively constant in hominids, including in our closest relative, the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, investigations on the finer structure, cellular organization, connectivity and eventual asymmetry of area 44 have a direct bearing on the understanding of the neural mechanisms at the base of our language. The semi-automated image analysis technology that we employed in the current study showed that the structure of the cortical layers of the chimpanzee contains elements of asymmetry that are discussed in relation to the corresponding human areas and the putative resulting disparity of function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The melanocortin system is a key neuroendocrine network involved in the control of food intake and energy homeostasis in vertebrates. Within the hypothalamus, the system comprises two main distinct neuronal cell populations that express the neuropeptides proopiomelanocortin (POMC; anorexigenic) or agouti-related protein (AGRP; orexigenic). Both bind to the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) in higher order neurons that control both food intake and energy expenditure. This system is relatively well-conserved among vertebrates. However, in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), the salmonid-specific fourth round whole-genome duplication led to the presence of several paralog genes which might result in divergent functions of the duplicated genes. In the current study, we report the first comprehensive comparative identification and characterization of Mc4r and extend the knowledge of Pomc and Agrp in appetite control in Atlantic salmon. In silico analysis revealed multiple paralogs for mc4r (a1, a2, b1, and b2) in the Atlantic salmon genome and confirmed the paralogs previously described for pomc (a1, a2, and b) and agrp (1 and 2). All Mc4r paralogs are relatively well-conserved with the human homolog, sharing at least 63% amino acid sequence identity. We analyzed the mRNA expression of mc4r, pomc, and agrp genes in eight brain regions of Atlantic salmon post-smolt under two feeding states: normally fed and fasted for 4 days. The mc4ra2 and b1 mRNAs were predominantly and equally abundant in the hypothalamus and telencephalon, the mc4rb2 in the hypothalamus, and a1 in the telencephalon. All pomc genes were highly expressed in the pituitary, followed by the hypothalamus and saccus vasculosus. The agrp genes showed a completely different expression pattern from each other, with prevalent expression of the agrp1 in the hypothalamus and agrp2 in the telencephalon. Fasting did not induce any significant changes in the mRNA level of mc4r, agrp, or pomc paralogs in the hypothalamus or in other highly expressed regions between fed and fasted states. The identification and wide distribution of multiple paralogs of mc4r, pomc, and agrp in Atlantic salmon brain provide new insights and give rise to new questions of the melanocortin system in the appetite regulation in Atlantic salmon.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The microtubule-associated protein tau is closely correlated with hypometabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). α-lipoic acid (LA), which is a naturally occurring cofactor in mitochondrial, has been shown to have properties that can inhibit the tau pathology and neuronal damage in our previous research. However, if LA affects glucose metabolism when it reverses tau pathology remains unclear, especially concerning the potential mechanism. Therefore, we make a further study using the P301S mouse model (a tauopathy and AD mouse model which overexpressing fibrillary tau) to gain a clear idea of the aforementioned problems. Here, we found chronic LA administration significantly increased glucose availability by elevating glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), GLUT4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein and mRNA level, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein level in P301S mouse brains. Meanwhile, we found that LA also promoted glycolysis by directly upregulating hexokinase (HK) activity, indirectly by increasing proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and DNA repair enzymes (OGG1/2 and MTH1). Further, we found the underlying mechanism of restored glucose metabolism might involve in the activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine Kinase receptor B (TrkB)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway by LA treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive impairment and later dementia among the elderly. Mounting evidence shows that adverse maternal environments during the fetal development increase the risk of diseases later in life including neurological disorders, and suggests an early origin in the development of AD-related dementia (ADRD) in utero. In the present study, we investigated the impact of antenatal hypoxia and fetal stress on the initiation of AD-related pathology in offspring of 5xFAD mice. We showed that fetal hypoxia significantly reduced brain and body weight in the fetal and the early postnatal period, which recovered in young adult mice. Using spontaneous Y-maze, novel object recognition (NOR), and open field (OF) tasks, we found that antenatal hypoxia exacerbated cognitive decline in offspring of 5xFAD compared with normoxia control. Of interest, fetal hypoxia did not alter intraneuronal soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomer accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus in 5xFAD mouse offspring, indicating that antenatal hypoxia increased the vulnerability of the brain to synaptotoxic Aβ in the disease onset later in life. Consistent with the early occurrence of cognitive decline, we found synapse loss but not neuronal death in the cerebral cortex in 5xFAD but not wild-type (WT) offspring exposed to antenatal hypoxia. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that antenatal hypoxia significantly increased microglial number and activation, and reactive astrogliosis in the cerebral cortex in WT offspring. Moreover, antenatal hypoxia resulted in an exacerbated increase of microgliosis and astrogliosis in the early stage of AD in 5xFAD offspring. Together, our study reveals a causative link between fetal stress and the accelerated onset of AD-related pathology, and provides mechanistic insights into the developmental origin of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence indicates Chronic Periodontitis (CP) is a comorbidity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the most common form of age-related dementia, and for the latter, effective diagnostic and treatment strategies are lacking. Although inflammation is present in both diseases, the exact mechanisms and cross-links between CP and AD are poorly understood; and a direct association between the two has not been reported. This study aimed to identify a direct serum proteins link between AD and CP. Two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis was employed to analyze serum samples from 12 CP patients and 12 age-matched controls. Furthermore, to determine the molecular link between CP and AD, neuroblastoma SK-N-SH APPwt cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g-LPS). Ten differentially expressed proteins were identified in CP patients. Among them, nine proteins were up-regulated, and one protein was down-regulated. Of the 10 differentially expressed proteins, five proteins were reportedly involved in the pathology of AD: Cofilin-2, Cathepsin B, Clusterin, Triosephosphate isomerase, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITI-H4). Western blotting indicated significantly higher expression of Cofilin-2, Cathepsin B, and Clusterin and lower expression of ITI-H4 in the CP group than in the Control group. The serum concentration of Cathepsin B has a good correlation with MMSE scores. Moreover, the protein level of Cathepsin B (but not that of ADAM10 and BACE1) increased significantly along with a prominent increase in Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in the cell lysates of P.g-LPS-treated SK-N-SH APPwt cells. Cathepsin B inhibition resulted in a sharp decrease in Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in the cell lysates. Furthermore, TNF-α was one of the most important inflammatory cytokines for the P.g-LPS-induced Cathepsin B upregulation in SK-N-SH APPwt cells. These results show that CP and AD share an association, while Cathepsin B could be a key link between the two diseases. The discovery of the identical serum proteins provides a potential mechanism underlying the increased risk of AD in CP patients, which could be critical for elucidating the pathophysiology of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 We conducted voluntary Covid-19 testing programmes for symptomatic and asymptomatic staff at a UK teaching hospital using naso-/oro-pharyngeal PCR testing and immunoassays for IgG antibodies. 1128/10,034(11.2%) staff had evidence of Covid-19 at some time. Using questionnaire data provided on potential risk-factors, staff with a confirmed household contact were at greatest risk (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.82 [95%CI 3.45-6.72]). Higher rates of Covid-19 were seen in staff working in Covid-19-facing areas (22.6% vs. 8.6% elsewhere) (aOR 2.47 [1.99-3.08]). Controlling for Covid-19-facing status, risks were heterogenous across the hospital, with higher rates in acute medicine (1.52 [1.07-2.16]) and sporadic outbreaks in areas with few or no Covid-19 patients. Covid-19 intensive care unit staff were relatively protected (0.44 [0.28-0.69]), likely by a bundle of PPE-related measures. Positive results were more likely in Black (1.66 [1.25-2.21]) and Asian (1.51 [1.28-1.77]) staff, independent of role or working location, and in porters and cleaners (2.06 [1.34-3.15]).</content>

 Sensory systems constantly compare external sensory information with internally generated predictions. While neural hallmarks of prediction errors have been found throughout the brain, the circuit-level mechanisms that underlie their computation are still largely unknown. Here, we show that a well-orchestrated interplay of three interneuron types shapes the development and refinement of negative prediction-error neurons in a computational model of mouse primary visual cortex. By balancing excitation and inhibition in multiple pathways, experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity can generate different variants of prediction-error circuits, which can be distinguished by simulated optogenetic experiments. The experience-dependence of the model circuit is consistent with that of negative prediction-error circuits in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex. Our model makes a range of testable predictions that may shed light on the circuitry underlying the neural computation of prediction errors.</content>

 Membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains play critical roles in cell physiology, but little is known about the machinery coordinating their biogenesis at the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we describe a ~360 kDa ribosome-associated complex comprising the core Sec61 channel and five accessory factors: TMCO1, CCDC47 and the Nicalin-TMEM147-NOMO complex. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals a large assembly at the ribosome exit tunnel organized around a central membrane cavity. Similar to protein-conducting channels that facilitate movement of transmembrane segments, cytosolic and luminal funnels in TMCO1 and TMEM147, respectively, suggest routes into the central membrane cavity. High-throughput mRNA sequencing shows selective translocon engagement with hundreds of different multi-pass membrane proteins. Consistent with a role in multi-pass membrane protein biogenesis, cells lacking different accessory components show reduced levels of one such client, the glutamate transporter EAAT1. These results identify a new human translocon and provide a molecular framework for understanding its role in multi-pass membrane protein biogenesis.</content>

 The β-catenin transcriptional coregulator is involved in various biological and pathological processes; however, its requirements in hematopoietic cells remain controversial. We re-targeted the &lt;i&gt;Ctnnb1&lt;/i&gt; gene locus to generate a true β-catenin-null mutant mouse strain. Ablation of β-catenin alone, or in combination with its homologue γ-catenin, did not affect thymocyte maturation, survival or proliferation. Deficiency in β/γ-catenin did not detectably affect differentiation of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T follicular helper cells or that of effector and memory CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cytotoxic cells in response to acute viral infection. In an MLL-AF9 AML mouse model, genetic deletion of β-catenin, or even all four Tcf/Lef family transcription factors that interact with β-catenin, did not affect AML onset in primary recipients, or the ability of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in propagating AML in secondary recipients. Our data thus clarify on a long-standing controversy and indicate that β-catenin is dispensable for T cells and AML LSCs.</content>

 Cellular senescence is a contributor to intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and low back pain. Here, we found that RG-7112, a potent mouse double-minute two protein inhibitor, selectively kills senescent IVD cells through apoptosis. Gene expression pathway analysis was used to compare the functional networks of genes affected by RG-7112, a pure synthetic senolytic with o-Vanillin a natural and anti-inflammatory senolytic. Both affected a functional gene network related to cell death and survival. O-Vanillin also affected networks related to cell cycle progression as well as connective tissue development and function. Both senolytics effectively decreased the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of IVD cells. Furthermore, bioavailability and efficacy were verified ex vivo in the physiological environment of degenerating intact human discs where a single dose improved disc matrix homeostasis. Matrix improvement correlated with a reduction in senescent cells and SASP, supporting a translational potential of targeting senescent cells as a therapeutic intervention.</content>

 The human cortex is characterized by local morphological features such as cortical thickness, myelin content, and gene expression that change along the posterior-anterior axis. We investigated if some of these structural gradients are associated with a similar gradient in a prominent feature of brain activity - namely the frequency of oscillations. In resting-state MEG recordings from healthy participants (N=187) using mixed effect models, we found that the dominant peak frequency in a brain area decreases significantly along the posterior-anterior axis following the global hierarchy from early sensory to higher-order areas. This spatial gradient of peak frequency was significantly anticorrelated with that of cortical thickness, representing a proxy of the cortical hierarchical level. This result indicates that the dominant frequency changes systematically and globally along the spatial and hierarchical gradients and establishes a new structure-function relationship pertaining to brain oscillations as a core organization that may underlie hierarchical specialization in the brain</content>

 Sensory neurons are activated by physical and chemical stimuli, eliciting sensations such as temperature, touch, pain, and itch. From an evolutionary perspective, sensing danger is essential for organismal survival. Upon infection and injury, immune cells respond to pathogen/damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and produce inflammatory mediators that activate sensory neurons through neuro–immune interactions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 At tripartite synapses, astrocytes surround synaptic contacts, but how astrocytes contribute to the assembly and function of synapses remains unclear. Here we show that neurexin-1, a presynaptic adhesion molecule that controls synapse properties, is also abundantly expressed by astrocytes. Strikingly, astrocytic neurexin-1, but not neuronal neurexin-1, is highly modified by heparan sulfate. Moreover, astrocytic neurexin-1 is uniquely alternatively spliced and invariably contains an insert in splice-site #4, thereby restricting the range of ligands to which it binds. Deletion of neurexin-1 from astrocytes or neurons does not alter synapse numbers or synapse ultrastructure, but differentially impairs synapse function. At hippocampal Schaffer-collateral synapses, neuronal neurexin-1 is essential for normal NMDA-receptor-mediated synaptic responses, whereas astrocytic neurexin-1 is required for normal AMPA-receptor-mediated synaptic responses and for long-term potentiation of these responses. Thus, astrocytes directly shape synapse properties via a neurexin-1-dependent mechanism that involves a specific molecular program distinct from that of neuronal neurexin-1.</content>

 Type I lissencephaly is a neuronal migration disorder caused by haploinsuffiency of the LIS1 gene and is characterized in humans by agyria, mislamination of brain structures, developmental delays, and epilepsy. Here, we investigate the impact of LIS1 mutation on the cellular migration, morphophysiology, microcircuitry and genomics of mouse hippocampal CA1 parvalbumin-containing inhibitory interneurons (PV+INTs). We find that WT PV+INTs consist of two physiological subtypes (80% fast-spiking (FS), 20% non-fast-spiking (NFS)) and four morphological subtypes (basket, axo-axonic, bistratified, radiatum-targeting). We also discover that cell-autonomous mutations within interneurons disrupts morphological development of PV+INTs and results in the emergence of a non-canonical 'intermediate spiking (IS)' subset of PV+INTs. In the GlobalLis mutant, IS/NFS cells become the dominant PV+INT subtypes (56%) and the percentage of FS cells shrinks to 44%. We also find that IS/NFS cells are prone to entering depolarizing block, causing them to temporarily lose the ability to initiate action potentials and control network excitation, potentially promoting seizures. Finally, single-cell nuclear RNAsequencing of PV+INTs revealed several misregulated genes related to morphogenesis, cellular excitability, and synapse formation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 How does the brain change during learning? Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have used both pattern analysis and repetition suppression (RS) to detect changes in neuronal representations. In the context of motor sequence learning, the two techniques have provided discrepant findings. Specifically, pattern analysis showed that only premotor and parietal regions, but not primary motor cortex (M1), develop a representation of trained sequences. In contrast, RS suggested trained sequence representations in all these regions. Here we applied both analysis techniques to data from a 5-week finger sequence training study, in which participants executed each sequence twice before switching to a different sequence. While we replicated both previously reported findings in the same paradigm, a more fine-grained analysis revealed that the RS effect in M1 and parietal areas reflect fundamentally different processes. On the first execution, M1 represents especially the first finger of each sequence, which might reflect preparatory processes, and this effect dramatically reduces during the second execution. In contrast, parietal areas represent the identity of a sequence, and this representation stays relatively stable on the second execution, only reducing proportionally to the reduction in overall activity. These results suggest that the RS effect in M1 does not reflect trained sequence representation, but rather the altered communication with higher-order areas. More generally, our study demonstrates that RS can reflect different representational changes in the underlying neuronal population code across regions, emphasizing the importance of combining pattern analysis and RS techniques.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Adaptive cognition is fostered by knowledge about the structure and value of our environment. Here, we hypothesize that these two kinds of information are inherently intertwined as affective schemas in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Schemas (e.g., of a social network) emerge by extracting commonalities across experiences and can be understood as graphs comprising nodes (e.g., people) and edges (e.g., their relationships). We sampled information about unique real-life environments (i.e., about personally familiar people and places) and probed their neural representations with fMRI. Using representational similarity analysis, we show that the mPFC encodes both, the nodes and the edges of the schema. Critically, the strength of the edges is not only determined by experience and centrality of a given node but also by its affective value. We thus account for the involvement of the mPFC in seemingly disparate functions and suggest that valuation emerges naturally from encoded memory representations.</content>

 Synaptic plasticity is a cellular model for learning and memory. However, the expression mechanisms underlying presynaptic forms of plasticity are not well understood. Here, we investigate functional and structural correlates of long-term potentiation at large hippocampal mossy fiber boutons induced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. We performed two-photon imaging of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGlu u that revealed an increase in the surface area used for glutamate release at potentiated terminals. Moreover, time-gated stimulated emission depletion microscopy revealed no change in the coupling distance between immunofluorescence signals from calcium channels and release sites. Finally, by high-pressure freezing and transmission electron microscopy analysis, we found a fast remodeling of synaptic ultrastructure at potentiated boutons : synaptic vesicles dispersed in the terminal and accumulated at the active zones, while active zone density and synaptic complexity increased. We suggest that these rapid and early structural rearrangements likely enable long-term increase in synaptic strength.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Theta and alpha frequency neural oscillations are important for learning and cognitive control, but their exact role has remained obscure. In particular, it is unknown whether they operate at similar timescales, and whether they support different cognitive processes. We recorded EEG in 30 healthy human participants while they performed a procedural learning task containing both (block-unique) novel and repeating stimuli. Learning occurred at two timescales (fast and slow). Behaviorally, both response time and accuracy improved (resp. decrease and increase) over both fast and slow timescales. However, on the spectral level, theta power significantly decreased along the slow timescale, whereas alpha power instead significantly increased along the fast timescale. We thus demonstrate that theta and alpha both play a role during learning, but operate at different timescales. This result poses important empirical constraints for theories on learning, cognitive control, and neural oscillations.</content>

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Predominantly, misfolding and aggregation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides associated with multifaceted toxicity is the neuropathological hallmark of AD pathogenesis and thus, primary therapeutic target to ameliorate neuronal toxicity and cognitive deficits. Herein, we report the design, synthesis and evaluation of small molecule inhibitors with naphthalene monoimide scaffold to ameliorate in vitro and in vivo amyloid induced neurotoxicity. The detailed studies established TGR63 as the lead candidate to rescue neuronal cells from amyloid toxicity. The in silico studies showed disruption of salt bridges and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions within A{beta}42 fibrils by the interaction of TGR63, causing destabilization of A{beta}42 assembly. Remarkably, TGR63 treatment showed a significant reduction in cortical and hippocampal amyloid burden in the progressive stages of APP/PS1 AD mice brain. Various behavioral tests demonstrated rescued cognitive deficits. The excellent biocompatibility, BBB permeability and therapeutic efficacy to reduce amyloid burden make TGR63 a promising candidate for the treatment of AD.</content>

 Neuronal activity can influence the generation of new oligodendrocytes (oligodendrogenesis) and myelination. In health, this is an adaptive process that can increase synchrony within distributed neuronal networks and contribute to cognitive function. We hypothesized that in seizure disorders, aberrant neuronal activity may promote maladaptive myelination that contributes to pathogenesis. Absence epilepsy is a disease defined by increasingly frequent behavioral arrest seizures over time, thought to be due to thalamocortical network hypersynchrony. We tested the hypothesis that activity-dependent myelination resulting from absence seizures promotes epileptogenesis. Using two distinct models of absence epilepsy, Wag/Rij rats and Scn8a+/mut mice, we found increased oligodendrogenesis and myelination specifically within the absence seizure network. These changes are evident only after seizure onset in both models and are prevented with pharmacological inhibition of seizures. Genetic blockade of activity-dependent myelination during epileptogenesis markedly decreased seizure frequency in the Scn8a+/mut mouse model of absence epilepsy. Taken together, these findings indicate that activity-dependent myelination driven by absence seizures contributes to seizure kindling during epileptogenesis.</content>

 Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leads primarily to respiratory symptoms that can be fatal, particularly in at risk individuals. However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in patients, including headache, seizures, stroke, and fatigue. The cause of these complications is not yet known, and whether they are due to a direct infection of neural cells, such as neurons and astrocytes, or through indirect effects on supportive brain cells, is unknown. Here, we use brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We examine expression of the key viral receptor ACE2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealing that only a subset of choroid plexus cells but not neurons or neural progenitors express this entry factor. We then challenge organoids with both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate high viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but not stromal cells, and little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells of the choroid plexus are an apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing subset of epithelial barrier cells. Finally, we show that infection with live SARS-CoV-2 leads to barrier breakdown of the choroid plexus. These findings suggest that neurological complications may result from effects on the choroid plexus, an important barrier that normally prevents entry of immune cells and cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.</content>

 Human brains interpret external stimuli based on internal representations. One untested hypothesis is that the default-mode network (DMN) while responsible for internally oriented cognition can also encode externally oriented information. The unique neuroanatomical and functional fingerprint of the posterior part of the DMN supports a prominent role for the precuneus in this process. By utilising imaging data during two tasks from 100 participants, we found that the precuneus is functionally divided into dorsal and ventral subdivisions, each one differentially connecting to internally and externally oriented networks. The strength and direction of their connectivity is modulated by task difficulty in a manner dictated by the balance of internal versus external cognitive demands. Our study provides evidence that the medial posterior part of the DMN may drive interactions between large-scale networks, potentially allowing access to stored representations for moment to moment interpretation of an everchanging environment.</content>

 Interruptions (secondary tasks) have been frequently investigated in behavioral studies leading to a deterioration of working memory performance. Yet, the underlying attentional control processes are not sufficiently understood. A lateralized working memory task was frequently interrupted by either a high- or low-demanding arithmetic task and a subsequent retroactive cue indicated the working memory item required for later report. We examined the role of frontal theta (4-7 Hz) and posterior alpha power (8-14 Hz) as correlates for retroactive attentional switches between working memory representations. In particular, highly demanding interruptions decreased primary task performance compared to a control condition without interruption. This was also reflected in decreased frontal theta power and higher posterior alpha power after retro-cue presentation, suggesting decreased attentional control resources. Moreover, reduced alpha lateralization indicated an impaired refocusing on primary task information following the interruption. These results highlight oscillatory mechanisms required for successfully handling the detrimental effects of interruptions.</content>

 Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures neuromagnetic activity with high temporal, and theoretically, high spatial resolution. However, the ability of magnetic source imaging (MSI) to localize deep sources is uncertain. We developed an experimental platform combining MEG-compatible optogenetic techniques in non-human primates (NHPs) to test the ability of MEG/MSI to image deep signals. We demonstrate localization of optogenetically-evoked signals to known sources in the superficial arcuate sulcus of cortex and in CA3 of hippocampus at a resolution of 750 m3. In response to stimulation of arcuate sulcus and hippocampus, we detected activation in subcortical and thalamic structures, or extended temporal networks, respectively. This is the first demonstration of accurate localization of deep sources within an intact brain using a novel combination of optogenetics with MEG/MSI. This approach is suitable for exploring causal relationships between discrete brain regions through precise optogenetic control and simultaneous whole brain recording.</content>

 Cortical neural dynamics organizes over multiple anatomical and temporal scales. The mechanistic origin of the temporal organization and its contribution to cognition remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that a temporal signature (autocorrelogram time constant and latency) of neural activity enlightens this organization. In monkey frontal areas, recorded during flexible cognitive decisions, temporal signatures display highly specific area-dependent ranges, as well as anatomical and cell-type distributions. Moreover, temporal signatures are functionally adapted to behaviorally relevant timescales. Fine-grained biophysical network models, constrained to account for temporal signatures, reveal that after-hyperpolarization potassium and inhibitory GABA-B conductances critically determine areas specificity. They mechanistically account for temporal signatures by organizing activity into metastable states, with inhibition controlling state stability and transitions. As predicted by models, state durations non-linearly scale with temporal signatures in monkey, matching behavioral timescales. Thus, local inhibitory-controlled metastability constitutes the dynamical core specifying the temporal organization of cognitive functions in frontal areas.</content>

 The capacity of utilizing past experience to guide future action is a fundamental and conserved function of the nervous system. Associative memory formation initiated by the coincident detection of a conditioned stimulus (CS, e.g. odour) and an unconditioned stimulus (US, e.g. sugar reward) can lead to a short-lived memory trace (STM) within distinct circuits. Memories can be consolidated into long-term memories (LTM) through processes that are not fully understood, but depend on de-novo protein synthesis, require structural modifications within the involved neuronal circuits and might lead to the recruitment of additional ones. Compared to modulation of existing connections, the reorganization of circuits affords the unique possibility of sampling for potential new partners. Nonetheless, only few examples of rewiring associated with learning have been established thus far. Here, we report that memory consolidation is associated with the structural and functional reorganization of an identified circuit in the adult fly brain. The formation and retrieval of olfactory associative memories in Drosophila requires the mushroom body (MB). We identified the individual synapses of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) that deliver a conditioned odour to the MB and reconstructed the complexity of the microcircuit they form. Combining behavioural experiments with high-resolution microscopy and functional imaging, we demonstrated that the consolidation of appetitive olfactory memories closely correlates with an increase in the number of synaptic complexes formed by the PNs that deliver the conditioned stimulus and their postsynaptic partners. These structural changes result in additional functional synaptic connections.</content>

 The polybasic juxtamembrane region (5RK) of the plasma membrane neuronal SNARE, syntaxin1A (Syx), was shown by us to act as a fusion clamp in PC12 cells, making release dependent on stimulation by Ca2+. By using a Syx-based FRET probe, we demonstrated that 5RK is absolutely required for a depolarization-induced Ca+2-dependent, close-to-open transition (CDO) of Syx that involves the vesicular SNARE synaptobrevin2 and occurs concomitantly with Ca2+-triggered release. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the 5RK requirement, and identified phosphorylation of Syx at Ser-14 (S14) by protein kinase CK2 as a crucial molecular determinant. Following biochemical verification that both endogenous Syx and CSYS are constitutively S14 phosphorylated in PC12 cells, dynamic FRET analysis of phospho-null and phospho-mimetic mutants of CSYS and the use of a CK2 inhibitor revealed that it is the S14 phosphorylation that confers the 5RK requirement. Concomitant amperometric analysis of catecholamine release revealed that the phospho-null mutants do not support release, spontaneous and evoked. Collectively, these results identify a functionally important CK2 phosphorylation site in Syx that is required for 5RK-regulation of CDO and for concomitant Ca2+-triggered release.</content>

 Despite variations in appearance we robustly recognize objects. Neuronal populations responding to objects presented under varying conditions form object manifolds and hierarchically organized visual areas are thought to untangle pixel intensities into linearly decodable object representations. However, the associated changes in the geometry of object manifolds along the cortex remain unknown. Using home cage training we showed that mice are capable of invariant object recognition. We simultaneously recorded the responses of thousands of neurons to measure the information about object identity available across the visual cortex and found that lateral visual areas LM, LI and AL carry more linearly decodable object identity information compared to other visual areas. We applied the theory of linear separability of manifolds, and found that the increase in classification capacity is associated with a decrease in the dimension and radius of the object manifold, identifying features of the population code that enable invariant object coding.</content>

 Optogenetics, the genetic incorporation of light-sensitive proteins such as Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) into target mammalian neurons, has enabled activation, silencing, and receptor subtype specific neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, the essential components of the ontogenetic system require invasive procedures with very few non-invasive alternatives preventing its use as a translational tool. The implantation of light emitting fibers deep within brain structures is both technically demanding and causes tissue scarring in target brain regions. To overcome these limitations, while maintaining the highly-tuned components of optogenetics we have developed a novel noninvasive alternative. Our approach replaces fibers with light-emitting radioluminescent particles (RLPs) that can be activated non-invasively with X-ray exposure. Here, we report successful noninvasive delivery of RLPs to target brain regions using MRI-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) blood brain barrier opening. In addition, FUS BBBO can be used to deliver viral vectors for light sensitive channel expression. Combined, these components can provide a completely non-invasive optogenetic system.</content>

Oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) delivery facilitated by hemoglobin (Hb)-based O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carriers (HBOCs) is a promising strategy to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics for treatment of solid tumors. However, the heterogeneous vascular structures present within tumors complicates evaluating the oxygenation potential of HBOCs within the tumor microenvironment. To account for spatial variations in the vasculature and tumor tissue that occur during tumor growth, we used a computational model to develop artificial tumor constructs. With these simulated tumors, we performed a polymerized human hemoglobin (hHb) (PolyhHb) enhanced oxygenation simulation accounting for differences in the physiologic characteristics of human and mouse blood. The results from this model were used to determine the potential effectiveness of different treatment options including a top load (low volume) and exchange (large volume) infusion of a tense quaternary state (T-State) PolyhHb, relaxed quaternary state (R-State) PolyhHb, and a non O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carrying control. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed correlations between the different regimes of effectiveness within the different simulated dosage options. In general, we found that infusion of T-State PolyhHb is more likely to decrease tissue hypoxia and modulate the metabolic rate of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption. Though the developed models are not a definitive descriptor of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carrier interaction in tumor capillary networks, we accounted for factors such as non-uniform vascular density and permeability that limit the applicability of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carriers during infusion. Finally, we have used these validated computational models to establish potential benchmarks to guide tumor treatment during translation of PolyhHb mediated therapies into clinical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/62H5xwpG7gw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Epithelial sheets define organ architecture during development. Here, we employed an iterative multiscale computational modeling and quantitative experimental approach to decouple direct and indirect effects of actomyosin-generated forces, nuclear positioning, extracellular matrix, and cell-cell adhesion in shaping &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; wing imaginal discs. Basally generated actomyosin forces generate epithelial bending of the wing disc pouch. Surprisingly, acute pharmacological inhibition of ROCK-driven actomyosin contractility does not impact the maintenance of tissue height or curved shape. Computational simulations show that ECM tautness provides only a minor contribution to modulating tissue shape. Instead, passive ECM pre-strain serves to maintain the shape independent from actomyosin contractility. These results provide general insight into how the subcellular forces are generated and maintained within individual cells to induce tissue curvature. Thus, the results suggest an important design principle of separable contributions from ECM prestrain and actomyosin tension during epithelial organogenesis and homeostasis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LhJdXPmSWBs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infection is life-long. Stopping therapy typically leads to the reignition of infection and progressive disease. In a major breakthrough, recent studies have shown that early initiation of ART can lead to sustained post-treatment control of viremia, raising hopes of long-term HIV-1 remission. ART, however, elicits post-treatment control in a small fraction of individuals treated. Strikingly, passive immunization with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of HIV-1 early in infection was found recently to elicit long-term control in a majority of SHIV-infected macaques, suggesting that HIV-1 remission may be more widely achievable. The mechanisms underlying the control elicited by bNAb therapy, however, remain unclear. Untreated infection typically leads to progressive disease. We hypothesized that viremic control represents an alternative but rarely realized outcome of the infection and that early bNAb therapy triggers a dynamical switch to this outcome. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a model of viral dynamics with bNAb therapy and applied it to analyse clinical data. The model fit quantitatively the complex longitudinal viral load data from macaques that achieved lasting control. The model predicted, consistently with our hypothesis, that the underlying system exhibited bistability, indicating two potential outcomes of infection. The first had high viremia, weak cytotoxic effector responses, and high effector exhaustion, marking progressive disease. The second had low viremia, strong effector responses, and low effector exhaustion, indicating lasting viremic control. Further, model predictions suggest that early bNAb therapy elicited lasting control via pleiotropic effects. bNAb therapy lowers viremia, which would also limit immune exhaustion. Simultaneously, it can improve effector stimulation via cross-presentation. Consequently, viremia may resurge post-therapy, but would encounter a primed effector population and eventually get controlled. ART suppresses viremia but does not enhance effector stimulation, explaining its limited ability to elicit post-treatment control relative to bNAb therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rgRAYva8jdg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Although dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to cellular senescence, which contributes to advanced age-related disorders, it is unclear how Krüppel-like factor 5 (Klf5), an essential transcriptional factor of cardiovascular remodeling, mediates the link between mitochondrial dynamics and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence. Here, we show that Klf5 down-regulation in VSMCs is correlated with rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), an age-related vascular disease. Mice lacking Klf5 in VSMCs exacerbate vascular senescence and progression of angiotensin II (Ang II)–induced AAA by facilitating reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Klf5 knockdown enhances, while Klf5 overexpression suppresses mitochondrial fission. Mechanistically, Klf5 activates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a (eIF5a) transcription through binding to the promoter of eIF5a, which in turn preserves mitochondrial integrity by interacting with mitofusin 1 (Mfn1). Accordingly, decreased expression of eIF5a elicited by Klf5 down-regulation leads to mitochondrial fission and excessive ROS production. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission decreases ROS production and VSMC senescence. Our studies provide a potential therapeutic target for age-related vascular disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oIAVlUnNIbk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Female reproductive state is associated with changes in distinct arginine vasotocin cell types in the preoptic area of Astatotilapia burtoni&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/149916bc-f3f5-4185-a3b7-50dcfc1f9f0d/cne24995-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used multiple methods for examining the arginine vasotocin (AVT) system in female African cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;. AVT‐ir cell size varied with female reproductive state in a cell type‐dependent manner. Ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocelluar cells than brooding females, and gigantocellular AVT‐ir cell size correlated with the number of days brooding. Overall, our data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonapeptides play a crucial role in mediating reproduction, aggression, and parental care across taxa. In fishes, &lt;i&gt;arginine vasotocin&lt;/i&gt; (AVT) expression is related to social and/or reproductive status in most male fishes studied to date, and is linked to territorial defense, paternal care, and courtship. Despite a plethora of studies examining AVT in male fishes, relatively little is known about how AVT expression varies with female reproductive state or its role in female social behaviors. We used multiple methods for examining the AVT system in female African cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, including immunohistochemistry for AVT, in situ hybridization for &lt;i&gt;avt&lt;/i&gt;‐mRNA, and quantitative PCR. Ovulated and mouthbrooding females had similar numbers of parvocellular, magnocellular, and gigantocellular AVT cells in the preoptic area. However, ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocellular cells compared to mouthbrooding females, and gigantocellular AVT cell size correlated with the number of days brooding, such that late‐stage brooding females had larger AVT cells than mid‐stage brooding females. In addition, we found that ventral hypothalamic cells were more prominent in females compared to males, and were larger in mouthbrooding compared to ovulated females, suggesting a role in maternal care. Together, these data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males. These data on females complement studies in male &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, providing a comprehensive picture of the regulation and potential function of different AVT cell types in reproduction and social behaviors in both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing between synaptic inputs has been proposed to play a role in the induction of plastic changes that enable neural circuits to store information. In the case of spike timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP), this relates to the interval between a synaptic input and a postsynaptic spike, thus providing a conceptual link to the Hebb learning rule. Experiments have documented STDP in many synapses and brain regions, and computational models have tested its utility in many neural network functions. However, questions remain about whether timing plays a role in plasticity during natural activity, and whether it can function in information storage. The present study used imaging with voltage sensitive dye to investigate the effectiveness of input timing in the plasticity of responses in the CA3 region of hippocampal slices. Plasticity was induced by sequential dual‐site stimulation at 10 ms intervals of either synaptic inputs and cell bodies (synaptic–somatic induction) or of two sets of synaptic inputs (synaptic–synaptic induction). Both protocols potentiated responses, with greater potentiation of responses to the first stimulation of the sequence than the second. Neither of these protocols induced depression. Synaptic–somatic stimulation was much more effective than synaptic–synaptic stimulation in evoking somatic action potentials, but both protocols potentiated responses equally well. This suggests that sequential dual‐site stimulation can potentiate equally well with very different degrees of somatic action potential firing. With synaptic–somatic induction, potentiation was focused at the sites of stimulation. In contrast, with synaptic–synaptic induction, the distribution of potentiation varied greatly. Changes in the spatial distribution of responses indicated that sequential dual‐site stimulation functions poorly in the storage of activity patterns. These results suggest that in the hippocampal CA3 region, timed sequential activation of two inputs is less effective than theta bursts, both in the induction of LTP and in the storage of information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are contractile cells that extend along the vasculature to mediate key homeostatic functions of endothelial barriers within the body. In the central nervous system (CNS), pericytes are important contributors to the structure and function of the neurovascular unit, which includes endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. The understanding of pericytes has been marred by an inability to accurately distinguish pericytes from other stromal cells with similar expression of identifying markers. Evidence is now growing in favor of pericytes being actively involved in both CNS homeostasis and pathology of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer's disease among others. In this review, we discuss the current understanding on the characterization of pericytes, their roles in maintaining the integrity of the blood–brain barrier, and their contributions to neuroinflammation and neurorepair. Owing to its plethora of surface receptors, pericytes respond to inflammatory mediators such as CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1) and tumor necrosis factor‐α, in turn secreting CCL2, nitric oxide, and several cytokines. Pericytes can therefore act as promoters of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Much like professional phagocytes, pericytes also have the ability to clear up cellular debris and macromolecular plaques. Moreover, pericytes promote the activities of CNS glia, including in maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells for myelination. Conversely, pericytes can impair regenerative processes by contributing to scar formation. A better characterization of CNS pericytes and their functions would bode well for therapeutics aimed at alleviating their undesirable properties and enhancing their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural Ordinary Differential Equations replace the right-hand side of a
conventional ODE with a neural net, which by virtue of the universal
approximation theorem, can be trained to the representation of any function.
When we do not know the function itself, but have state trajectories (time
evolution) of the ODE system we can still train the neural net to learn the
representation of the underlying but unknown ODE. However if the state of the
system is incompletely known then the right-hand side of the ODE cannot be
calculated. The derivatives to propagate the system are unavailable. We show
that a specially augmented Neural ODE can learn the system when given
incomplete state information. As a worked example we apply neural ODEs to the
Lotka-Voltera problem of 3 species, rabbits, wolves, and bears. We show that
even when the data for the bear time series is removed the remaining time
series of the rabbits and wolves is sufficient to learn the dynamical system
despite the missing the incomplete state information. This is surprising since
a conventional ODE system cannot output the correct derivatives without the
full state as the input. We implement augmented neural ODEs and differential
equation solvers in the julia programming language.

 &lt;p&gt;Activation in deep neural networks is fundamental to achieving non-linear
mappings. Traditional studies mainly focus on finding fixed activations for a
particular set of learning tasks or model architectures. The research on
flexible activation is quite limited in both designing philosophy and
application scenarios. In this study, three principles of choosing flexible
activation components are proposed and a general combined form of flexible
activation functions is implemented. Based on this, a novel family of flexible
activation functions that can replace sigmoid or tanh in LSTM cells are
implemented, as well as a new family by combining ReLU and ELUs. Also, two new
regularisation terms based on assumptions as prior knowledge are introduced. It
has been shown that LSTM models with proposed flexible activations P-Sig-Ramp
provide significant improvements in time series forecasting, while the proposed
P-E2-ReLU achieves better and more stable performance on lossy image
compression tasks with convolutional auto-encoders. In addition, the proposed
regularization terms improve the convergence, performance and stability of the
models with flexible activation functions.

 &lt;p&gt;Tau is a predominantly neuronal protein that is normally bound to microtubules, where it acts to modulate neuronal and axonal stability. In humans, pathological forms of tau are implicated in a range of diseases that are collectively known as tauopathies. Kinases and phosphatases are responsible for maintaining the correct balance of tau phosphorylation to enable axons to be both stable and labile enough to function properly. In the early stages of tauopathies, this balance is interrupted leading to dissociation of tau from microtubules. This leaves microtubules prone to damage and phosphorylated tau prone to aggregation. Initially, phosphorylated tau forms oligomers, then fibrils, and ultimately neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). It is widely accepted that the initial soluble oligomeric forms of tau are probably the most pathologically relevant species but there is relatively little quantitative information to explain exactly what their toxic effects are at the individual neuron level. Electrophysiology provides a valuable tool to help uncover the mechanisms of action of tau oligomers on synaptic transmission within single neurons. Understanding the concentration-, time-, and neuronal compartment-dependent actions of soluble tau oligomers on neuronal and synaptic properties are essential to understanding how best to counteract its effects and to develop effective treatment strategies. Here, we briefly discuss the standard approaches used to elucidate these actions, focusing on the advantages and shortcomings of the experimental procedures. Subsequently, we will describe a new approach that addresses specific challenges with the current methods, thus allowing real-time toxicity evaluation at the single-neuron level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) remain in the eye throughout life and can be characterized by their ability for self-renewal as well as their specialization into different cell types. A recent study has suggested that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) participate in the processes of multiple types of stem cells. Therefore, clarifying the functions of different subtypes of mGluRs in RPCs may provide a novel treatment strategy for regulating the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous RPCs after retinal degeneration. In this study, we observed that mGluR4 was functionally expressed in RPCs, with an effect on cell viability and intracellular cAMP concentration. The activation of mGluR4 by VU0155041 (VU, mGluR4 positive allosteric selective modulator) reduced the number of BrdU&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Pax6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; double-positive cells and Cyclin D1 expression levels while increasing the number of neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1)- and Doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells. The knockdown of mGluR4 by target-specific siRNA abolished the effects of VU on RPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Further investigation demonstrated that mGluR4 activation inhibited AKT phosphorylation and up-regulated PTEN protein expression. Moreover, the VU0155041-induced inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neuronal differentiation in RPCs were significantly hampered by Forskolin (adenylyl cyclase activator) and VO-OHpic trihydrate (PTEN inhibitor). In contrast, the effect of LY294002 (a highly selective Akt inhibitor) on proliferation and differentiation was similar to that of VU. These results indicate that mGluR4 activation can suppress proliferation and promote the neural differentiation of cultured rat RPCs through the cAMP/PTEN/AKT pathway. Our research lays the foundation for further pharmacological work exploring a novel potential therapy for several retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive procedure, stimulates the cortex evaluating the central motor pathways. The response is called motor evoked potential (MEP). Polyphasia results when the response crosses the baseline more than twice (zero crossing). Recent research shows MEP polyphasia in patients with generalized genetic epilepsy (GGE) and their first-degree relatives compared with controls. Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), a GGE type, is not well studied regarding polyphasia. In our study, we assessed polyphasia appearance probability with TMS in JME patients, their healthy first-degree relatives and controls. Two genetic approaches were applied to uncover genetic association with polyphasia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;20 JME patients, 23 first-degree relatives and 30 controls underwent TMS, obtaining 10–15 MEPs per participant. We evaluated MEP mean number of phases, proportion of MEP trials displaying polyphasia for each subject and variability between groups. Participants underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) via trio-based analysis and two-case scenario. Extensive bioinformatics analysis was applied.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We identified increased polyphasia in patients (85%) and relatives (70%) compared to controls (47%) and significantly higher mean number of zero crossings (i.e., occurrence of phases) (patients 1.49, relatives 1.46, controls 1.22; p &amp;lt; 0.05). Trio-based analysis revealed a candidate polymorphism, p.Glu270del,in SYT14 (Synaptotagmin 14), in JME patients and their relatives presenting polyphasia. Sanger sequencing analysis in remaining participants showed no significant association. In two-case scenario, a machine learning approach was applied in variants identified from odds ratio analysis and risk prediction scores were obtained for polyphasia. The results revealed 61 variants of which none was associated with polyphasia. Risk prediction scores indeed showed lower probability for non-polyphasic subjects on having polyphasia and higher probability for polyphasic subjects on having polyphasia.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Polyphasia was present in JME patients and relatives in contrast to controls. Although no known clinical symptoms are linked to polyphasia this neurophysiological phenomenon is likely due to common cerebral electrophysiological abnormality. We did not discover direct association between genetic variants obtained and polyphasia. It is likely these genetic traits alone cannot provoke polyphasia, however, this predisposition combined with disturbed brain-electrical activity and tendency to generate seizures may increase the risk of developing polyphasia, mainly in patients and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Inherited retinal diseases encompass a highly heterogenous group of disorders caused by a wide range of genetic variants and with diverse clinical symptoms that converge in the common trait of retinal degeneration. Indeed, mutations in over 270 genes have been associated with some form of retinal degenerative phenotype. Given the immune privileged status of the eye, cell replacement and gene augmentation therapies have been envisioned. While some of these approaches, such as delivery of genes through recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, have been successfully tested in clinical trials, not all patients will benefit from current advancements due to their underlying genotype or phenotypic traits. Gene editing arises as an alternative therapeutic strategy seeking to correct mutations at the endogenous locus and rescue normal gene expression. Hence, gene editing technologies can in principle be tailored for treating retinal degeneration. Here we provide an overview of the different gene editing strategies that are being developed to overcome the challenges imposed by the post-mitotic nature of retinal cell types. We further discuss their advantages and drawbacks as well as the hurdles for their implementation in treating retinal diseases, which include the broad range of mutations and, in some instances, the size of the affected genes. Although therapeutic gene editing is at an early stage of development, it has the potential of enriching the portfolio of personalized molecular medicines directed at treating genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study investigated electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during movement preparation and execution in stroke patients. EEG-based event-related potential (ERP) technology was used to measure brain activity changes. Seventeen stroke patients participated in this study and completed ERP tests that were designed to measure EEG changes during unilateral upper limb movements in preparation and execution stages, with Instruction Response Movement (IRM) and Cued Instruction Response Movement (CIRM) paradigms. EEG data were analyzed using motor potential (MP) in the time domain and the mu-rhythm and beta frequency band response mean value (R-means) in the time–frequency domain. In IRM, the MP amplitude at Cz was higher during hemiplegic arm movement than during unaffected arm movement. MP latency was shorter at Cz and the contralesional motor cortex during hemiplegic arm movement in CIRM compared to IRM. No significant differences were found in R-means among locations, between movement sides in both ERP tests. This study presents the brain activity changes in the time and time–frequency domains in stroke patients during movement preparation and execution and supports the contralesional compensation and adjacent-region compensation mechanism of post-stroke brain reconstruction. These findings may contribute to future rehabilitation research about neuroplasticity and technology development such as the brain–computer interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mutations in SPG7 and SPAST are common causes of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). While some SPG7 mutations cause paraplegin deficiency, other SPG7 mutations cause increased paraplegin expression. Mitochondrial function has been studied in models that are paraplegin-deficient (human, mouse, and Drosophila models with large exonic deletions, null mutations, or knockout models) but not in models of mutations that express paraplegin. Here, we evaluated mitochondrial function in olfactory neurosphere-derived cells, derived from patients with a variety of SPG7 mutations that express paraplegin and compared them to cells derived from healthy controls and HSP patients with SPAST mutations, as a disease control. We quantified paraplegin expression and an extensive range of mitochondrial morphology measures (fragmentation, interconnectivity, and mass), mitochondrial function measures (membrane potential, oxidative phosphorylation, and oxidative stress), and cell proliferation. Compared to control cells, SPG7 patient cells had increased paraplegin expression, fragmented mitochondria with low interconnectivity, reduced mitochondrial mass, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, reduced ATP content, increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, and reduced cellular proliferation. Mitochondrial dysfunction was specific to SPG7 patient cells and not present in SPAST patient cells, which displayed mitochondrial functions similar to control cells. The mitochondrial dysfunction observed here in SPG7 patient cells that express paraplegin was similar to the dysfunction reported in cell models without paraplegin expression. The p.A510V mutation was common to all patients and was the likely species associated with increased expression, albeit seemingly non-functional. The lack of a mitochondrial phenotype in SPAST patient cells indicates genotype-specific mechanisms of disease in these HSP patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To date, numerous mathematical models have been proposed on the basis of some types of Hebbian synaptic learning to account for the activity-dependent development of orientation maps as well as neuronal orientation selectivity. These models successfully reproduced orientation map-like spatial patterns. Nevertheless, we still have questions: (1) How does synaptic rewiring occur in the visual cortex during the formation of orderly orientation maps in early life? (2) How does visual experience contribute to the maturation of orientation selectivity of visual cortical neurons and reorganize orientation maps? (3) How does the sensitive period for orientation plasticity end? In this study, we performed animal experiments and mathematical modeling to understand the mechanisms underlying synaptic rewiring for experience-dependent formation and reorganization of orientation maps. At first, we visualized orientation maps from the intrinsic signal optical imaging in area 17 of kittens reared under single-orientation exposure through cylindrical-lens-fitted goggles. The experiments revealed that the degree of expansion of cortical domains representing the experienced orientation depends on the age at which the single-orientation exposure starts. As a result, we obtained the sensitive period profile for orientation plasticity. Next, we refined our previously proposed mathematical model for the activity-dependent self-organization of thalamo-cortical inputs on the assumption that rewiring is caused by the competitive interactions among transient synaptic contacts on the same dendritic spine. Although various kinds of molecules have been reported to be involved in such interactions, we attempt to build a mathematical model to describe synaptic rewiring focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its related molecules. Performing computer simulations based on the refined model, we successfully reproduced orientation maps reorganized in kittens reared under single-orientation exposure as well as normal visual experience. We also reproduced the experimentally obtained sensitive period profile for orientation plasticity. The excellent agreement between experimental observations and theoretical reproductions suggests that the BDNF-induced competitive interaction among synaptic contacts from different axons on the same spine is an important factor for the experience-dependent formation and reorganization of orientation selectivity and orientation maps.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: To investigate the long-term effects on cognition and brain function after installing treadmill workstations in offices for 13 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eighty healthy overweight or obese office workers aged 40–67 years were individually randomized to an intervention group, receiving a treadmill workstation and encouraging emails, or to a control group, continuing to work as usual. Effects on cognitive function, hippocampal volume, prefrontal cortex (PFC) thickness, and circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were analyzed. Further, mediation analyses between changes in walking time and light-intensity physical activity (LPA) on changes in BDNF and hippocampal volume between baseline and 13 months, and multivariate analyses of the baseline data with percentage sitting time as the response variable, were performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: No group by time interactions were observed for any of the outcomes. In the mediation analyses, positive associations between changes in walking time and LPA on changes in hippocampal volume were observed, although not mediated by changes in BDNF levels. In the multivariate analyses, a negative association between percentage sitting time and hippocampal volume was observed, however only among those older than 51 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Although no group by time interactions were observed, our analyses suggest that increased walking and LPA may have positive effects on hippocampal volume and that sedentary behavior is associated with brain structures of importance for memory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01997970.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia play an essential role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, as well as responding to injury and disease. Most neurological disorders feature microglial activation, a process whereby microglia undergo profound morphological and transcriptional changes aimed at containing CNS damage and promoting repair, but often resulting in overt inflammation that sustains and propagates the neurodegenerative process. This is especially evident in multiple sclerosis (MS), were microglial activation and microglia-driven neuroinflammation are considered key events in the onset, progression, and resolution of the disease. Our understanding of microglial functions in MS has widened exponentially in the last decade by way of new tools and markers to discriminate microglia from other myeloid populations. Consequently, the complex functional and phenotypical diversity of microglia can now be appreciated. This, in combination with a variety of animal models that mimic specific features and processes of MS, has contributed to filling the gap of knowledge in the cascade of events underlying MS pathophysiology. The purpose of this review is to present the most up to date knowledge of the dynamic responses of microglia in the commonly used animal models of MS, specifically the immune-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, and the chemically-induced cuprizone and lysolecithin models. Elucidating the spectrum of microglial functions in these models, from detrimental to protective, is essential to identify emerging targets for therapy and guide drug discovery efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Approximately one-third of childhood blindness is attributed to developmental eye disorders, of which 80% have a genetic cause. Eye morphogenesis is tightly regulated by a highly conserved network of transcription factors when disrupted by genetic mutations can result in severe ocular malformation. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are an attractive tool to study early eye development as they are more physiologically relevant than animal models, can be patient-specific and their use does not elicit the ethical concerns associated with human embryonic stem cells. The generation of self-organizing hiPSC-derived optic cups is a major advancement to understanding mechanisms of ocular development and disease. Their development in vitro has been found to mirror that of the human eye and these early organoids have been used to effectively model microphthalmia caused by a VSX2 variant. hiPSC-derived optic cups, retina, and cornea organoids are powerful tools for future modeling of disease phenotypes and will enable a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of many other developmental eye disorders. These models will also provide an effective platform for identifying molecular therapeutic targets and for future clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The detection of ambient cold is critical for mammals, who use this information to avoid tissue damage by cold and to maintain stable body temperature. The transduction of information about the environmental cold is mediated by cold-sensitive ion channels expressed in peripheral sensory nerve endings in the skin. Most transduction mechanisms for detecting temperature changes identified to date depend on transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. Mild cooling is detected by the menthol-sensitive TRPM8 ion channel, but how painful cold is detected remains unclear. The TRPA1 ion channel, which is activated by cold in expression systems, seemed to provide an answer to this question, but whether TRPA1 is activated by cold in neurons and contributes to the sensation of cold pain continues to be a matter of debate. Recent advances have been made in this area of investigation with the identification of several potential cold-sensitive ion channels in thermosensory neurons, including two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P), GluK2 glutamate receptors, and CNGA3 cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. This mini-review gives a brief overview of the way by which ion channels contribute to cold sensation, discusses the controversy around the cold-sensitivity of TRPA1, and provides an assessment of some recently-proposed novel cold-transduction mechanisms. Evidence for another unidentified cold-transduction mechanism is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To identify the novel projections received by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus from the subcortex and limbic system to understand the biological functions of the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The cholera toxin subunit B (CB), a retrograde tracer, was injected into the CSF-contacting nucleus in Sprague–Dawley rats. After 7–10 days, the surviving rats were perfused, and the whole brain and spinal cord were sliced for CB immunofluorescence detection. The CB-positive neurons in the subcortex and limbic system were observed under a fluorescence microscope, followed by 3D reconstructed with the imaris software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: CB-positive neurons were found in the basal forebrain, septum, periventricular organs, preoptic area, and amygdaloid structures. Five functional areas including 46 sub-regions sent projections to the CSF-contacting nucleus. However, the projections had different densities, ranging from sparse to moderate, to dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: According to the projections from the subcortex and limbic system, we hypothesize that the CSF-contacting nucleus participates in emotion, cognition, homeostasis regulation, visceral activity, pain, and addiction. In this study, we illustrate the novel projections from the subcortex and limbic system to the CSF-contacting nucleus, which underlies the diverse and complicated circuits of the nucleus in body regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Quality of life (QoL) was worse in Parkinson’s disease patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or dementia (PDD) than PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC). The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the potential heterogeneous determinants of QoL in PD patients with different cognitive statuses.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 600 PD patients, including 185 PD-NC patients, 336 PD-MCI patients and 79 PDD patients, in this cross-sectional study. All patients completed the QoL assessment by the 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), as well as clinical evaluations and neuropsychological tests. The determinants of the QoL were analyzed by multiple stepwise regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;QoL was more impaired across the three groups (PD-NC &amp;lt; PD-MCI &amp;lt; PDD). The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) score, Geriatric Depression Rating Scale (GDS) score and daily levodopa equivalent dose (LED) were independent variables of PDQ-39 in PD-NC patients. The GDS score, disease duration, UPDRS-III score, Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and sex were independent variables of PDQ-39 in PD-MCI patients. The GDS score and disease duration were independent variables of PDQ-39 in PDD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The determinants of QoL in PD-NC, PD-MCI and PDD patients were heterogeneous. Motor function was considered to be the most crucial determinant for QoL in PD-NC, while depression was indicated to be the most vital determinant for PD-MCI and PDD. For QoL improvement, clinicians might need to focus more on motor function in PD-NC patients and on depression in PD-MCI and PDD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In 1907, Alois Alzheimer observed, as he quoted, development of “numerous fibers” and “adipose saccules” in the brain of his diseased patient Auguste Deter. The neurodegenerative disease became known as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. AD normally develops with aging and is mostly initiated because of the imbalance between the formation and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ). Formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau is another hallmark of AD. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in the development and pathology of AD. This chapter explores the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia in case of AD. Mitochondrial oxidative stress in microglia has been linked to the development of AD. Elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential through various mechanisms have been observed in AD. Aβ interacts with microglial receptors, such as triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), activating downstream pathways causing mitochondrial damage and aggravating inflammation and cytotoxicity. Fibrillar Aβ activates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in microglia leading to elevated induction of mitochondrial ROS which further causes neurotoxicity. Elevated ROS in microglia causes activation of inflammatory and cell death pathways. Production of ATP, regulation of mitochondrial health, autophagy, and mitophagy in microglia play significant roles in the AD pathology. Understanding microglial physiology and mitochondrial dysfunction will enable better therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 We present a three-dimensional (3d) approach for virtual histology and histopathology based on multi-scale phase contrast x-ray tomography, and use this to investigate the parenchymal architecture of unstained lung tissue from patients who succumbed to Covid-19. Based on this first proof-of-concept study, we propose multi-scale phase contrast x-ray tomography as a tool to unravel the pathophysiology of Covid-19, extending conventional histology by a third dimension and allowing for full quantification of tissue remodeling. By combining parallel and cone beam geometry, autopsy samples with a maximum cross section of 4mm are scanned and reconstructed at a resolution and image quality which allows for the segmentation of individual cells. Using the zoom capability of the cone beam geometry, regions-of-interest are reconstructed with a minimum voxel size of 167 nm. We exemplify the capability of this approach by 3d visualisation of the DAD with its prominent hyaline membrane formation, by mapping the 3d distribution and density of lymphocytes infiltrating the tissue, and by providing histograms of characteristic distances from tissue interior to the closest air compartment.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The glycoprotein uromodulin (UMOD) is the most abundant protein in human urine and forms filamentous homopolymers that encapsulate and aggregate uropathogens, promoting pathogen clearance by urine excretion. Despite its critical role in the innate immune response against urinary tract infections, the structural basis and mechanism of UMOD polymerization remained unknown. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the UMOD filament core at 3.5 Å resolution, comprised of the bipartite zona pellucida (ZP) module in a helical arrangement with a rise of ~65 Å and a twist of ~180°. The immunoglobulin-like ZPN and ZPC subdomains of each monomer are separated by a long linker that interacts with the preceding ZPC and following ZPN subdomains by β-sheet complementation. The unique filament architecture suggests an assembly mechanism in which subunit incorporation could be synchronized with proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal pro-peptide that anchors assembly-incompetent UMOD precursors to the membrane.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The apicoplast of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; parasites is believed to rely on the import of three-carbon phosphate compounds for use in organelle anabolic pathways, in addition to the generation of energy and reducing power within the organelle. We generated a series of genetic deletions in an apicoplast metabolic bypass line to determine which genes involved in apicoplast carbon metabolism are required for blood-stage parasite survival and organelle maintenance. We found that pyruvate kinase II (PyrKII) is essential for organelle maintenance, but that production of pyruvate by PyrKII is not responsible for this phenomenon. Enzymatic characterization of PyrKII revealed activity against all NDPs and dNDPs tested, suggesting that it may be capable of generating a broad range of nucleotide triphosphates. Conditional mislocalization of PyrKII resulted in decreased transcript levels within the apicoplast that preceded organelle disruption, suggesting that PyrKII is required for organelle maintenance due to its role in nucleotide triphosphate generation.</content>

 Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules with a covalently closed loop structure formed by back-splicing of exon–exon junctions. The detection of circRNAs across many eukaryotic species, often with cell-type– and tissue-type–specific expression, has catalyzed a growing interest in understanding circRNA biogenesis and their potential functions. circRNAs are enriched in the brain, and accumulate upon neuronal differentiation and depolarization, suggesting that these RNAs are an integral component of the brain transcriptome, and may play functional roles.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Previous work has shown that symmetrical or regular stimuli are judged as lasting longer than asymmetrical or irregular ones, even when actual duration is matched. This effect has been replicated with different methods and stimuli types, both in the UK and Japan. We aimed to a) replicate the effect of symmetry on subjective duration, and b) assess whether it was further modulated by the number of symmetrical axes. There was no evidence for either effect. This null result cannot be explained by reduced statistical power or enhanced floor or ceiling effects. There is no obvious stimulus-based explanation either. However, we are mindful of the reproducibility crisis and file drawer problems in psychology. Other symmetry and time perception researchers should be aware of this null result.</content>

 Metabolism of beta-amyloid is critical for healthy brain. Decreased clearance of beta-amyloid is associated with ensued accumulation of amyloid peptide, culminating in formation of senile plaques, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease(AD). Apolipoprotein E (APOE), a lipoprotein for phospholipid and cholesterol metabolism, is predominantly synthesized by glia in the central nervous system, controlling A-beta; aggregation and metabolism. By use of stereotactic injection and a Morris water maze, we found that delivery of Dicer1-expressing adenovirus into the hippocampus of an animal model of AD mice APPswe/PSEN1deltaE9 significantly improved spatial memory. The effect was associated with reduced amyloid peptides in the hippocampus which were analyzed with immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. With western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and northern blot, Dicer1 overexpression increased apolipoprotein E (APOE) and concomitantly decreased B2 RNA in the hippocampus of the AD mice and in astrocyte cultures whereas transfection of B2 Mm2 RNA decreased APOE mRNA and protein levels in astrocyte cultures. Further,human or mouse APOE mRNA was found containing Alu RNA or its equivalent, B2 Mm2 RNA,locating downstream of its 3-untranslated region (UTR), respectively. The 3-UTR or 3-UTR in conjunction with the downstream Alu/B2 RNA were cloned into a luciferase reporter; with dual-luciferase assay, we found that simultaneous transfection of Dicer1 siRNA or Alu/B2 RNA decreased the corresponding luciferase activities which suggest that Alu RNA mediated APOE mRNA degradation. Altogether, Dicer1 expression mediated amyloid peptide clearance by increasing APOE via blocking B2 RNA-mediated APOE mRNA degradation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Findings from neuroimaging studies show low replication rates, but the origin of the problem is not clear. The current project explored the extent of the time-of-day dependent metabolic variation to the replication crisis. Using data from the human connectome project (HCP) release S1200, cross-spectral density dynamic causal modelling was used to analyse time-dependent effects on the hemodynamic response and effective connectivity parameters in the spontaneous fluctuations (&amp;gt;0.1Hz) of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. Hierarchical group-parametric empirical Bayes found no support for time-of-day variations in effective connectivity, whereas the hemodynamic parameters exhibited a significant time-of-day dependent effect. It is concluded that these findings urge the need to account for the time of day in data acquisition of future MRI studies. Moreover, data from the human connectome project suggest that the relationship between functional and dynamic connectivity and the BOLD signal might not be direct.</content>

 The auditory brainstem is important for processing speech, yet we have much to learn regarding the contributions of different subcortical structures. These deep neural generators respond quickly, making them difficult to study during dynamic, ongoing speech. Recently developed techniques have paved the way to use natural speech stimuli, but the auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) they provide are temporally broad and thus have ambiguous neural sources. Here we describe a new method that uses re-synthesized &quot;peaky&quot; speech stimuli and deconvolution analysis of EEG data to measure canonical ABRs to continuous naturalistic speech of male and female narrators. We show that in adults with normal hearing, peaky speech quickly yields robust ABRs that can be used to investigate speech processing at distinct subcortical structures from auditory nerve to rostral brainstem. We further demonstrate the versatility of peaky speech by simultaneously measuring bilateral and ear-specific responses across different frequency bands. Thus, the peaky speech method holds promise as a powerful tool for investigating speech processing and for clinical applications.</content>

 Trem2R47H rats, which carry the Alzheimer disease (AD) risk factor p.R47H variant of the microglia gene TREM2 and produce human Abeta. Previously, we demonstrated that supraphysiological TNF-alpha; boost glutamatergic transmission and suppresses Long-term-Potentiation (LTP), a surrogate of learning and memory, in peri-adolescent Trem2R47H rats (Ren et al., 2020). Here we tested the effect of the p.R47H TREM2 variant on GABA transmission. We report that GABAergic transmission is decreased in Trem2R47H/R47H rats. This decrease is due to the acute and reversable action of TNF-alpha and is not associated whit changes in human Abeta;levels and pathological brain lesions. Thus, the p.R47H TREM2 variant changes the excitatory/inhibitory balance between glutamate and GABA transmission, favoring excitation. This unbalance could potentiate glutamate excitotoxicity and, over time, contribute to neuronal dysfunction, enhanced neuronal cells death and neurodegeneration. Future studies will determine whether this unbalance represents an early, Abeta-independent pathway leading to dementia.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The neuropeptides CGRP and PACAP have emerged as mediators of migraine, yet the potential overlap of their mechanisms remains unknown. Infusion of PACAP, like CGRP, can cause migraine in people, and both peptides share similar vasodilatory and nociceptive functions. In this study, we have used light aversion in mice as a surrogate for migraine-like photophobia to compare CGRP and PACAP and ask whether CGRP or PACAP actions were dependent on each other. Similar to CGRP, PACAP induced light aversion in outbred CD-1 mice. The light aversion was accompanied by increased resting in the dark, but not anxiety in a light-independent open field assay. Unexpectedly, about a third of the CD-1 mice did not respond to PACAP, which was not seen with CGRP. The responder and nonresponder phenotypes were stable, inheritable, and not sex-linked, although there was generally a trend for greater responses among male mice. RNA-seq analysis of trigeminal ganglia yielded hieriechial clustering of responder and nonresponder mice and revealed a number of candidate genes, including greater expression of pituitary hormones and receptors in a subset of responder mice. Importantly, an anti-PACAP monoclonal antibody could block PACAP-induced light aversion but not CGRP-induced light aversion. Conversely, an anti-CGRP antibody could not block PACAP-induced light aversion. Thus, we propose that CGRP and PACAP act by independent convergent pathways that cause a migraine-like symptom in mice.</content>

 The appearance of a salient stimulus evokes saccadic eye movements and pupil dilation as part of the orienting response. Although the role of the superior colliculus (SC) in saccade and pupil dilation has been established separately, whether and how these responses are coordinated remains unknown. The SC also receives global luminance signals from the retina, but whether global luminance modulates saccade and pupil responses coordinated by the SC remains unknown. Here, we used microstimulation to causally determine how the SC coordinates saccade and pupil responses, and whether global luminance modulates these responses by varying stimulation frequency and global luminance in male monkeys. Stimulation frequency modulated saccade and pupil responses, with trial-by-trial correlations between the two responses. Global luminance only modulated pupil, but not, saccade responses. Our results demonstrate an integrated role of the SC on coordinating saccade and pupil responses, characterizing luminance independent modulation in the SC, together elucidating the differentiated pathways underlying this behavior.</content>

 Primary sensory areas of the mammalian neocortex have a remarkable degree of plasticity, allowing neural circuits to adapt to dynamic environments. However, little is known about the effect of traumatic brain injury on visual system function. Here we applied a mild focal contusion injury to primary visual cortex (V1) in adult mice. We found that, although V1 was largely intact in brain-injured mice, there was a reduction in the number of inhibitory interneurons that extended into deep cortical layers. In general, we found a preferential reduction of interneurons located in superficial layers, near the impact site, while interneurons positioned in deeper layers were better preserved. Three months after injury, V1 neurons showed dramatically reduced responses to visual stimuli and weaker orientation selectivity and tuning, consistent with the loss of cortical inhibition. Our results demonstrate that V1 neurons no longer robustly and stably encode visual input following a mild traumatic injury.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Loud acoustic stimuli (LAS) can trigger prepared motor responses at very short latencies: the StartReact effect. In this study, we tested the proposal that responses to LAS in the StartReact effect could be explained by stimulus intensity effects combined with movement-related preparation changes on nervous system excitability. Using a simple auditory reaction time task, we induced different levels of preparation by systematically manipulating the conditional probability and temporal location of the auditory stimulus (LAS or non-intense tone). We then examined how preparation-levels influenced motor responses to LAS and non-intense tones, as well as cortical and sub-cortical excitability - reflected by electroencephalographic (EEG) activity before the onset of the auditory stimulus, and the eye-blink startle reflex. On both tone and LAS trials, higher preparation conditions were accompanied with reductions in movement onset time, increased force, as well as enhanced cortical (in auditory and motor areas) and sub-cortical excitability. At the trial-level, we found that enhanced pre-stimulus EEG activity in sensory and motor areas was associated with earlier movement onset on tone trials, and shorter blink onset latencies were associated with earlier movement onset on LAS trials. The results show that movement preparation is associated with wide-spread changes in cortical and sub-cortical excitability, and that movement preparation (combined with stimulus-intensity effects) plays a critical role in shaping responses to both non-intense tones and LAS.</content>

 Background: Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau) protein is associated with synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD). We previously demonstrated that neuroprotection in familial mouse models of AD could be achieved by targeting mitochondria complex I (MCI) and activating the adaptive stress response. Efficacy of this strategy on pTau-related pathology remained unknown. Objective: To investigate the effect of specific MCI inhibitor tricyclic pyrone compound CP2 on pTau levels, memory function, long term potentiation (LTP), and energy homeostasis in 18-month-old 3xTg-AD mice and explore the potential mechanisms. Methods: CP2 was administered to male and female 3xTg-AD mice from 3.5 - 18 months of age. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test. Glucose metabolism was measured in periphery using a glucose tolerance test and in the brain using fluorodeoxyglucose F18 positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET). LTP was evaluated using electrophysiology in the hippocampus. The expression of key proteins associated with neuroprotective mechanisms were assessed by western blotting. Results: Chronic CP2 treatment restored synaptic activity and cognitive function, increased levels of synaptic proteins, improved glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis in male and female 3xTg-AD mice. Significant reduction of human pTau in the brain was associated with increased activity of protein phosphatase of type 2A (PP2A), reduced activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3{beta} (GSK3{beta}). Conclusion: CP2 treatment protected against synaptic dysfunction and memory impairment in symptomatic 3xTg-AD mice, and reduced levels of human pTau, indicating that targeting mitochondria with small molecule specific MCI inhibitors represents a promising strategy for AD.</content>

 Brain decoding of motor imagery (MI) is crucial for the control of neuroprosthesis, and it provides insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Walking consists of stance and swing phases, which are associated with different biomechanical and neural control features. However, previous studies on the decoding of the MI of walking focused on the classification of more simple information (e.g., walk and rest). Here, we investigated the feasibility of electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding of the two gait phases during the MI of walking and whether the combined use of MI and action observation (AO) would improve decoding accuracy. We demonstrated that the stance and swing phases could be decoded from EEGs during AO or MI alone. Additionally, the combined use of MI and AO improved decoding accuracy. The decoding models indicated that the improved decoding accuracy following the combined use of MI and AO was facilitated by the additional information resulting from the concurrent cortical activations by multiple regions associated with MI and AO. This study is the first to show that decoding the stance versus swing phases during MI is feasible. The current findings provide fundamental knowledge for neuroprosthetic design and gait rehabilitation, and they expand our understanding of the neural activity underlying AO, MI, and AO+MI of walking.</content>

 N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a short acting psychedelic tryptamine found naturally in many plants and animals. When combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, such as in the Amazonian brew known as ayahuasca, DMT becomes orally active and its effects are extended. Few studies to date addressed the neural and psychological effects of DMT alone, either administered intravenously or inhaled in freebase form, and none conducted in natural settings. We combined state-of-the-art wireless electroencephalography (EEG) with psychometric questionnaires to study the acute effects of inhaled DMT in 35 participants in natural settings, focusing on questions tuned to the advantages of conducting field research, including the effects of contextual factors (known as set and setting), the possibility of studying a comparatively large number of subjects, and the relaxed mental state of participants consuming DMT in familiar and comfortable settings. We observed that DMT significantly decreased the power of alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations throughout all scalp locations, while simultaneously increasing power of delta (1-4 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) oscillations. The pharmacokinetics of inhaled DMT was similar to intravenous administration, but we observed a faster return to baseline for power in the alpha band. Gamma power increases correlated with subjective reports indicative of mystical-type experiences. DMT also increased/decreased global synchrony and metastability in the gamma/alpha band, and resulted in widespread increases in signal complexity measured using the Lempel-Ziv algorithm. These results are consistent with previous studies of psychedelic action in the human brain, while at the same time suggesting potential EEG markers of mystical-type experiences in natural settings. In summary, we conducted one of the first field studies on the neural and psychological effects of a serotonergic psychedelic, yielding new insights and advancing our understanding of the translation between laboratory findings and those obtained in the contexts where these compounds are most frequently consumed.</content>

Estimating the latent dynamics underlying biological processes is a central problem in computational biology. State-space models with Gaussian statistics are widely used for estimation of such latent dynamics and have been successfully utilized in the analysis of biological data. Gaussian statistics, however, fail to capture several key features of the dynamics of biological processes (e.g., brain dynamics) such as abrupt state changes and exogenous processes that affect the states in a structured fashion. Although Gaussian mixture process noise models have been considered as an alternative to capture such effects, data-driven inference of their parameters is not well-established in the literature. The objective of this paper is to develop efficient algorithms for inferring the parameters of a general class of Gaussian mixture process noise models from noisy and limited observations, and to utilize them in extracting the neural dynamics that underlie auditory processing from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in a cocktail party setting. We develop an algorithm based on Expectation-Maximization to estimate the process noise parameters from state-space observations. We apply our algorithm to simulated and experimentally-recorded MEG data from auditory experiments in the cocktail party paradigm to estimate the underlying dynamic Temporal Response Functions (TRFs). Our simulation results show that the richer representation of the process noise as a Gaussian mixture significantly improves state estimation and capturing the heterogeneity of the TRF dynamics. Application to MEG data reveals improvements over existing TRF estimation techniques, and provides a reliable alternative to current approaches for probing neural dynamics in a cocktail party scenario, as well as attention decoding in emerging applications such as smart hearing aids. Our proposed methodology provides a framework for efficient inference of Gaussian mixture process noise models, with application to a wide range of biological data with underlying heterogeneous and latent dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z3L-FPE_fPY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Visually inferring material properties is crucial for many tasks, yet poses significant computational challenges for biological vision. Liquids and gels are particularly challenging due to their extreme variability and complex behaviour. We reasoned that measuring and modelling viscosity perception is a useful case study for identifying general principles of complex visual inferences. In recent years, artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have yielded breakthroughs in challenging real-world vision tasks. However, to model human vision, the emphasis lies not on best possible performance, but on mimicking the specific pattern of successes and errors humans make. We trained a DNN to estimate the viscosity of liquids using 100.000 simulations depicting liquids with sixteen different viscosities interacting in ten different scenes (stirring, pouring, splashing, etc). We find that a shallow feedforward network trained for only 30 epochs predicts mean observer performance better than most individual observers. This is the first successful image-computable model of human viscosity perception. Further training improved accuracy, but predicted human perception less well. We analysed the network’s features using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and a range of image descriptors (e.g. optic flow, colour saturation, GIST). This revealed clusters of units sensitive to specific classes of feature. We also find a distinct population of units that are poorly explained by hand-engineered features, but which are particularly important both for physical viscosity estimation, and for the specific pattern of human responses. The final layers represent many distinct stimulus characteristics—not just viscosity, which the network was trained on. Retraining the fully-connected layer with a reduced number of units achieves practically identical performance, but results in representations focused on viscosity, suggesting that network capacity is a crucial parameter determining whether artificial or biological neural networks use distributed vs. localized representations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CX0itcUkkbU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

During meiosis, chromosomes adopt a specialized organization involving assembly of a cohesin-based axis along their lengths, with DNA loops emanating from this axis. We applied novel, quantitative, and widely applicable cytogenetic strategies to elucidate the molecular bases of this organization using &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Analyses of wild-type (WT) chromosomes and de novo circular minichromosomes revealed that meiosis-specific HORMA-domain proteins assemble into cohorts in defined numbers and co-organize the axis together with 2 functionally distinct cohesin complexes (REC-8 and COH-3/4) in defined stoichiometry. We further found that REC-8 cohesins, which load during S phase and mediate sister-chromatid cohesion, usually occur as individual complexes, supporting a model wherein sister cohesion is mediated locally by a single cohesin ring. REC-8 complexes are interspersed in an alternating pattern with cohorts of axis-organizing COH-3/4 complexes (averaging 3 per cohort), which are insufficient to confer cohesion but can bind to individual chromatids, suggesting a mechanism to enable formation of asymmetric sister-chromatid loops. Indeed, immunofluorescence fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays demonstrate frequent asymmetry in genomic content between the loops formed on sister chromatids. We discuss how features of chromosome axis/loop architecture inferred from our data can help to explain enigmatic, yet essential, aspects of the meiotic program.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dEDkOdULF6w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ivanova et al&lt;/i&gt;. use sparse labeling of mural cells in the retina to identify pericyte diversity and to selectively manipulate capillary blood flow

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are a unique class of mural cells essential for angiogenesis, maintenance of the vasculature and are key players in microvascular pathology. However, their diversity and specific roles are poorly understood, limiting our insight into vascular physiology and the ability to develop effective therapies. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we evaluated distinct classes of mural cells along the vascular tree for both structural characterization and physiological manipulation of blood flow. To accomplish this, we first tested three inducible mural cell‐specific mouse lines using a sensitive Ai14 reporter and tamoxifen application either by a systemic injection, or by local administration in the form of eye drops. The specificity and pattern of cre activation varied significantly across the three lines, under either the PDGFRβ or NG2 promoter (Pdgfrβ‐CreRha, Pdgfrβ‐CreCsln, Cspg4‐Cre). In particular, a mouse line with Cre under the NG2 promoter resulted in sparse TdTomato labeling of mural cells, allowing for an unambiguous characterization of anatomical features of individual sphincter cells and capillary pericytes. Furthermore, in one PDGFRβ line, we found that focal eye drop application of tamoxifen led to an exclusive Cre‐activation in pericytes, without affecting arterial mural cells. We then used this approach to boost capillary blood flow by selective expression of Halorhodopsin, a highly precise hyperpolarizing optogenetic actuator. The ability to exclusively target capillary pericytes may prove a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, a common pathology in numerous diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Combination of acamprosate and baclofen (PXT864) as a potential new therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0bc9c930-cd8a-4c3d-8f29-b15d5c9fa8d6/jnr24714-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity of PXT864, a combination of acamprosate and baclofen, was assessed in cellular models relevant for ALS disease. PXT864 protected neuro muscular junctions in co‐cultures of primary rat neurons and human muscle cells, as well as motoneurons derived from SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; rodents against glutamate toxicity. When combined with riluzole, PXT864 exerted larger protective effects, highlighting the potential use of PXT864 with the standard of care. Importantly, PXT864 reduced TDP‐43 toxic accumulation in cells after insulting stimuli such as glutamate or oxidative stress inducers. An improved maturity of cultured primary SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; motoneurons was also found after PXT864 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no therapy impacting the course of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The only approved treatments are riluzole and edaravone, but their efficacy is modest and short‐lasting, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. We previously demonstrated the ability of PXT864, a combination of low doses of acamprosate and baclofen, to synergistically restore cellular and behavioral activity in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models. The overlapping genetic, molecular, and cellular characteristics of these neurodegenerative diseases supported investigating the effectiveness of PXT864 in ALS. As neuromuscular junction (NMJ) alterations is a key feature of ALS, the effects of PXT864 in primary neuron‐muscle cocultures injured by glutamate were studied. PXT864 significantly and synergistically preserved NMJ and motoneuron integrity following glutamate excitotoxicity. PXT864 added to riluzole significantly improved such protection. PXT864 activity was then assessed in primary cultures of motoneurons derived from SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; rat embryos. These motoneurons presented severe maturation defects that were significantly improved by PXT864. In this model, glutamate application induced an accumulation of TDP‐43 protein in the cytoplasm, a hallmark that was completely prevented by PXT864. The anti‐TDP‐43 aggregation effect was also confirmed in a cell line expressing TDP‐43 fused to GFP. These results demonstrate the value of PXT864 as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The brain of the African wild dog. III. The auditory system&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8e940c3d-ae20-4763-89dc-e0301a75d671/cne24989-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for parvalbumin reveals the various nuclei of the superior olivary complex and trapezoid body within the brain of the African wild dog. We could identify the medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei, the superior, medioventral, and lateroventral periolivary nuclei, the nucleus of the trapezoid body (Tz), and the fiber bundles forming the trapezoid body (tz). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large external pinnae and extensive vocal repertoire of the African wild dog (&lt;i&gt;Lycaon pictus&lt;/i&gt;) has led to the assumption that the auditory system of this unique canid may be specialized. Here, using cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and a range of immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system of the African wild dog. We observed the cochlear nuclear complex, superior olivary nuclear complex, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and auditory cortex all being in their expected locations, and exhibiting the standard subdivisions of this system. While located in the ectosylvian gyri, the auditory cortex includes several areas, resembling the parcellation observed in cats and ferrets, although not all of the auditory areas known from these species could be identified in the African wild dog. These observations suggest that, broadly speaking, the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system, and by extension the processing of auditory information, within the brain of the African wild dog closely resembles that observed in other carnivores. Our findings indicate that it is likely that the extraction of the semantic content of the vocalizations of African wild dogs, and the behaviors generated, occurs beyond the classically defined auditory system, in limbic or association neocortical regions involved in cognitive functions. Thus, to obtain a deeper understanding of how auditory stimuli are processed, and how communication is achieved, in the African wild dog compared to other canids, cortical regions beyond the primary sensory areas will need to be examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Subjective Experience (SE) is part of the ancient mind-body problem, which
continues to be one of deepest mysteries of science. Despite major advances in
many fields, there is still no plausible causal link between SE and its
realization in the body. The core issue is the incompatibility of objective
(3rd person) public science with subjective (1st person) private experience.
Any scientific approach to SE assumes that it arose from extended evolutionary
processes and that examining evolutionary history should help us understand it.
While the core mystery remains, converging evidence from theoretical,
experimental, and computational studies yields strong constraints on SE and
some suggestions for further research. All animals confront many of the same
fitness challenges. They all need some kind of internal model to relate their
life goals and actionable sensed information to action. We understand the
evolution of the bodily aspects of human perception and emotion, but not the
SE. The first evolutionary evidence for SE appears in vertebrates and much of
its neural substrate and simulation mechanism is preserved in mammals and
humans. People exhibit the same phenomena, but there are remaining mysteries of
everyday experience that are demonstrably incompatible with current
neuroscience. In spite of this limitation, there is considerable progress on
understanding the role of SE in the success of prostheses.

 &lt;p&gt;We create a family of powerful video models which are able to: (i) learn
interactions between semantic object information and raw appearance and motion
features, and (ii) deploy attention in order to better learn the importance of
features at each convolutional block of the network. A new network component
named peer-attention is introduced, which dynamically learns the attention
weights using another block or input modality. Even without pre-training, our
models outperform the previous work on standard public activity recognition
datasets with continuous videos, establishing new state-of-the-art. We also
confirm that our findings of having neural connections from the object modality
and the use of peer-attention is generally applicable for different existing
architectures, improving their performances. We name our model explicitly as
AssembleNet++. The code will be available at:

 &lt;p&gt;Vehicle acceleration and deceleration maneuvers at traffic signals results in
significant fuel and energy consumption levels. Green light optimal speed
advisory systems require reliable estimates of signal switching times to
improve vehicle fuel efficiency. Obtaining these estimates is difficult for
actuated signals where the length of each green indication changes to
accommodate varying traffic conditions. This study details a four-step Long
Short-Term Memory deep learning-based methodology that can be used to provide
reasonable switching time estimates from green to red and vice versa while
being robust to missing data. The four steps are data gathering, data
preparation, machine learning model tuning, and model testing and evaluation.
The input to the models included controller logic, signal timing parameters,
time of day, traffic state from detectors, vehicle actuation data, and
pedestrian actuation data. The methodology is applied and evaluated on data
from an intersection in Northern Virginia. A comparative analysis is conducted
between different loss functions including the mean squared error, mean
absolute error, and mean relative error used in LSTM and a new loss function is
proposed. The results show that while the proposed loss function outperforms
conventional loss functions in terms of overall absolute error values, the
choice of the loss function is dependent on the prediction horizon. In
particular, the proposed loss function is outperformed by the mean relative
error for very short prediction horizons and mean squared error for very long
prediction horizons.

 &lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have become a powerful tool for detecting
patterns in image data. Recent papers report promising results in the domain of
disease detection using brain MRI data. Despite the high accuracy obtained from
CNN models for MRI data so far, almost no papers provided information on the
features or image regions driving this accuracy as adequate methods were
missing or challenging to apply. Recently, the toolbox iNNvestigate has become
available, implementing various state of the art methods for deep learning
visualizations. Currently, there is a great demand for a comparison of
visualization algorithms to provide an overview of the practical usefulness and
capability of these algorithms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this thesis has two goals: 1. To systematically evaluate the
influence of CNN hyper-parameters on model accuracy. 2. To compare various
visualization methods with respect to the quality (i.e. randomness/focus,
soundness).

 &lt;p&gt;The interactions play one of the central roles in the brain mediating various
processes and functions. They are particularly important for the brain as a
complex system that has many different functions from the same structural
connectivity. When studying such neural interactions the coupling functions are
very suitable, as inherently they can reveal the underlaying functional
mechanism. This chapter overviews some recent and widely used aspects of
coupling functions for studying neural interactions. Coupling functions are
discussed in connection to two different levels of brain interactions - that of
neuron interactions and brainwave cross-frequency interactions. Aspects
relevant to this from both, theory and methods, are presented. Although the
discussion is based on neuroscience, there are strong implications from, and
to, other fields as well.

 &lt;p&gt;A sudden change in dynamics produces large errors leading to increases in
muscle co-contraction and feedback gains during early adaptation. We previously
proposed that internal model uncertainty drives these changes, whereby the
sensorimotor system reacts to the change in dynamics by upregulating stiffness
and feedback gains to reduce the effect of model errors. However, these
feedback gain increases have also been suggested to represent part of the
adaptation mechanism. Here, we investigate this by examining changes in
visuomotor feedback gains during gradual or abrupt force field adaptation.
Participants grasped a robotic manipulandum and reached while a curl force
field was introduced gradually or abruptly. Abrupt introduction of dynamics
elicited large initial increases in kinematic error, muscle co-contraction and
visuomotor feedback gains, while gradual introduction showed little initial
change in these measures despite evidence of adaptation. After adaptation had
plateaued, there was a change in the co-contraction and visuomotor feedback
gains relative to null field movements, but no differences (apart from the
final muscle activation pattern) between the abrupt and gradual introduction of
dynamics. This suggests that the initial increase in feedback gains is not part
of the adaptation process, but instead an automatic reactive response to
internal model uncertainty. In contrast, the final level of feedback gains is a
predictive tuning of the feedback gains to the external dynamics as part of the
internal model adaptation. Together, the reactive and predictive feedback gains
explain the wide variety of previous experimental results of feedback changes
during adaptation.

 &lt;p&gt;This paper presents a novel data-driven method for learning deep constrained
continuous control policies and dynamical models of linear systems. By
leveraging partial knowledge of system dynamics and constraint enforcing
multi-objective loss functions, the method can learn from small and static
datasets, handle time-varying state and input constraints and enforce the
stability properties of the controlled system. We use a continuous control
design example to demonstrate the performance of the method on three distinct
tasks: system identification, control policy learning, and simultaneous system
identification and policy learning. We assess the system identification
performance by comparing open-loop simulations of the true system and the
learned models. We demonstrate the performance of the policy learning
methodology in closed-loop simulations using the system model affected by
varying levels of parametric and additive uncertainties. We report superior
performance in terms of reference tracking, robustness, and online
computational and memory footprints compared with classical control approaches,
namely LQR and LQI controllers, and with three variants of model predictive
control (MPC) formulations and two traditional MPC solution approaches. We then
evaluate the potential of simultaneously learning the system model and control
policy. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our unifying
framework for constrained optimal control of linear systems to provide
stability guarantees of the learned dynamics, robustness to uncertainty, and
high sampling efficiency.

 &lt;p&gt;Everyday human locomotion requires changing directions and turning. However,
while straight-line walking behavior is approximately explained by energy
minimization, we do not yet have a unified theoretical account of
non-straight-line (i.e., curvilinear) locomotion, despite its ecological
importance. Here, we show that many non-straight-line walking phenomena are
predicted by including an energy cost for turning. We quantified the cost of
turning in humans, showing that the metabolic rate of walking increases with
decreasing radius for fixed speed. We then used this metabolic cost to
mathematically predict energy-optimal movement patterns for five tasks of
varying complexity: walking in circles, turning in place, walking through an
angled corridor, walking freely from point to point while having to turn, and
walking through doors while maneuvering around obstacles. In these tasks,
humans moved at speeds and paths approximately predicted by energy optima.
Thus, we provide a unified theoretical account that predicts diverse
curvilinear locomotor phenomena.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Unsupervised learning requiring only raw data is not only a fundamental
function of the cerebral cortex, but also a foundation for a next generation of
artificial neural networks. However, a unified theoretical framework to treat
sensory inputs, synapses and neural activity together is still lacking. The
computational obstacle originates from the discrete nature of synapses, and
complex interactions among these three essential elements of learning. Here, we
propose a variational mean-field theory in which the distribution of synaptic
weights is considered. The unsupervised learning can then be decomposed into
two intertwined steps: a maximization step is carried out as a gradient ascent
of the lower-bound on the data log-likelihood, in which the synaptic weight
distribution is determined by updating variational parameters, and an
expectation step is carried out as a message passing procedure on an equivalent
or dual neural network whose parameter is specified by the variational
parameters of the weight distribution. Therefore, our framework provides
insights on how data (or sensory inputs), synapses and neural activities
interact with each other to achieve the goal of extracting statistical
regularities in sensory inputs. This variational framework is verified in
restricted Boltzmann machines with planted synaptic weights and
handwritten-digits learning.

 &lt;p&gt;Myelin membranes are dominated by lipids while the complexity of their protein composition has long been considered to be low. However, numerous additional myelin proteins have been identified since. Here we revisit the proteome of myelin biochemically purified from the brains of healthy c56Bl/6N-mice utilizing complementary proteomic approaches for deep qualitative and quantitative coverage. By gel-free, label-free mass spectrometry, the most abundant myelin proteins PLP, MBP, CNP, and MOG constitute 38, 30, 5, and 1% of the total myelin protein, respectively. The relative abundance of myelin proteins displays a dynamic range of over four orders of magnitude, implying that PLP and MBP have overshadowed less abundant myelin constituents in initial gel-based approaches. By comparisons with published datasets we evaluate to which degree the CNS myelin proteome correlates with the mRNA and protein abundance profiles of myelin and oligodendrocytes. Notably, the myelin proteome displays only minor changes if assessed after a post-mortem delay of 6 h. These data provide the most comprehensive proteome resource of CNS myelin so far and a basis for addressing proteomic heterogeneity of myelin in mouse models and human patients with white matter disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Cells bearing pigment have diverse roles and are often under strict evolutionary selection. Here, we explore the regulation of pigmented cells in the purple sea urchin &lt;i&gt;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, &lt;/i&gt;an emerging model for diverse pigment function. We took advantage of single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) technology and discovered that pigment cells in the embryo segregated into two distinct populations, a mitotic cluster and a post-mitotic cluster. &lt;i&gt;Gcm&lt;/i&gt; is essential for expression of several genes important for pigment function, but is only transiently expressed in these cells. We discovered unique genes expressed by pigment cells and test their expression with double fluorescence in situ hybridization. These genes include new members of the &lt;i&gt;fmo&lt;/i&gt; family that are expressed selectively in pigment cells of the embryonic and in the coelomic cells of the adult - both cell-types having immune functions. Overall, this study identifies nodes of molecular intersection ripe for change by selective evolutionary pressures.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Natural Killer (NK) cells have an important role in immune responses to viruses and tumours. Integrating changes in signal transduction pathways and cellular metabolism is essential for effective NK cells responses. The glycolytic enzyme Pyruvate Kinase Muscle 2 (PKM2) has described roles in regulating glycolytic flux and signal transduction, particularly gene transcription. While PKM2 expression is robustly induced in activated NK cells, mice lacking PKM2 in NK cells showed no defect in NK cell metabolism, transcription or anti-viral responses to MCMV infection. NK cell metabolism was maintained due to compensatory PKM1 expression in PKM2-null NK cells. To further investigate the role of PKM2 we used TEPP-46, which increases PKM2 catalytic activity while inhibiting any PKM2 signalling functions. NK cells activated with TEPP-46 had reduced effector function due to TEPP-46-induced increases in oxidative stress. Overall, PKM2-regulated glycolytic metabolism and redox status, not transcriptional control, facilitate optimal NK cells responses.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The coordination of cell proliferation and migration in growing tissues is crucial in development and regeneration but remains poorly understood. Here, we find that, while expanding with an edge speed independent of initial conditions, millimeter-scale epithelial monolayers exhibit internal patterns of proliferation and migration that depend not on the current but on the initial tissue size, indicating memory effects. Specifically, the core of large tissues becomes very dense, almost quiescent, and ceases cell-cycle progression. In contrast, initially-smaller tissues develop a local minimum of cell density and a tissue-spanning vortex. To explain vortex formation, we propose an active polar fluid model with a feedback between cell polarization and tissue flow. Taken together, our findings suggest that expanding epithelia decouple their internal and edge regions, which enables robust expansion dynamics despite the presence of size and history-dependent patterns in the tissue interior.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Translation of mitochondrial messenger RNA (mt-mRNA) is performed by distinct mitoribosomes comprising at least 36 mitochondria-specific proteins. How these mitoribosomal proteins assist in the binding of mt-mRNA and to what extent they are involved in the translocation of transfer RNA (mt-tRNA) is unclear. To visualize the process of translation in human mitochondria, we report ~3.0 Å resolution structure of the human mitoribosome, including the L7/L12 stalk, and eight structures of its functional complexes with mt-mRNA, mt-tRNAs, recycling factor and additional trans factors. The study reveals a transacting protein module LRPPRC-SLIRP that delivers mt-mRNA to the mitoribosomal small subunit through a dedicated platform formed by the mitochondria-specific protein mS39. Mitoribosomal proteins of the large subunit mL40, mL48, and mL64 coordinate translocation of mt-tRNA. The comparison between those structures shows dynamic interactions between the mitoribosome and its ligands, suggesting a sequential mechanism of conformational changes.</content>

 Computational simulations, akin to wetlab experimentation, are subject to statistical fluctuations. Assessing the magnitude of these fluctuations, i.e. assigning uncertainties to the computed results, is of critical importance to drawing statistically reliable conclusions. Here, we use a simulation box size as an independent variable, to demonstrate how crucial it is to gather sufficient amounts of data before drawing any conclusions about the potential thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In various systems, ranging from solvation free energies to protein conformational transition rates, we showcase how the proposed simulation box size effect disappears with increased sampling. This indicates that, if at all, the simulation box size only minimally affects both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the type of biomolecular systems presented in this work.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Dopamine and striatal dysfunctions play a key role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dystonia, but our understanding of the changes in the discharge rate and pattern of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) remains limited. Here, we recorded and examined multi-unit signals from the striatum of PD and dystonic patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgeries. Contrary to earlier human findings, we found no drastic changes in the spontaneous discharge of the well-isolated and stationary SPNs of the PD patients compared to the dystonic patients or to the normal levels of striatal activity reported in healthy animals. Moreover, cluster analysis using SPN discharge properties did not characterize two well-separated SPN subpopulations, indicating no SPN subpopulation-specific (D1 or D2 SPNs) discharge alterations in the pathological state. Our results imply that small to moderate changes in spontaneous SPN discharge related to PD and Dystonia are likely amplified by basal ganglia downstream structures.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Psychostimulants such as d-amphetamine (AMPH) often have behavioral effects that appear paradoxical within the framework of optimal choice theory. AMPH typically increases task engagement and the effort animals exert for reward, despite decreasing reward valuation. We investigated neural correlates of this phenomenon in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain structure implicated in signaling cost-benefit utility. AMPH decreased signaling of reward, but not effort, in the ACC of freely-moving rats. Ensembles of simultaneously recorded neurons generated task-specific trajectories of neural activity encoding past, present, and future events. Low-dose AMPH contracted these trajectories and reduced their variance, whereas high-dose AMPH expanded both. We propose that under low-dose AMPH, increased network stability balances moderately increased excitability, which promotes accelerated unfolding of a neural 'script' for task execution, despite reduced reward valuation. Noise from excessive excitability at high doses overcomes stability enhancement to drive frequent deviation from the script, impairing task execution.</content>

 The evolutionary expansion of the mammalian neocortex is widely considered to be a basis of increased cognitive abilities. This expansion is a consequence of the enhanced production of neurons during the fetal/embryonic development of the neocortex, which in turn reflects an increased proliferative capacity of neural progenitor cells; in particular basal progenitors (BPs). The remarkable heterogeneity of BP subtypes across mammals, notably their various morphotypes and molecular fingerprints, which has recently been revealed, corroborates the importance of BPs for neocortical expansion.</content>

 Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a common problem for older adults, leading to communication difficulties, isolation, and cognitive decline. Recently, hearing loss has been identified as potentially the most modifiable risk factor for dementia. Listening in challenging situations, or when the auditory system is damaged, strains cortical resources, and this may change how the brain responds to cognitively demanding situations more generally. We review the effects of ARHL on brain areas involved in speech perception, from the auditory cortex, through attentional networks, to the motor system.</content>

Previous studies in neurophysiology have shown that neurons exhibit trial-by-trial correlated activity and that such noise correlations (NCs) greatly impact the accuracy of population codes. Meanwhile, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a mainstream approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but it remains unclear how NCs between voxels influence MVPA performance. Here, we tackle this issue by combining voxel-encoding modeling and MVPA. We focus on a well-established form of NC, tuning-compatible noise correlation (TCNC), whose sign and magnitude are systematically related to the tuning similarity between two units. We show that this form of voxelwise NCs can improve MVPA performance if NCs are sufficiently strong. We also confirm these results using standard information-theoretic analyses in computational neuroscience. In the same theoretical framework, we further demonstrate that the effects of noise correlations at both the neuronal level and the voxel level may manifest differently in typical fMRI data, and their effects are modulated by tuning heterogeneity. Our results provide a theoretical foundation to understand the effect of correlated activity on population codes in macroscopic fMRI data. Our results also suggest that future fMRI research could benefit from a closer examination of the correlational structure of multivariate responses, which is not directly revealed by conventional MVPA approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7PQVk9e8O_U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Social interaction between microbes can be described at many levels of details: from the biochemistry of cell-cell interactions to the ecological dynamics of populations. Choosing an appropriate level to model microbial communities without losing generality remains a challenge. Here we show that modeling cross-feeding interactions at an intermediate level between genome-scale metabolic models of individual species and consumer-resource models of ecosystems is suitable to experimental data. We applied our modeling framework to three published examples of multi-strain &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; communities with increasing complexity: uni-, bi-, and multi-directional cross-feeding of either substitutable metabolic byproducts or essential nutrients. The intermediate-scale model accurately fit empirical data and quantified metabolic exchange rates that are hard to measure experimentally, even for a complex community of 14 amino acid auxotrophies. By studying the conditions of species coexistence, the ecological outcomes of cross-feeding interactions, and each community’s robustness to perturbations, we extracted new quantitative insights from these three published experimental datasets. Our analysis provides a foundation to quantify cross-feeding interactions from experimental data, and highlights the importance of metabolic exchanges in the dynamics and stability of microbial communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WgFVhHNcU5g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Standard treatment for active tuberculosis (TB) requires drug treatment with at least four drugs over six months. Shorter-duration therapy would mean less need for strict adherence, and reduced risk of bacterial resistance. A system pharmacology model of TB infection, and drug therapy was developed and used to simulate the outcome of different drug therapy scenarios. The model incorporated human immune response, granuloma lesions, multi-drug antimicrobial chemotherapy, and bacterial resistance. A dynamic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) simulation model including rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was developed and parameters aligned with previous experimental data. Population therapy outcomes for simulations were found to be generally consistent with summary results from previous clinical trials, for a range of drug dose and duration scenarios. An online tool developed from this model is released as open source software. The TB simulation tool could support analysis of new therapy options, novel drug types, and combinations, incorporating factors such as patient adherence behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Dx3oCUCRX-I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Tumour spheroids are widely used as an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay for characterising the dynamics and response to treatment of different cancer cell lines. Their popularity is largely due to the reproducible manner in which spheroids grow: the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from the surrounding culture medium, and their consumption by tumour cells, causes proliferation to be localised at the spheroid boundary. As the spheroid grows, cells at the spheroid centre may become hypoxic and die, forming a necrotic core. The pressure created by the localisation of tumour cell proliferation and death generates an cellular flow of tumour cells from the spheroid rim towards its core. Experiments by Dorie &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. showed that this flow causes inert microspheres to infiltrate into tumour spheroids via advection from the spheroid surface, by adding microbeads to the surface of tumour spheroids and observing the distribution over time. We use an off-lattice hybrid agent-based model to re-assess these experiments and establish the extent to which the spatio-temporal data generated by microspheres can be used to infer kinetic parameters associated with the tumour spheroids that they infiltrate. Variation in these parameters, such as the rate of tumour cell proliferation or sensitivity to hypoxia, can produce spheroids with similar bulk growth dynamics but differing internal compositions (the proportion of the tumour which is proliferating, hypoxic/quiescent and necrotic/nutrient-deficient). We use this model to show that the types of experiment conducted by Dorie &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. could be used to infer spheroid composition and parameters associated with tumour cell lines such as their sensitivity to hypoxia or average rate of proliferation, and note that these observations cannot be conducted within previous continuum models of microbead infiltration into tumour spheroids as they rely on resolving the trajectories of individual microbeads.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UboktnJLXIM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Plants are attacked by herbivores, which often specialize on different tissues, and in response, have evolved sophisticated resistance strategies that involve different types of chemical defenses frequently targeted to different tissues. Most known phytohormones have been implicated in regulating these defenses, with jasmonates (JAs) playing a pivotal role in complex regulatory networks of signaling interactions, often generically referred to as “cross talk.” The newly identified class of phytohormones, strigolactones (SLs), known to regulate the shoot architecture, remain unstudied with regard to plant–herbivore interactions. We explored the role of SL signaling in resistance to a specialist weevil (&lt;i&gt;Trichobaris mucorea&lt;/i&gt;) herbivore of the native tobacco, &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana attenuata&lt;/i&gt;, that attacks the root–shoot junction (RSJ), the part of the plant most strongly influenced by alterations in SL signaling (increased branching). As SL signaling shares molecular components, such as the core F-box protein more axillary growth 2 (MAX2), with another new class of phytohormones, the karrikins (KARs), which promote seed germination and seedling growth, we generated transformed lines, individually silenced in the expression of &lt;i&gt;NaMAX2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dwarf 14&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;NaD14&lt;/i&gt;: the receptor for SL) and &lt;i&gt;carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;NaCCD7&lt;/i&gt;: a key enzyme in SL biosynthesis), and &lt;i&gt;karrikin insensitive 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;NaKAI2&lt;/i&gt;: the KAR receptor). The mature stems of all transgenic lines impaired in the SL, but not the KAR signaling pathway, overaccumulated anthocyanins, as did the stems of plants attacked by the larvae of weevil, which burrow into the RSJs to feed on the pith of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;attenuata&lt;/i&gt; stems. &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mucorea&lt;/i&gt; larvae grew larger in the plants silenced in the SL pathway, but again, not in the &lt;i&gt;KAI2&lt;/i&gt;-silenced plants. These phenotypes were associated with elevated JA and auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) levels and significant changes in the accumulation of defensive compounds, including phenolamides and nicotine. The overaccumulation of phenolamides and anthocyanins in the SL pathway–silenced plants likely resulted from antagonism between the SL and JA pathway in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;attenuata&lt;/i&gt;. We show that the repressors of SL signaling, suppressor of max2-like (NaSMXL6/7), and JA signaling, jasmonate zim-domain (NaJAZs), physically interact, promoting NaJAZb degradation and releasing jasmonate insensitive 1 (JIN1/MYC2) (NaMYC2), a critical transcription factor promoting JA responses. However, the increased performance of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mucorea&lt;/i&gt; larvae resulted from lower pith nicotine levels, which were inhibited by increased IAA levels in SL pathway–silenced plants. This inference was confirmed by decapitation and auxin transport inhibitor treatments that decreased pith IAA and increased nicotine levels. In summary, SL signaling tunes specific sectors of specialized metabolism in stems, such as phenylpropanoid and nicotine biosynthesis, by tailoring the cross talk among phytohormones, including JA and IAA, to mediate herbivore resistance of stems. The metabolic consequences of the interplay of SL, JA, and IAA signaling revealed here could provide a mechanism for the commonly observed pattern of herbivore tolerance/resistance trade-offs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bMR1GCtaSzI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Antibiotics are losing efficacy due to the rapid evolution and spread of resistance. Treatments targeting bacterial virulence factors have been considered as alternatives because they target virulence instead of pathogen viability, and should therefore exert weaker selection for resistance than conventional antibiotics. However, antivirulence treatments rarely clear infections, which compromises their clinical applications. Here, we explore the potential of combining antivirulence drugs with antibiotics against the opportunistic human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. We combined two antivirulence compounds (gallium, a siderophore quencher, and furanone C-30, a quorum sensing [QS] inhibitor) together with four clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, colistin, meropenem, tobramycin) in 9×9 drug concentration matrices. We found that drug-interaction patterns were concentration dependent, with promising levels of synergies occurring at intermediate drug concentrations for certain drug pairs. We then tested whether antivirulence compounds are potent adjuvants, especially when treating antibiotic resistant (AtbR) clones. We found that the addition of antivirulence compounds to antibiotics could restore growth inhibition for most AtbR clones, and even abrogate or reverse selection for resistance in five drug combination cases. Molecular analyses suggest that selection against resistant clones occurs when resistance mechanisms involve restoration of protein synthesis, but not when efflux pumps are up-regulated. Altogether, our work provides a first systematic analysis of antivirulence-antibiotic combinatorial treatments and suggests that such combinations have the potential to be both effective in treating infections and in limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/o41AexYYLAs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The evolutionary radiation of birds has produced incredible morphological variation, including a huge range of skull form and function. Investigating how this variation arose with respect to non-avian dinosaurs is key to understanding how birds achieved their remarkable success after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Using a high-dimensional geometric morphometric approach, we quantified the shape of the skull in unprecedented detail across 354 extant and 37 extinct avian and non-avian dinosaurs. Comparative analyses reveal fundamental differences in how skull shape evolved in birds and non-avian dinosaurs. We find that the overall skull shape evolved faster in non-avian dinosaurs than in birds across all regions of the cranium. In birds, the anterior rostrum is the most rapidly evolving skull region, whereas more posterior regions—such as the parietal, squamosal, and quadrate—exhibited high rates in non-avian dinosaurs. These fast-evolving elements in dinosaurs are strongly associated with feeding biomechanics, forming the jaw joint and supporting the jaw adductor muscles. Rapid pulses of skull evolution coincide with changes to food acquisition strategies and diets, as well as the proliferation of bony skull ornaments. In contrast to the appendicular skeleton, which has been shown to evolve more rapidly in birds, avian cranial morphology is characterised by a striking deceleration in morphological evolution relative to non-avian dinosaurs. These results may be due to the reorganisation of skull structure in birds—including loss of a separate postorbital bone in adults and the emergence of new trade-offs with development and neurosensory demands. Taken together, the remarkable cranial shape diversity in birds was not a product of accelerated evolution from their non-avian relatives, despite their frequent portrayal as an icon of adaptive radiations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rDGe3-2SUPo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Fluctuations of consciousness, mood, and science: The interhemispheric switch and sticky switch models two decades on&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8c5f1342-4379-4ea3-a435-e871546025ee/cne24943-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago Jack Pettigrew and I proposed the interhemispheric switch model of binocular rivalry and the sticky switch model of bipolar disorder. Here I describe the genesis, development, supporting data, and current status of these models. I also reflect on doing science with Pettigrew, his remarkable life in science, and how perspectives in science and medicine can fluctuate like the very phenomena on which we worked.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and medicine aim to identify verifiable and replicable truths. However, the paths to such truths are frequently characterized by swinging pendulums of opposing perspectives. This is especially so in human neuroscience and the brain‐based clinical sciences, where the target of investigation is the most complex of all biological systems. This article overviews a set of interrelated neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses, models, experiments, and predictions with which I have been involved for the last two decades. Traversing visual neuroscience, consciousness science, genetics, chronobiology, and biological and clinical psychiatry, the work illustrates how developments in science and medicine can occur through a combination of synthesis, serendipity, and experimentation. The article also reflects on doing science with the inimitable John “Jack” Pettigrew, and outlines how Pettigrew and I conceived, proposed, tested, and developed two new scientific models—one on neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry, the other on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. I also provide an update on various aspects of our models and data, and describe lessons learned from Pettigrew on how perspectives in science exhibit their own fluctuations, ironically like the very phenomena on which we worked.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberation is thought to involve the internal simulation of the outcomes of candidate actions, the valuation of those outcomes, and the selection of the actions with the highest expected value. While it is known that deliberation involves prefrontal cortical areas, specifically the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), as well as the hippocampus (HPC) and other brain regions, how these areas process prospective information and select actions is not well understood. We recorded simultaneously from ensembles in dmPFC and CA1 of dorsal HPC in rats during performance of a spatial contingency switching task, and examined the relationships between spatial and reward encoding in these two areas during deliberation at the choice point. We found that CA1 and dmPFC represented either goal locations or the current position simultaneously, but that when goal locations were encoded, HPC and dmPFC did not always represent the same goal location. Ensemble activity in dmPFC predicted when HPC would represent goal locations, but on a broad timescale on the order of seconds. Also, reward encoding in dmPFC increased during hippocampal theta cycles where CA1 ensembles represented the goal location. These results suggest that dmPFC and HPC share prospective information during deliberation, that dmPFC may influence whether HPC represents prospective information, and that information recalled about goal locations by HPC may be integrated into dmPFC reward representations on fast timescales.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Xyloglucan (XyG) is an abundant component of the primary cell walls of most plants. While the structure of XyG has been well studied, much remains to be learned about its biosynthesis. Here we employed reverse genetics to investigate the role of Arabidopsis cellulose synthase like-C (CSLC) proteins in XyG biosynthesis....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/y9p0JboOGL4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of α-synuclein (α-syn), e.g., phosphorylation, play an important role in modulating α-syn pathology in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and α-synucleinopathies. Accumulation of phosphorylated α-syn fibrils in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is the histological hallmark of these diseases. However, it is unclear how phosphorylation relates to α-syn pathology....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/-QAcuuZN8o8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns (eg, sleep–wake cycle, circadian rest‐activity rhythm, and physical activity) across different stages of α‐synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared alterations in 7‐day actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns among patients with clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies (n = 44), and their age‐, sex‐, and body mass index (BMI)‐matched patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD, n = 88), and non‐rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) controls (n = 44) in a case–control study (study 1) and between convertors (n = 22) and their age‐, sex‐, BMI‐, iRBD‐duration, and follow‐up duration‐matched non‐convertors (n = 66) in a prospective nested case–control study (study 2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In study 1, there were significant increases (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted by false discovery rate &amp;lt; 0.01) in probable napping behaviors (percentage, duration, and episodes), activity fragmentation (estimated by k&lt;sub&gt;AR&lt;/sub&gt;), and physical inactivity during active periods across controls, and iRBD, to clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies. In study 2, higher levels (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted by false discovery rate &amp;lt; 0.05) of baseline objective probable napping, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active periods were associated with the conversion of patients with iRBD into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies at 2 years of follow‐up with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.56 to 0.80). These findings were further supported by functional linear modeling analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest‐activity pattern alterations, mainly objective probable napping behaviors, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active period, emerge as early as at the stage of iRBD, which serves as early and robust prodromal markers of the conversion of iRBD into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of people with suspected genetic dystonia remain undiagnosed after maximal investigation, implying that a number of causative genes have not yet been recognised. We aimed to investigate this paucity of diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We undertook weighted burden analysis of whole‐exome sequencing data from 138 individuals with unresolved generalised dystonia of suspected genetic aetiology, followed by additional case‐finding from international databases, first for the gene implicated by the burden analysis (&lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt;), then for other functionally related genes. Electron microscopy was performed on patient‐derived cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis revealed a significant burden for &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; (Fisher's exact test p‐value, 6.9x10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; encodes a subunit of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which plays a key role in autophagosome‐lysosome fusion. A total of 18 individuals harbouring heterozygous loss‐of‐function &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; variants, and one with a microdeletion, were identified. These individuals experienced early‐onset progressive dystonia with predominant cervical, bulbar, orofacial and upper limb involvement. Some patients had a more complex phenotype with additional neuropsychiatric and/or developmental comorbidities. We also identified biallelic loss‐of‐function variants in &lt;i&gt;VPS41&lt;/i&gt;, another HOPS‐complex encoding genes, in an individual with infantile‐onset generalised dystonia. Electron microscopy of patient‐derived lymphocytes and fibroblasts from both &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;VPS41&lt;/i&gt; patients showed vacuolar abnormalities suggestive of impaired lysosomal function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study strongly supports a role for HOPS complex dysfunction in the pathogenesis of dystonia, though variants in different subunits display different phenotypic and inheritance characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Adaptive learning rates can lead to faster convergence and better final
performance for deep learning models. There are several widely known
human-designed adaptive optimizers such as Adam and RMSProp, gradient based
adaptive methods such as hyper-descent and L4, and meta learning approaches
including learning to learn. However, the issue of balancing adaptiveness and
over-parameterization is still a topic to be addressed. In this study, we
investigate different levels of learning rate adaptation based on the framework
of hyper-gradient descent, and further propose a method that adaptively learns
the model parameters for combining different levels of adaptations. Meanwhile,
we show the relationship between adding regularization on over-parameterized
learning rates and building combinations of different levels of adaptive
learning rates. The experiments on several network architectures including
feed-forward networks, LeNet-5 and ResNet-34 show that the proposed multi-level
adaptive approach can outperform baseline adaptive methods in a variety
circumstances with statistical significance.

 &lt;p&gt;The deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on end-nodes at the extreme
edge of the Internet-of-Things is a critical enabler to support pervasive Deep
Learning-enhanced applications. Low-Cost MCU-based end-nodes have limited
on-chip memory and often replace caches with scratchpads, to reduce area
overheads and increase energy efficiency -- requiring explicit DMA-based memory
transfers between different levels of the memory hierarchy. Mapping modern DNNs
on these systems requires aggressive topology-dependent tiling and
double-buffering. In this work, we propose DORY (Deployment Oriented to memoRY)
- an automatic tool to deploy DNNs on low cost MCUs with typically less than
1MB of on-chip SRAM memory. DORY abstracts tiling as a Constraint Programming
(CP) problem: it maximizes L1 memory utilization under the topological
constraints imposed by each DNN layer. Then, it generates ANSI C code to
orchestrate off- and on-chip transfers and computation phases. Furthermore, to
maximize speed, DORY augments the CP formulation with heuristics promoting
performance-effective tile sizes. As a case study for DORY, we target
GreenWaves Technologies GAP8, one of the most advanced parallel ultra-low power
MCU-class devices on the market. On this device, DORY achieves up to 2.5x
better MAC/cycle than the GreenWaves proprietary software solution and 18.1x
better than the state-of-the-art result on an STM32-F746 MCU on single layers.
Using our tool, GAP-8 can perform end-to-end inference of a 1.0-MobileNet-128
network consuming just 63 pJ/MAC on average @ 4.3 fps - 15.4x better than an
STM32-F746. We release all our developments - the DORY framework, the optimized
backend kernels, and the related heuristics - as open-source software.

 &lt;p&gt;The development of efficient and effective evolutionary multi-objective
optimization (EMO) algorithms has been an active research topic in the
evolutionary computation community. Over the years, many EMO algorithms have
been proposed. The existing EMO algorithms are mainly developed based on the
final population framework. In the final population framework, the final
population of an EMO algorithm is presented to the decision maker. Thus, it is
required that the final population produced by an EMO algorithm is a good
solution set. Recently, the use of solution selection framework was suggested
for the design of EMO algorithms. This framework has an unbounded external
archive to store all the examined solutions. A pre-specified number of
solutions are selected from the archive as the final solutions presented to the
decision maker. When the solution selection framework is used, EMO algorithms
can be designed in a more flexible manner since the final population is not
necessarily to be a good solution set. In this paper, we examine the design of
MOEA/D under these two frameworks. We use an offline genetic algorithm-based
hyper-heuristic method to find the optimal configuration of MOEA/D in each
framework. The DTLZ and WFG test suites and their minus versions are used in
our experiments. The experimental results suggest the possibility that a more
flexible, robust and high-performance MOEA/D algorithm can be obtained when the
solution selection framework is used.

 &lt;p&gt;Dense Associative Memories or modern Hopfield networks permit storage and
reliable retrieval of an exponentially large (in the dimension of feature
space) number of memories. At the same time, their naive implementation is
non-biological, since it seemingly requires the existence of many-body synaptic
junctions between the neurons. We show that these models are effective
descriptions of a more microscopic (written in terms of biological degrees of
freedom) theory that has additional (hidden) neurons and only requires two-body
interactions between them. For this reason our proposed microscopic theory is a
valid model of large associative memory with a degree of biological
plausibility. The dynamics of our network and its reduced dimensional
equivalent both minimize energy (Lyapunov) functions. When certain dynamical
variables (hidden neurons) are integrated out from our microscopic theory, one
can recover many of the models that were previously discussed in the
literature, e.g. the model presented in ''Hopfield Networks is All You Need''
paper. We also provide an alternative derivation of the energy function and the
update rule proposed in the aforementioned paper and clarify the relationships
between various models of this class.

 &lt;p&gt;Object detection is a very important function of visual perception systems.
Since the early days of classical object detection based on HOG to modern deep
learning based detectors, object detection has improved in accuracy. Two stage
detectors usually have higher accuracy than single stage ones. Both types of
detectors use some form of quantization of the search space of rectangular
regions of image. There are far more of the quantized elements than true
objects. The way these bounding boxes are filtered out possibly results in the
false positive and false negatives. This empirical experimental study explores
ways of reducing false positives and negatives with labelled data.. In the
process also discovered insufficient labelling in Openimage 2019 Object

 &lt;p&gt;Some biological mechanisms of early vision are comparatively well understood,
but they have yet to be evaluated for their ability to accurately predict and
explain human judgments of image similarity. From well-studied simple
connectivity patterns in early vision, we derive a novel formalization of the
psychophysics of similarity, showing the differential geometry that provides
accurate and explanatory accounts of perceptual similarity judgments. These
predictions then are further improved via simple regression on human behavioral
reports, which in turn are used to construct more elaborate hypothesized neural
connectivity patterns. Both approaches outperform standard successful measures
of perceived image fidelity from the literature, as well as providing
explanatory principles of similarity perception.

 &lt;p&gt;Experimental studies support the notion of spike-based neuronal information
processing in the brain, with neural circuits exhibiting a wide range of
temporally-based coding strategies to rapidly and efficiently represent sensory
stimuli. Accordingly, it would be desirable to apply spike-based computation to
tackling real-world challenges, and in particular transferring such theory to
neuromorphic systems for low-power embedded applications. Motivated by this, we
propose a new supervised learning method that can train multilayer spiking
neural networks to solve classification problems based on a rapid,
first-to-spike decoding strategy. The proposed learning rule supports multiple
spikes fired by stochastic hidden neurons, and yet is stable by relying on
first-spike responses generated by a deterministic output layer. In addition to
this, we also explore several distinct, spike-based encoding strategies in
order to form compact representations of presented input data. We demonstrate
the classification performance of the learning rule as applied to several
benchmark datasets, including MNIST. The learning rule is capable of
generalising from the data, and is successful even when used with constrained
network architectures containing few input and hidden layer neurons.
Furthermore, we highlight a novel encoding strategy, termed `scanline
encoding', that can transform image data into compact spatiotemporal patterns
for subsequent network processing. Designing constrained, but optimised,
network structures and performing input dimensionality reduction has strong
implications for neuromorphic applications.

 &lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved the unwavering
confidence in its performance on image processing tasks. The CNN architecture
constitutes a variety of different types of layers including the convolution
layer and the max-pooling layer. CNN practitioners widely understandthe fact
that the stability of learning depends on how to initialize the model
parameters in each layer. Nowadays, no one doubts that the de facto standard
scheme for initialization is the so-called Kaiming initialization that has been
developed by He et al. The Kaiming scheme was derived from a much simpler model
than the currently used CNN structure having evolved since the emergence of the
Kaiming scheme. The Kaiming model consists only of the convolution and fully
connected layers, ignoring the max-pooling layer and the global average pooling
layer. In this study, we derived the initialization scheme again not from the
simplified Kaiming model, but precisely from the modern CNN architectures.

 &lt;p&gt;Drivers behaviour prediction has been an unceasing concern for transportation
safety divisions all over the world. A massive amount of lives and properties
losses due to the adversities at intersections and pedestrian crossings.
Especially for countries with poor road safety technologies, this toll knows no
bounds. A myriad of research and studies have been mastered for technological
evaluation and model representation over this issue. Instead, little
comprehensive review has been made on the drivers behaviour prediction at
signalised intersections on red-light running and turning. This Paper aims at
incorporating previous researches on drivers behaviour prediction and the
prediction parameters leading to traffic violation like red-light running and
turning at intersection and pedestrian crossing. The review also covers the
probable crash scenarios by red-light running and turning and analyses the
innovation of counter-crash technologies with future research directions.

 &lt;p&gt;We show analytically that training a neural network by stochastic mutation or
&quot;neuroevolution&quot; of its weights is equivalent, in the limit of small mutations,
to gradient descent on the loss function in the presence of Gaussian white
noise. Averaged over independent realizations of the learning process,
neuroevolution is equivalent to gradient descent on the loss function. We use
numerical simulation to show that this correspondence can be observed for
finite mutations. Our results provide a connection between two distinct types
of neural-network training, and provide justification for the empirical success
of neuroevolution.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06634"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are susceptible to various noise factors leading
to the loss of information, and the noise restricts the subsequent HSIs object
detection and classification tasks. In recent years, learning-based methods
have demonstrated their superior strengths in denoising the HSIs.
Unfortunately, most of the methods are manually designed based on the extensive
expertise that is not necessarily available to the users interested. In this
paper, we propose a novel algorithm to automatically build an optimal
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to effectively denoise HSIs. Particularly,
the proposed algorithm focuses on the architectures and the initialization of
the connection weights of the CNN. The experiments of the proposed algorithm
have been well-designed and compared against the state-of-the-art peer
competitors, and the experimental results demonstrate the competitive
performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the different evaluation
metrics, visual assessments, and the computational complexity.

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-us">The Two Kinds of Free Energy and the Bayesian Revolution. (arXiv:2004.11763v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11763"/>
		<id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11763</id>
		<updated>2020-08-18T01:30:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The concept of free energy has its origins in 19th century thermodynamics,
but has recently found its way into the behavioral and neural sciences, where
it has been promoted for its wide applicability and has even been suggested as
a fundamental principle of understanding intelligent behavior and brain
function. We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free
energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as
applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that
appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum
entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of
minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies
from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for
action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information
processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to
formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context
of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature.
We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual
issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to
apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of
reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We propose a novel biologically-plausible solution to the credit assignment
problem, being motivated by observations in the ventral visual pathway and
trained deep neural networks. In both, representations of objects in the same
category become progressively more similar, while objects belonging to
different categories becomes less similar. We use this observation to motivate
a layer-specific learning goal in a deep network: each layer aims to learn a
representational similarity matrix that interpolates between previous and later
layers. We formulate this idea using a contrastive similarity matching
objective function and derive from it deep neural networks with feedforward,
lateral and feedback connections, and neurons that exhibit
biologically-plausible Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity. Contrastive
similarity matching can be interpreted as an energy-based learning algorithm,
but with significant differences from others in how a contrastive function is
constructed.

 &lt;p&gt;Beta oscillations (13.5−25 Hz) over the sensorimotor areas are characterized by a power decrease during movement execution (event-related desynchronization, ERD) and a sharp rebound after the movement end (event-related synchronization, ERS). In previous studies, we demonstrated that movement-related beta modulation depth (peak ERS-ERD) during reaching increases within 1-h practice. This increase may represent plasticity processes within the sensorimotor network. If so, beta modulation during a reaching test should be affected by previous learning activity that engages the sensorimotor system but not by learning involving other systems. We thus recorded high-density EEG activity in a group of healthy subjects performing three 45-min blocks of motor adaptation task to a visually rotated display (ROT) and in another performing three blocks of visual sequence-learning (VSEQ). Each block of either ROT or VSEQ was followed by a simple reaching test (mov) without rotation. We found that beta modulation depth increased with practice across mov tests. However, such an increase was greater in the group performing ROT over both the left and frontal areas previously involved in ROT. Importantly, beta modulation values returned to baseline values after a 90-min of either nap or quiet wake. These results show that previous practice leaves a trace in movement-related beta modulation and therefore such increases are cumulative. Furthermore, as sleep is not necessary to bring beta modulation values to baseline, they could reflect local increases of neuronal activity and decrease of energy and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The majority of synaptic activity in the brain consists of glutamatergic transmission, and there are numerous mechanisms, both intra- and inter-cellular that regulate this excitatory synaptic activity. Importantly, uptake of glutamate plays an important role and a reduced level of astrocytic glutamate transporters affect the normally balanced neurotransmission and is observed in many mental disorders. However, reduced glutamate uptake affects many different synaptic mechanisms in the astrocyte as well as in the neuron, and the effects are challenging to delineate. Combining electrophysiological recordings from neurons and astrocytes as well as extracellular glutamate recordings in rat hippocampal slices, we confirmed previous work showing that synaptic stimulation induces a long-lasting depolarization of the astrocytic membrane that is dependent on inward-rectifier potassium channels. We further showed that when glutamate transporters are blocked, this astrocytic depolarization is greatly enhanced although synaptic responses are reduced. We propose that increasing the levels of synaptic glutamate through blocking glutamate transporters reduces the AMPA-mediated synaptic response while the NMDA receptor current increases, contributing to a rise in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; leading to enhanced astrocytic depolarization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence has suggested that the dynamic properties of functional brain networks are related to individual behaviors and cognition traits. However, current fMRI-based approaches mostly focus on statistical characteristics of the windowed correlation time course, potentially overlooking subtle time-varying patterns in dynamic functional connectivity (dFC). Here, we proposed the use of an end-to-end deep learning model that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal and spatial features of functional connectivity sequences simultaneously. The results on a large cohort (Human Connectome Project, n = 1,050) demonstrated that our model could achieve a high classification accuracy of about 93% in a gender classification task and prediction accuracies of 0.31 and 0.49 (Pearson’s correlation coefficient) in fluid and crystallized intelligence prediction tasks, significantly outperforming previously reported models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our model could effectively learn spatiotemporal dynamics underlying dFC with high statistical significance based on the null hypothesis estimated using surrogate data. Overall, this study suggests the advantages of a deep learning model in making full use of dynamic information in resting-state functional connectivity, and highlights the potential of time-varying connectivity patterns in improving the prediction of individualized characterization of demographics and cognition traits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt; Striatal tonic dopamine increases rapidly during global cerebral hypoxia. This phenomenon has previously been studied using microdialysis techniques which have relatively poor spatio-temporal resolution. In this study, we measured changes in tonic dopamine during hypoxia (death) in real time with high spatio-temporal resolution using novel multiple cyclic square wave voltammetry (MCSWV) and conventional fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) techniques.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;MCSWV and FSCV were used to measure dopamine release at baseline and during hypoxia induced by euthanasia, with and without prior alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) treatment, in urethane anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Baseline tonic dopamine levels were found to be 274.1 ± 49.4 nM (n = 5; mean ± SEM). Following intracardiac urethane injection, the tonic levels increased to a peak concentration of 1753.8 ± 95.7 nM within 3.6 ± 0.6 min (n = 5), followed by a decline to 50.7 ± 21.5 nM (n = 4) at 20 min. AMPT pre-treatment significantly reduced this dopamine peak to 677.9 ± 185.7 nM (n = 3). FSCV showed a significantly higher (p = 0.0079) peak dopamine release of 6430.4 ± 1805.7 nM (n = 5) during euthanasia-induced cerebral hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MCSWV is a novel tool to study rapid changes in tonic dopamine release in vivo during hypoxia. We found a 6-fold increase in peak dopamine levels during hypoxia which was attenuated with AMPT pre-treatment. These changes are much lower compared to those found with microdialysis. This could be due to improved estimation of baseline tonic dopamine with MCSWV. Higher dopamine response measured with FSCV could be due to an increased oxidation current from electroactive interferents.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Evidence is mounting that LRRK2 function, particularly its kinase activity, is elevated in multiple forms of Parkinson’s disease, both idiopathic as well as familial forms linked to mutations in the LRRK2 gene. However, sensitive quantitative markers of LRRK2 activation in clinical samples remain at the early stages of development. There are several measures of LRRK2 activity that could potentially be used in longitudinal studies of disease progression, as inclusion/exclusion criteria for clinical trials, to predict response to therapy, or as markers of target engagement. Among these are levels of LRRK2, phosphorylation of LRRK2 itself, either by other kinases or via auto-phosphorylation, its in vitro kinase activity, or phosphorylation of downstream substrates. This is advantageous on many levels, in that multiple indices of elevated kinase activity clearly strengthen the rationale for targeting this kinase with novel therapeutic candidates, and provide alternate markers of activation in certain tissues or biofluids for which specific measures are not detectable. However, this can also complicate interpretation of findings from different studies using disparate measures. In this review we discuss the current state of LRRK2-focused biomarkers, the advantages and disadvantages of the current pallet of outcome measures, the gaps that need to be addressed, and the priorities that the field has defined.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke-induced inflammation and inflammasome-dependent pyroptotic neural death cause serious neurological injury. Nano-sized plasma exosomes have exhibited therapeutic potential against ischemia and reperfusion injury by ameliorating inflammation. To enhance its therapeutic potential in patients with ischemic injury, we isolated exosomes from melatonin-treated rat plasma and assessed the neurological protective effect in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Basal plasma exosomes and melatonin-treated plasma exosomes were isolated and intravenously injected into a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Neurological recovery was evaluated by determining the modified neurological severity score (mNSS), infarct volume, and brain water content. Pyroptosis in the ischemic cortex was detected through dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage. NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and global inflammatory cytokine secretion were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot assay. In immunized Sprague–Dawley rats, microglia pyroptosis was determined through a positive percentage of IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and caspase-1 (p20)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Finally, the microRNA (miRNA) profiles in melatonin-treated plasma exosomes were analyzed by exosome miRNA microarray analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Melatonin treatment enhanced plasma exosome therapeutic effects against ischemia-induced inflammatory responses and inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. In addition, we confirmed that ischemic stroke-induced pyroptotic cell death occurred in the microglia and neuron, while the administration of melatonin-treated exosomes further effectively decreased the infarct volume and improved recovery of function via regulation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Finally, the altered miRNA profiles in the melatonin-treated plasma exosomes demonstrated the regulatory mechanisms involved in neurological recovery after ischemic injury.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that nano-sized plasma exosomes with melatonin pretreatment might be a more effective strategy for patients with ischemic brain injury. Further exploration of key molecules in the plasma exosome may provide increased therapeutic value for cerebral ischemic injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Gambling disorder (GD) is the most common behavioral addiction and shares pathophysiological and clinical features with substance use disorders (SUDs). Effective therapeutic interventions for GD are lacking. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) may represent a promising treatment option for GD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive and structured overview of studies applying NIBS techniques to GD and problem gambling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search using Pubmed, Web of Science, and Science Direct was conducted from databases inception to December 19, 2019, for studies assessing the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS) on subjects with GD or problem gambling. Studies using NIBS techniques on healthy subjects and those without therapeutic goals but only aiming to assess basic neurophysiology measures were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 269 articles were title and abstract screened, 13 full texts were assessed, and 11 were included, of which six were controlled and five were uncontrolled. Most studies showed a reduction of gambling behavior, craving for gambling, and gambling-related symptoms. NIBS effects on psychiatric symptoms were less consistent. A decrease of the behavioral activation related to gambling was also reported. Some studies reported modulation of behavioral measures (i.e., impulsivity, cognitive and attentional control, decision making, cognitive flexibility). Studies were not consistent in terms of NIBS protocol, site of stimulation, clinical and surrogate outcome measures, and duration of treatment and follow-up. Sample size was small in most studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the included studies prevented us from drawing any firm conclusion on the efficacy of NIBS interventions for GD. Further methodologically sound, robust, and well-powered studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Malformations of cortical development (MCD) is associated with a wide range of developmental delay and drug resistant epilepsy in children. By using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) of cortical electroencephalography (EEG) data, we tried to investigate the neural changes of spatiotemporal functional connectivity (FC) and fast oscillation (FO) dynamics in a rat model of methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-induced MCD. A total of 28 infant rats with prenatal exposure to MAM and those of age matched 28 controls with prenatal saline exposure were used. RS-fMRI were acquired at postnatal day 15 (P15) and 29 (P29), and correlation coefficient analysis of eleven region of interests (ROI) was done to find the differences of functional networks between four groups. Two hour-cortical EEGs were also recorded at P15 and P29 and the ERSP of gamma (30–80 Hz) and ripples (80–200 Hz) were analyzed. The rats with MCD showed significantly delayed development of superior colliculus-brainstem network compared to control rats at P15. In contrast to marked maturation of default mode network (DMN) in controls from P15 to P29, there was no clear development in MCD rats. The MCD rats showed significantly higher cortical gamma and ripples-ERSP at P15 and lower cortical ripples-ERSP at P29 than those of control rats. This study demonstrated delayed development of FC and altered cortical FO dynamics in rats with malformed brain. The results should be further investigated in terms of the epileptogenesis and cognitive dysfunction in patients with MCD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The literature on neuroscience has grown rapidly in recent years with the emergence of new domains of research. In the context of this progress, creating a knowledge organization system (KOS) that can quickly incorporate terms of a given domain is an important aim in the area. In this article, we develop a systematic method based on word representation and the agglomerative clustering algorithm to semi-automatically build a hierarchical KOS. We collected 35,832 research keywords and 11,497 research methods from PubMed Central database, and organized them in a hierarchical structure according to semantic distance. We show that the proposed KOS can help find terms related to the given topics, analyze articles related to specific domains of research, and characterize the features of article clusters. The proposed method can significantly reduce the manual work required by experts to organize the KOS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Biased attention towards emotional stimuli is adaptive, as it facilitates responses to important threats and rewards. An unfortunate consequence is that emotional stimuli can become potent distractors when they are irrelevant to current goals. How can this distraction be overcome despite the bias to attend to emotional stimuli? Recent studies show that distraction by irrelevant flankers is reduced when distractor frequency is high, even if they are emotional. A parsimonious explanation is that the expectation of frequent distractors promotes the use of proactive control, whereby attentional control settings can be altered to minimize distraction before it occurs. It is difficult, however, to infer proactive control on the basis of behavioral data alone. We therefore measured neural indices of proactive control while participants performed a target-detection task in which irrelevant peripheral distractors (either emotional or neutral) could appear either frequently (on 75% of trials) or rarely (on 25% of trials). We measured alpha power during the pre-stimulus period to assess proactive control and during the post-stimulus period to determine the consequences of control for subsequent processing. Pre-stimulus alpha power was tonically suppressed in the high, compared to low, distractor frequency condition, regardless of expected distractor valence, indicating sustained use of proactive control. In contrast, post-stimulus alpha suppression was reduced in the high-frequency condition, suggesting that proactive control reduced the need for post-stimulus adjustments. Our findings indicate that a sustained proactive control strategy accounts for the reduction in both emotional and non-emotional distraction when distractors are expected to appear frequently.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To understand the function of the neocortex, which is a hierarchical distributed network, it is useful giving meaning to the signals transmitted between these areas from the computational viewpoint. The overall anatomical structure or organs related to this network, including the neocortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia, has been roughly revealed, and much physiological knowledge, though often fragmentary, is being accumulated. The computational theories involving the neocortex have also been developed considerably. By introducing the assumption “The signals transmitted by interarea axonal projections of pyramidal cells in the neocortex carry different meanings for each cell type, common to all areas,” derived from its nature as a distributed network in the neocortex, allows us to specify the computational meanings of interarea signals. In this paper, first, the types of signals exchanged between neocortical areas are investigated, taking into account biological constraints, and employing theories such as predictive coding, reinforcement learning, representation emulation theory, and BDI logic as theoretical starting points, two types of feedforward signals (observation and deviation) and three types of feedback signals (prediction, plan, and intention) are identified. Next, based on the anatomical knowledge of the neocortex and thalamus, the pathways connecting the areas are organized and summarized as three corticocortical pathways and two thalamocortical pathways. Using this summation as preparation, this paper proposes a hypothesis that gives meaning to each type of signals transmitted in the different pathways in the neocortex, from the viewpoint of their functions. This hypothesis reckons that the feedforward corticocortical pathway transmits observation signals, the feedback corticocortical pathway transmits prediction signals, and the corticothalamic pathway mediated by core relay cells transmits deviation signals. The thalamocortical pathway, which is mediated by matrix relay cells, would be responsible for transmitting the signals that activate a part of prediction signals as intentions, due to the reason that the nature of the other available feedback pathways are not sufficient for conveying plans and intentions as signals. The corticocortical pathway, which is projected from various IT cells to the first layer, would be responsible for transmitting signals that activate a part of prediction signals as plans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Monochromatic blue light (MBL), with a wavelength between 400–490 nm, can regulate non-image-forming (NIF) functions of light in the central nervous system. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain is involved in the arousal-promoting response to blue light in mice. Animal and human studies showed that the responsiveness of the brain to visual stimuli is partly preserved under general anesthesia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether MBL promotes arousal from sevoflurane anesthesia via activation of the SCN in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The induction and emergence time of sevoflurane anesthesia under MBL (460 nm and 800 lux) exposure was measured. Cortical electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded and the burst-suppression ratio (BSR) was calculated under MBL during sevoflurane anesthesia. The EEGs and local field potential (LFP) recordings with or without locally electrolytic ablated bilateral SCN were used to further explore the role of SCN in the arousal-promoting effect of MBL under sevoflurane anesthesia. Immunofluorescent staining of c-Fos was conducted to reveal the possible downstream mechanism of SCN activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Unlike the lack of effect on the induction time, MBL shortened the emergence time and the EEG recordings showed cortical arousal during the recovery period. MBL resulted in a significant decrease in BSR and a marked increase in EEG power at all frequency bands except for the spindle band during 2.5% sevoflurane anesthesia. MBL exposure under sevoflurane anesthesia enhances the neuronal activity of the SCN. These responses to MBL were abolished in SCN lesioned (SCNx) mice. MBL evoked a high level of c-Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and lateral hypothalamus (LH) compared to polychromatic white light (PWL) under sevoflurane anesthesia, while it exerted no effect on c-Fos expression in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) and locus coeruleus (LC) c-Fos expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: MBL promotes behavioral and electroencephalographic arousal from sevoflurane anesthesia via the activation of the SCN and its associated downstream wake-related nuclei. The clinical implications of this study warrant further study.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common phenomenon associated with anesthesia and surgery and has been frequently described in the elderly and susceptible individuals. Microglia, which are the brain’s major resident immune cells, play critical roles in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. Accumulating evidence suggests microglial dysfunction occurring after anesthesia and surgery might perturb neuronal function and induce PND. This review aims to provide an overview of the involvement of microglia in PND to date. Possible cellular and molecular mechanisms regarding the connection between microglial activation and PND are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Loss of function mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previous works reported that the deficiency of PGRN accelerates β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in AD transgenic mouse brains while overexpression of PGRN could restrain disease progression. However, mechanisms of PGRN in protecting against Aβ deposition remains unclear. Here, using the 5xFAD AD mouse model, we show that intrahippocampal injection of PGRN protein leads to a reduction of Aβ plaques, downregulation of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and enhanced microglia Aβ phagocytosis in the mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, PGRN treatment inhibited BACE1 expression in N2a cells and primary culture neurons and improved the phagocytic capacity of microglia isolated from 5xFAD mouse brains. Collectively, our results provide further evidence that enhancing progranulin could be a promising option for AD therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative diseases endemic in humans and several ruminants caused by the misfolding of native prion protein (PrP) into pathological conformations. Experimental work and the mad-cow epidemic of the 1980s exposed a wide spectrum of animal susceptibility to prion diseases, including a few highly resistant animals: horses, rabbits, pigs, and dogs/canids. The variable susceptibility to disease offers a unique opportunity to uncover the mechanisms governing PrP misfolding, neurotoxicity, and transmission. Previous work indicates that PrP-intrinsic differences (sequence) are the main contributors to disease susceptibility. Several residues have been cited as critical for encoding PrP conformational stability in prion-resistant animals, including D/E159 in dog, S167 in horse, and S174 in rabbit and pig PrP (all according to human numbering). These amino acids alter PrP properties in a variety of assays, but we still do not clearly understand the structural correlates of PrP toxicity. Additional insight can be extracted from comparative structural studies, followed by molecular dynamics simulations of selected mutations, and testing in manipulable animal models. Our working hypothesis is that protective amino acids generate more compact and stable structures in a C-terminal subdomain of the PrP globular domain. We will explore this idea in this review and identify subdomains within the globular domain that may hold the key to unravel how conformational stability and disease susceptibility are encoded in PrP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The first anatomical atlas of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of white matter pathways in the canine brain was published in 2013; however, the anatomical orientation of the entire visual pathway in the canine brain, from the retina to the cortex, has not yet been studied using DTI. In the present study, 3T DTI magnetic resonance (MR) images of three dogs euthanized for reasons other than neurological disorders were obtained. The process of obtaining combined fractional anisotropy and directional maps was initiated within 1 h of death. The heads were amputated immediately after MR imaging and stored in 10% formalin until dissection and histological sampling was performed. The trajectory of the visual pathway is dissimilar to the horizontal representation in other literature. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to visualize the entire canine visual pathway in its full antero-posterior extension. Fibers from the retina to the cortex passed through the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tracts, lateral geniculate nucleus, Meyer’s and Baum’s loops, and pretectal fibers. Their projections to the cortex were similar to those in the human visual pathway. The crossing of fibers at the optic chiasm occurred in 75% of fibers. In addition to advancing our knowledge in this field of study, these results could help plan neurosurgical and radiotherapeutic procedures to avoid unnecessary damage to the visual fiber system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Olfactory deficits are an early and prevalent non-motor symptom of Huntington’s disease (HD). In other neurodegenerative diseases where olfactory deficits occur, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, pathological protein aggregates (tau, β-amyloid, α-synuclein) accumulate in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) of the olfactory bulb (OFB). Therefore, in this study we determined whether aggregates are also present in HD OFBs; 13 HD and five normal human OFBs were stained for mutant huntingtin (mHtt), tau, β-amyloid, TDP-43, and α-synuclein. Our results show that mHtt aggregates detected with 1F8 antibody are present within all HD OFBs, and mHtt aggregate load in the OFB does not correlate with Vonsattel grading scores. The majority of the aggregates were located in the AON and in similar abundance in each anatomical segment of the AON. No mHtt aggregates were found in controls; 31% of HD cases also contained tau neurofibrillary tangles within the AON. This work demonstrates HD pathology in the OFB and indicates that disease-specific protein aggregation in the AON is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases that show olfactory deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background and purpose: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease in older people. Yet, there are no FDA approved drugs specifically for VaD. In this study, we have investigated the therapeutic effects of human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) treatment on the cognitive outcome, white matter (WM) integrity, and glymphatic system function in rats subject to a multiple microinfarction (MMI) model of VaD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Male, retired breeder rats were subjected to the MMI model (800 ± 100 cholesterol crystals/300 μl injected into the internal carotid artery), and 3 days later were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or HUCBC (5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, i.v.). Sham rats were included as naïve control. Following a battery of cognitive tests, rats were sacrificed at 28 days after MMI and brains extracted for immunohistochemical evaluation and Western blot analysis. To evaluate the glymphatic function, fluorescent tracers (Texas Red dextran, MW: 3 kD and FITC-dextran, MW: 500 kD) was injected into the cisterna magna over 30 min at 14 days after MMI. Rats (3–4/group/time point) were sacrificed at 30 min, 3 h, and 6 h, and the tracer movement analyzed using laser scanning confocal microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to control MMI rats, HUCBC treated MMI rats exhibit significantly improved short-term memory and long-term memory exhibited by increased discrimination index in novel object recognition task with retention delay of 4 h and improved novel odor recognition task with retention delay of 24 h, respectively. HUCBC treatment also improves spatial learning and memory as measured using the Morris water maze test compared to control MMI rats. HUCBC treatment significantly increases axon and myelin density increases oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell number and increases Synaptophysin expression in the brain compared to control MMI rats. HUCBC treatment of MMI in rats significantly improves glymphatic function by reversing MMI induced delay in the penetration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the brain parenchyma via glymphatic pathways and reversing delayed clearance from the brain. HUCBC treatment significantly increases miR-126 expression in serum, aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression around cerebral vessels, and decreases transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) protein expression in the brain which may contribute to HUCBC induced improved glymphatic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: HUCBC treatment of an MMI rat model of VaD promotes WM remodeling and improves glymphatic function which together may aid in the improvement of cognitive function and memory. Thus, HUCBC treatment warrants further investigation as a potential therapy for VaD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism involving in gene transcription modulation. An age-related increase in promoter methylation has been observed for neuronal activity and memory genes, and participates in neurological disorders. However, the position and precise mechanism of DNA methylation for memory gene modulation in anesthesia related cognitive impairment remained to be determined. Here, we studied the effects of sevoflurane anesthesia on the transcription of memory genes in the aged rat hippocampus. Then, we investigated changes in DNA methylation of involved genes and verified whether dysregulated DNA methylation would contribute to anesthesia induced cognitive impairment. The results indicated that sevoflurane anesthesia down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of three memory genes, Arc, Bdnf, and Reln, which were accompanied with promoter hypermethylation and increased Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Mecp2 expression, and finally impaired hippocampus dependent memory. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA hypermethylation by 5-Aza rescued sevoflurane induced memory gene expression decrease and cognitive impairment. These findings provide an epigenetic understanding for the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment induced by general anesthesia in aged brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Genome replication is initiated from specific origin sites established by dynamic events. The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) is necessary for orchestrating the initiation process by binding to origin DNA, recruiting CDC6, and assembling the MCM replicative helicase on DNA. Here we report five cryoEM structures of the human ORC (HsORC) that illustrate the native flexibility of the complex. The absence of ORC1 revealed a compact, stable complex of ORC2-5. Introduction of ORC1 opens the complex into several dynamic conformations. Two structures revealed dynamic movements of the ORC1 AAA+ and ORC2 winged-helix domains that likely impact DNA incorporation into the ORC core. Additional twist and pinch motions were observed in an open ORC conformation revealing a hinge at the ORC5·3 interface that may facilitate ORC binding to DNA. Finally, a structure of ORC was determined with endogenous DNA bound in the core revealing important differences between human and yeast origin recognition.</content>

 Specific protein-lipid interactions are critical for viral assembly. We present a molecular dynamics simulation study on the binding mechanism of the membrane targeting domain of HIV-1 Gag protein. The matrix (MA) domain drives Gag onto the plasma membrane through electrostatic interactions at its highly-basic-region (HBR), located near the myristoylated (Myr) N-terminus of the protein. Our study suggests Myr insertion is involved in the sorting of membrane lipids around the protein binding site to prepare it for viral assembly. Our realistic membrane models confirm interactions with PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PS lipids are highly favored around the HBR, and are strong enough to keep the protein bound even without Myr insertion. We characterized Myr insertion events from microsecond trajectories, and examined the membrane response upon initial membrane targeting by MA. Insertion events only occur with one of the membrane models, showing a combination of surface charge and internal membrane structure modulate this process.</content>

 Microglia continuously monitor synapses, but active synaptic remodelling by microglia in mature healthy brains is rarely directly observed. We performed targeted photoablation of single synapses in mature transgenic mice expressing fluorescent labels in neurons and microglia. The photodamage focally increased the duration of microglia-neuron contacts, and dramatically exacerbated both the turnover of dendritic spines and presynaptic boutons as well as the generation of new filopodia originating from spine heads or boutons. The results of microglia depletion confirmed that elevated spine turnover and the generation of presynaptic filopodia are microglia-dependent processes.</content>

 BCL9 and PYGO are β-catenin cofactors that enhance the transcription of Wnt target genes. They have been proposed as therapeutic targets to diminish Wnt signaling output in intestinal malignancies. Here we find that, in colorectal cancer cells and in developing mouse forelimbs, BCL9 proteins sustain the action of β-catenin in a largely PYGO-independent manner. Our genetic analyses implied that BCL9 necessitates other interaction partners in mediating its transcriptional output. We identified the transcription factor TBX3 as a candidate tissue-specific member of the β-catenin transcriptional complex. In developing forelimbs, both TBX3 and BCL9 occupy a large number of Wnt-responsive regulatory elements, genome-wide. Moreover, mutations in &lt;i&gt;Bcl9&lt;/i&gt; affect the expression of TBX3 targets in vivo, and modulation of TBX3 abundance impacts on Wnt target genes transcription in a β-catenin- and TCF/LEF-dependent manner. Finally, TBX3 overexpression exacerbates the metastatic potential of Wnt-dependent human colorectal cancer cells. Our work implicates TBX3 as context-dependent component of the Wnt/β-catenin-dependent transcriptional complex.</content>

 Pathogens find diverse niches for survival including inside a host cell where replication occurs in a relatively protective environment. &lt;i&gt;Vibrio parahaemolyticus&lt;/i&gt; is a facultative intracellular pathogen that uses its type 3 secretion system 2 (T3SS2) to invade and replicate inside host cells. Analysis of the T3SS2 pathogenicity island encoding the T3SS2 appeared to lack a mechanism for egress of this bacterium from the invaded host cell. Using a combination of molecular tools, we found that VPA0226, a constitutively secreted lipase, is required for escape of &lt;i&gt;V. parahaemolyticus&lt;/i&gt; from the host cells. This lipase must be delivered into the host cytoplasm where it preferentially uses fatty acids associated with innate immune response to esterify cholesterol, weakening the plasma membrane and allowing egress of the bacteria. This study reveals the resourcefulness of microbes and the interplay between virulence systems and host cell resources to evolve an ingenious scheme for survival and escape.</content>

 We aimed to study time trends and levels of mean total cholesterol and lipid fractions, and dyslipidaemias prevalence in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Systematic-review and meta-analysis of population-based studies in which lipid (total cholesterol [TC; 86 studies; 168,553 people], HDL-Cholesterol [HDL-C; 84 studies; 121,282 people], LDL-Cholesterol [LDL-C; 61 studies; 86,854 people], and triglycerides [TG; 84 studies; 121,009 people]) levels and prevalences were laboratory-based. We used Scopus, LILACS, Embase, Medline and Global Health; studies were from 1964 to 2016. Pooled means and prevalences were estimated for lipid biomarkers from ≥2005. The pooled means (mg/dl) were 193 for TC, 120 for LDL-C, 47 for HDL-C, and 139 for TG; no strong trends. The pooled prevalence estimates were 21% for high TC, 20% for high LDL-C, 48% for low HDL-C, and 21% for high TG; no strong trends. These results may help strengthen programs for dyslipidaemias prevention/management in LAC.</content>

 The Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor synaptotagmin-1 and the SNARE complex cooperate to trigger neurotransmitter release. Structural studies elucidated three distinct synaptotagmin-1-SNARE complex binding modes involving polybasic, primary and tripartite interfaces of synaptotagmin-1. We investigated these interactions using NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. Synaptotagmin-1 binds to the SNARE complex through the polybasic and primary interfaces in solution. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free synaptotagmin-1 binds to SNARE complexes anchored on PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing nanodiscs. R398Q/R399Q and E295A/Y338W mutations at the primary interface, which strongly impair neurotransmitter release, disrupt and enhance synaptotagmin-1-SNARE complex binding, respectively. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induces tight binding of synaptotagmin-1 to PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing nanodiscs, disrupting synaptotagmin-1-SNARE interactions. Specific effects of mutations in the polybasic region on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent synaptotagmin-1-PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-membrane interactions correlate with their effects on release. Our data suggest that synaptotagmin-1 binds to the SNARE complex through the primary interface and that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; releases this interaction, inducing PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/membrane binding and allowing cooperation between synaptotagmin-1 and the SNAREs in membrane fusion to trigger release.</content>

 Understanding how climate-mediated biotic interactions shape thermal niche width is critical in an era of global change. Yet, most previous work on thermal niches has ignored detailed mechanistic information about the relationship between temperature and organismal performance, which can be described by a thermal performance curve. Here, we develop a model that predicts the width of thermal performance curves will be narrower in the presence of interspecific competitors, causing a species’ optimal breeding temperature to diverge from that of its competitor. We test this prediction in the Asian burying beetle &lt;i&gt;Nicrophorus nepalensis&lt;/i&gt;, confirming that the divergence in actual and optimal breeding temperatures is the result of competition with their primary competitor, blowflies. However, we further show that intraspecific cooperation enables beetles to outcompete blowflies by recovering their optimal breeding temperature. Ultimately, linking abiotic factors and biotic interactions on niche width will be critical for understanding species-specific responses to climate change.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Predicting gene expression from DNA sequence remains a major goal in the field of gene regulation. A challenge to this goal is the connectivity of the network, whose role in altering gene expression remains unclear. Here, we study a common autoregulatory network motif, the negative single-input module, to explore the regulatory properties inherited from the motif. Using stochastic simulations and a synthetic biology approach in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, we find that the TF gene and its target genes have inherent asymmetry in regulation, even when their promoters are identical; the TF gene being more repressed than its targets. The magnitude of asymmetry depends on network features such as network size and TF binding affinities. Intriguingly, asymmetry disappears when the growth rate is too fast or too slow and is most significant for typical growth conditions. These results highlight the importance of accounting for network architecture in quantitative models of gene expression.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Relay of muscle-derived sensory information to the CNS is essential for the execution of motor behavior, but how proprioceptive sensory neurons (pSNs) establish functionally appropriate connections is poorly understood. A prevailing model of sensory-motor circuit assembly is that peripheral, target-derived, cues instruct pSN identities and patterns of intraspinal connectivity. To date no known intrinsic determinants of muscle-specific pSN fates have been described in vertebrates. We show that expression of Hox transcription factors defines pSN subtypes, and these profiles are established independently of limb muscle. The &lt;i&gt;Hoxc8&lt;/i&gt; gene is expressed by pSNs and motor neurons (MNs) targeting distal forelimb muscles, and sensory-specific depletion of &lt;i&gt;Hoxc8&lt;/i&gt; in mice disrupts sensory-motor synaptic matching, without affecting pSN survival or muscle targeting. These results indicate that the diversity and central specificity of pSNs and MNs are regulated by a common set of determinants, thus linking early rostrocaudal patterning to the assembly of limb control circuits.</content>

 How neural representations supporting odor object recognition emerge in the brain remains elusive. Here, Endo et al. show in Drosophila that a random, divergent-convergent network in an olfactory association center generates clustered representations for groups and mixtures of odors. Notably, despite this random connectivity, relative odor representations are conserved across animals.</content>

 Whether Western diet enrichment with linoleic acid promotes colorectal carcinogenesis is poorly understood. Liu et al. identify a mechanism by which 15-lipoxygenase-1 peroxidation of linoleic acid in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P_LA), to induce PI3P_13-HODE formation, attenuates PI3P binding to the SNX17-LRP5 complex.

 Development and activation of T lymphocytes are coordinated by lineage-specific transcriptional programs. Here, Maqbool et al. performed a wide epigenomic and transcriptional analysis of mouse T cell differentiation. These data provide new insights into the role of multiple enhancers and PRC2 in controlling alternative promoter choice during differentiation.</content>

 Nemes-Baran et al. show that ameboid microglia engulf living oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) during brain development. Fractalkine receptor-deficient microglia exhibit a reduction in engulfment of OPCs, resulting in a surplus of oligodendrocytes and impaired myelination. These data provide evidence that microglia phagocytose OPCs as a homeostatic mechanism required for normal myelination.</content>

Genome-scale metabolic models have been utilized extensively in the study and engineering of the organisms they describe. Here we present the analysis of a published dataset from pooled transposon mutant fitness experiments as an approach for improving the accuracy and gene-reaction associations of a metabolic model for &lt;i&gt;Zymomonas mobilis&lt;/i&gt; ZM4, an industrially relevant ethanologenic organism with extremely high glycolytic flux and low biomass yield. Gene essentiality predictions made by the draft model were compared to data from individual pooled mutant experiments to identify areas of the model requiring deeper validation. Subsequent experiments showed that some of the discrepancies between the model and dataset were caused by polar effects, mis-mapped barcodes, or mutants carrying both wild-type and transposon disrupted gene copies—highlighting potential limitations inherent to data from individual mutants in these high-throughput datasets. Therefore, we analyzed correlations in fitness scores across all 492 experiments in the dataset in the context of functionally related metabolic reaction modules identified within the model via flux coupling analysis. These correlations were used to identify candidate genes for a reaction in histidine biosynthesis lacking an annotated gene and highlight metabolic modules with poorly correlated gene fitness scores. Additional genes for reactions involved in biotin, ubiquinone, and pyridoxine biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mobilis&lt;/i&gt; were identified and confirmed using mutant complementation experiments. These discovered genes, were incorporated into the final model, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;ZM4_478, which contains 747 metabolic and transport reactions (of which 612 have gene-protein-reaction associations), 478 genes, and 616 unique metabolites, making it one of the most complete models of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mobilis&lt;/i&gt; ZM4 to date. The methods of analysis that we applied here with the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mobilis&lt;/i&gt; transposon mutant dataset, could easily be utilized to improve future genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for organisms where these, or similar, high-throughput datasets are available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PsAz6cdGilc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Complexity of cell-type composition has created much skepticism surrounding the interpretation of bulk tissue transcriptomic studies. Recent studies have shown that deconvolution algorithms can be applied to computationally estimate cell-type proportions from gene expression data of bulk blood samples, but their performance when applied to brain tissue is unclear. Here, we have generated an immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset for five major cell-types from brain tissue of 70 individuals, who also have bulk cortical gene expression data. With the IHC data as the benchmark, this resource enables quantitative assessment of deconvolution algorithms for brain tissue. We apply existing deconvolution algorithms to brain tissue by using marker sets derived from human brain single cell and cell-sorted RNA-seq data. We show that these algorithms can indeed produce informative estimates of constituent cell-type proportions. In fact, neuronal subpopulation can also be estimated from bulk brain tissue samples. Further, we show that including the cell-type proportion estimates as confounding factors is important for reducing false associations between Alzheimer’s disease phenotypes and gene expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that using more accurate marker sets can substantially improve statistical power in detecting cell-type specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/irKCm4qd2IE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Understanding the behavior of emerging disease outbreaks in, or ahead of, real-time could help healthcare officials better design interventions to mitigate impacts on affected populations. Most healthcare-based disease surveillance systems, however, have significant inherent reporting delays due to data collection, aggregation, and distribution processes. Recent work has shown that machine learning methods leveraging a combination of traditionally collected epidemiological information and novel Internet-based data sources, such as disease-related Internet search activity, can produce meaningful “nowcasts” of disease incidence ahead of healthcare-based estimates, with most successful case studies focusing on endemic and seasonal diseases such as influenza and dengue. Here, we apply similar computational methods to emerging outbreaks in geographic regions where no historical presence of the disease of interest has been observed. By combining limited available historical epidemiological data available with disease-related Internet search activity, we retrospectively estimate disease activity in five recent outbreaks weeks ahead of traditional surveillance methods. We find that the proposed computational methods frequently provide useful real-time incidence estimates that can help fill temporal data gaps resulting from surveillance reporting delays. However, the proposed methods are limited by issues of sample bias and skew in search query volumes, perhaps as a result of media coverage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7qNYE1HPEY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Congestive heart failure is characterized by suppressed cardiac output and arterial filling pressure, leading to renal retention of salt and water, contributing to further volume overload. Mathematical modeling provides a means to investigate the integrated function and dysfunction of heart and kidney in heart failure. This study updates our previously reported integrated model of cardiac and renal functions to account for the fluid exchange between the blood and interstitium across the capillary membrane, allowing the simulation of edema. A state of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-rEF) was then produced by altering cardiac parameters reflecting cardiac injury and cardiovascular disease, including heart contractility, myocyte hypertrophy, arterial stiffness, and systemic resistance. After matching baseline characteristics of the SOLVD clinical study, parameters governing rates of cardiac remodeling were calibrated to describe the progression of cardiac hemodynamic variables observed over one year in the placebo arm of the SOLVD clinical study. The model was then validated by reproducing improvements in cardiac function in the enalapril arm of SOLVD. The model was then applied to prospectively predict the response to the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin, which has been shown to reduce heart failure events in HF-rEF patients in the recent DAPAHF clinical trial by incompletely understood mechanisms. The simulations predict that dapagliflozin slows cardiac remodeling by reducing preload on the heart, and relieves congestion by clearing interstitial fluid without excessively reducing blood volume. This provides a quantitative mechanistic explanation for the observed benefits of SGLT2i in HF-rEF. The model also provides a tool for further investigation of heart failure drug therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QHGzKTEFaqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The human body generates a diverse set of high affinity antibodies, the soluble form of B cell receptors (BCRs), that bind to and neutralize invading pathogens. The natural development of BCRs must be understood in order to design vaccines for highly mutable pathogens such as influenza and HIV. BCR diversity is induced by naturally occurring combinatorial “V(D)J” rearrangement, mutation, and selection processes. Most current methods for BCR sequence analysis focus on separately modeling the above processes. Statistical phylogenetic methods are often used to model the mutational dynamics of BCR sequence data, but these techniques do not consider all the complexities associated with B cell diversification such as the V(D)J rearrangement process. In particular, standard phylogenetic approaches assume the DNA bases of the progenitor (or “naive”) sequence arise independently and according to the same distribution, ignoring the complexities of V(D)J rearrangement. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to Bayesian phylogenetic inference for BCR sequences that is based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). This technique not only integrates a naive rearrangement model with a phylogenetic model for BCR sequence evolution but also naturally accounts for uncertainty in all unobserved variables, including the phylogenetic tree, via posterior distribution sampling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qLRRuowrcjE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Brain networks are complex dynamical systems in which directed interactions between different areas evolve at the sub-second scale of sensory, cognitive and motor processes. Due to the highly non-stationary nature of neural signals and their unknown noise components, however, modeling dynamic brain networks has remained one of the major challenges in contemporary neuroscience. Here, we present a new algorithm based on an innovative formulation of the Kalman filter that is optimized for tracking rapidly evolving patterns of directed functional connectivity under unknown noise conditions. The Self-Tuning Optimized Kalman filter (STOK) is a novel adaptive filter that embeds a self-tuning memory decay and a recursive regularization to guarantee high network tracking accuracy, temporal precision and robustness to noise. To validate the proposed algorithm, we performed an extensive comparison against the classical Kalman filter, in both realistic surrogate networks and real electroencephalography (EEG) data. In both simulations and real data, we show that the STOK filter estimates time-frequency patterns of directed connectivity with significantly superior performance. The advantages of the STOK filter were even clearer in real EEG data, where the algorithm recovered latent structures of dynamic connectivity from epicranial EEG recordings in rats and human visual evoked potentials, in excellent agreement with known physiology. These results establish the STOK filter as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic network structures in biological systems, with the potential to yield new insights into the rapid evolution of network states from which brain functions emerge.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ooTHPC5MWFo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In humans, most germline mutations are inherited from the father. This observation has been widely interpreted as reflecting the replication errors that accrue during spermatogenesis. If so, the male bias in mutation should be substantially lower in a closely related species with similar rates of spermatogonial stem cell divisions but a shorter mean age of reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we resequenced two 3–4 generation nuclear families (totaling 29 individuals) of olive baboons (&lt;i&gt;Papio anubis&lt;/i&gt;), who reproduce at approximately 10 years of age on average, and analyzed the data in parallel with three 3-generation human pedigrees (26 individuals). We estimated a mutation rate per generation in baboons of 0.57×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; per base pair, approximately half that of humans. Strikingly, however, the degree of male bias in germline mutations is approximately 4:1, similar to that of humans—indeed, a similar male bias is seen across mammals that reproduce months, years, or decades after birth. These results mirror the finding in humans that the male mutation bias is stable with parental ages and cast further doubt on the assumption that germline mutations track cell divisions. Our mutation rate estimates for baboons raise a further puzzle, suggesting a divergence time between apes and Old World monkeys of 65 million years, too old to be consistent with the fossil record; reconciling them now requires not only a slowdown of the mutation rate per generation in humans but also in baboons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QGpYdxUwXag&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Pleiotropy—when a single mutation affects multiple traits—is a controversial topic with far-reaching implications. Pleiotropy plays a central role in debates about how complex traits evolve and whether biological systems are modular or are organized such that every gene has the potential to affect many traits. Pleiotropy is also critical to initiatives in evolutionary medicine that seek to trap infectious microbes or tumors by selecting for mutations that encourage growth in some conditions at the expense of others. Research in these fields, and others, would benefit from understanding the extent to which pleiotropy reflects inherent relationships among phenotypes that correlate no matter the perturbation (vertical pleiotropy). Alternatively, pleiotropy may result from genetic changes that impose correlations between otherwise independent traits (horizontal pleiotropy). We distinguish these possibilities by using clonal populations of yeast cells to quantify the inherent relationships between single-cell morphological features. Then, we demonstrate how often these relationships underlie vertical pleiotropy and how often these relationships are modified by genetic variants (quantitative trait loci [QTL]) acting via horizontal pleiotropy. Our comprehensive screen measures thousands of pairwise trait correlations across hundreds of thousands of yeast cells and reveals ample evidence of both vertical and horizontal pleiotropy. Additionally, we observe that the correlations between traits can change with the environment, genetic background, and cell-cycle position. These changing dependencies suggest a nuanced view of pleiotropy: biological systems demonstrate limited pleiotropy in any given context, but across contexts (e.g., across diverse environments and genetic backgrounds) each genetic change has the potential to influence a larger number of traits. Our method suggests that exploiting pleiotropy for applications in evolutionary medicine would benefit from focusing on traits with correlations that are less dependent on context.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/59QPqP1-vk8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Role of β3‐adrenergic receptor in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in mouse cerebellar cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ecc76698-d57a-417b-b6e5-9dbc43346f7f/jnr24712-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study is the first to investigate the localization and function of β3‐adrenoreceptor (AR) in the mouse cerebellum. The immunohistochemical analysis allowed us to demonstrate that β3‐AR is mainly expressed on Purkinje cells. In addition, we found that blocking β3‐AR interfered with motor learning and synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell. The molecular mechanisms underlying the β3‐AR action are likely related to the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergent lines of evidence have recently highlighted β3‐adrenoreceptors (ARs) as a potentially critical target in the regulation of nervous and behavioral functions, including memory consolidation, anxiety, and depression. Nevertheless, the role of β3‐ARs in the cerebellum has been never investigated. To address this issue, we first examined the effects of pharmacological manipulation of β3‐ARs on motor learning in mice. We found that blockade of β3‐ARs by SR 59230A impaired the acquisition of the rotarod task with no effect on general locomotion. Since the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell (PF–PC) synapse is considered to be the main cerebellar locus of motor learning, we assessed β3‐AR modulatory action on this synapse as well as its expression in cerebellar slices. We demonstrate, for the first time, a strong expression of β3‐ARs on Purkinje cell soma and dendrites. In addition, whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings revealed that bath application of β3‐AR agonist CL316,243 depressed the PF–PC excitatory postsynaptic currents via a postsynaptic mechanism mediated by the PI3K signaling pathway. Application of CL316,243 also interfered with the expression of PF long‐term potentiation, whereas SR 59230A prevented the induction of LTD at PF–PC synapse. These results underline the critical role of β3‐AR on cerebellar synaptic transmission and plasticity and provide a new mechanism for adrenergic modulation of motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Walking animals such as invertebrates can effectively perform self-organized and robust locomotion. They can also quickly adapt their gait to deal with injury or damage. Such a complex achievement is mainly performed via coordination between the legs, commonly known as interlimb coordination. Several components underlying the interlimb coordination process (like distributed neural control circuits, local sensory feedback, and body-environment interactions during movement) have been recently identified and applied to the control systems of walking robots. However, while the sensory pathways of biological systems are plastic and can be continuously readjusted (referred to as sensory adaptation), those implemented on robots are typically static. They first need to be manually adjusted or optimized offline to obtain stable locomotion. In this study, we introduce a fast learning mechanism for online sensory adaptation. It can continuously adjust the strength of sensory pathways, thereby introducing flexible plasticity into the connections between sensory feedback and neural control circuits. We combine the sensory adaptation mechanism with distributed neural control circuits to acquire the adaptive and robust interlimb coordination of walking robots. This novel approach is also general and flexible. It can automatically adapt to different walking robots and allow them to perform stable self-organized locomotion as well as quickly deal with damage within a few walking steps. The adaptation of plasticity after damage or injury is considered here as lesion-induced plasticity. We validated our adaptive interlimb coordination approach with continuous online sensory adaptation on simulated 4-, 6-, 8-, and 20-legged robots. This study not only proposes an adaptive neural control system for artificial walking systems but also offers a possibility of invertebrate nervous systems with flexible plasticity for locomotion and adaptation to injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence has classically been associated with aging. Intriguingly, recent studies have also unraveled key roles for senescence in embryonic development, regeneration, and reprogramming. Developmental senescence has been reported during embryonic development in different organisms and structures, such as the endolymphatic duct during inner ear development of mammals and birds. However, there is no study addressing the possible role of senescence on otic neurogenesis. TGFβ/SMAD is the best-known pathway linked to the induction of developmentally programmed cell senescence. Here, we studied if TGFβ2 induces cellular senescence during acoustic-vestibular-ganglion (AVG) formation. Using organotypic cultures of AVG, and characterizing different stages of otic neurogenesis in the presence of TGFβ2 and a selective TGF-β receptor type-I inhibitor, we show that TGFβ2 exerts a powerful action in inner ear neurogenesis but, contrary to what we recently observed during endolymphatic duct development, these actions are independent of cellular senescence. We show that TGFβ2 reduces proliferation, and induces differentiation and neuritogenesis of neuroblasts, without altering cell death. Our studies highlight the roles of TGFβ2 and cellular senescence in the precise regulation of cell fate within the developing inner ear and its different cell types, being their mechanisms of action highly cell-type dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Fusion of intracellular trafficking vesicles is mediated by the assembly of SNARE proteins into membrane-bridging complexes. SNARE-mediated membrane fusion requires Sec1/Munc18-family (SM) proteins, SNARE chaperones that can function as templates to catalyze SNARE complex assembly. Paradoxically, the SM protein Munc18-1 traps the Qa-SNARE protein syntaxin-1 in an autoinhibited closed conformation. Here we present the structure of a second SM–Qa-SNARE complex, Vps45–Tlg2. Strikingly, Vps45 holds Tlg2 in an open conformation, with its SNARE motif disengaged from its Habc domain and its linker region unfolded. The domain 3a helical hairpin of Vps45 is unfurled, exposing the presumptive R-SNARE binding site to allow template complex formation. Although Tlg2 has a pronounced tendency to form homo-tetramers, Vps45 can rescue Tlg2 tetramers into stoichiometric Vps45–Tlg2 complexes. Our findings demonstrate that SM proteins can engage Qa-SNAREs using at least two different modes, one in which the SNARE is closed and one in which it is open.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The eukaryotic replisome assembles around the CMG helicase, which stably associates with DNA replication forks throughout elongation. When replication terminates, CMG is ubiquitylated on its Mcm7 subunit and disassembled by the Cdc48 / p97 ATPase. Until now, the regulation that restricts CMG ubiquitylation to termination was unknown, as was the mechanism of disassembly. By reconstituting these processes with purified budding yeast proteins, we show that ubiquitylation is tightly repressed throughout elongation by the Y-shaped DNA structure of replication forks. Termination removes the repressive DNA structure, whereupon long K48-linked ubiquitin chains are conjugated to CMG-Mcm7, dependent on multiple replisome components that bind to the ubiquitin ligase SCF&lt;sup&gt;Dia2&lt;/sup&gt;. This mechanism pushes CMG beyond a '5-ubiquitin threshold' that is inherent to Cdc48, which specifically unfolds ubiquitylated Mcm7 and thereby disassembles CMG. These findings explain the exquisite regulation of CMG disassembly and provide a general model for the disassembly of ubiquitylated protein complexes by Cdc48.</content>

 Molecular-glue degraders mediate interactions between target proteins and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to cause selective protein degradation. Here, we report a new molecular glue HQ461 discovered by high-throughput screening. Using loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic screening in human cancer cells followed by biochemical reconstitution, we show that HQ461 acts by promoting an interaction between CDK12 and DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK12-interacting protein Cyclin K (CCNK). Degradation of CCNK mediated by HQ461 compromised CDK12 function, leading to reduced phosphorylation of a CDK12 substrate, downregulation of DNA damage response genes, and cell death. Structure-activity relationship analysis of HQ461 revealed the importance of a 5-methylthiazol-2-amine pharmacophore and resulted in an HQ461 derivate with improved potency. Our studies reveal a new molecular glue that recruits its target protein directly to DDB1 to bypass the requirement of a substrate-specific receptor, presenting a new strategy for targeted protein degradation.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in tau distribution across the brain of older adults, using positron emission tomography (PET), and investigate how these differences might associate with cognitive trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were 343 clinically‐normal individuals (Female,58%; 73.8[8.5] years) and 55 individuals with MCI (Female,38%; 76.9[7.3] years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We examined &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐Flortaucipir (FTP)‐PET signal across 41 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs). Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP‐signal for each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions between sex*Aβ‐PET(+/‐) and sex*APOEε4 status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between a composite of sex‐differentiated tau ROIs and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Females showed significantly higher FTP‐signal than males across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (p&amp;lt;0.007). Aβ‐moderated sex differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio‐lateral temporal regions (p&amp;lt;0.007); Aβ+ females exhibited greater FTP‐signal than other groups. APOEε4‐moderated sex differences in FTP‐signal were only found in the lateral occipital lobe. Females with higher FTP‐signal in composite ROI exhibited faster cognitive decline than males (p=0.04).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tau vulnerability in females is not just limited to the medial temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive decline. Interactive effects of sex and Aβ were predominantly localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra‐temporal tau highlights the possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in females with the onset of clinical symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal association of blood biomarkers of total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with common sporadic AD and cognitive decline are not established.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays for serum concentrations of total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured in a population sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a clinical evaluation for AD, completed in‐home cognitive assessments, and undergone 1.5T structural MRI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD, especially, the time‐specific associations were notable: t‐tau 8–16 years, and Nf‐L and GFAP 4–8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years: baseline t‐tau above 0.40 pg/mL had 30% faster decline, Nf‐L above 25.5 pg/mL had 110% faster decline, and GFAP above 232 pg/mL had 130% faster decline compared to those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP above 232 pg/mL showed 160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those below 160 pg/mL. Additionally, higher baseline t‐tau was associated with faster increase in third ventricular volume, and baseline Nf‐L and GFAP were associated with faster decline in cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s dementia&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Central nervous system‐infiltrated immune cells induce calcium increase in astrocytes via astroglial purinergic signaling&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3ca61cca-a627-44af-bb60-1bd51977cf31/jnr24699-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application of the central nervous system (CNS)‐infiltrated immune cells induces a rapid increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in cultured naïve astrocytes through glial purinergic receptor‐mediated signaling. This provides an insight into the astroglial response to the immune cells in their local environment in CNS autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction between autoreactive immune cells and astroglia is an important part of the pathologic processes that fuel neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. In this inflammatory disease, immune cells enter into the central nervous system (CNS) and they spread through CNS parenchyma, but the impact of these autoreactive immune cells on the activity pattern of astrocytes has not been defined. By exploiting naïve astrocytes in culture and CNS‐infiltrated immune cells (CNS IICs) isolated from rat with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), here we demonstrate previously unrecognized properties of immune cell–astrocyte interaction. We show that CNS IICs but not the peripheral immune cell application, evokes a rapid and vigorous intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase in astrocytes by promoting glial release of ATP. ATP propagated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation through glial purinergic P2X7 receptor activation by the hemichannel‐dependent nucleotide release mechanism. Astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase is specifically triggered by the autoreactive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell application and these two cell types exhibit close spatial interaction in EAE. Therefore, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals may mediate a rapid astroglial response to the autoreactive immune cells in their local environment. This property of immune cell–astrocyte interaction may be important to consider in studies interrogating CNS autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), a subset of chronic active white matter lesions are identifiable on MRI by their paramagnetic rims, and increasing evidence supports their association with clinical disease severity. Here we study their potential role in differential diagnosis, screening an international multicenter clinical research‐based sample of 438 individuals affected by different neurological conditions (MS, other inflammatory, infectious, and non‐inflammatory). Paramagnetic rim lesion detection, rarely occurring in other neurological conditions (52% of MS vs 7% of non‐MS cases), yielded high specificity (93%) in differentiating MS from non‐MS. Future prospective multicenter studies should further validate its role as a diagnostic biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The brain of the African wild dog. II. The olfactory system&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ad1ac5ac-5f7f-480c-a16e-42dab1a4cf69/cne25007-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb of the brain of the African wild dog. Stereological estimates of the numbers of glomeruli reveal that the African wild dog has up to 1700 glomeruli. Scale bar = 250 μm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing a range of neuroanatomical stains, we detail the organization of the main and accessory olfactory systems of the African wild dog. The organization of both these systems follow that typically observed in mammals, but variations of interest were noted. Within the main olfactory bulb, the size of the glomeruli, at approximately 350 μm in diameter, are on the larger end of the range observed across mammals. In addition, we estimate that approximately 3,500 glomeruli are present in each main olfactory bulb. This larger main olfactory bulb glomerular size and number of glomeruli indicates that enhanced peripheral processing of a broad range of odorants is occurring in the main olfactory bulb of the African wild dog. Within the accessory olfactory bulb, the glomeruli did not appear distinct, rather forming a homogenous syncytia‐like arrangement as seen in the domestic dog. In addition, the laminar organization of the deeper layers of the accessory olfactory bulb was indistinct, perhaps as a consequence of the altered architecture of the glomeruli. This arrangement of glomeruli indicates that rather than parcellating the processing of semiochemicals peripherally, these odorants may be processed in a more nuanced and combinatorial manner in the periphery, allowing for more rapid and precise behavioural responses as required in the highly social group structure observed in the African wild dog. While having a similar organization to that of other mammals, the olfactory system of the African wild dog has certain features that appear to correlate to their environmental niche.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Vector control has been a key component in the fight against malaria for decades, and chemical insecticides are critical to the success of vector control programs worldwide. However, increasing resistance to insecticides threatens to undermine these efforts. Understanding the evolution and propagation of resistance is thus imperative to mitigating loss of intervention effectiveness. Additionally, accelerated research and development of new tools that can be deployed alongside existing vector control strategies is key to eradicating malaria in the near future. Methods such as gene drives that aim to genetically modify large mosquito populations in the wild to either render them refractory to malaria or impair their reproduction may prove invaluable tools. Mathematical models of gene flow in populations, which is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another through migration, can offer invaluable insight into the behavior and potential impact of gene drives as well as the spread of insecticide resistance in the wild. Here, we present the first multi-locus, agent-based model of vector genetics that accounts for mutations and a many-to-many mapping cardinality of genotypes to phenotypes to investigate gene flow, and the propagation of gene drives in Anopheline populations. This model is embedded within a large scale individual-based model of malaria transmission representative of a high burden, high transmission setting characteristic of the Sahel. Results are presented for the selection of insecticide-resistant vectors and the spread of resistance through repeated deployment of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), in addition to scenarios where gene drives act in concert with existing vector control tools such as ITNs. The roles of seasonality, spatial distribution of vector habitat and feed sites, and existing vector control in propagating alleles that confer phenotypic traits via gene drives that result in reduced transmission are explored. The ability to model a spectrum of vector species with different genotypes and phenotypes in the context of malaria transmission allows us to test deployment strategies for existing interventions that reduce the deleterious effects of resistance and allows exploration of the impact of new tools being proposed or developed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bTY4nEQilzM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In the last decade, there has been tremendous progress in identifying genetic anomalies linked to clinical disease. New experimental platforms have connected genetic variants to mechanisms underlying disruption of cellular and organ behavior and the emergence of proarrhythmic cardiac phenotypes. The development of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) signifies an important advance in the study of genetic disease in a patient-specific context. However, considerable limitations of iPSC-CM technologies have not been addressed: 1) phenotypic variability in apparently identical genotype perturbations, 2) low-throughput electrophysiological measurements, and 3) an immature phenotype which may impact translation to adult cardiac response. We have developed a computational approach intended to address these problems. We applied our recent iPSC-CM computational model to predict the proarrhythmic risk of 40 KCNQ1 genetic variants. An I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; computational model was fit to experimental data for each mutation, and the impact of each mutation was simulated in a population of iPSC-CM models. Using a test set of 15 KCNQ1 mutations with known clinical long QT phenotypes, we developed a method to stratify the effects of KCNQ1 mutations based on proarrhythmic markers. We utilized this method to predict the severity of the remaining 25 KCNQ1 mutations with unknown clinical significance. Tremendous phenotypic variability was observed in the iPSC-CM model population following mutant perturbations. A key novelty is our reporting of the impact of individual KCNQ1 mutant models on adult ventricular cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, allowing for prediction of mutant impact across the continuum of aging. This serves as a first step toward translating predicted response in the iPSC-CM model to predicted response of the adult ventricular myocyte given the same genetic mutation. As a whole, this study presents a new computational framework that serves as a high throughput method to evaluate risk of genetic mutations based-on proarrhythmic behavior in phenotypically variable populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cDA4WPN2SKQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Antibiotic resistance is rising and we urgently need to gain a better quantitative understanding of how antibiotics act, which in turn would also speed up the development of new antibiotics. Here, we describe a computational model (COMBAT-COmputational Model of Bacterial Antibiotic Target-binding) that can quantitatively predict antibiotic dose-response relationships. Our goal is dual: We address a fundamental biological question and investigate how drug-target binding shapes antibiotic action. We also create a tool that can predict antibiotic efficacy a priori. COMBAT requires measurable biochemical parameters of drug-target interaction and can be directly fitted to time-kill curves. As a proof-of-concept, we first investigate the utility of COMBAT with antibiotics belonging to the widely used quinolone class. COMBAT can predict antibiotic efficacy in clinical isolates for quinolones from drug affinity (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;gt;0.9). To further challenge our approach, we also do the reverse: estimate the magnitude of changes in drug-target binding based on antibiotic dose-response curves. We overexpress target molecules to infer changes in antibiotic-target binding from changes in antimicrobial efficacy of ciprofloxacin with 92–94% accuracy. To test the generality of our approach, we use the beta-lactam ampicillin to predict target molecule occupancy at MIC from antimicrobial action with 90% accuracy. Finally, we apply COMBAT to predict antibiotic concentrations that can select for resistance due to novel resistance mutations. Using ciprofloxacin and ampicillin as well defined test cases, our work demonstrates that drug-target binding is a major predictor of bacterial responses to antibiotics. This is surprising because antibiotic action involves many additional effects downstream of drug-target binding. In addition, COMBAT provides a framework to inform optimal antibiotic dose levels that maximize efficacy and minimize the rise of resistant mutants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RlDIbe95eSM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Inference of admixture proportions is a classical statistical problem in population genetics. Standard methods implicitly assume that both parents of an individual have the same admixture fraction. However, this is rarely the case in real data. In this paper we show that the distribution of admixture tract lengths in a genome contains information about the admixture proportions of the ancestors of an individual. We develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework for estimating the admixture proportions of the immediate ancestors of an individual, i.e. a type of decomposition of an individual’s admixture proportions into further subsets of ancestral proportions in the ancestors. Based on a genealogical model for admixture tracts, we develop an efficient algorithm for computing the sampling probability of the genome from a single individual, as a function of the admixture proportions of the ancestors of this individual. This allows us to perform probabilistic inference of admixture proportions of ancestors only using the genome of an extant individual. We perform extensive simulations to quantify the error in the estimation of ancestral admixture proportions under various conditions. To illustrate the utility of the method, we apply it to real genetic data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QimDbNlEa14&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genetic studies have recently highlighted the importance of fat distribution, as well as overall adiposity, in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated diseases. Using a large study (n = 1,288) from 4 independent cohorts, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mean adipocyte area and obesity-related traits, and identify genetic factors associated with adipocyte cell size. To perform the first large-scale study of automatic adipocyte phenotyping using both histological and genetic data, we developed a deep learning-based method, the Adipocyte U-Net, to rapidly derive mean adipocyte area estimates from histology images. We validate our method using three state-of-the-art approaches; CellProfiler, Adiposoft and floating adipocytes fractions, all run blindly on two external cohorts. We observe high concordance between our method and the state-of-the-art approaches (Adipocyte U-net vs. CellProfiler: &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;visceral&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.94, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;subcutaneous&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.91, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;), and faster run times (10,000 images: 6mins vs 3.5hrs). We applied the Adipocyte U-Net to 4 cohorts with histology, genetic, and phenotypic data (total N = 820). After meta-analysis, we found that mean adipocyte area positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;subq&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.13 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−69&lt;/sup&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;subq&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.45; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;visc&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−55&lt;/sup&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;visc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.49; average &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; across cohorts = 0.49) and that adipocytes in subcutaneous depots are larger than their visceral counterparts (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;meta&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;). Lastly, we performed the largest GWAS and subsequent meta-analysis of mean adipocyte area and intra-individual adipocyte variation (N = 820). Despite having twice the number of samples than any similar study, we found no genome-wide significant associations, suggesting that larger sample sizes and a homogenous collection of adipose tissue are likely needed to identify robust genetic associations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2gUxo07LOqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The dynamic signal encoding paradigm suggests that information flows from the extracellular environment into specific signaling patterns (encoding) that are then read by downstream effectors to control cellular behavior. Previous work empirically quantified the information content of dynamic signaling patterns. However, whether this information can be faithfully transmitted to the gene expression level is unclear. Here we used NFkB signaling as a model to understand the accuracy of information transmission from signaling dynamics into gene expression. Using a detailed mathematical model, we simulated realistic NFkB signaling patterns with different degrees of variability. The NFkB patterns were used as an input to a simple gene expression model. Analysis of information transmission between ligand and NFkB and ligand and gene expression allows us to determine information loss in transmission between receptors to dynamic signaling patterns and between signaling dynamics to gene expression. Information loss could occur due to biochemical noise or due to a lack of specificity. We found that noise-free gene expression has very little information loss suggesting that gene expression can preserve specificity in NFkB patterns. As expected, the addition of noise to the gene expression model results in information loss. Interestingly, this effect can be mitigated by a specific choice of parameters that can substantially reduce information loss due to biochemical noise during gene expression. Overall our results show that the cellular capacity for information transmission from dynamic signaling patterns to gene expression can be high enough to preserve ligand specificity and thereby the accuracy of cellular response to environmental cues.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wDtY4jRy0Sw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

New treatments for diseases caused by antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms can be developed by identifying unexplored therapeutic targets and by designing efficient drug screening protocols. In this study, we have screened a library of compounds to find ligands for the flavin-adenine dinucleotide synthase (FADS) -a potential target for drug design against tuberculosis and pneumonia- by implementing a new and efficient virtual screening protocol. The protocol has been developed for the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; search of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets, for which limited information about ligands or ligand-receptor structures is available. It implements an integrative funnel-like strategy with filtering layers that increase in computational accuracy. The protocol starts with a pharmacophore-based virtual screening strategy that uses ligand-free receptor conformations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Then, it performs a molecular docking stage using several docking programs and an exponential consensus ranking strategy. The last filter, samples the conformations of compounds bound to the target using MD simulations. The MD conformations are scored using several traditional scoring functions in combination with a newly-proposed score that takes into account the fluctuations of the molecule with a Morse-based potential. The protocol was optimized and validated using a compound library with known ligands of the &lt;i&gt;Corynebacterium ammoniagenes&lt;/i&gt; FADS. Then, it was used to find new FADS ligands from a compound library of 14,000 molecules. A small set of 17 &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; filtered molecules were tested experimentally. We identified five inhibitors of the activity of the flavin adenylyl transferase module of the FADS, and some of them were able to inhibit growth of three bacterial species: &lt;i&gt;C. ammoniagenes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, where the two are human pathogens. Overall, the results show that the integrative VS protocol is a cost-effective solution for the discovery of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ysLfvTPFjIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance and virulence in pathogenic bacteria underlies a major public health issue. Understanding how, in the absence of antibiotic-mediated selection, plasmid-bearing cells avoid being outnumbered by plasmid-free cells is key to developing counterstrategies. Here, we quantified the induction of the plasmidial sex pheromone pathway of &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; to show that the integration of the stimulatory (mate-sensing) and inhibitory (self-sensing) signaling modules from the pCF10 conjugative plasmid provides a precise measure of the recipient-to-donor ratio, agnostic to variations in population size. Such ratiometric control of conjugation favors vertical plasmid transfer under low mating likelihood and allows activation of conjugation functions only under high mating likelihood. We further show that this strategy constitutes a cost-effective investment into mating effort because overstimulation produces unproductive self-aggregation and growth rate reduction. A mathematical model suggests that ratiometric control of conjugation increases plasmid fitness and predicts a robust long-term, stable coexistence of donors and recipients. Our results demonstrate how population-level parameters can control transfer of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, opening the door for biotic control strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RVMc99MAxj4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and other determinants and incident impulse control disorder behaviors (ICBs) in patients with early Parkinson disease (PD) using longitudinal data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four hundred one newly diagnosed PD patients were prospectively evaluated at baseline (BL), month 6, and annually for 5 years. Probable RBD (pRBD) was assessed with the RBD Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ) and dichotomized using a cutoff value of ≥6. The association of BL and time‐dependent (TD) pRBD and other covariates with the development of ICB symptoms was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression and general estimating equation logistic regression. Models considered adjustment for age, sex, Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS‐15), RBD medication use, total levodopa equivalent daily dose, and dopamine agonist (DA) and antidepressant medication use.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both BL pRBD and TD pRBD were not associated with an increased risk for incident ICB symptoms after adjustment for covariates (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.458 and HR = 1.27, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.257, respectively). In a modified TD pRBD model (ie, considering subjects as pRBD onward from the first time point with RBDSQ score ≥ 6), the risk for incident ICB symptoms was higher in pRBD in unadjusted (HR = 1.48, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.038) but not adjusted (HR = 1.29, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.203) models. TD DA use (HR = 1.64, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.039), TD GDS‐15 score (HR = 1.12, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and male sex (year 3: HR = 2.10, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009; year 4: HR = 3.04, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; year 5: HR = 4.40, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) were associated with increased ICB symptom risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pRBD is not clearly associated with ICB symptom development in early PD, in contrast to DA use, depression, and male sex. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Myasthenic syndromes are typically characterized by muscle weakness and increased fatigability due to an impaired transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Most cases are caused by acquired autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis (MG), typically with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Different drugs are among the major factors that may complicate pre-existing autoimmune myasthenic conditions by further impairing transmission at the NMJ. Some clinical observations are substantiated by experimental data, indicating that presynaptic, postsynaptic or more complex pathomechanisms at the NMJ may be involved, depending on the individual compound. Most robust data exist for the risks associated with some antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, ketolides, fluoroquinolones) and cardiovascular medications (e.g., class Ia antiarrhythmics, beta blockers). Apart from primarily autoimmune-mediated disorders of the NMJ, de novo myasthenic manifestations may also be triggered by medical treatments that induce an autoimmune reaction. Most notably, there is growing evidence that the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), a modern class of drugs to treat various malignancies, represent a relevant risk factor to develop severe and progressive medication-induced myasthenia via an immune-mediated mechanism. From a clinical perspective, it is of utmost importance for the treating physicians to be aware of such adverse treatment effects and their consequences. In this article, we aim to summarize existing evidence regarding the key molecular and immunological mechanisms as well as the clinical implications of medication-aggravated and medication-induced myasthenic syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal polarization and growth are developmental processes that occur during neuronal cell differentiation. The molecular signaling mechanisms involved in these events in in vivo mammalian brain remain unclear. Also, cellular events of the neuronal polarization process within a given neuron are thought to be constituted of many independent intracellular signal transduction pathways (the “tug-of-war” model). However, in vivo results suggest that such pathways should be cooperative with one another among a given group of neurons in a region of the brain. Lipid rafts, specific membrane domains with low fluidity, are candidates for the hotspots of such intracellular signaling. Among the signals reported to be involved in polarization, a number are thought to be present or translocated to the lipid rafts in response to extracellular signals. As part of our analysis, we discuss how such novel molecular mechanisms are combined for effective regulation of neuronal polarization and growth, focusing on the significance of the lipid rafts, including results based on recently introduced methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) are inherited degenerative retinal dystrophies with vision loss that ultimately lead to blindness. Several genes have been shown to be involved in early onset retinal dystrophies, including CRB1 and RPE65. Gene therapy recently became available for young RP patients with variations in the RPE65 gene. Current research programs test adeno-associated viral gene augmentation or editing therapy vectors on various disease models mimicking the disease in patients. These include several animal and emerging human-derived models, such as human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal organoids or hiPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and human donor retinal explants. Variations in the CRB1 gene are a major cause for early onset autosomal recessive RP with patients suffering from visual impairment before their adolescence and for LCA with newborns experiencing severe visual impairment within the first months of life. These patients cannot benefit yet from an available gene therapy treatment. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances, advantages and disadvantages of different CRB1 human and animal retinal degeneration models. In addition, we will describe novel therapeutic tools that have been developed, which could potentially be used for retinal gene augmentation therapy for RP patients with variations in the CRB1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the only output neurons of the vertebrate retina, integrating signals from other retinal neurons and transmitting information to the visual centers of the brain. The death of RGCs is a common outcome in many optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma, demyelinating optic neuritis and ischemic optic neuropathy, resulting in visual defects and blindness. There are currently no therapies in clinical use which can prevent RGC death in optic neuropathies; therefore, the identification of new targets for supporting RGC survival is crucial in the development of novel treatments for eye diseases. In this study we identify that the receptor tyrosine kinase, Tyro3, is critical for normal neuronal function in the adult mouse retina. The loss of Tyro3 results in a reduction in photoreceptor and RGC function as measured using electroretinography. The reduction in RGC function was associated with a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer and fewer RGCs. In the central retina, independent of the loss of RGCs, Tyro3 deficiency resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of RGC dendrites in the inner plexiform layer. Our results show that Tyro3 has a novel, previously unidentified role in retinal function, RGC survival and RGC morphology. The Tyro3 pathway could therefore provide an alternative, targetable pathway for RGC protective therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Gait disturbance accompanies many neurodegenerative diseases; it is characteristic for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Treatment of advanced PD often includes deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus. Regarding gait, previous studies have reported non-significant or conflicting results, possibly related to methodological limitations.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of this prospective study was to assess the effects of DBS on biomechanical parameters of gait in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one patients with advanced PD participated in this prospective study. Gait was examined in all patients using the Zebris FDM-T pressure-sensitive treadmill (Isny, Germany) before DBS implantation and after surgery immediately, further immediately after the start of neurostimulation, and 3 months after neurostimulator activation. We assessed spontaneous gait on a moving treadmill at different speeds. Step length, stance phase of both lower limbs, double-stance phase, and cadence were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In this study, step length increased, allowing the cadence to decrease. Double-stance phase duration, that is, the most sensitive parameter of gait quality and unsteadiness, was reduced, in gait at a speed of 4.5 km/h and in the narrow-based gaits at 1 km/h (tandem gait), which demonstrates improvement.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study suggests positive effects of DBS treatment on gait in PD patients. Improvement was observed in several biomechanical parameters of gait.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A population of neural stem cells (NSCs) dwelling in the dentate gyrus (DG) is able to generate neurons throughout adult life in the hippocampus of most mammals. These NSCs generate also astrocytes naturally and are capable of generating oligodendrocytes after gene manipulation. It has been more recently shown that adult hippocampal NSCs after epileptic seizures as well as subventricular zone NSCs after stroke can give rise to reactive astrocytes (RAs). In the hippocampus, the induction of seizures triggers the conversion of NSCs into reactive NSCs (React-NSCs) characterized by a drastic morphological transformation, abnormal migration, and massive activation or entry into the cell cycle to generate more React-NSCs that ultimately differentiate into RAs. In the search for tools to investigate the properties of React-NSCs, we have explored the LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic line of mice in which hippocampal NSCs are specifically labeled due to the expression of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). We first addressed the validity of the transgene expression as true marker of LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; expression and then demonstrated how, after seizures, LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP labeled exclusively React-NSCs for several weeks. Then React-NSCs lost LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP expression as neurons of the granule cell layer started to express it. Finally, we used knockout for LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; transgenic mice to show that LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; plays a functional role in the activation of React-NSCs. Thus, we confirmed that LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP expression is a valid tool to study both NSCs and React-NSCs and that the LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; pathway could be a target in the intent to preserve NSCs after seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In patients with gliomas, motor deficits are not always observed, even though tumor cells infiltrate into the motor area. Currently, it is recognized that this phenomenon can occur through the neuroplasticity potential. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of motor functional reorganization in gliomas. Out of 100 consecutive patients who underwent awake surgery, 29 patients were assessed as regards their motor function and were retrospectively explored to determine whether positive motor responses were elicited. A total of 73 positive mapping sites from 27 cases were identified, and their spatial anatomical locations and activated region by functional MRI were analyzed. Additionally, the factors promoting neuroplasticity were analyzed through multiple logistic regression analysis. As a result, a total of 60 points (21 cases) were found in place, while 13 points (17.8%) were found to be shifted from anatomical localization. Reorganizations were classified into three categories: Type 1 (move to ipsilateral different gyrus) was detected at nine points (four cases), and they moved into the postcentral gyrus. Type 2 (move within the ipsilateral precentral gyrus) was detected at four points (two cases). Unknown type (two cases) was categorized as those whose motor functional cortex was moved to other regions, although we could not find the compensated motor area. Two factors for the onset of reorganization were identified: tumor cells infiltrate into the primary motor area and repeated surgery (p &amp;lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0070, respectively). Our study demonstrated that compensation can occur mainly in two ways, and it promoted repeated surgery and infiltration of tumor into the primary motor area.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Meditation has shown to benefit a wide range of conditions and symptoms, but the neural mechanisms underlying the practice remain unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have investigated the structural brain changes due to the practice by examining volume, density, or cortical thickness changes. However, these studies have focused on adults; meditation’s structural effects on the adolescent brain remain understudied. In this study, we investigated how meditation training affects the structure of the adolescent brain by scanning a group of 38 adolescents (16.48 ± 1.29 years) before and after participating in a 12-week meditation training. Subjects underwent Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA), a program that mainly incorporates elements from mindfulness meditation and yoga-based practices. A subset of the adolescents also received an additional control scan 12 weeks before TARA. We conducted voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess gray matter volume changes pre- to post-training and during the control period. Subjects showed significant gray matter (GM) volume decreases in the left posterior insula and to a lesser extent in the left thalamus and left putamen after meditation training. There were no significant changes during the control period. Our results support previous findings that meditation affects regions associated with physical and emotional awareness. However, our results are different from previous morphometric studies in which meditation was associated with structural increases. We posit that this discrepancy may be due to the differences between the adolescent brain and the adult brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Humans’ interactions with each other or with socially competent machines exhibit lawful coordination patterns at multiple levels of description. According to Coordination Dynamics, such laws specify the flow of coordination states produced by functional synergies of elements (e.g., cells, body parts, brain areas, people…) that are temporarily organized as single, coherent units. These coordinative structures or synergies may be mathematically characterized as informationally coupled self-organizing dynamical systems (Coordination Dynamics). In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientific method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB’s evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Two themes have puzzled the research on developmental and learning disorders for decades. First, some of the risk and protective factors behind developmental challenges are suggested to be shared and some are suggested to be specific for a given condition. Second, language-based learning difficulties like dyslexia are suggested to result from or correlate with non-linguistic aspects of information processing as well. In the current study, we investigated how adults with developmental dyslexia or ADHD as well as healthy controls cluster across various dimensions designed to tap the prominent non-linguistic theories of dyslexia. Participants were 18–55-year-old adults with dyslexia (n = 36), ADHD (n = 22), and controls (n = 35). Non-linguistic theories investigated with experimental designs included temporal processing impairment, abnormal cerebellar functioning, procedural learning difficulties, as well as visual processing and attention deficits. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to investigate the emerging groups and patterns of results across these experimental designs. LPA suggested three groups: (1) a large group with average performance in the experimental designs, (2) participants predominantly from the clinical groups but with enhanced conditioning learning, and (3) participants predominantly from the dyslexia group with temporal processing as well as visual processing and attention deficits. Despite the presence of these distinct patterns, participants did not cluster very well based on their original status, nor did the LPA groups differ in their dyslexia or ADHD-related neuropsychological profiles. Remarkably, the LPA groups did differ in their intelligence. These results highlight the continuous and overlapping nature of the observed difficulties and support the multiple deficit model of developmental disorders, which suggests shared risk factors for developmental challenges. It also appears that some of the risk factors suggested by the prominent non-linguistic theories of dyslexia relate to the general level of functioning in tests of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: Motor skill learning already triggers the functional reorganization of regional brain activity after short periods of training. Recent studies suggest that microstructural change may emerge at similar timescales, but the spatiotemporal profiles of functional and structural plasticity have rarely been traced in parallel. Recently, we demonstrated that 5 days of endoscopic skill training induces changes in task-related brain activity in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and other areas of the frontoparietal grasping network. Here, we analyzed microstructural data, collected during the same experiment to investigate if microstructural plasticity overlaps temporally and spatially with the training-induced changes in task-related brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine students were divided into a full-routine group (n = 20), that underwent three endoscopy training sessions in the MR-scanner as well as a 5-day virtual reality (VR)-endoscopy training and a brief-routine group (n = 19), that only performed the in-scanner endoscopy training sessions. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were collected at baseline, after the first and after the last VR-training session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The full-routine group showed significant FA changes in a left-hemispheric subcortical cluster underlying the PMv region, for which we previously demonstrated functional plasticity during endoscopy training in the same sample. Functional (task-related fMRI) and structural (FA) changes showed the largest change from the first to the second scan, suggesting similar temporal dynamics. In the full-routine group, the FA change in the subcortical cluster underlying the left PMv scaled positively with the individual improvement in endoscopic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Microstructural white-matter plasticity mirrors the spatiotemporal profile of task-dependent plasticity during a 5-day course of endoscopy skill training. The observed similarities motivate future research on the interplay between functional and structural plasticity during early skill acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Computer interaction via visually guided hand movements often employs either abstract cursor-based feedback or virtual hand (VH) representations of varying degrees of realism. The effect of changing this visual feedback in virtual reality settings is currently unknown. In this study, 19 healthy right-handed adults performed index finger movements (“action”) and observed movements (“observation”) with four different types of visual feedback: a simple circular cursor (CU), a point light (PL) pattern indicating finger joint positions, a shadow cartoon hand (SH) and a realistic VH. Finger movements were recorded using a data glove, and eye-tracking was recorded optically. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both action and observation conditions showed stronger fMRI signal responses in the occipitotemporal cortex compared to baseline. The action conditions additionally elicited elevated bilateral activations in motor, somatosensory, parietal, and cerebellar regions. For both conditions, feedback of a hand with a moving finger (SH, VH) led to higher activations than CU or PL feedback, specifically in early visual regions and the occipitotemporal cortex. Our results show the stronger recruitment of a network of cortical regions during visually guided finger movements with human hand feedback when compared to a visually incomplete hand and abstract feedback. This information could have implications for the design of visually guided tasks involving human body parts in both research and application or training-related paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cochlear implants (CIs) are the most successful treatment for severe-to-profound deafness in children. However, speech outcomes with a CI often lag behind those of normally-hearing children. Some authors have attributed these deficits to the takeover of the auditory temporal cortex by vision following deafness, which has prompted some clinicians to discourage the rehabilitation of pediatric CI recipients using visual speech. We studied this cross-modal activity in the temporal cortex, along with responses to auditory speech and non-speech stimuli, in experienced CI users and normally-hearing controls of school-age, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Strikingly, CI users displayed significantly greater cortical responses to visual speech, compared with controls. Importantly, in the same regions, the processing of auditory speech, compared with non-speech stimuli, did not significantly differ between the groups. This suggests that visual and auditory speech are processed synergistically in the temporal cortex of children with CIs, and they should be encouraged, rather than discouraged, to use visual speech.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Learning print-speech sound correspondences is a crucial step at the beginning of reading acquisition and often impaired in children with developmental dyslexia. Despite increasing insight into audiovisual language processing, it remains largely unclear how integration of print and speech develops at the neural level during initial learning in the first years of schooling. To investigate this development, 32 healthy, German-speaking children at varying risk for developmental dyslexia (17 typical readers and 15 poor readers) participated in a longitudinal study including behavioral and fMRI measurements in first (T1) and second (T2) grade. We used an implicit audiovisual (AV) non-word target detection task aimed at characterizing differential activation to congruent (AVc) and incongruent (AVi) audiovisual non-word pairs. While children’s brain activation did not differ between AVc and AVi pairs in first grade, an incongruency effect (AVi &amp;gt; AVc) emerged in bilateral inferior temporal and superior frontal gyri in second grade. Of note, pseudoword reading performance improvements with time were associated with the development of the congruency effect (AVc &amp;gt; AVi) in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) from first to second grade. Finally, functional connectivity analyses indicated divergent development and reading expertise dependent coupling from the left occipito-temporal and superior temporal cortex to regions of the default mode (precuneus) and fronto-temporal language networks. Our results suggest that audiovisual integration areas as well as their functional coupling to other language areas and areas of the default mode network show a different development in poor vs. typical readers at varying familial risk for dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cellular protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is indispensable to the survival and function of all cells. Distinct from other cell types, neurons are long-lived, exhibiting architecturally complex and diverse multipolar projection morphologies that can span great distances. These properties present unique demands on proteostatic machinery to dynamically regulate the neuronal proteome in both space and time. Proteostasis is regulated by a distributed network of cellular processes, the proteostasis network (PN), which ensures precise control of protein synthesis, native conformational folding and maintenance, and protein turnover and degradation, collectively safeguarding proteome integrity both under homeostatic conditions and in the contexts of cellular stress, aging, and disease. Dendrites are equipped with distributed cellular machinery for protein synthesis and turnover, including dendritically trafficked ribosomes, chaperones, and autophagosomes. The PN can be subdivided into an adaptive network of three major functional pathways that synergistically govern protein quality control through the action of (1) protein synthesis machinery; (2) maintenance mechanisms including molecular chaperones involved in protein folding; and (3) degradative pathways (e.g., Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), endolysosomal pathway, and autophagy. Perturbations in any of the three arms of proteostasis can have dramatic effects on neurons, especially on their dendrites, which require tightly controlled homeostasis for proper development and maintenance. Moreover, the critical importance of the PN as a cell surveillance system against protein dyshomeostasis has been highlighted by extensive work demonstrating that the aggregation and/or failure to clear aggregated proteins figures centrally in many neurological disorders. While these studies demonstrate the relevance of derangements in proteostasis to human neurological disease, here we mainly review recent literature on homeostatic developmental roles the PN machinery plays in the establishment, maintenance, and plasticity of stable and dynamic dendritic arbors. Beyond basic housekeeping functions, we consider roles of PN machinery in protein quality control mechanisms linked to dendritic plasticity (e.g., dendritic spine remodeling during LTP); cell-type specificity; dendritic morphogenesis; and dendritic pruning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The retina and the olfactory bulb are the gateways to the visual and olfactory systems, respectively, similarly using neural networks to initiate sensory signal processing. Sensory receptors receive signals that are transmitted to neural networks before projecting to primary cortices. These networks filter sensory signals based on their unique features and adjust their sensitivities by gain control systems. Interestingly, dopamine modulates sensory signal transduction in both systems. In the retina, dopamine adjusts the retinal network for daylight conditions (“light adaptation”). In the olfactory system, dopamine mediates lateral inhibition between the glomeruli, resulting in odorant signal decorrelation and discrimination. While dopamine is essential for signal discrimination in the olfactory system, it is not understood whether dopamine has similar roles in visual signal processing in the retina. To elucidate dopaminergic effects on visual processing, we conducted patch-clamp recording from second-order retinal bipolar cells, which exhibit multiple types that can convey different temporal features of light. We recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by various frequencies of sinusoidal light in the absence and presence of a dopamine receptor 1 (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R) agonist or antagonist. Application of a D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist, SKF-38393, shifted the peak temporal responses toward higher frequencies in a subset of bipolar cells. In contrast, a D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist, SCH-23390, reversed the effects of SKF on these types of bipolar cells. To examine the mechanism of dopaminergic modulation, we recorded voltage-gated currents, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, and low-voltage activated (LVA) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. SKF modulated HCN and LVA currents, suggesting that these channels are the target of D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling to modulate visual signaling in these bipolar cells. Taken together, we found that dopamine modulates the temporal tuning of a subset of retinal bipolar cells. Consequently, we determined that dopamine plays a role in visual signal processing, which is similar to its role in signal decorrelation in the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with typical amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregations. Elimination of the Aβ precursors via the kidneys makes the organ a potential factor in the systemic degeneration leading to AD. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) exerts neuroprotective effects in AD and plays a protective role in kidney pathologies. Increased physical activity is preventive of the formation of AD, but its detailed mechanism and possible connections with PACAP have not been clarified. In the kidneys of AD mice, the effects of physical activity were investigated by comparing wild-type and AD organs. Aβ plaque formation was reduced in AD kidneys after increased training (TAD). Mechanotransduction elevated PACAP receptor expression in TAD mice and normalized the protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated pathways. BMP4/BMPR1 elevation activated Smad1 expression and normalized collagen type IV in TAD animals. In conclusion, our data suggest that elevated physical activity can prevent the AD-induced pathological changes in the kidneys via, at least in part, the activation of PACAP–BMP signaling crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Squamata is one of the richest and most diverse extant groups. The present study investigates the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunopositive elements of five lizard and three snake species; each represents a different family. The study continues our former studies on bird, turtle, and caiman brains. Although several studies have been published on lizards, they usually only investigated one species. Almost no data are available on snakes. The animals were transcardially perfused. Immunoperoxidase reactions were performed with a mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP (Novocastra). The original radial ependymoglia is enmeshed by secondary, non-radial processes almost beyond recognition in several brain areas like in other reptiles. Astrocytes occur but only as complementary elements like in caiman but unlike in turtles, where astrocytes are absent. In most species, extended areas are free of GFAP—a meaningful difference from other reptiles. The predominance of astrocytes and the presence of areas free of GFAP immunopositivity are characteristic of birds and mammals; therefore, they must be apomorphic features of Squamata, which appeared independently from the evolution of avian glia. However, these features show a high diversity; in some lizards, they are even absent. There was no principal difference between the glial structures of snakes and lizards. In conclusion, the glial structure of Squamata seems to be the most apomorphic one among reptiles. The high diversity suggests that its evolution is still intense. The comparison of identical brain areas with different GFAP contents in different species may promote understanding the role of GFAP in neuronal networks. Our findings are in accordance with the supposal based on our previous studies that the GFAP-free areas expand during evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Iron concentration in the brain has been suggested as a biomarker of pathologic neurodegeneration. However, the iron concentration changes in healthy aging as well. This study aimed to quantify the age-related changes in iron concentration in the gray matter of healthy rhesus monkeys using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Three-dimensional gradient-echo images of 16 female rhesus monkey brains aged between 2 and 26 years were acquired in vitro. The susceptibilities in the brain regions of the caudate nucleus (Cd), putamen (Pt), globus pallidus (Gp), and substantia nigra (Sn) were analyzed. The susceptibility varied across different brain regions, with higher levels in the Gp and Sn. Susceptibilities in all analyzed brain regions were linearly correlated with age, yet the plateau period as observed in human brains was absent. This is the first in vitro report of the age-related variability of susceptibility in the deep gray matter of rhesus monkey brains at 9.4 T, with an isotropic resolution of 150 μm. Awareness of age-related changes in susceptibility is vital for the establishment of a baseline to facilitate the differentiation of pathologic neurodegeneration from healthy aging in non-human primate studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor and cognitive deficits that negatively impact on activities of daily living. While dopaminergic medications are used to attenuate motor symptoms, adjuvant therapies such as acoustic-based non-pharmacological interventions are used as a complement to standard drug treatments. At present, preliminary studies of acoustic-based interventions such as rhythmic-auditory stimulation (RAS) and vibroacoustic therapy (VAT) suggest two competing hypotheses: (1) RAS may recruit alternative motor networks that may bypass faulty spatiotemporal motor networks of movement in PD; or (2) the use of RAS enhances BG function through entrainment of beta oscillatory activities. In this mini review article, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the role of acoustic-based interventions and how it may serve to improve motor deficits such as gait impairments and tremors. We further provide suggestions for future work that may use a combination of RAS, VAT, and physical therapy to improve motor function in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Extensive research using water-diffusion MRI reported age-related modifications of cerebral White Matter (WM). Moreover, water-diffusion parameter modifications have been frequently associated with cognitive performances in the elderly sample, reinforcing the idea of aging inducing microstructural disconnection of the brain which in turn impacts cognition. However, only few studies really assessed over-time modifications of these parameters and their relationship with episodic memory outcome of elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: One-hundred and thirty elderly subjects without dementia (74.1 ± 4.1 years; 47% female) were included in this study. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed at two-time points (3.49 ± 0.68 years apart), allowing the assessment of changes in water-diffusion parameters over time using a specific longitudinal pipeline. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden and gray matter (GM) atrophy were also measured on FLAIR and T1-weighted sequences collected during these two MRI sessions. Free and cued verbal recall scores assessed at the last follow-up of the cohort were used as episodic memory outcome. Changes in water-diffusion parameters over time were included in serial linear regression models to predict retrieval or storage ability of elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: GM atrophy and an increase in mean diffusivity (MD) and WMH load between the two-time points were observed. The increase in MD was significantly correlated with WMH load and the different memory scores. In models accounting for the baseline cognitive score, GM atrophy, or WMH load, MD changes still significantly predict free verbal recall, and not total verbal recall, suggesting the specific association with the retrieval deficit in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In elderly, microstructural WM changes are good predictors of lower free verbal recall performances. Moreover, this contribution is not only driven by WMH load increase. This last observation is in line with studies reporting early water-diffusion modification in WM tissue during aging, resulting lately in the appearance of WMH on conventional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal loss, cognitive impairment, and aphasia. Aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide in the brain is considered a key mechanism in the development of AD. In the past 20 years, many compounds have been developed to inhibit Aβ aggregation and accelerate its degradation. Platycladus orientalis seed is a traditional Chinese medicine used to enhance intelligence and slow aging. We previously found that Platycladus orientalis seed extract (EPOS) inhibited Aβ-peptide aggregation in the hippocampus and reduced cognitive deficits in 5×FAD mice. However, the mechanisms of these effects have not been characterized. To characterize the protective mechanisms of EPOS, we used a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL4176 model to perform Bioactivity-guided identification of active compounds. Four active compounds, comprising communic acid, isocupressic acid, imbricatolic acid, and pinusolide, were identified using 13C-and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, we showed that isocupressic acid inhibited Aβ generation by modulating BACE1 activity via the GSK3β/NF-κB pathway in HEK293-APPsw cells. These findings showed that EPOS reduced cognitive deficits in an AD model via modulation of the Aβ peptide aggregation pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine whether osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with a change in adjusted hippocampal volumes (HpVR: hippocampal/intracranial volume × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over time among cognitively normal older people.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of OA with HpVR among individuals with normal cognition (NC) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. At baseline, a total of 372 individuals with NC were included.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the cross-sectional analyses of baseline data, we did not find a significant relationship between OA and HpVR among individuals with NC. However, in the longitudinal analyses, OA was significantly associated with change in HpVR over time among individuals with NC. Specifically, compared with individuals without OA, those with OA showed a faster decline in HpVR over time when controlling for other potential confounders, including age, educational attainment, gender, and APOE4 genotype.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;OA status was significantly associated with a change in HpVR over time among individuals with NC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

We study the genotype-phenotype maps of 80 quantitative phenotypes in the model plant &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, by representing the genotypes affecting each phenotype as a genotype network. In such a network, each vertex or node corresponds to an individual’s genotype at all those genomic loci that affect a given phenotype. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the associated genotypes differ in exactly one nucleotide. The 80 genotype networks we analyze are based on data from genome-wide association studies of 199 &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thaliana&lt;/i&gt; accessions. They form connected graphs whose topography differs substantially among phenotypes. We focus our analysis on the incidence of epistasis (non-additive interactions among mutations) because a high incidence of epistasis can reduce the accessibility of evolutionary paths towards high or low phenotypic values. We find epistatic interactions in 67 phenotypes, and in 51 phenotypes every pairwise mutant interaction is epistatic. Moreover, we find phenotype-specific differences in the fraction of accessible mutational paths to maximum phenotypic values. However, even though epistasis affects the accessibility of maximum phenotypic values, the relationships between genotypic and phenotypic change of our analyzed phenotypes are sufficiently smooth that some evolutionary paths remain accessible for most phenotypes, even where epistasis is pervasive. The genotype network representation we use can complement existing approaches to understand the genetic architecture of polygenic traits in many different organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OvgRp6w03Vg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of diagnosed fatal encephalitis in humans caused by the classical Borna disease virus (BoDV‐1) is increasingly recognized, ever since it was proven that BoDV‐1 can cause human infections. However, awareness for this entity is low and a specific imaging pattern has not yet been identified. We therefore provide the first comprehensive description on the morphology of human BoDV‐1 encephalitis with histopathological verification of imaging abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an institutional review board (IRB)‐approved multi‐center study, we retrospectively analyzed 55 MRI exams of 19 patients with confirmed BoDV‐1 encephalitis. Fifty brain regions were systematically analyzed (T1w, T2w, T2*w, T1w + Gd, DWI) in order to discern a specific inflammation pattern. Histopathological analysis of 25 locations of one patient served as correlation for MRI abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline imaging, acquired at a mean of 11 ± 10 days after symptom onset, as well as follow‐up scans of 16 patients revealed characteristic T2‐hyperintensities with predilection for the head of the caudate nucleus, insula and cortical spread to the limbic system, whereas occipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres were unaffected. This gradient was confirmed by histology. Nine patients (47.4%) developed T1‐hyperintensities of the basal ganglia, corresponding to accumulated lipid phagocytes on histology and typical for late‐stage necrosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BoDV‐1 encephalitis shows a distinct inflammation pattern in both the early and late stages of the disease. Its appearance can mimic sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (sCJD) on MRI and should be considered a differential diagnosis in the case of atypical clinical presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution and overlap of entorhinal, premotor, and amygdalar connections in the monkey anterior cingulate cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/32dec15c-737f-4364-9f38-f2a5bb8c9940/cne24986-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional tracer injections in macaque monkey entorhinal cortex (EC), amygdala (AMY), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMC) reveal distinct distributions across the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We show that EC and PMC connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) ACC, while AMY connections are evenly distributed. These distinct ACC networks are likely important for temporal integration and affective, contextual, and motor processing in flexible goal‐directed behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for decision‐making as it integrates motor plans with affective and contextual limbic information. Disruptions in these networks have been observed in depression, bipolar disorder, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. Yet, overlap of limbic and motor connections within subdivisions of the ACC is not well understood. Hence, we administered a combination of retrograde and anterograde tracers into structures important for contextual memories (entorhinal cortex), affective processing (amygdala), and motor planning (dorsal premotor cortex) to assess overlap of labeled projection neurons from (outputs) and axon terminals to (inputs) the ACC of adult rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;). Our data show that entorhinal and dorsal premotor cortical (dPMC) connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) subregions of the ACC, while amygdalar connections are more evenly distributed across subregions. Among all areas, the rostral ACC (A32) had the lowest relative density of connections with all three regions. In the ventral ACC, entorhinal and amygdalar connections strongly overlap across all layers, especially in A25. In the dorsal ACC, outputs to dPMC and the amygdala strongly overlap in deep layers. However, dPMC input to the dorsal ACC was densest in deep layers, while amygdalar inputs predominantly localized in upper layers. These connection patterns are consistent with diverse roles of the dorsal ACC in motor evaluation and the ventral ACC in affective and contextual memory. Further, distinct laminar circuits suggest unique interactions within specific ACC compartments that are likely important for the temporal integration of motor and limbic information during flexible goal‐directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of neurobiologists have long abandoned the Cartesian view of non-human animals as unconscious automatons—acknowledging instead the high likelihood that mammals and birds have mental experiences akin to subjective consciousness. Several lines of evidence are now extending those limits to all vertebrates and even some invertebrates, though graded in degrees as argued originally by Darwin, correlated with the complexity of the animal’s brain. A principal argument for this view is that the function of consciousness is to promote the survival of an animal—especially one actively moving about—in the face of dynamic changes and real-time contingencies. Cognitive ecologists point to the unique features of each animal’s environment and the specific behavioral capabilities that different environments invoke, thereby suggesting that consciousness must take on a great variety of forms, many of which differ substantially from human subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Oscillatory neural activity in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical (CBGTC) loop is associated with the motor state of a subject, but also with the availability of modulatory neurotransmitters. For example, increased low-frequency oscillations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are related to decreased levels of dopamine and have been proposed as biomarkers to adapt and optimize therapeutic interventions, such as deep brain stimulation. Using neural oscillations as biomarkers require differentiating between changes in oscillatory patterns associated with parkinsonism vs. those related to a subject’s motor state. To address this point, we studied the correlation between neural oscillatory activity in the motor cortex and striatum and varying degrees of motor activity under normal and parkinsonian conditions. Using rats with bilateral or unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions as PD models, we correlated the motion index (MI)—a measure based on the physical acceleration of the head of rats—to the local field potential (LFP) oscillatory power in the 1–80 Hz range. In motor cortices and striata, we observed a robust correlation between the motion index and the oscillatory power in two main broad frequency ranges: a low-frequency range [5.0–26.5 Hz] was negatively correlated to motor activity, whereas a high-frequency range [35.0–79.9 Hz] was positively correlated. We observed these correlations in both normal and parkinsonian conditions. In addition to these general changes in broad-band power, we observed a more restricted narrow-band oscillation [25–40 Hz] in dopamine-denervated hemispheres. This oscillation, which seems to be selective to the parkinsonian state, showed a linear frequency dependence on the concurrent motor activity level. We conclude that, independently of the parkinsonian condition, changes in broad-band oscillatory activities of cortico-basal ganglia networks (including changes in the relative power of low- and high-frequency bands) are closely correlated to ongoing motions, most likely reflecting he operations of these neural circuits to control motor activity. Hence, biomarkers based on neural oscillations should focus on specific features, such as narrow frequency bands, to allow differentiation between parkinsonian states and physiological movement-dependent circuit modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Atypical white matter (WM) microstructure is commonly implicated in the neuropathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Fixel based analysis (FBA), at the cutting-edge of diffusion-weighted imaging, can account for crossing WM fibers and can provide indices of both WM micro- and macrostructure. We applied FBA to investigate WM structure between 25 (12 males, 13 females) adults with ASD and 24 (12 males, 12 females) matched controls. As the role of biological sex on the neuropathophysiology of ASD is of increasing interest, this was also explored. There were no significant differences in WM micro- or macrostructure between adults with ASD and matched healthy controls. When data were stratified by sex, females with ASD had reduced fiber density and cross-section (FDC), a combined metric comprised of micro- and macrostructural measures, in the corpus callosum, a finding not detected between the male sub-groups. We conclude that micro- and macrostructural WM aberrations are present in ASD, and may be influenced by biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the aberrant deposition of protein in the brain and is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Increasingly, there have been reports of the presence of these protein hallmarks in the retina. In this study, we assayed the retina of 5xFAD mice, a transgenic model of amyloid deposition known to exhibit dementia-like symptoms with age. Using OCT, we found that the retinal nerve fiber layer was thinner in 5xFAD at 6, 12, and 17 months of age compared with wild-type littermates, but the inner plexiform layer was thicker at 6 months old. Retinal function showed reduced ganglion cell responses to light in 5xFAD at 6, 12, and 17 months of age. This functional loss was observed in the outer retina at 17 months of age but not in younger mice. We showed using immunohistochemistry and ELISA that soluble and insoluble amyloid was present in the retina and brain at all ages. In conclusion, we report that amyloid is present in brain and retina of 5xFAD mice and that the pattern of neuronal dysfunction occurs in the inner retina at the early ages and progresses to encompass the outer retina with age. This implies that the inner retina is more sensitive to amyloid changes in early disease and that the outer retina is also affected with disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The study of cognitive impairment associated with hearing loss has recently garnered considerable interest. Epidemiological data have demonstrated that hearing loss is a risk factor for cognitive decline as a result of aging. However, no previous study has examined the effect of hearing loss in patients with cognitive problems such as Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, we investigated the effect of conductive hearing loss in an Alzheimer’s mouse model. Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to evaluate changes in glucose metabolism and gray matter concentrations in the 5xFAD Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) transgenic mouse model with and without conductive hearing loss (HL). Conductive hearing loss was induced using chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane. Behavioral data from the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests revealed greater memory deficits in the AD with HL (AD-HL) group than in the AD group. Following induction of hearing loss, lower cerebral glucose metabolism in the frontal association cortex was observed in the AD-HL group than in the AD group. Although lower glucose metabolism in the hippocampus and cerebellum was found in the AD-HL group than in the AD group at 3 months, the gray matter concentrations in these regions were not significantly different between the groups. Furthermore, the gray matter concentrations in the simple lobule, cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, substantia nigra, retrosigmoid nucleus, medial geniculate nucleus, and anterior pretectal nucleus at 7 months were significantly lower in the AD-HL group than in the AD group. Taken together, these results indicate that even partial hearing loss can aggravate memory impairment in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: We aimed to evaluate the activity of the human glymphatic system in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using diffusion tensor image analysis along with the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Diffusion tensor images were acquired to calculate the diffusivities in the direction of the x-axis (right-to-left; Dx), y-axis (anterior-to-posterior; Dy), and z-axis (inferior-to-superior; Dz) of the plane of the lateral ventricle body in 20 patients with type 2 diabetes and 10 people in a control group. We evaluated the diffusivity along with the perivascular spaces, as well as the projection fibers and association fibers, separately. The analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS-index) was defined as the mean (Dxpro, Dypro)/mean (Dypro, Dzasc), where the Dxpro and Dxasc were the Dx values in the projection and association fiber areas, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There were significant differences in diffusivity along the projection fibers and the association fibers among the groups. The significant differences among the groups along the perivascular spaces, shown as the ALPS-index and medical history of T2DM, indicating lower water diffusivity along the perivascular space concerning type 2 diabetes severity, was also observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Lower diffusivity along the perivascular space on DTI-APLS can reflect impairment of the glymphatic system in T2DM. This study showed that the activity of the glymphatic system could be evaluated by diffusion tensor image analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Field potential (FP) oscillations are believed to coordinate brain activity over large spatiotemporal scales, with specific features (e.g., phase and power) in discrete frequency bands correlated with motor output. Furthermore, complex correlations between oscillations in distinct frequency bands (phase-amplitude, amplitude-amplitude, and phase-phase coupling) are commonly observed. However, the mechanisms underlying FP-behavior correlations and cross-frequency coupling remain unknown. The thalamus plays a central role in generating many circuit-level neural oscillations, and single-unit activity in motor thalamus (Mthal) is correlated with behavioral output. We, therefore, hypothesized that motor thalamic spiking coordinates motor system FPs and underlies FP-behavior correlations. To investigate this possibility, we recorded wideband motor thalamic (Mthal) electrophysiology as healthy rats performed a two-alternative forced-choice task. Delta (1–4 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), low gamma (30–70 Hz), and high gamma (70–200 Hz) power were strongly modulated by task performance. As in the cortex, the delta phase was correlated with beta/low gamma power and reaction time. Most interestingly, subpopulations of Mthal neurons defined by their relationship to the behavior exhibited distinct relationships with FP features. Specifically, neurons whose activity was correlated with action selection and movement speed were entrained to delta oscillations. Furthermore, changes in their activity anticipated power fluctuations in beta/low gamma bands. These complex relationships suggest mechanisms for commonly observed FP-FP and spike-FP correlations, as well as subcortical influences on motor output.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a heterogeneous brain region, containing different neuronal populations. During in vivo recordings, electrophysiological characteristics are classically used to distinguish the different populations. However, the VTA is also considered as a region harboring neurons with heterogeneous properties. In the present study, we aimed to classify VTA neurons using in silico approaches, in an attempt to determine if homogeneous populations could be extracted. Thus, we recorded 291 VTA neurons during in vivo extracellular recordings in anesthetized rats. Initially, 22 neurons with high firing rates (&amp;gt;10 Hz) and short-lasting action potentials (AP) were considered as a separate subpopulation, in light of previous studies. To segregate the remaining 269 neurons, presumably dopaminergic (DA), we performed in silico analyses, using a combination of different electrophysiological parameters. These parameters included: (1) firing rate; (2) firing rate coefficient of variation (CV); (3) percentage of spikes in a burst; (4) AP duration; (5) Δt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; duration (i.e., time from initiation of depolarization until end of repolarization); and (6) presence of a notched AP waveform. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed two neuronal populations that differed in their bursting activities. The largest population presented low bursting activities (&amp;lt;17.5% of total spikes in burst), while the remaining neurons presented higher bursting activities (&amp;gt;17.5%). Within non-high-firing neurons, a large heterogeneity was noted concerning AP characteristics. In conclusion, this analysis based on conventional electrophysiological criteria clustered two subpopulations of putative DA VTA neurons that are distinguishable by their firing patterns (firing rates and bursting activities) but not their AP properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a recently characterized inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Elamipretide (SS-31), a mitochondrial-targeted peptide with multiple pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory activity, has been demonstrated to protect against many neurological diseases. However, the effect of elamipretide on pyroptosis in PND has not been studied. We established an animal model of PND by performing an exploratory laparotomy on mice under isoflurane anesthesia and examined the effects of elamipretide on cognitive function, synaptic integrity, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial function, and signaling controlling pyroptosis. Our results showed that anesthesia and surgery caused mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal morphology, activation of canonicalnod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis, and downregulation of synaptic integrity-related proteins in the hippocampus in aged mice, thus leading to learning and memory deficits in behavioral tests. Remarkably, treatment with the mitochondrial-targeted peptide elamipretide not only had protective effects against mitochondrial dysfunction but also attenuated surgery-induced pyroptosis and cognitive deficits. Our results provide a promising strategy for the treatment of PND involving mitochondrial dysfunction and pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-related chronic inflammatory activation of microglia and their dysfunction are observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, and the potential contributions of these dysfunctional cells to neurodegeneration have been demonstrated recently. The housekeeping and defensive functions of microglia, such as surveying the brain parenchyma and phagocytosis of neuronal debris after injury, are important for brain homeostasis and immunity. During neurodegenerative diseases, loss of these functions can promote disease pathology by producing proinflammatory cytokines and increasing oxidative stress, which can exaggerate the ongoing neuroinflammation. A recent surge in microglial research has unraveled myriads of microglial phenotypes associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases, in addition to the conventional M1/M2 paradigm. Each of these phenotypes can be characterized by distinct transcriptional profiles as well as altered metabolism, migration, and phagocytosis characteristics. Mutations in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) and granulin (GRN) are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, and these genes are dysregulated in the majority of recently identified microglial phenotypes. These genes act as checkpoint regulators and maintain microglial inflammatory fitness, principally through metabolic modulation. Dysfunctional microglia typically show mitochondrial deficits, glycolysis elevation, and lipid droplet accumulation, which results in reduced migration and phagocytosis and increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion and reactive oxygen species release. In this mini-review article, we discuss the existing data regarding metabolic perturbations in dysfunctional microglia and their documented associations with neurodegeneration, highlighting how aging-induced chronic microglial activation alters microglial bioenergetics, leading to impaired homeostatic and housekeeping functions. Dysfunctional microglia initiate or exacerbate neurodegeneration, and key pathways involved in the dysfunctional processes, including metabolism, may represent potential intervention targets for correcting imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced during abnormal and normal physiological conditions. Understanding the expression profile of microRNA (miRNA) in plasma-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and their roles in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that cause cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Sprague Dawley rats (250–300 g) were allocated to sham or SAH groups established using endovascular perforation method. miRNA expression profiles of plasma sEVs in both groups (each n = 4) were evaluated using next-generation sequencing (NGS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were 142 microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly expressed differently between the two groups, of which 73 were up-regulated while 69 were down-regulated in SAH sEVs compared with those of sham (p &amp;lt; 0.05; fold change ≥ 2). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of differently expressed (DE) miRNAs revealed signaling pathways and target genes (TGs) in the SAH group. rno-miR-185-5p, rno-miR-103-3p, rno-miR-15b-3p, rno-miR-93-5p, and rno-miR-98-5p were the top five most up-regulated sEVs miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that miRNA can be selectively packaged into sEVs under SAH, and this could help develop potential targets for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CVS after this condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Controlling the proinflammatory response of microglia by targeting chemokines (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) could be an important therapeutic approach for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Here, through JEV infection to BV2 microglia and young BALB/c mice, we investigated that CCR2 is highly upregulated after JEV infection and plays a key role in determining microglia activation phenotype and associated with neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators of TNF-α and IFNγ. In addition, we found JEV infection to BV2 microglia causes an increase in microglial proliferation and cell body area at day 1 and day 3. Using the agonist molecule of CCR2 inhibition; RS102895, significantly reduces microglia reactive phenotype and nitric oxide production. Further, to define the role of CCR2 in functional responses of microglia and their activation phenotype, we performed in vitro cell scratch functional assay and ImageJ analysis. When compared with control, microglia cells showed a significant increase in elongated or rod-like activated phenotype in JEV-infected cells at 24 h post-infection and CCR2 inhibition significantly reduced the elongated activation phenotype induced by JEV infection, suggesting that CCR2 acts as a critical regulator for microglia activation phenotype after JEV infection. We found that JEV-infected mice treated with RS102895 had less microglia activation and reduced mRNA expression of CCR2 and proinflammatory mediators such as IFN-γ in cortical tissue. Collectively, our data indicate that CCR2 drives reactive phenotype of microglia and its inhibition reduces microglia activation and neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators after JEV infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Chromosomal abnormality causes congenital and acquired intractable diseases. In general, there are no fundamental treatments for these diseases. To establish platforms to develop therapeutics for these diseases, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are highly beneficial. To study abnormal chromosomal diseases, it is often hard to apply animal disease models because the chromosomal structures are variable among species. It is also difficult to apply simple genome editing technology in cells or individuals for abnormal chromosomes. Thus, these patient-derived iPSCs have advantages for developing disease models with multiple cell and tissue types, which are typically seen in the symptoms of abnormal chromosomal diseases. Here we review the studies of patient-derived iPSCs carrying abnormal chromosomes, focusing on pluripotent state and neural lineages. We also discuss the technological advances in chromosomal manipulations toward establishing experimental models and future therapeutics. Patient-derived iPSCs carrying chromosomal abnormality are valuable as cellular bioresources since they can indefinitely proliferate and provide various cell types. Also, these findings and technologies are important for future studies on elucidating pathogenesis, drug development, regenerative medicine, and gene therapy for abnormal chromosomal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia are dynamic cells that have roles in neuronal plasticity as well as in recovery responses following neuronal injury. Although many hypothesize that hyperactivation of microglia contributes to alcohol-induced neuropathology, in other neurodegenerative conditions disruption of normal microglial processes also contributes to neuronal loss, particularly as microglia become dystrophic or dysfunctional. Based on the observation of a striking, abnormal morphology in microglia during binge-like ethanol exposure, the present study investigated the impact of excessive ethanol exposure on microglia number and dystrophic morphology in a model of alcohol dependence that includes neurodegeneration in both adult and adolescent rats. Following 2- and 4-day binge ethanol exposure, the number of microglia was decreased in the hippocampus and the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices of both adult and adolescent rats. Furthermore, a significant number of microglia with a dystrophic morphology were observed in ethanol-exposed tissue, accompanied by a significant decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. Together these findings suggest another means by which microglia may contribute to alcohol-induced neurodegeneration, specifically dystrophic microglia and/or loss of microglia may disrupt homeostatic and recovery mechanisms. These results demonstrate that microglia also degenerate with excessive alcohol exposure, which has important implications for understanding the role of microglia—and specifically their contributions to plasticity and neuronal survival—in neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that harboring the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele represents the single greatest risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the exact mechanism by which ApoE4 contributes to disease progression remains unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that a 151 amino-terminal fragment of ApoE4 (nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;) localizes within the nucleus of microglia in the human AD brain and traffics to the nucleus causing toxicity in BV2 microglia cells. In the present study, we examined in detail what genes may be affected following treatment by nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;. Transcriptome analyses in BV2 microglial cells following sublethal treatment with nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; revealed the upregulation of almost 4,000 genes, with 20 of these genes upregulated 182- to 715-fold compared to untreated control cells. The majority of these 20 genes play a role in the immune response and polarization toward microglial M1 activation. As a control, an identical nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; fragment that differed by a single amino acid at position 112 (Cys→Arg) was tested and produced a similar albeit lower level of upregulation of an identical set of genes. In this manner, enriched pathways upregulated by nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; and nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; following exogenous treatment included Toll receptor signaling, chemokine/cytokine signaling and apoptosis signaling. There were unique genes differentially expressed by at least two-fold for either fragment. For nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;, these included 16 times as many genes, many of which are involved in physiological functions within microglia. For nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;, on the other hand the number genes uniquely upregulated was significantly lower, with many of the top upregulated genes having unknown functions. Taken together, our results suggest that while nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; may serve a more physiological role in microglia, nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; may activate genes that contribute to disease inflammation associated with AD. These data support the hypothesis that the link between harboring the APOE4 allele and dementia risk could be enhanced inflammation through activation of microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) is a key component in the cellular production of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) and has long been associated with neuronal development, survival and death. Numerous data suggest that nicotinamide may offer therapeutic benefits in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Beyond its effect in NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stores, nicotinamide is an inhibitor of Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), an enzyme with multiple cellular functions, including regulation of cell death, energy/metabolism and inflammatory response. PARP-1 functions as a DNA repair enzyme but under intense DNA damage depletes the cell of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ATP and leads to a non-apoptotic type of cell death called Parthanatos, which has been associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; availability might potentially improve mitochondrial function, which is severely impaired in AD. PARP-1 inhibition may also exert a protective effect against neurodegeneration by its action to diminish neuroinflammation and microglial activation which are also implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we discuss the evidence supporting the use of nicotinamide as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of early stages of AD based on the inhibitory effect of nicotinamide on PARP-1 activity. The data support evaluating nicotinamide as an adjunctive treatment for AD at early stages of the disease not only to increase NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stores but as a PARP-1 inhibitor, raising the hypothesis that other PARP-1 inhibitors – drugs that are already approved for breast cancer treatment – might be explored for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background and Objective&lt;p&gt;Executive dysfunction is the most common cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD), occurring even in its early stages. In our study, we applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter integrity and its association with a specific executive function such as cognitive flexibility in individuals with risk factors for PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We examined 50 individuals with risk factors for developing PD and 24 healthy controls from the TREND (Tübinger Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration) study including neuropsychological evaluation and DTI. Cognitive flexibility was assessed using the trail making test (TMT). Tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) were employed to assess white matter abnormalities and their correlation with cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;TMT performance correlated with mean and axial diffusivity in several white matter regions, predominantly in the frontoparietal white matter. These effects were stronger in PD risk persons (PD-RP) than in controls as evidenced by a significant group interaction. White matter integrity and TMT performance did not significantly differ across groups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Based on our results, PD-RP do no exhibit white matter changes or impaired cognitive flexibility. However, specific executive functions in PD-RP are more related to white matter alterations than in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The current study compared attention profiles and functional connectivity of frontal regions in patients with early-stage subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Twenty patients with SIVD, 32 patients with AD, and 23 subjects with normal cognition (NC) received cognition and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) evaluations. The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was used to assess global cognition, and simple attention, processing speed, divided attention, and vigilance/sustained attention were evaluated using the Digit Span Forward, Trail Making Test, Symbol Digit Modality Test, and Conners Continuous Performance Test, respectively. Voxel-based regional homogeneity (ReHo) derived from rs-fMRI data was analyzed to identify significant clusters, which were further correlated with attention profiles. Although the patients with SIVD and AD had comparable global cognitive ability, those with SIVD exhibited worse divided attention and vigilance/sustained attention than those with AD. Compared with the NC group, the patients with SIVD exhibited decreased ReHo within the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), whereas the patients with AD exhibited increased ReHo within the right orbital part of frontal regions. Correlations between these three clusters with attention exhibited distinct patterns according to the dementia subtype, as did attention indices with significance in predicting global cognition. In summary, our study suggested that worse attention performance was associated with functional disconnection within the frontal regions among patients with SIVD than in those with AD. Frontal functional disconnection may underlie the pathogenesis responsible for defective divided attention, vigilance/sustained attention, and notable within-group variations identified in SIVD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Chronic pain remains challenging to both diagnose and treat. These challenges, in part, arise from limited systems-level understanding of the basic mechanisms that process nociceptive information and ultimately instantiate a subjectively available experience of pain. Here, I provide a framework, the distributed nociceptive system, for understanding nociceptive mechanisms at a systems level by integrating the concepts of neural population coding with distributed processing. Within this framework, wide-spread engagement of populations of neurons produces representations of nociceptive information that are highly resilient to disruption.</content>

 Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular clearance pathway in which cytoplasmic contents are trafficked to the lysosome for degradation. Within neurons, it helps to remove damaged organelles and misfolded or aggregated proteins and has therefore been the subject of intense research in relation to neurodegenerative disease. However, far less is understood about the role of autophagy in other aspects of neuronal physiology. Here we review the literature on the role of autophagy in maintaining neuronal stem cells and in neuronal plasticity in adult life and we discuss how these contribute to structural and functional deficits observed in a range of human disorders.</content>

Many cognitive processes involve transformations of distributed representations in neural populations, creating a need for population-level models. Recurrent neural network models fulfill this need, but there are many open questions about how their connectivity gives rise to dynamics that solve a task. Here, we present a method for finding the connectivity of networks for which the dynamics are specified to solve a task in an interpretable way. We apply our method to a working memory task by synthesizing a network that implements a drift-diffusion process over a ring-shaped manifold. We also use our method to demonstrate how inputs can be used to control network dynamics for cognitive flexibility and explore the relationship between representation geometry and network capacity. Our work fits within the broader context of understanding neural computations as dynamics over relatively low-dimensional manifolds formed by correlated patterns of neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iEhpglNKGpY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Dendritic spine abnormalities correlate with behavioral and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Lafora disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b9806c5d-c279-4a1d-88fc-14deed7079ae/cne25006-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known to associate with cognitive dysfunctions in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in the mouse model for Lafora disease ‐ a fatal form of epileptic disorder associated with cognitive defects. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines from the postnatal period onwards. These animals also exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and non‐spatial memory. Thus, dendritic spine abnormalities appear to be a primary developmental defect in the Lafora disease mouse model and may contribute to the cognitive deficits in the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lafora disease (LD) is a genetic and fatal form of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and cognitive deficits. LD is caused by loss‐of‐function mutations in the EPM2A or the NHLRC1 gene. A major hallmark of LD is the presence of abnormal glycogen aggregates in neurons and other tissues. Functional studies on the genes have, therefore, mostly focused on glycogen metabolism. The physiological basis of cognitive deficits in LD is thus largely unexplored. Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We, therefore, analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal and cortical layer V of the Epm2a or Nhlrc1 knockout mice brain. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines in postnatal day 21 to 12‐month‐old LD animals. Similar observations were made in the primary cultures of neurons derived from the hippocampi of the embryonic brain, suggesting that the aberrant spine phenotype could be a developmental defect in LD. We also looked at the cognitive and behavioral deficits as a possible readout of the spine abnormalities. The LD animals exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and non‐spatial memory. Such abnormalities were seen in the younger (1‐to‐2 months) as well as the older (7‐to‐8 months) age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the dendritic spine abnormalities are primary developmental defects in the LD model and these defects might underlie some of the symptoms, including cognitive deficits, in LD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Administration of 5‐Bromo‐2´‐Deoxyuridine interferes with neuroblast proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death in the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a374dd55-f733-4e6d-8d48-7ae164b7adac/cne25005-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study reveals that low doses of BrdU (from 25 to 75 μg/g) have no deleterious effects on the development of the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium. Our results also denotes that the BrdU injection at doses ranging from 100 to 300 μg/g alters neuroblasts proliferation and induces the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study was conducted to assess whether a single administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (BrdU) interferes with cell proliferation and leads to the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (25 to 300 μg/g b.w.) were analyzed using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural procedures. The pregnant rats were injected with BrdU at embryonic day 13, and their fetuses were sacrificed from 5 to 35 h after exposure. The quantification of several parameters such as the density of mitotic figures, and BrdU and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)‐reactive cells showed that, in comparison with the saline injected rats, the administration of BrdU impairs the proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial cells. The above mentioned parameters were significantly reduced in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The reduction was more evident using 200 μg/g b.w. The most severe effects were found with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The present findings also revealed that high doses of BrdU lead to the activation of apoptotic cellular events as evidenced by both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for active caspase‐3. In comparison with saline rats, many apoptotic cells were found in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The number of dying cells increased with 200 μg/g b.w. The most important number of apoptotic cells were observed in animals injected with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of neuroblasts at different stages of apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ec975b8e-c06e-4b6b-b5d2-e3fb97ae734a/cne25003-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of  muscle cells. In Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase
the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen – probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus&lt;/i&gt; species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The SNARE Regulator Complexin3 is a Target of the Cone Circadian Clock&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b922640-cb86-45a0-b150-d6d276e878bc/cne25004-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt; knock out cones (cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) and wild type cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, &lt;i&gt;Complexin3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt;), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in wild type cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4‐‐&lt;/i&gt;the other complexin expressed in cones‐‐ were similar in wild type and mutant cones; in wild type cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt; and none upstream of exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4&lt;/i&gt;. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) have historically been among the most difficult to treat using conventional pharmacological approaches. This is due to a confluence of factors, including the limited regenerative capacity and overall complexity of the brain, problems associated with repeated drug administration, and difficulties delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Viral-mediated gene transfer represents an attractive alternative for the delivery of therapeutic cargo to the nervous system. Crucially, it usually requires only a single injection, whether that be a gene replacement strategy for an inherited disorder or the delivery of a genome- or epigenome-modifying construct for treatment of CNS diseases and disorders. It is thus understandable that considerable effort has been put towards the development of improved vector systems for gene transfer into the CNS. Different viral vectors are of course tailored to their specific applications, but they generally should share several key properties. The ideal viral vector incorporates a high-packaging capacity, efficient gene transfer paired with robust and sustained expression, lack of oncogenicity, toxicity and pathogenicity, and scalable manufacturing for clinical applications. In this review, we will devote attention to viral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (lentiviral vectors; LVs) and adeno-associated virus (AAVs). The high interest in these viral delivery systems vectors is due to: (i) robust delivery and long-lasting expression; (ii) efficient transduction into postmitotic cells, including the brain; (iii) low immunogenicity and toxicity; and (iv) compatibility with advanced manufacturing techniques. Here, we will outline basic aspects of LV and AAV biology, particularly focusing on approaches and techniques aiming to enhance viral safety. We will also allocate a significant portion of this review to the development and use of LVs and AAVs for delivery into the CNS, with a focus on the genome and epigenome-editing tools based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas 9) and the development of novel strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Proinflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifunctional cytokine and has been found involved in many neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Previous studies have shown that MIF is expressed in neocortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord in adult mice. It is expressed by astrocytes and activates microglias in neuroinflammation. Further studies have shown that MIF is detected in moss fibers of dentate granule cells and in apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in adult hippocampus. Only NeuroD-positive immature granule neurons but not NeuN-positive mature neurons express MIF. These findings led us eager to know the exact role of MIF in the development of hippocampus. Therefore, we systematically checked the spatial and temporal expression pattern of MIF and characterized MIF-positive cells in hippocampus from mice aged from postnatal day 0 (P0) to 3 months. Our results showed that the lowest level of MIF protein occurred at P7 and mif mRNA increased from P0, reached a peak at P7, and stably expressed until P30 before declining dramatically at 3 months. MIF was localized in fibers of GFAP- and BLBP-positive radial glial precursor cells in dentate gyrus (DG). DCX-expressing newly generated neurons were MIF-negative. Inhibition of MIF by MIF antagonist S, R-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4, 5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1) reduced BrdU-positive cells. Interestingly, MIF was expressed by NeuN-positive GABAergic interneurons including parvalbumin-and Reelin-expressing cells in the DG. Neither NeuN-positive granule cells nor NeuN-positive pyramidal neurons expressed MIF. In transgenic mice, POMC-EGFP–positive immature dentate granule cells and Thy1-EGFP–positive mature granule cells were MIF-negative. Treatment of neuronal cultures with ISO-1 inhibited neurite outgrowth. Therefore, we conclude that MIF might be important for feature maintenance of neural stem cells and neurite outgrowth during hippocampal development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is strongly associated with metabolic diseases including diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies indicate that Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbe-dependent metabolite is implicated in the development of age-related cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms of the impact of TMAO on neuronal function has not been elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between TMAO and deficits in synaptic plasticity in an Alzheimer’s model (3×Tg-AD) and insulin resistance (Leptin deficient db/db) mouse by measuring plasma and brain levels of TMAO. We observed increased TMAO levels in the plasma and brain of both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice in comparison to wild-type mice. Besides, TMAO levels further increased as mice progressed in age. Deficits in synaptic plasticity, in the form of reduced long-term potentiation (LTP), were noted in both groups of mice in comparison to wild-type mice. To further explore the impact of TMAO on neuronal function, we utilized an ex-vivo model by incubating wild-type hippocampal brain slices with TMAO and found impaired synaptic transmission. We observed that TMAO induced the PERK-EIF2α-ER stress signaling axis in TMAO treated ex-vivo slices as well as in both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice. Lastly, we also observed altered presynaptic and reduced postsynaptic receptor expression. Our findings suggest that TMAO may induce deficits in synaptic plasticity through the ER stress-mediated PERK signaling pathway. Our results offer novel insight into the mechanism by which TMAO may induce cognitive deficits by promoting ER stress and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ionotropic ATP-gated P2X7 receptor is an important contributor to inflammatory signaling cascades via the release of Interleukin-1β, as well as having roles in cell death, neuronal plasticity and the release of neurotransmitters. Accordingly, there is interest in targeting the P2X7 receptor for the treatment of epilepsy. However, the signaling pathways downstream of P2X7 receptor activation remain incompletely understood. Notably, recent studies showed that P2X7 receptor expression is controlled, in part, by microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we explored P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNA expression by comparing microRNA expression profiles of wild-type (wt) and P2X7 receptor knockout mice before and after status epilepticus. Genome-wide microRNA profiling was performed using hippocampi from wt and P2X7 receptor knockout mice following status epilepticus induced by intra-amygdala kainic acid. This revealed that the genetic deletion of the P2X7 receptor results in distinct patterns of microRNA expression. Specifically, we found that in vehicle-injected control mice, the lack of the P2X7 receptor resulted in the up-regulation of 50 microRNAs and down-regulation of 35 microRNAs. Post-status epilepticus, P2X7 receptor deficiency led to the up-regulation of 44 microRNAs while 13 microRNAs were down-regulated. Moreover, there was only limited overlap among identified P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs between control conditions and post-status epilepticus, suggesting that the P2X7 receptor regulates the expression of different microRNAs during normal physiology and pathology. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that genes targeted by P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs were particularly overrepresented in pathways involved in intracellular signaling, inflammation, and cell death; processes that have been repeatedly associated with P2X7 receptor activation. Moreover, whereas genes involved in signaling pathways and inflammation were common among up- and down-regulated P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs during physiological and pathological conditions, genes associated with cell death seemed to be restricted to up-regulated microRNAs during both physiological conditions and post-status epilepticus. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the P2X7 receptor impacts on the expression profile of microRNAs in the brain, thereby possibly contributing to both the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and pathological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reaching and grasping is an essential part of everybody’s life, it allows meaningful interaction with the environment and is key to independent lifestyle. Recent electroencephalogram (EEG)-based studies have already shown that neural correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be identified in the EEG. However, it is still in question whether these results obtained in a laboratory environment can make the transition to mobile applicable EEG systems for home use. In the current study, we investigated whether EEG-based correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified and decoded using mobile EEG systems, namely the water-based EEG-Versatile&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; system and the dry-electrodes EEG-Hero&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; headset. In addition, we also analyzed gel-based recordings obtained in a laboratory environment (g.USBamp/g.Ladybird, gold standard), which followed the same experimental parameters. For each recording system, 15 study participants performed 80 self-initiated reach-and-grasp actions toward a glass (palmar grasp) and a spoon (lateral grasp). Our results confirmed that EEG-based correlates of reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified using these mobile systems. In a single-trial multiclass-based decoding approach, which incorporated both movement conditions and rest, we could show that the low frequency time domain (LFTD) correlates were also decodable. Grand average peak accuracy calculated on unseen test data yielded for the water-based electrode system 62.3% (9.2% STD), whereas for the dry-electrodes headset reached 56.4% (8% STD). For the gel-based electrode system 61.3% (8.6% STD) could be achieved. To foster and promote further investigations in the field of EEG-based movement decoding, as well as to allow the interested community to make their own conclusions, we provide all datasets publicly available in the BNCI Horizon 2020 database (http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;High-tension glaucoma (HTG) is the most common type of primary open angle glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the major risk factor of the disease. The aim of this study was to assess alterations in resting-state visual networks in patients with HTG and investigate the effect of elevated IOP on the visual networks.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI images were acquired from 36 HTG patients (aged 49.22 ± 15.26 years) and 20 healthy controls (aged 49.90 ± 5.62 years). Group independent component analysis (ICA) was utilized to evaluate altered functional connectivity (FC) in resting-state visual networks between HTG patients and healthy controls. Pearson correlation analysis between mean IOP and altered FCs in the visual networks was performed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ICA demonstrated decreased FCs in HTG group in the left calcarine cortex of the lateral visual network, in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the medial visual network and in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the occipital visual network compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed negative correlation between mean IOP and altered FC within the lateral visual network.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results suggested reduced FCs between primary and higher visual cortices in HTG brain. The IOP elevation might be responsible for the functional alterations in the visual networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;There is a unique nucleus (CSF-contacting nucleus) in the brain of rat. It has been demonstrated in our previous research. The extraordinary feature of this nucleus is that it is not connected to any parenchymal organ but to the CSF. In primates, however, the presence or absence of this nucleus has not been proven. Confirmation of the presence of this nucleus in primates will provide the structural basis for brain-CSF communication and help to understand the neurohumoral regulatory mechanisms in humans.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The tracer cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (CB-HRP) was injected into the CSF in the lateral ventricle (LV) of primate rhesus monkeys. After 48 h, the monkeys were perfused and the brain was dissected out, and sectioned for CB-HRP staining. The CB-HRP positive structures were observed under confocal and electron microscopy. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster was reconstructed by computer software.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;(1) CB-HRP labeling is confined within the ventricle, but not leakage into the brain parenchyma. (2) From the midbrain inferior colliculus superior border plane ventral to the aqueduct to the upper part of the fourth ventricle (4V) floor, a large number of CB-HRP positive neurons are consistently located, form a cluster, and are symmetrically located on both sides of the midline. (3) 3D reconstruction shows that the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster in the monkey brain occupies certain space. The rostral part is large and caudal part is thin appearing a “rivet”-like shape. (4) Under electron microscopy, the CB-HRP positive neurons show different types of synaptic connections with the non-CSF-contacting structures in the brain. Some of the processes stretch directly into the ventricle cavity.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Same as we did in rats, the CSF-contacting nucleus is also existed in the primate brain parenchyma. We also recommend listing it as the XIII pair of cranial nucleus, which is specialized in the communications between the brain and the CSF. It is significant to the completing of innervation in the organism.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: Individuals with presbycusis often show deficits in cognitive function, however, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. This study explored the alterations in intra- and inter-network functional connectivity (FC) of multiple networks in presbycusis patients, and further correlated FC with cognitive assessment scores to assess their ability to predict cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was performed in 40 presbycusis patients and 40 matched controls, and 12 resting-state networks (RSNs) were identified by independent component analysis (ICA) approach. A two-sample t-test was carried out to detect the intra-network FC differences, and functional network connectivity (FNC) was calculated to compare the inter-network FC differences. Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis was subsequently used to explore the correlation between altered FC and cognitive assessment scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study demonstrated that patients with presbycusis showed significantly decreased FC in the subcortical limbic network (scLN), default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and attention network (AN) compared with the control group. Moreover, the connectivity for scLN-AUN (auditory network) and VN (visual network)-DMN were found significantly increased while AN-DMN was found significantly decreased in presbycusis patients. Ultimately, this study revealed the intra- and inter-network alterations associated with some cognitive assessment scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study observed intra- and inter-network FC alterations in presbycusis patients, and investigated that presbycusis can lead to abnormal connectivity of RSNs and plasticity compensation mechanism, which may be the basis of cognitive impairment, suggesting that FNC can be used to predict potential cognitive impairment in their early stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The aging of the brain is a well-investigated topic, but existing analyses have mainly focused on Caucasian samples. To investigate brain aging in East Asians, we measured cortical and subcortical volumes from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 1,008 cognitively normal elderly Koreans from the Gwangju Alzheimer’s and Related Dementia cohort and 342 Caucasians from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. To determine whether the aging effect varies with ethnicity and sex, beta coefficients of age and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in each ethnicity–sex group using a bootstrap method and a regression analysis using the relative volume to intracranial volume as predicted. The betas or aging slopes largely were not significantly different between ethnicity and sex groups in most types of brain structures. However, ethnic differences between the two female groups were found in the brain, most cortical regions, and a few subcortical regions. Ethnic differences in brain aging are likely due in large part to genetic factors; thus, we compared carriers and non-carriers of a gene relevant to longevity and neurodegenerative diseases, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4. The regions with ethnic differences in women also showed significant differences between Korean APOE ε4 non-carriers and Caucasian APOE ε4 carriers. Furthermore, Caucasian women showed significant APOE ε4 effects in the largest number of regions. These results illustrate that much of the ethnic differences in females may be explained by synergistic effects of ethnic background and APOE ε4 carrier status. Our results suggest that sex-dependent differences of aging between ethnic backgrounds may be due to ethnicity-dependent effects of genetic risk factors, such as APOE ε4. We also presented the normative information on volume estimates of the brain structures of the elderly Korean people in the subdivided age groups. This normative information of the aging brain stratified by ethnicity provides the age-related reference ranges quantified to replace visual judgment and facilitate precise clinical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Gray matter (GM) alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have been demonstrated in many neuroimaging studies using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). However, the inconsistent findings between studies cannot be applied to clinical practice as a neuroimaging biomarker. We performed a meta-analysis of VBM studies at a whole-brain level to investigate GM differences between PD patients with and without RBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to November 2019 to identify eligible VBM studies. We adopted the latest Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images technique to quantitatively estimate the difference of regional GM volume between PD patients with and without RBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We included five studies comprising 105 PD patients with RBD and 140 PD patients without RBD. The pooled meta-analysis revealed that PD patients with RBD showed a significant reduction of GM volume in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) compared with those without RBD. This result was confirmed to be robust by the jackknife sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our finding shows significantly and robustly reduced GM volume in the right STG in PD patients with RBD, preliminarily suggesting the association of GM atrophy in this brain region with the occurrence of RBD in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Standard neuroeconomic decision theory assumes that choice is based on a value comparison process, independent from how information about alternative options is collected. Here, we investigate the opposite intuition that preferences are dynamically shaped as options are sampled, through iterative covert pairwise comparisons. Our model builds on two lines of research, one suggesting that a natural frame of comparison for the brain is between default and alternative options, the other suggesting that comparisons spread preferences between options. We therefore assumed that during sequential option sampling, people would 1) covertly compare every new alternative to the current best and 2) update their values such that the winning (losing) option receives a positive (negative) bonus. We confronted this “covert pairwise comparison” model to models derived from standard decision theory and from known memory effects. Our model provided the best account of human choice behavior in a novel task where participants (n = 92 in total) had to browse through a sequence of items (food, music or movie) of variable length and ultimately select their favorite option. Consistently, the order of option presentation, which was manipulated by design, had a significant influence on the eventual choice: the best option was more likely to be chosen when it came earlier in the sequence, because it won more covert comparisons (hence a greater total bonus). Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how the option sampling process shapes economic preference, which should be integrated into decision theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vlknqot9jVc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Tissue vibrations in the larynx produce most sounds that comprise vocal communication in mammals. Larynx morphology is thus predicted to be a key target for selection, particularly in species with highly developed vocal communication systems. Here, we present a novel database of digitally modeled scanned larynges from 55 different mammalian species, representing a wide range of body sizes in the primate and carnivoran orders. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we demonstrate that the primate larynx has evolved more rapidly than the carnivoran larynx, resulting in a pattern of larger size and increased deviation from expected allometry with body size. These results imply fundamental differences between primates and carnivorans in the balance of selective forces that constrain larynx size and highlight an evolutionary flexibility in primates that may help explain why we have developed complex and diverse uses of the vocal organ for communication.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MrGQspFPUS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate as to whether ketamine anesthesia suppresses neurophysiologic complexity at doses sufficient for surgical anesthesia, with previous human studies reporting surrogates of both suppressed and preserved levels of cortical complexity. However, these studies have not assessed cortical dynamics in higher gamma frequencies, which have previously been demonstrated to correlate with the level of consciousness during anesthesia. In this study, we used Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc) to characterize frontal and parietal electroencephalographic complexity (0.5–175 Hz, 0.5–55 Hz, 65–175 Hz) before, during, and after ketamine or propofol anesthesia in the rat. To control for the potential influence of spectral changes in complexity estimation, LZc was normalized with phase-shuffled surrogate data. We demonstrate that ketamine and propofol anesthesia were characterized by a significant reduction in broadband (0.5–175 Hz) LZc. Further analysis showed that while the reduction of LZc during ketamine anesthesia was significant in 65–175 Hz range, during propofol anesthesia, a significant decrease was observed in 0.5–55 Hz bandwidth. LZc in broadband and 0.5–55 Hz range showed a significant increase during emergence from ketamine anesthesia. Phase-shuffled normalized LZc revealed that (1) decrease in complexity during ketamine and propofol anesthesia—not increase in complexity during emergence—were dissociable from the influence of spectral changes, and (2) reduced LZc during ketamine anesthesia was present across all three bandwidths. Ketamine anesthesia was characterized by reduced complexity in high gamma bandwidth, as reflected in both raw and phase-shuffled normalized LZc, which suggests that reduced high gamma complexity is a neurophysiological feature of ketamine anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results in social-communication impairments, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. Moreover, ASD is more prevalent in males, with a male to female ratio of 4 to 1. Although the underlying etiology of ASD is generally unknown, recent advances in genome sequencing have facilitated the identification of a host of associated genes. Among these, synaptic proteins such as cell adhesion molecules have been strongly linked with ASD. Interestingly, many large genome sequencing studies exclude sex chromosomes, which leads to a shift in focus toward autosomal genes as targets for ASD research. However, there are many genes on the X chromosome that encode synaptic proteins, including strong candidate genes. Here, we review findings regarding two members of the neuroligin (NLGN) family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules, NLGN3 and NLGN4. Neuroligins have multiple isoforms (NLGN1-4), which are both autosomal and sex-linked. The sex-linked genes, NLGN3 and NLGN4, are both on the X chromosome and were among the first few genes to be linked with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). In addition, there is a less studied human neuroligin on the Y chromosome, NLGN4Y, which forms an X-Y pair with NLGN4X. We will discuss recent findings of these neuroligin isoforms regarding function at the synapse in both rodent models and human-derived differentiated neurons, and highlight the exciting challenges moving forward to a better understanding of ASD/ID.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The presynaptic compartment of the chemical synapse is a small, yet extremely complex structure. Considering its size, most methods of optical microscopy are not able to resolve its nanoarchitecture and dynamics. Thus, its ultrastructure could only be studied by electron microscopy. In the last decade, new methods of optical superresolution microscopy have emerged allowing the study of cellular structures and processes at the nanometer scale. While this is a welcome addition to the experimental arsenal, it has necessitated careful analysis and interpretation to ensure the data obtained remains artifact-free. In this article we review the application of nanoscopic techniques to the study of the synapse and the progress made over the last decade with a particular focus on the presynapse. We find to our surprise that progress has been limited, calling for imaging techniques and probes that allow dense labeling, multiplexing, longer imaging times, higher temporal resolution, while at least maintaining the spatial resolution achieved thus far.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A GWAS study recently demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human GLRB gene of individuals with a prevalence for agoraphobia. GLRB encodes the glycine receptor (GlyRs) β subunit. The identified SNPs are localized within the gene flanking regions (3′ and 5′ UTRs) and intronic regions. It was suggested that these nucleotide polymorphisms modify GlyRs expression and phenotypic behavior in humans contributing to an anxiety phenotype as a mild form of hyperekplexia. Hyperekplexia is a human neuromotor disorder with massive startle phenotypes due to mutations in genes encoding GlyRs subunits. GLRA1 mutations have been more commonly observed than GLRB mutations. If an anxiety phenotype contributes to the hyperekplexia disease pattern has not been investigated yet. Here, we compared two mouse models harboring either a mutation in the murine Glra1 or Glrb gene with regard to anxiety and startle phenotypes. Homozygous spasmodic animals carrying a Glra1 point mutation (alanine 52 to serine) displayed abnormally enhanced startle responses. Moreover, spasmodic mice exhibited significant changes in fear-related behaviors (freezing, rearing and time spent on back) analyzed during the startle paradigm, even in a neutral context. Spastic mice exhibit reduced expression levels of the full-length GlyRs β subunit due to aberrant splicing of the Glrb gene. Heterozygous animals appear normal without an obvious behavioral phenotype and thus might reflect the human situation analyzed in the GWAS study on agoraphobia and startle. In contrast to spasmodic mice, heterozygous spastic animals revealed no startle phenotype in a neutral as well as a conditioning context. Other mechanisms such as a modulatory function of the GlyRs β subunit within glycinergic circuits in neuronal networks important for fear and fear-related behavior may exist. Possibly, in human additional changes in fear and fear-related circuits either due to gene-gene interactions e.g., with GLRA1 genes or epigenetic factors are necessary to create the agoraphobia and in particular the startle phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Loss of vestibular function is known to cause spatial memory deficits and hippocampal dysfunction, in terms of impaired place cell firing and abnormal theta rhythm. Based on these results, it has been of interest to determine whether vestibular loss also affects the development and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. This article summarizes and critically reviews the studies of hippocampal LTP following a vestibular loss and its relationship to NMDA receptor expression, that have been published to date. Although the available in vitro studies indicate that unilateral vestibular loss (UVL) results in reduced hippocampal field potentials in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG), the in vivo studies involving bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) do not. This may be due to the differences between UVL and BVL or it could be a result of in vitro/in vivo differences. One in vitro study reported a decrease in LTP in hippocampal slices following UVL; however, the two available in vivo studies have reported different results: either no effect or an increase in EPSP/Population Spike (ES) potentiation. This discrepancy may be due to the different high-frequency stimulation (HFS) paradigms used to induce LTP. The increased ES potentiation following BVL may be related to an increase in synaptic NMDA receptors, possibly increasing the flow of vestibular input coming into CA1, with a loss of selectivity. This might cause increased excitability and synaptic noise, which might lead to a degradation of spatial learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;The precise physiopathological association between the courses of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unclear. This study sought to comprehensively investigate the distribution characteristics of gray matter atrophy in middle-aged T2DM patients with newly diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Four groups, including 28 patients with early-onset MCI, 28 patients with T2DM, 28 T2DM patients with early-onset MCI (T2DM-MCI), and 28 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent three-dimensional high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes were calculated, and a structural covariance method was used to evaluate the morphological relationships within the default mode network (DMN).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Overlapped and unique cortical/subcortical gray matter atrophy was found in patients with MCI, T2DM and T2DM-MCI in our study, and patients with T2DM-MCI showed lower volumes in several areas than patients with MCI or T2DM. Volume loss in subcortical areas (including the thalamus, putamen, and hippocampus), but not in cortical areas, was related to cognitive impairment in patients with MCI and T2DM-MCI. No associations between biochemical measurements and volumetric reductions were found. Furthermore, patients with MCI and those with T2DM-MCI showed disrupted structural connectivity within the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings provide further evidence that T2DM may exacerbate atrophy of specific gray matter regions, which may be primarily associated with MCI. Impairments in gray matter volume related to T2DM or MCI are independent of cardiovascular risk factors, and subcortical atrophy may play a more pivotal role in cognitive impairment than cortical alterations in patients with MCI and T2DM-MCI. The enhanced structural connectivity within the DMN in patients with T2DM-MCI may suggest a compensatory mechanism for the chronic neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Diabetes mellitus increases stroke incidence and mortality and hampers functional recovery after stroke. Fingolimod has been shown to improve neurofunctional recovery and reduce brain infarction after ischemic injury in mice without comorbidities. In this work, we investigated the effects of fingolimod in diabetic mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Hyperglycemia was induced by a single bolus streptozotocin injection. Adult male ICR mice (n = 86) underwent 1-h tMCAO surgery and received intraperitoneal injection of fingolimod (1 mg/kg) or vehicle immediately after reperfusion. Clark neurological score, brain infarction and edema, blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, apoptosis, and inflammation were evaluated at 24 h after tMCAO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fingolimod treatment reduced the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells and lowered the mRNA level of Tnfα. It also increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. However, fingolimod significantly aggravated brain edema and reduced the expression levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin. The negative impacts of fingolimod on BBB integrity outweighed its beneficial effects in anti-inflammation, which resulted in the lack of improvement in endpoint outcomes at 24 h after tMCAO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Caution should be taken in considering the acute treatment using fingolimod for ischemic stroke with diabetes comorbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The concept of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) has been widely accepted, and a large number of studies have been performed in rodents using modern experimental techniques, which have clarified the nature and developmental processes of adult neural stem/progenitor cells, the functions of AHN, such as memory and learning, and its association with neural diseases. However, a fundamental problem is that it remains unclear as to what extent AHN actually occurs in humans. The answer to this is indispensable when physiological and pathological functions of human AHN are deduced from studies of rodent AHN, but there are controversial data on the extent of human AHN. In this review, studies on AHN performed in rodents and humans will be briefly reviewed, followed by a discussion of the studies in non-human primates. Then, how data of rodent and non-human primate AHN should be applied for understanding human AHN will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mammalian brains consist of 10s of millions to 100s of billions of neurons operating at millisecond time scales, of which current recording techniques only capture a tiny fraction. Recording techniques capable of sampling neural activity at high spatiotemporal resolution have been difficult to scale. The most intensively studied mammalian neuronal networks, such as the neocortex, show a layered architecture, where the optimal recording technology samples densely over large areas. However, the need for application-specific designs as well as the mismatch between the three-dimensional architecture of the brain and largely two-dimensional microfabrication techniques profoundly limits both neurophysiological research and neural prosthetics. Here, we discuss a novel strategy for scalable neuronal recording by combining bundles of glass-ensheathed microwires with large-scale amplifier arrays derived from high-density CMOS in vitro MEA systems or high-speed infrared cameras. High signal-to-noise ratio (&amp;lt;25 μV RMS noise floor, SNR up to 25) is achieved due to the high conductivity of core metals in glass-ensheathed microwires allowing for ultrathin metal cores (down to &amp;lt;1 μm) and negligible stray capacitance. Multi-step electrochemical modification of the tip enables ultra-low access impedance with minimal geometric area, which is largely independent of the core diameter. We show that the microwire size can be reduced to virtually eliminate damage to the blood-brain-barrier upon insertion and we demonstrate that microwire arrays can stably record single-unit activity. Combining microwire bundles and CMOS arrays allows for a highly scalable neuronal recording approach, linking the progress in electrical neuronal recordings to the rapid progress in silicon microfabrication. The modular design of the system allows for custom arrangement of recording sites. Our approach of employing bundles of minimally invasive, highly insulated and functionalized microwires to extend a two-dimensional CMOS architecture into the 3rd dimension can be translated to other CMOS arrays, such as electrical stimulation devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Gliomas are the most common primary brain cancers. In recent years, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion have been suggested as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of gliomas. However, these biomarkers are only effective for a part of glioma patients, and thus more biomarkers are still emergently needed. Recently, an electrochemical communication between normal neurons and glioma cells by neuro-glioma synapse has been reported. Moreover, it was discovered that breast-to-brain metastasis tumor cells have pseudo synapses with neurons, and these synapses were indicated to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Based on the above observations, we first curated a panel of 17 synapse-related genes and then proposed a metric, synapse score to quantify the “stemness” for each sample of 12 glioma gene expression datasets from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO. Strikingly, synapse score showed excellent predictive ability for the prognosis, diagnosis, and grading of gliomas. Moreover, being compared with the two established biomarkers, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, synapse score demonstrated independent and better predictive performance. In conclusion, this study proposed a quantitative method, synapse score, as an efficient biomarker for monitoring gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Animal behavior is regulated by environmental stimuli and is shaped by the activity of neural networks, underscoring the importance of assessing the morpho-functional properties of different populations of cells in freely behaving animals. In recent years, a number of optical tools have been developed to monitor and modulate neuronal and glial activity at the protein, cellular, or network level and have opened up new avenues for studying brain function in freely behaving animals. Tools such as genetically encoded sensors and actuators are now commonly used for studying brain activity and function through their expression in different neuronal ensembles. In parallel, microscopy has also made major progress over the last decades. The advent of miniature microscopes (mini-microscopes also called mini-endoscopes) has become a method of choice for studying brain activity at the cellular and network levels in different brain regions of freely behaving mice. This technique also allows for longitudinal investigations while animals carrying the microscope on their head are performing behavioral tasks. In this review, we will discuss mini-endoscopic imaging and the advantages that these devices offer to research. We will also discuss current limitations of and potential future improvements in mini-endoscopic imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This study presents the integration of a passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) and cognitive modeling as a method to trace pilots’ perception and processing of auditory alerts and messages during operations. Missing alerts on the flight deck can result in out-of-the-loop problems that can lead to accidents. By tracing pilots’ perception and responses to alerts, cognitive assistance can be provided based on individual needs to ensure they maintain adequate situation awareness. Data from 24 participating aircrew in a simulated flight study that included multiple alerts and air traffic control messages in single pilot setup are presented. A classifier was trained to identify pilots’ neurophysiological reactions to alerts and messages from participants’ electroencephalogram (EEG). A neuroadaptive ACT-R model using EEG data was compared to a conventional normative model regarding accuracy in representing individual pilots. Results show that passive BCI can distinguish between alerts that are processed by the pilot as task-relevant or irrelevant in the cockpit based on the recorded EEG. The neuroadaptive model’s integration of this data resulted in significantly higher performance of 87% overall accuracy in representing individual pilots’ responses to alerts and messages compared to 72% accuracy of a normative model that did not consider EEG data. We conclude that neuroadaptive technology allows for implicit measurement and tracing of pilots’ perception and processing of alerts on the flight deck. Careful handling of uncertainties inherent to passive BCI and cognitive modeling shows how the representation of pilot cognitive states can be improved iteratively for providing assistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to mild objective cognitive deficits and is associated with the later development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, not all patients with MCI convert to AD. EEG spectral power has shown promise as a marker of progression, but brain oscillations in different frequencies are not isolated entities. Coupling between different frequency bands, so-called cross-frequency coupling (CFC), has been associated with memory function and may further contribute to our understanding of what characterizes patients with MCI who progress to AD. In the current study, we wanted to investigate the changes in gamma/theta CFC in patients with AD and MCI compared to HC and in patients with pMCI compared to patients with sMCI. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the association with cognitive test scores. EEGs were included at baseline for 15 patients with AD, 25 patients with MCI, and 36 older HC, and the participants were followed for up to 3 years. To investigate CFC, we calculated the modulation index (MI), which has been shown to be less affected by noisy data compared to other techniques. We found that patients with pMCI showed a significantly lower global gamma/theta CFC compared to patients with sMCI. In addition, global gamma/theta CFC was significantly correlated with Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE) score (p-value = 0.030, rho = 0.527). Although not significant, patients with AD and MCI showed a lower gamma/theta CFC compared to HC. These findings suggest that gamma/theta CFC is important for proper cognitive functioning and that a decrease in gamma/theta CFC in patients with MCI may be a sign of progression. Gamma/theta CFC may therefore serve as a progression marker in MCI, but larger studies are needed to validate these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are crucial for non-image forming functions of the eye, including the photoentrainment of circadian rhythms and the regulation of the pupillary light reflex (PLR). Chromatic pupillometry, using light stimuli at different wavelengths, makes possible the isolation of the contribution of rods, cones, and mRGCs to the PLR. In particular, post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) is the most reliable pupil metric of mRGC function. We have previously described, in post-mortem investigations of AD retinas, a loss of mRGCs, and in the remaining mRGCs, we demonstrated extensive morphological abnormalities. We noted dendrite varicosities, patchy distribution of melanopsin, and reduced dendrite arborization. In this study, we evaluated, with chromatic pupillometry, the PLR in a cohort of mild-moderate AD patients compared to controls. AD and controls also underwent an extensive ophthalmological evaluation. In our AD cohort, PIPR did not significantly differ from controls, even though we observed a higher variability in the AD group and 5/26 showed PIPR values outside the 2 SD from the control mean values. Moreover, we found a significant difference between AD and controls in terms of rod-mediated transient PLR amplitude. These results suggest that in the early stage of AD there are PLR abnormalities that may reflect a pathology affecting mRGC dendrites before involving the mRGC cell body. Further studies, including AD cases with more severe and longer disease duration, are needed to further explore this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The restoration of a useful visual sense in a profoundly blind person by direct electrical stimulation of the visual cortex has been a subject of study for many years. However, the field of cortically based sight restoration has made few advances in the last few decades, and many problems remain. In this context, the scientific and technological problems associated with safe and effective communication with the brain are very complex, and there are still many unresolved issues delaying its development. In this work, we review some of the biological and technical issues that still remain to be solved, including long-term biotolerability, the number of electrodes required to provide useful vision, and the delivery of information to the implants. Furthermore, we emphasize the possible role of the neuroplastic changes that follow vision loss in the success of this approach. We propose that increased collaborations among clinicians, basic researchers, and neural engineers will enhance our ability to send meaningful information to the brain and restore a limited but useful sense of vision to many blind individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;At present, a healthy diet appears to be one of the suitable strategies in slowing down cognitive decline in the process of aging. A number of evidence-based studies confirm its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. The aim of this mini review is to evaluate and describe recent randomized clinical and cohort studies exploring the effect of healthy diet on cognitive performance among healthy seniors, as well as to update the existing information on this research issue. For these reasons, the authors reviewed full-text, peer-reviewed journal articles written in English and available in Web of Science and PubMed between September 2017 and February 2020. Altogether nine original studies were detected. The results indicate that healthy diet and healthy diet components generally have a positive impact on the enhancement of cognitive functions. Furthermore, the findings reveal that dietary patterns, as well as single nutrients might have a significant effect on specific cognitive domains, such as memory in general, episodic memory, or processing speed. It also seems that a strict adherence to the dietary patterns and a higher diet variety have a more significant effect on the improvement of cognitive functions. Nevertheless, there seem to be gender differences in dietary behavior. More recently, personalized dietary interventions started to be used in delaying cognitive decline among healthy seniors. Therefore, more randomized control trials or N-of-1 trials should be performed in this research area in order to detect the most suitable dietary pattern or nutrients, which would, together with other modifiable lifestyle factors, contribute to the improvement of quality of life of the aging population.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;When people talk, they gesture. Gesture is a fundamental component of language that contributes meaningful and unique information to a spoken message and reflects the speaker’s underlying knowledge and experiences. Theoretical perspectives of speech and gesture propose that they share a common conceptual origin and have a tightly integrated relationship, overlapping in time, meaning, and function to enrich the communicative context. We review a robust literature from the field of psychology documenting the benefits of gesture for communication for both speakers and listeners, as well as its important cognitive functions for organizing spoken language, and facilitating problem-solving, learning, and memory. Despite this evidence, gesture has been relatively understudied in populations with neurogenic communication disorders. While few studies have examined the rehabilitative potential of gesture in these populations, others have ignored gesture entirely or even discouraged its use. We review the literature characterizing gesture production and its role in intervention for people with aphasia, as well as describe the much sparser literature on gesture in cognitive communication disorders including right hemisphere damage, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer’s disease. The neuroanatomical and behavioral profiles of these patient populations provide a unique opportunity to test theories of the relationship of speech and gesture and advance our understanding of their neural correlates. This review highlights several gaps in the field of communication disorders which may serve as a bridge for applying the psychological literature of gesture to the study of language disorders. Such future work would benefit from considering theoretical perspectives of gesture and using more rigorous and quantitative empirical methods in its approaches. We discuss implications for leveraging gesture to explore its untapped potential in understanding and rehabilitating neurogenic communication disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD) are characterized by a selective detrimental impact on neurons in a specific brain area. Currently, these diseases have no cures, although some promising trials of therapies that may be able to slow the loss of brain cells are underway. Cell therapy is distinguished by its potential to replace cells to compensate for those lost to the degenerative process and has shown a great potential to replace degenerated neurons in animal models and in clinical trials in PD and HD patients. Fetal-derived neural progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells are the main cell sources that have been tested in cell therapy approaches. Furthermore, new strategies are emerging, such as the use of adult stem cells, encapsulated cell lines releasing trophic factors or cell-free products, containing an enriched secretome, which have shown beneficial preclinical outcomes. One of the major challenges for these potential new treatments is to overcome the host immune response to the transplanted cells. Immune rejection can cause significant alterations in transplanted and endogenous tissue and requires immunosuppressive drugs that may produce adverse effects. T-, B-lymphocytes and microglia have been recognized as the main effectors in striatal graft rejection. This review aims to summarize the preclinical and clinical studies of cell therapies in PD and HD. In addition, the precautions and strategies to ensure the highest quality of cell grafts, the lowest risk during transplantation and the reduction of a possible immune rejection will be outlined. Altogether, the wide-ranging possibilities of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) could make therapeutic treatment of these incurable diseases possible in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dominant, missense mutations in the widely and constitutively expressed GARS1 gene cause peripheral neuropathy that usually begins in adolescence and principally impacts the upper limbs. Caused by a toxic gain-of-function in the encoded glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) enzyme, the neuropathology appears to be independent of the canonical role of GlyRS in aminoacylation. Patients display progressive, life-long weakness and wasting of muscles in hands followed by feet, with frequently associated deficits in sensation. When dysfunction is observed in motor and sensory nerves, there is a diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D), or distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V if the symptoms are purely motor. The cause of this varied sensory involvement remains unresolved, as are the pathomechanisms underlying the selective neurodegeneration characteristic of the disease. We have previously identified in CMT2D mice that neuropathy-causing Gars mutations perturb sensory neuron fate and permit mutant GlyRS to aberrantly interact with neurotrophin receptors (Trks). Here, we extend this work by interrogating further the anatomy and function of the CMT2D sensory nervous system in mutant Gars mice, obtaining several key results: (1) sensory pathology is restricted to neurons innervating the hindlimbs; (2) perturbation of sensory development is not common to all mouse models of neuromuscular disease; (3) in vitro axonal transport of signaling endosomes is not impaired in afferent neurons of all CMT2D mouse models; and (4) Gars expression is selectively elevated in a subset of sensory neurons and linked to sensory developmental defects. These findings highlight the importance of comparative neurological assessment in mouse models of disease and shed light on key proposed neuropathogenic mechanisms in GARS1-linked neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment is the main gold-standard therapy for Parkinson disease (PD). Besides good antiparkinsonian effects, prolonged use of this drug is associated to the development of involuntary movements known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is linked to a sensitization of dopamine (DA) D1 receptors located on spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the dorsal striatum. Several evidences have shown that the emergence of LID can be related to striatal D1/cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway overactivation associated to aberrant N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. In addition, within striatum, ERK1/2 is also able to modulate in a D1 receptor-dependent manner the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway under DA depletion and L-DOPA therapy. Consistently, increased mTORC1 signaling appears during chronic administration of L-DOPA and shows a high correlation with the severity of dyskinesia. Furthermore, the abnormal activation of the D1/PKA/DARPP-32 cascade is paralleled by increased phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor at the PKA Ser845 site. The GluA1 promotes excitatory AMPA receptor-mediated transmission and may be implicated in the alterations found at the corticostriatal synapses of dyskinetic animals. In our study, we investigated the role of mTORC1 pathway activation in modulating bidirectional striatal synaptic plasticity in L-DOPA-treated parkinsonian rats. Inhibition of mTORC1 by coadministration of rapamycin to L-DOPA was able to limit the magnitude of LID expression, accounting for a therapeutic effect of this drug. In particular, behavioral data showed that, in L-DOPA-treated rats, rapamycin administration induced a selective decrease of distinct components of abnormal involuntary movements (i.e., axial and orolingual dyskinesia). Furthermore, ex vivo patch clamp and intracellular recordings of SPNs revealed that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 also resulted associated with a physiological bidirectional plasticity, when compared to dyskinetic rats treated with L-DOPA alone. This study uncovers the important role of mTORC1 inhibition to prevent the loss of striatal bidirectional plasticity under chronic L-DOPA treatment in rodent models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Laura de Arroyo Garcia, Patrik R. Jones&lt;/p&gt;

In the growing field of metabolic engineering, where cells are treated as ‘factories’ that synthesize industrial compounds, it is essential to consider the ability of the cells’ native metabolism to accommodate the demands of synthetic pathways, as these pathways will alter the homeostasis of cellular energy and electron metabolism. From the breakdown of substrate, microorganisms activate and reduce key co-factors such as ATP and NAD(P)H, which subsequently need to be hydrolysed and oxidized, respectively, in order to restore cellular balance. A balanced supply and consumption of such co-factors, here termed &lt;i&gt;co-factor balance&lt;/i&gt;, will influence biotechnological performance. To aid the strain selection and design process, we used stoichiometric modelling (FBA, pFBA, FVA and MOMA) and the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;) core stoichiometric model to investigate the network-wide effect of butanol and butanol precursor production pathways differing in energy and electron demand on product yield. An FBA-based co-factor balance assessment (CBA) algorithm was developed to track and categorise how ATP and NAD(P)H pools are affected in the presence of a new pathway. CBA was compared to the balance calculations proposed by Dugar et al. (Nature Biotechnol. 29 (12), 1074–1078). Predicted solutions were compromised by excessively underdetermined systems, displaying greater flexibility in the range of reaction fluxes than experimentally measured by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and the appearance of unrealistic futile co-factor cycles. With the assumption that futile cycles are tightly regulated in reality, the FBA models were manually constrained in a step-wise manner. Solutions with minimal futile cycling diverted surplus energy and electrons towards biomass formation. As an alternative, the use of loopless FBA or constraining the models with measured flux ranges were tried but did not prevent futile co-factor cycles. The results highlight the need to account for co-factor imbalance and confirm that better-balanced pathways with minimal diversion of surplus towards biomass formation present the highest theoretical yield. The analysis also suggests that ATP and NAD(P)H balancing cannot be assessed in isolation from each other, or even from the balance of additional co-factors such as AMP and ADP. We conclude that, through revealing the source of co-factor imbalance CBA can facilitate pathway and host selection when designing new biocatalysts for implementation by metabolic engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cksuVli6J44&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) regulates synaptic plasticity in multiple ways, supposedly including the secretion of neuromodulators like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we show that neuromodulator secretion is indeed reduced in mouse α- and βCaMKII-deficient (αβCaMKII double-knockout [DKO]) hippocampal neurons. However, this was not due to reduced secretion efficiency or neuromodulator vesicle transport but to 40% reduced neuromodulator levels at synapses and 50% reduced delivery of new neuromodulator vesicles to axons. αβCaMKII depletion drastically reduced neuromodulator expression. Blocking BDNF secretion or BDNF scavenging in wild-type neurons produced a similar reduction. Reduced neuromodulator expression in αβCaMKII DKO neurons was restored by active βCaMKII but not inactive βCaMKII or αCaMKII, and by CaMKII downstream effectors that promote cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. These data indicate that CaMKII regulates neuromodulation in a feedback loop coupling neuromodulator secretion to βCaMKII- and CREB-dependent neuromodulator expression and axonal targeting, but CaMKIIs are dispensable for the secretion process itself.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6ioF5P1TIuw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Studies of neural processes underlying delay of gratification usually focus on prefrontal networks related to curbing affective impulses. Here, we provide evidence for an alternative mechanism that facilitates delaying gratification by mental orientation towards the future. Combining continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) with functional neuroimaging, we tested how the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) facilitates processing of future events and thereby promotes delay of gratification. Participants performed an intertemporal decision task and a mental time-travel task in the MRI scanner before and after receiving cTBS over the rTPJ or the vertex (control site). rTPJ cTBS led to both stronger temporal discounting for longer delays and reduced processing of future relative to past events in the mental time-travel task. This finding suggests that the rTPJ contributes to the ability to delay gratification by facilitating mental representation of outcomes in the future. On the neural level, rTPJ cTBS led to a reduction in the extent to which connectivity of rTPJ with striatum reflected the value of delayed rewards, indicating a role of rTPJ–striatum connectivity in constructing neural representations of future rewards. Together, our findings provide evidence that the rTPJ is an integral part of a brain network that promotes delay of gratification by facilitating mental orientation to future rewards.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RqA111s2EcY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>
