 &lt;p&gt;The modern machine learning methods allow one to obtain the data-driven
models in various ways. However, the more complex the model is, the harder it
is to interpret. In the paper, we describe the algorithm for the mathematical
equations discovery from the given observations data. The algorithm combines
genetic programming with the sparse regression.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm allows obtaining different forms of the resulting models. As
an example, it could be used for governing analytical equation discovery as
well as for partial differential equations (PDE) discovery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea is to collect a bag of the building blocks (it may be simple
functions or their derivatives of arbitrary order) and consequently take them
from the bag to create combinations, which will represent terms of the final
equation. The selected terms pass to the evolutionary algorithm, which is used
to evolve the selection. The evolutionary steps are combined with the sparse
regression to pick only the significant terms. As a result, we obtain a short
and interpretable expression that describes the physical process that lies
beyond the data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper, two examples of the algorithm application are described: the
PDE discovery for the metocean processes and the function discovery for the
acoustics.

 &lt;p&gt;We organized a workshop on the &quot;Present and Future Frameworks of Theoretical
Neuroscience&quot;, with the support of the National Science Foundation. The
objective was to identify the challenges and strategies that this field will
need to tackle in order to incorporate vast and multi-scale streams of
experimental data from the technologies developed by the BRAIN initiative. The
participants, divided in workgroups, identified five key areas that, while not
exhaustive, cover multiple aspects of current challenges needed to be
developed: Dynamics-statistics; multi-scale integration; coding; brain-body
integration; and structure of neuroscience theories. While each area is
different, there were coincidences on finding theoretical paths to incorporate
biophysics, energetics, and ethology with more abstract coding and
computational approaches. Each workgroup has continued to work after the
meeting to develop the ideas seeded there, which are started to being
published. Here, we provide a perspective of the discussions of each workgroup
that point to building on the present foundations of theoretical neuroscience
and extend them by incorporating multi-scale information with the objective of
providing mechanistic insights into the nervous system.

 &lt;p&gt;With more and more event-based neuromorphic hardware systems being developed
at universities and in industry, there is a growing need for assessing their
performance with domain specific measures. In this work, we use the methodology
of converting pre-trained non-spiking to spiking neural networks to evaluate
the performance loss and measure the energy-per-inference for three
neuromorphic hardware systems (BrainScaleS, Spikey, SpiNNaker) and common
simulation frameworks for CPU (NEST) and CPU/GPU (GeNN). For analog hardware we
further apply a re-training technique known as hardware-in-the-loop training to
cope with device mismatch. This analysis is performed for five different
networks, including three networks that have been found by an automated
optimization with a neural architecture search framework. We demonstrate that
the conversion loss is usually below one percent for digital implementations,
and moderately higher for analog systems with the benefit of much lower
energy-per-inference costs.

 &lt;p&gt;At the end of 2019 the world has seen the initial breakout of COVID-19, a
disease caused by SARS-CoV2 virus in China. The World Health Organization (WHO)
declared this disease as a pandemic on March 22 2020. As the disease spread
globally, it becomes difficult to tract the transmission dynamics of this
disease in all countries, as they may differ in geographical, demographical and
strategical aspects. In this short note, the author proposes the utilization of
a type of neural network to generate a global topological map for these
dynamics, in which countries that share similar dynamics are mapped adjacently,
and countries with significantly different dynamics are mapped far from each
other. The author believes that this kind of topological map can be useful for
further analyzing and comparing the correlation between the diseases dynamics
with strategies to mitigate this global crisis in an intuitive manner. Some
initial experiments with with time series of patients numbers in more than 240
countries are explained in this not.

 &lt;p&gt;Neural Architecture Search (NAS) was first proposed to achieve
state-of-the-art performance through the discovery of new architecture
patterns, without human intervention. An over-reliance on expert knowledge in
the search space design has however led to increased performance (local optima)
without significant architectural breakthroughs, thus preventing truly novel
solutions from being reached. In this work we propose 1) to cast NAS as a
problem of finding the optimal network generator and 2) a new, hierarchical and
graph-based search space capable of representing an extremely large variety of
network types, yet only requiring few continuous hyper-parameters. This greatly
reduces the dimensionality of the problem, enabling the effective use of
Bayesian Optimisation as a search strategy. At the same time, we expand the
range of valid architectures, motivating a multi-objective learning approach.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy on six benchmark datasets and
show that our search space generates extremely lightweight yet highly
competitive models illustrating the benefits of a NAS approach that optimises
over network generator selection.

 &lt;p&gt;One hope of using non-elitism in evolutionary computation is that it aids
leaving local optima. We perform a rigorous runtime analysis of a basic
non-elitist evolutionary algorithm (EA), the $(\mu,\lambda)$ EA, on the most
basic benchmark function with a local optimum, the jump function. We prove that
for all reasonable values of the parameters and the problem, the expected
runtime of the $(\mu,\lambda)$ EA is, apart from lower order terms, at least as
large as the expected runtime of its elitist counterpart, the
$(\mu+\lambda)$~EA (for which we conduct the first runtime analysis to allow
this comparison). Consequently, the ability of the $(\mu,\lambda)$ EA to leave
local optima to inferior solutions does not lead to a runtime advantage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We complement this lower bound with an upper bound that, for broad ranges of
the parameters, is identical to our lower bound apart from lower order terms.
This is the first runtime result for a non-elitist algorithm on a multi-modal
problem that is tight apart from lower order terms.

 &lt;p&gt;The need for more transparency of the decision-making processes in artificial
neural networks steadily increases driven by their applications in safety
critical and ethically challenging domains such as autonomous driving or
medical diagnostics. We address today's lack of transparency of neural networks
and shed light on the roles of single neurons and groups of neurons within the
network fulfilling a learned task. Inspired by research in the field of
neuroscience, we characterize the learned representations by activation
patterns and network ablations, revealing functional neuron populations that a)
act jointly in response to specific stimuli or b) have similar impact on the
network's performance after being ablated. We find that neither a neuron's
magnitude or selectivity of activation, nor its impact on network performance
are sufficient stand-alone indicators for its importance for the overall task.
We argue that such indicators are essential for future advances in transfer
learning and modern neuroscience.

 &lt;p&gt;A recent line of studies has focused on the infinite width limit of deep
neural networks (DNNs) where, under a certain deterministic training protocol,
the DNN outputs are related to a Gaussian Process (GP) known as the Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK). However, finite-width DNNs differ from GPs quantitatively
and for CNNs the difference may be qualitative. Here we present a DNN training
protocol involving noise whose outcome is mappable to a certain non-Gaussian
stochastic process. An analytical framework is then introduced to analyze this
resulting non-Gaussian process, whose deviation from a GP is controlled by the
finite width. Our work extends upon previous relations between DNNs and GPs in
several ways: (a) In the infinite width limit, it establishes a mapping between
DNNs and a GP different from the NTK. (b) It allows computing analytically the
general form of the finite width correction (FWC) for DNNs with arbitrary
activation functions and depth and further provides insight on the magnitude
and implications of these FWCs. (c) It appears capable of providing better
performance than the corresponding GP in the case of CNNs. We are able to
predict the outputs of empirical finite networks with high accuracy, improving
upon the accuracy of GP predictions by over an order of magnitude. Overall, we
provide a framework that offers both an analytical handle and a more faithful
model of real-world settings than previous studies in this avenue of research.

 &lt;p&gt;The present review presents multiple techniques in which ocular assessments
may serve as a noninvasive approach for the early diagnoses of various
cognitive and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism
spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SZ), and major depressive disorder
(MDD). Real-time ocular responses are tightly associated with emotional and
cognitive processing within the central nervous system. Patterns seen in
saccades, pupillary responses, and blinking, as well as retinal
microvasculature and morphology visualized via office-based ophthalmic imaging,
are potential biomarkers for the screening and evaluation of cognitive and
psychiatric disorders. Additionally, rapid advances in artificial intelligence
(AI) present a growing opportunity to use machine-learning-based AI, especially
deep-learning neural networks, to shed new light on the field of cognitive
neuroscience, which may lead to novel evaluations and interventions via ocular

 The anti-malarial artemisinins have also been implicated in the regulation of various other cellular pathways. Despite their widespread application, the cellular specificities and molecular mechanisms of target recognition by artemisinins remain poorly characterized. We recently demonstrated how these drugs modulate inhibitory postsynaptic signaling by direct binding to the scaffolding protein gephyrin. Here, we report the crystal structure of the central metabolic enzyme pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), which catalyzes the production of the active form of vitamin-B6 (also known as pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, PLP), in complex with artesunate at 2.4-[A] resolution. Partially overlapping binding of artemisinins with the substrate pyridoxal inhibits PLP biosynthesis as demonstrated by kinetic measurements. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices and activity measurements of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a PLP-dependent enzyme synthesizing the neurotransmitter {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), define how artemisinins interfere presynaptically with GABAergic signaling. Our data provide a comprehensive picture of artemisinin-induced effects on inhibitory signaling in the brain.</content>

 Foraging is a vital behavioral task for living organisms. Behavioral strategies and abstract mathematical models thereof have been described in detail for various species. To explore the link between underlying nervous systems and abstract computational principles we present how a biologically detailed neural circuit model of the insect mushroom body implements sensory processing, learning and motor control. We focus on cast &amp;amp; surge strategies employed by flying insects when foraging within turbulent odor plumes. Using a synaptic plasticity rule the model rapidly learns to associate individual olfactory sensory cues paired with food in a classical conditioning paradigm. Without retraining, the system dynamically recalls memories to detect relevant cues in complex sensory scenes. Accumulation of this sensory evidence on short time-scales generates cast &amp;amp; surge motor commands. Our systems approach is generic and predicts that population sparseness facilitates learning, while temporal sparseness is required for dynamic memory recall and precise behavioral control.</content>

 A rapidly growing body of research indicates that inhibition of distracting information may not be under flexible, top-down control, but instead heavily relies on expectations derived from past experience about the likelihood of events or statistical learning. Yet, how expectations about distracting information influence distractor inhibition at the neural level remains unclear. To determine how learned expectations about distractor features and/or location modulate distractor processing, we measured EEG while participants performed two variants of the additional singleton paradigm. Critically, in these different variants target and distractor features either randomly swapped across trials, favoring stimulus-driven selection (singleton detection mode), or were fixed, allowing for goal-driven selection (feature search mode) and the development of distractor feature-based expectations. Moreover, participants performed these tasks both with and without a high probability distractor location. Our results show that both distractor feature- and location learning contributed to distractor inhibition, as indicated by corresponding reductions in distractor costs during visual search and an earlier distractor-evoked Pd ERP. Large individual differences further suggest a functional dissociation between early and late Pd components, with the former reflecting early sensory suppression related to intertrial priming and the latter reflecting suppression sensitive to statistical learning over a longer time scale. Spatial expectations did not increase anticipatory alpha-band activity over visual regions representing the expected distractor location, suggesting that statistical learning may rely on activity-silent mechanisms, such as synaptic plasticity. Together, our findings provide further support to the idea that distractor suppression strongly relies on expectations derived from past experience and reveal the neural mechanisms underlying spatial and non-spatial distractor learning.</content>

 Our conscious visual perception relies on predictive signals, notably in the periphery where sensory uncertainty is high. We investigated how such signals could support perceptual stability of objects size across the visual field. When attended carefully, the same object appears slightly smaller in the periphery compared to the fovea. Could this perceptual difference be encoded as a strong prior to predict the peripheral perceived size relative to the fovea? Recent studies emphasized the role of foveal information in defining peripheral size percepts. However, they could not disentangle bottom-up from top-down mechanisms. Here, we revealed a pure top-down contribution to the perceptual size difference between periphery and fovea. First, we discovered a novel Ebbinghaus illusion effect, inducing a typical reduction of foveal perceived size, but a reversed increase effect in the periphery. The size percept was similar at both retinal locations and deviated from the classic perceptual difference. Then through an updating process of successive peripheral-foveal viewing, the unusual peripheral perceived size decreased. The classic perceptual eccentricity difference was restored and the peripheral illusion effect changed into a fovea-like reduction. Therefore, we report the existence of a prior that actively shapes peripheral size perception and stabilizes it relative to the fovea.</content>

 Touching an object leads to a frictional interaction between the skin and the object. There are two kinds of friction: the first contact that leads to static friction and the dragging phase that leads to dynamic friction. No study has been performed to show the effect of friction type on EEG signals. The main goal of the current study is to investigate the effect of tactile friction on non-linear features of EEG signals. Participants performed a tactile task that each of its trials had three states: the sensation of 1) static friction, 2) dynamic friction, and 3) no friction. During the experiment, EEG signals were recorded, and different linear and non-linear EEG indices were extracted and analyzed to find the effect of the tactile friction on EEG signals. Linear features such as spectral features were not a good choice to distinguish between the states. However, non-linear features such as Lyapunov exponent, Higuchis dimension, and Hurst exponent had the potential to separate the mentioned states. Results also showed signs of predictability (negative Lyapunov exponent) in the signals recorded during dynamic friction and the existence of long-range dependency (memory) in EEG signals recorded during all states. The complexity of the tactile system in Theta band was also higher than the Delta band. The results of this research not only increase our knowledge about brain non-linear dynamics in response to tactile friction but also lead to a design of a preliminary system that can automatically detect friction between the skin and surfaces.</content>

 Alpha-7-nicotine-acetylcholine-receptor (7-nAChRs) agonists modulate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway to attenuate proinflammatory signals and reduce dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in toxin-induced experimental murine models of Parkinson's disease (PD). The protein -synuclein (Syn) is considered to represent the major pathogenic component in the etiology and progression of sporadic PD. However, no research has been performed to evaluate the effect of 7-nAChR agonists in human Syn mediated models of PD. We, therefore, investigated the effect of the compound JN403, an 7-nAChR specific agonist, in Syn treated in vitro microglia culture and in a human Syn overexpression in vivo mouse model. In primary mouse microglia cells, Syn fragment 61-140 treatment increased the release of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-6, and decreased cell viability. In contrast, 100 nM or 1 M of JN403 co-incubation significantly reduced the level of NO and TNF- release in the microglial cells. For in-vivo testing of JN403, a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV)-mediated unilateral intranigral overexpression of human wild-type-Syn (WT-Syn) or the control protein luciferase (luc) was induced via stereotactic delivery in C57/BL6N mice. Targeted WT-Syn overexpression reduced 20% of the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive (+) nigral neurons after 10 weeks. Subcutaneous daily treatment of 30 mg/kg JN403 over 9 weeks starting at postoperative week 1 did not alter the decrease of TH+ neuronal numbers, and microglial density in WT-Syn overexpression mouse model. The reduced density of TH+ striatal terminals in the WT-Syn groups was also not recovered by the JN403 treatment. In summary, JN403, an 7-nAChR specific agonist shows a beneficial effect on ameliorating proinflammatory signals in Syn exposed microglia cells. However, no significant in-vivo treatment effect was found in an intranigral WT-Syn overexpression mouse model of PD.</content>

 The blood-brain barrier is made of polarised brain endothelial cells (BECs) phenotypically conditioned by the central nervous system (CNS). Transport across BECs is of paramount importance for nutrient uptake as well as to rid the brain of waste products. Nevertheless, currently, we do not understand how large macromolecular cargo shuttles across and how BECs discriminate between the brain-bound and own nutrients. Here, we study the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) an essential regulator of BEC transport and show that it is associated with endocytic effectors, endo-lysosomal compartments as well as syndapin-2, a member of the Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily known to stabilise tubular carriers. We employed synthetic self-assembled vesicles, polymersomes, as a multivalent system with tunable avidity as a tool to investigate the mechanism of transport across BECs. We used a combination of conventional and super-resolution microscopy, both in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by biophysical modelling of transport kinetics and membrane-bound interactions. Our results demonstrate that the avidity of the ligand-receptor interaction (the overall cargo binding energy) determines the mechanism of sorting during the early stages of endocytosis and consequent trafficking. We show that high avidity cargo biases the LRP1 towards internalisation and fast degradation in BECs, while mid avidity augments the formation of syndapin-2 stabilised tubular carriers and promotes fast shuttling across BECs. Thus, we map out a very detailed mechanism where clathrin, actin, syndapin-2, dynamin and SNARE act synergistically to enable fast shuttling across BECs.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the selective vulnerability of specific neuronal populations, the molecular signatures of which are largely unknown. To identify and characterize selectively vulnerable neuronal populations, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the caudal entorhinal cortex and the superior frontal gyrus - brain regions where neurofibrillary inclusions and neuronal loss occur early and late in AD, respectively - from individuals spanning the neuropathological progression of AD. We identified RORB as a marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex, and subsequently validated their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods. We also discovered an astrocyte subpopulation, likely representing reactive astrocytes, characterized by decreased expression of genes involved in homeostatic functions. Our characterization of selectively vulnerable neurons in AD paves the way for future mechanistic studies of selective vulnerability and potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing neuronal resilience.</content>

 We show that the classical problem of 3D size perception in obliquely viewed pictures can be understood by comparing human performance to the optimal geometric solution. A photograph seen from the camera position, forms the same retinal projection as the physical 3D scene, but retinal projections of sizes and shapes are distorted in oblique viewing. For real scenes, we previously showed that size and shape inconstancy result despite observers using the correct geometric back-transform, because some retinal images evoke misestimates of viewing elevation. Now, we examine how observers estimate 3D sizes in oblique views of pictures of objects in different poses on the ground. Compared to the camera position estimates, sizes in oblique views were seriously underestimated for objects at fronto-parallel poses, but there was almost no change for objects perceived as pointing towards the viewer. The inverse of the function relating projected length to pose, camera elevation and viewing azimuth, gives the optimal correction factor for inferring correct 3D lengths if the elevation and azimuth are estimated accurately. Empirical correction functions had similar shapes to optimal, but lower amplitude. Measurements revealed that observers systematically underestimated viewing azimuth, similar to the fronto-parallel bias for object pose perception. A model that adds underestimation of viewing azimuth to the geometrical back-transform, provided good fits to estimated 3D lengths from oblique views. These results add to accumulating evidence that observers use internalized projective geometry to perceive sizes, shapes and poses in 3D scenes and their pictures.</content>

 Listeners experience speech as a sequence of discrete words. However, the real input is a continuously varying acoustic signal that blends words and phonemes into one another. Here we recorded two-hour magnetoencephalograms from 21 subjects listening to stories, in order to investigate how the brain concurrently solves three competing demands: 1) processing overlapping acoustic-phonetic information while 2) keeping track of the relative order of phonemic units and 3) maintaining individuated phonetic information until successful word recognition. We show that the human brain transforms speech input, roughly at the rate of phoneme duration, along a temporally-defined representational trajectory. These representations, absent from the acoustic signal, are active earlier when phonemes are predictable than when they are surprising, and are sustained until lexical ambiguity is resolved. The results reveal how phoneme sequences in natural speech are represented and how they interface with stored lexical items.</content>

 Humans automatically and unintentionally detect and remember regularities in the visual environment-a type of learning termed visual statistical learning (VSL). Many aspects of learning from reward resemble statistical learning in some respects, yet whether and how reward learning impacts VSL is largely unexamined. In two studies, we investigated the impact of reward on VSL and examined the neural basis of this interaction using fMRI. Subjects completed a risky choice task, in which they learned the values (high or low) of fractal images through a trial-and-error binary-choice task. Unbeknownst to subjects, we paired images so that some images always predicted other images on the following trial. This led to four types of pairings (High-High, High-Low, Low-High, and Low-Low). In a subsequent recognition task and reward memory task, we asked them to choose the more familiar of two pairs (a target and a foil) and to recall the value of images (high or low). We found better recognition when the first image of a pair was a high-value image, with High-High pairs showing the highest recognition rate. To investigate the neural basis of this effect, we measured brain responses to visual images that were associated with both varying levels of reward and sequential contingencies with event-related fMRI. Subjects completed the same risky choice task and then passively viewed a stream of the images with pairwise relationships intact. Brain responses to images during the risky choice task were affected by both value and statistical contingencies. When we compared responses between the first image of a pair that was high-value and the first image of a pair that was low-value, we found greater activation in regions that included inferior frontal gyrus, left anterior cingulate gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and lateral occipital cortex. These findings are not driven solely by the value difference, but rather the interaction between statistically structured information and reward - the same value contrast yielded no regions for either second-image contrasts or for singletons. Our results suggest that the first images of pairs that were associated with high-value, in comparison to those associated with low-value, were involved in greater attentional engagement, potentially enabling better memory for statistically learned pairs and reward information. Additionally, we found neural evidence that when an image contains both statistical structure and reward information, the reward learning may be predicted by the type of the statistical structure it is associated with. We conclude that reward contingencies affect VSL, with high-value associated with stronger behavioral and neural signatures of such learning.</content>

		<content type="html">
 People often adapt their coordination patterns during walking to reduce energy cost by using sources of external assistance in the environment. Adaptation to walking on a split-belt treadmill, where one belt moves faster than the other, provides an opportunity for people to acquire positive work from the treadmill to reduce metabolic cost by modifying where they step on the faster belt. Though we know what people should do to acquire this assistance, this strategy is not observed during typical adaptation studies. Here, by extending the duration of adaptation, we show that people continuously optimize energetic cost by adjusting foot placement to acquire positive work from the treadmill and reduce the work performed by the legs. These results demonstrate that learning to acquire and take advantage of assistance to reduce energetic cost is central in shaping adaptive locomotion, but this process occurs over timescales longer than those used in typical studies.</content>

 Objective: The classification of patients with Primary Progressive Aphasia into variants is time consuming, costly, and requires combined evaluations by clinical neurologists, neuropsychologists, speech pathologists, and radiologists. Therefore, our aim is to determine if acoustic and linguistic variables provide accurate classification of PPA patients into one of the three variants. Methods: In this paper, we present a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Networks for the subtyping of patients with PPA into the three main variants using combined acoustic and linguistic information elicited automatically using acoustic and linguistic analysis. The performance of the Deep Neural Networks was compared to the classification accuracy of Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees. It was also compared to the classification based on auditory scores provided by clinicians. Results: The DNN model resulted in 80% classification accuracy providing reliable subtyping of patients with PPA into variants that outperformed other machine learning models and auditory classification of patients into variants by clinicians. Conclusion: We show that combined measures of speech and language function as the patients' fingerprint and provide information about patients' symptoms and variant subtyping.

 Research into the neural correlates of consciousness has found that the vividness and complexity of conscious experience is related to the structure of brain dynamics, and that alterations to consciousness track changes in temporal evolution of brain states. Despite inducing externally similar states, propofol and ketamine produce different subjective states of consciousness. Here we explore the different effects of these two anaesthetics on the structure of dynamical attractors reconstructed from brain activity recorded electrophysiologically from cerebral cortex of a non-human primate. We used two different methods of attractor reconstruction. The first embeds the recordings in a continuous high-dimensional manifold on which we use topological data analysis to infer the presence (or absence) of higher-order dynamics. The second reconstruction, an ordinal partition network embedding, allows us to create a discrete state-transition network approximation of a continuous attractor, which is amenable to information-theoretic analysis and contains rich information about state-transition dynamics. We find significant differences between the awake, ketamine, and propofol conditions. Propofol significantly decreased the expression of higher-order structure in brain dynamics, while ketamine had the opposite effect, promoting an increase in complex dynamic features. Overall we found that ketamine produced dynamics similar to normal waking consciousness while propofol did not, and the significance of these findings is discussed.</content>

 The cerebellum is the largest sensorimotor structure in the brain, but its mode of operation is not well understood. However, a fundamental organizational feature of the cerebellar cortex is division into elongated zones, defined by their inputs from specific parts of the inferior olive and Purkinje cell output to cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. Little is known about how the pattern of neuronal activity in zones, and their functional microcircuit subdivisions, microzones, is related to behaviour in awake animals. Here, we studied the organization of microzones within the C3 zone and their activity during a skilled forelimb reaching task in cats. Neurons in different parts of the C3 zone, functionally determined by receptive field characteristics, differed in their patterns of activity during movement. Our results suggest that the cerebellar C3 zone is organized and operates within an action-based frame of reference, with different microcircuits within the zone controlling specific muscle synergies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the highly specialised peripheral synapse formed between lower motor neuron terminals and muscle fibres. Post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), which are found in high density in the muscle membrane, bind to acetylcholine released into the synaptic cleft of the NMJ, ultimately facilitating the conversion of motor action potentials to muscle contractions. NMJs have been studied for many years as a general model for synapse formation, development and function, and are known to be early sites of pathological changes in many neuromuscular diseases. However, information is limited on the diversity of NMJs in different muscles, whether muscle fibre type impacts NMJ morphology and growth, and the relevance of these parameters to neuropathology. Here, this crucial gap was addressed using a robust and standardised semi-automated workflow called NMJ-morph to quantify features of pre- and post-synaptic NMJ architecture in an unbiased manner. Five wholemount muscles from wild-type mice were dissected and compared at immature (post-natal day, P7) and early adult (P31-32) timepoints. Post-synaptic AChR morphology was found to be more variable between muscles than that of the motor neuron terminal and there were greater differences in the developing NMJ than at the mature synapse. Post-synaptic architecture, but not neuronal morphology or post-natal synapse growth, correlates with fibre type and is largely independent of muscle fibre diameter. Counter to previous observations, this study indicates that smaller NMJs tend to innervate muscles with higher proportions of fast twitch fibres and that NMJ growth rate is not conserved across all muscles. Furthermore, healthy pre- and post-synaptic NMJ morphological parameters were collected for five anatomically and functionally distinct mouse muscles, generating reference data that will be useful for the future assessment of neuromuscular disease models.</content>

 During navigation, the brain must continuously integrate external guidance cues with internal spatial maps to update steering commands. However, it has been difficult to link spatial maps with motor control. Here we identify 'descending steering' neurons in the Drosophila brain that lie two synapses downstream from the brain's heading direction map in the central complex. These steering neurons predict behavioral turns caused by microstimulation of the spatial map. Moreover, these neurons receive 'direct' sensory input that bypasses the central complex, and they predict steering evoked by multimodal stimuli. Unilateral activation of these neurons can promote turning, while bilateral silencing interferes with body and leg movements. In short, these neurons combine internal maps with external cues to predict and influence steering. They represent a key link between cognitive maps, which use an abstract coordinate frame, and motor commands, which use a body-centric coordinate frame.</content>

 Understanding Parkinson's disease (PD) in particular in its earliest phases is important for diagnosis and treatment. However, human brain samples are collected post-mortem, reflecting mainly end stage disease. Because brain samples of mouse models can be collected at any stage of the disease process, they are useful to investigate PD progression. Here, we compare ventral midbrain transcriptomics profiles from -synuclein transgenic mice with a progressive, early PD-like striatum neurodegeneration across different ages using pathway, gene set and network analysis methods. Our study uncovers statistically significant altered genes across ages and between genotypes with known, suspected or unknown function in PD pathogenesis and key pathways associated with disease progression. Among those are genotype-dependent alterations associated with synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission, as well as mitochondria-related genes and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Age-dependent changes were among others observed in neuronal and synaptic activity, calcium homeostasis, and membrane receptor signaling pathways, many of which linked to G-protein coupled receptors. Most importantly, most changes occurred before neurodegeneration was detected in this model, which points to a sequence of gene expression events that may be relevant for disease initiation and progression. It is tempting to speculate that molecular changes similar to those changes observed in our model happen in midbrain dopaminergic neurons before they start to degenerate. In other words, we believe we have uncovered molecular changes that accompany the progression from preclinical to early PD.</content>

 Empathy, among other social-cognitive processes, changes across adulthood. More specifically, cognitive components of empathy (understanding other perspectives) appear to decline with age, while findings for affective empathy (sharing other emotional states) are rather mixed. Not well understood yet are the neural correlates underlying cognitive and affective empathy and the extent to which valence modulates these components of empathy in aging. To fill these research gaps, young and older participants completed a modified version of the Multifaceted Empathy Test, which measures both cognitive and affective empathy, while brain images were acquired in the MRI scanner. Multivariate analysis showed that regions of the salience network, including anterior insula and anterior cingulate, were more involved in cognitive empathy to negative emotions, in older than in younger participants. For affective empathy to positive emotions, in contrast, young and older participants recruited a similar brain network including the main nodes of the default mode network. These results provide novel insights into the neural networks subserving cognitive and affective empathy in young and older adults and highlight a modulatory role of valence on empathy in aging. Our findings highlight the importance of valence for the study of higher-order social-cognitive processes such as empathy in aging.</content>

 Drosophila melanogaster has long been a popular model insect species, due in large part to the availability of genetic tools and is fast becoming the model for insect colour vision. Key to understanding colour reception in Drosophila is in-depth knowledge of spectral inputs and downstream neural processing. While recent studies have sparked renewed interest in colour processing in Drosophila, photoreceptor spectral sensitivity measurements have yet to be carried out in vivo. We have fully characterised the spectral input to the motion and colour vision pathways, and directly measured the effects of spectral modulating factors, screening pigment density and carotenoid-based ocular pigments. All receptor sensitivities had significant shifts in spectral sensitivity compared to previous measurements. Notably, the spectral range of the Rh6 visual pigment is substantially broadened and its peak sensitivity is shifted by 92 nm from 508 to 600 nm. We propose that this deviation can be explained by transmission of long wavelengths through the red screening pigment and by the presence of the blue-absorbing filter in the R7y receptors. Further, we tested direct interactions between photoreceptors and found evidence of interactions between inner and outer receptors, in agreement with previous findings of cross-modulation between receptor outputs in the lamina.</content>

 Objective: We identified a novel de novo SCN2A variant (M1879T) associated with infantile-onset epilepsy that responded dramatically to sodium channel blocker antiepileptic drugs. We analyzed the functional and pharmacological consequences of this variant to establish pathogenicity, and to correlate genotype with phenotype and clinical drug response. Methods: The clinical and genetic features of an infant boy with epilepsy are presented. We investigated the effect of the variant using heterologously expressed recombinant human NaV1.2 channels. We performed whole-cell patch clamp recording to determine the functional consequences and response to carbamazepine. Results: The M1879T variant caused disturbances in channel inactivation including substantially depolarized voltage-dependence of inactivation, slower time course of inactivation, and enhanced resurgent current that collectively represent a gain-of-function. Carbamazepine partially normalized the voltage-dependence of inactivation and produced use-dependent block of the variant channel at high pulsing frequencies. Carbamazepine also suppresses resurgent current conducted by M1879T channels, but this effect was explained primarily by reducing the peak transient current. Molecular modeling suggests that the M1879T variant disrupts contacts with nearby residues in the C-terminal domain of the channel. Interpretation: Our study demonstrates the value of conducting functional analyses of SCN2A variants of unknown significance to establish pathogenicity and genotype-phenotype correlations. We also show concordance of in vitro pharmacology using heterologous cells with the drug response observed clinically in a case of SCN2A-associated epilepsy.</content>

 Although numerous studies have suggested that pharmacological alteration of the dopamine (DA) system modulates reward discounting, these studies have produced inconsistent findings. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate DA drug-mediated effects on reward discounting in studies of healthy rodents. This produced a total of 1,343 articles to screen for inclusion/exclusion. From the literature, we identified 117 effects from approximately 1,549 individual rodents. Using random-effects with maximum-likelihood estimation, we meta-analyzed placebo-controlled drug effects for (1) DA transporters, (2) DA D1-like receptor agonists and (3) antagonists, and (4) D2-like agonists and (5) antagonists. Meta-analytic effects showed that DAT-binding drugs decreased reward discounting. While D1 and D2 antagonists both increased discounting, agonist drugs for those receptors had no significant effect on discounting behavior. These findings suggest a nuanced relationship between DA and discounting behavior and urge caution when drawing generalizations about the effects of pharmacologically manipulating dopamine on reward-based decision making.</content>

 The spatiotemporal structure of activity in populations of neurons is critical for accurate perception and behavior. Experimental and theoretical studies have focused on noise correlations (trial-to-trial covariations in neural activity for a given stimulus) as a key feature of population activity structure. Much work has shown that these correlations limit the stimulus information encoded by a population of neurons, leading to the widely held prediction that correlations are detrimental for perceptual discrimination behaviors. However, this prediction relies on an untested assumption: that the neural mechanisms that read out sensory information to inform behavior depend only on the population total stimulus information independently of how correlations constrain this information across neurons or time. Here we make the critical advance of simultaneously studying how correlations affect both the encoding and the readout of sensory information. We analyzed calcium imaging data from mouse posterior parietal cortex during two perceptual discrimination tasks. Correlations limited the ability to encode stimulus information, but (seemingly paradoxically) correlations were higher when mice made correct choices than when they made errors. On a single-trial basis, the behavioral choice of the mouse depended not only on the stimulus information in the activity of the population as a whole, but unexpectedly also on the consistency of information across neurons and time. Because correlations increased information consistency, sensory information was more efficiently converted into a behavioral choice in the presence of correlations. Given this enhanced-by-consistency readout, we estimated that correlations produced a behavioral benefit that compensated or overcame their detrimental information-limiting effects. These results call for a reevaluation of the role of correlated neural activity, and suggest that correlations in association cortex can benefit task performance even if they decrease sensory information.</content>

 There has been little evidence linking changes in spiking activity that occur prior to a spatially predictable target (i.e., prior to target selection) to behavioral outcomes, despite such preparatory changes being widely assumed to enhance the sensitivity of sensory processing. We simultaneously recorded from frontal and parietal nodes of the attention network, while macaques performed a spatial-cueing task. When anticipating a spatially predictable target, different patterns of coupling between spike timing and oscillatory phase in local field potentials, but not changes in spike rate, were predictive of different behavioral outcomes. These behaviorally relevant differences in local and between-region synchronization occurred among specific cell types that were defined based on their sensory and motor properties, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying enhanced sensory processing prior to target selection. We propose that these changes in neural synchronization reflect differential, anticipatory engagement of the network nodes and functional units that shape attention-related sampling.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Epilepsy is a neurological condition associated to significant brain damage produced by status epilepticus (SE) including neurodegeneration, gliosis and ectopic neurogenesis. Reduction of these processes constitutes a useful strategy to improve recovery and ameliorate negative outcomes after an initial insult. SGK1.1, the neuronal isoform of the serum and glucocorticoids-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), has been shown to increase M-current density in neurons, leading to reduced excitability and protection against seizures. We now show that SGK1.1 activation potently reduces levels of neuronal death and gliosis after SE induced by kainate, even in the context of high seizure activity. This neuroprotective effect is not exclusively a secondary effect of M-current activation but is also directly linked to decreased apoptosis levels through regulation of Bim and Bcl-xL cellular levels. Our results demonstrate that this newly described antiapoptotic role of SGK1.1 activation acts synergistically with the regulation of cellular excitability, resulting in a significant reduction of SE-induced brain damage. The protective role of SGK1.1 occurs without altering basal neurogenesis in brain areas relevant to epileptogenesis.</content>

 Cognitive pathways supporting human language and declarative memory are thought to have uniquely evolutionarily differentiated in our species. However, cross-species comparisons are missing on site-specific effective connectivity between regions important for cognition. We harnessed a new approach using functional imaging to visualize the impact of direct electrical brain stimulation in human neurosurgery patients. Applying the same approach with macaque monkeys, we found remarkably comparable patterns of effective connectivity between auditory cortex and ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and parahippocampal cortex in both species. Moreover, in humans electrical tractography revealed rapid evoked potentials in vlPFC from stimulating auditory cortex and speech sounds drove vlPFC, consistent with prior evidence in monkeys of direct projections from auditory cortex to vocalization responsive regions in vlPFC. The results identify a common effective connectivity signature that from auditory cortex is equally direct to vlPFC and indirect to the hippocampus (via parahippocampal cortex) in human and nonhuman primates.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Anatomical and physiological analyses have long revealed differences between proprioceptive groups Ia, II, and Ib sensory neurons, yet the molecular correlates of these three muscle afferent subtypes remain unknown. We performed single cell RNA sequencing of genetically identified adult proprioceptors and, using unbiased bioinformatics approaches, detected five molecularly distinct neuronal clusters. Validation of cluster-specific transcripts in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and skeletal muscle provides evidence these clusters correspond to functionally distinct muscle spindle (MS) or Golgi tendon organ (GTO) afferent proprioceptors. Remarkably, while we uncovered just one type of GTO afferents, four of the five clusters represent MS afferents, thus demonstrating a previously unappreciated diversity among these muscle proprioceptors. In vitro electrophysiological recordings reveal just two broadly distinct proprioceptor types, and suggest that the refinement of functional subtype diversity may occur along multiple axes of maturation. Lineage analysis between proprioceptor transcriptomes at different developmental stages show little or no correlation for transcripts that define adult MS or GTO afferents, supporting the idea that proprioceptor subtype identity emerges late in development. Together, our data provide the first comprehensive molecular signature for groups Ia and II MS afferents and group Ib GTO afferents, and offer new strategies for genetic interrogation of the role of these individual proprioceptor subtypes in regulating voluntary motor behavior.</content>

 Primates have evolved the ability transmit important social information through facial expression. In humans and macaque monkeys, socially relevant face processing is accomplished via a distributed cortical and subcortical functional network that includes specialized patches in anterior cingulate cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, regions usually associated with high-level cognition. It is unclear whether a similar network exists in New World primates, who diverged ~35 million years from Old World primates and have a less elaborated frontal cortex. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate that is ideally placed to address this question given the complex social repertoire inherent to this species (e.g., observational social learning; imitation; cooperative antiphonal calling). Here, we investigated the existence of a putative high-level face processing network in marmosets by employing ultra-high field (9.4 Tesla) task-based functional MRI (fMRI). We demonstrated that, like Old World primates, marmosets show differential activation in anterior cingulate cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex while they view socially relevant videos of marmoset faces. We corroborate the locations of these frontal regions by demonstrating both functional (via resting-state fMRI) and structural (via cellular-level tracing) connectivity between these regions and temporal lobe face patches. Given the evolutionary separation between macaques and marmosets, our results suggest this frontal network specialized for social face processing predates the separation between Platyrrhini and Catarrhine. These results give further credence to the marmoset as a viable preclinical modelling species for studying human social disorders.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Judging the speed of objects moving in three dimensions is important in our everyday lives, because we interact with objects in a three-dimensional world. However, speed perception has been seldom studied for motion in depth, particularly when using monocular cues such as looming. Here, we compared speed discrimination, and speed change discrimination, for looming stimuli, to better understand what visual information is used for these tasks. For the speed discrimination task, we manipulated the distance and duration information available, to investigate if participants were specifically using speed information. For speed change discrimination, total distance and duration were held constant, hence they could not be used to successfully perform that task. We found speed change discrimination thresholds were consistently higher than those for speed discrimination. Evidence suggested that participants used a variety of cues to complete the speed discrimination task, not always solely relying on speed. Further, our data suggested that participants may switch between cues on a trial to trial basis. We conclude that speed change discrimination for looming is more difficult than speed discrimination, and that naive participants may not always exclusively use speed for speed discrimination.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a cephalochordate studied by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d97221d2-4ead-4c12-8d15-9518f21cd8c4/cne24913-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalochordates (amphioxus or lancelets) are basal in the phylum Chiordata and can exemplify the relatively simple developmental and anatomical starting conditions likely to have evolved into more complex vertebrate features. Here we use serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a lancelet. The nerves (glial cell/neurite complexes) branch within the dermis and then exit to the epidermis to associate with the perikarya of two kinds of ciliated sensory neurons. The results indicate that cephalochordate neuroglia have an intramedullary origin. Moreover, we suggest that the peripheral nerves in the dermis are, at least in part, comparable to Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates, whereas, in contrast, the placode‐ and neural crest‐derived peripheral neurons of vertebrates are evolutionary novelties that appear to have supplanted the epidermal sensory receptors of cephalochordates.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the sensory peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the tail of a cephalochordate, &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron lucayanum&lt;/i&gt;. The reconstructed region extends from the tail tip to the origin of the most posterior peripheral nerves from the dorsal nerve cord. As peripheral nerves ramify within the dermis, all the nuclei along their course belong to glial cells. Invaginations in the glial cell cytoplasm house the neurites, an association reminiscent of the non‐myelinated Schwann cells of vertebrates. Peripheral nerves pass from the dermis to the epidermis via small fenestrae in the sub‐epidermal collagen fibril layer; most nerves exit abruptly, but a few run obliquely within the collagen fibril layer for many micrometers before exiting. Within the epidermis, each nerve begins ramifying repeatedly, but the branches are too small to be followed to their tips with SBSEM at low magnification (previous studies on other cephalochordates indicate that the branches end freely or in association with epidermal sensory cells). In &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron&lt;/i&gt;, two morphological kinds of sensory cells are scattered in the epidermis, usually singly, but sometimes in pairs, evidently the recent progeny of a single precursor cell. The discussion considers the evolution of the sensory PNS in the phylum Chordata. In cephalochordates, Retzius bipolar neurons with intramedullary perikarya likely correspond to the Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates. However, extramedullary neurons originating from ventral epidermis in cephalochordates (and presumably in ancestral chordates) contrast with vertebrate sensory neurons, which arise from placodes and neural crest.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The Effects of Fluoxetine on Oligodendrocytes in the Hippocampus of CUS‐induced Depressed Model Rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/88e2e0d2-9f28-4b1b-ae2b-2b6896437294/cne24914-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;

3 weeks of fluoxetine injection at dose of 5 mg / (kg • d) significantly improved the depressive‐like behavior in depressed model rats.
The oligodendrocytes of the CA1, CA3 and DG fields of hippocampus were significantly decreased after 7 weeks of CUS stimulations.
3 weeks of fluoxetine injection reversed the CUS‐induced decrease of the oligodendrocytes in the CA1 and CA3 fields of hippocampus.




&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental illness which is harmful seriously to the society. This study investigated the effects of fluoxetine on the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes in hippocampus of the depressed rats to explore the new target structure of antidepressants. Male Sprague ‐ Dawley rats were used to build chronic unpredictable stress(CUS) depressed model of rats. Then, the depressed rats were divided into the CUS standard group and the CUS + fluoxetine (CUS/FLX) group. The CUS/FLX group was treated with fluoxetine at dose of 5 mg / (kg·d) from the fifth week to seventh week. After 7 weeks CUS intervention, the sucrose preference of the CUS standard group was significantly lower than that of the control group and the CUS/FLX group. The stereological results showed that the total number of the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CA1, CA3 and DG subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group were significantly decreased, when compared with the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the control group. However, the total number of the CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CA1 and CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group was significantly decreased when it compared with CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the CUS/FLX group. Therefore, fluoxetine might prevent the loss of CNPase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes in CA1 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus of the depressed rats. The oligodendrocytes in hippocampus may play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. The current result might provide structural basis for the future studies that search for new antidepressant strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

 Synucleinopathies are neurological disorders associated with -synuclein overexpression and aggregation. While it is well established that overexpression of wild type -synuclein (-syn-140) leads to cellular toxicity and neurodegeneration, much less is known about other naturally occurring -synuclein splice isoforms. In this study we provide the first detailed examination of the synaptic effects caused by one of these splice isoforms, -synuclein-112 (-syn-112). -Syn-112 is produced by an in-frame excision of exon 5, resulting in deletion of amino acids 103-130 in the C-terminal region. -Syn-112 is upregulated in the substantia nigra, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of parkinsonian brains and is correlated with susceptibility to sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple systems atrophy (MSA). We report here that -syn-112 binds strongly to anionic phospholipids when presented in highly-curved liposomes, similar to -syn-140. However, -syn-112 bound significantly stronger to all phospholipids tested, including the phosphoinositides. -Syn-112 also dimerized and trimerized on isolated synaptic membranes, while -syn-140 remained largely monomeric. When introduced acutely to lamprey synapses, -syn-112 robustly inhibited synaptic vesicle recycling. Interestingly, -syn-112 produced effects on the plasma membrane and clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis that were phenotypically intermediate between those caused by monomeric and dimeric -syn-140. These findings indicate that -syn-112 exhibits enhanced phospholipid binding and oligomerization in vitro and consequently interferes with synaptic vesicle recycling in vivo in ways that are consistent with its biochemical properties. This study provides additional evidence suggesting that impaired vesicle endocytosis is a cellular target of excess -synuclein and advances our understanding of potential mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis in the synucleinopathies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Understanding force generation in nonequilibrium systems is a notable challenge in statistical physics. We uncover a fluctuation-induced force between two plates immersed in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The force is a nonmonotonic function of plate separation. The mechanism of force generation reveals an intriguing analogy with fluctuation-induced forces: In a fluid, energy and vorticity are localized in regions of defined length scales. When varying the distance between the plates, we exclude energy structures modifying the overall pressure on the plates. At intermediate plate distances, the intense vorticity structures (worms) are forced to interact in close vicinity between the plates. This interaction affects the pressure in the slit and the force between the plates. The combination of these two effects causes a nonmonotonic attractive force with a complex Reynolds number dependence. Our study sheds light on how length scale–dependent distributions of energy and high-intensity vortex structures determine Casimir forces.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Numerous plants and animals harbor selfish B chromosomes that &quot;drive&quot; or transmit themselves at super-Mendelian frequencies, despite long-term fitness costs to the organism. Currently, it is unknown how B chromosome drive is mediated, and whether B-gene expression plays a role. We used modern sequencing technologies to analyze the fine-scale sequence composition and expression of paternal sex ratio (PSR), a B chromosome in the jewel wasp &lt;i&gt;Nasonia vitripennis&lt;/i&gt;. PSR causes female-to-male conversion by destroying the sperm’s hereditary material in young embryos to drive. Using RNA interference, we demonstrate that testis-specific expression of a PSR-linked gene, named &lt;i&gt;haploidizer&lt;/i&gt;, facilitates this genome elimination–and–sex conversion effect. &lt;i&gt;haploidizer&lt;/i&gt; encodes a putative protein with a DNA binding domain, suggesting a functional link with the sperm-derived chromatin.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Liquid emulsion droplet evaporation is of importance for various sensing and imaging applications. The liquid-to-gas phase transformation is typically triggered thermally or acoustically by low–boiling point liquids, or by inclusion of solid structures that pin the vapor/liquid contact line to facilitate heterogeneous nucleation. However, these approaches lack precise tunability in vaporization behavior. Here, we describe a previously unused approach to control vaporization behavior through an endoskeleton that can melt and blend into the liquid core to either enhance or disrupt cohesive intermolecular forces. This effect is demonstrated using perfluoropentane (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) droplets encapsulating a fluorocarbon (FC) or hydrocarbon (HC) endoskeleton. FC skeletons inhibit vaporization, whereas HC skeletons trigger vaporization near the rotator melting transition. Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal interfacial mixing for initiating droplet vaporization. Tuning molecular interactions between the endoskeleton and droplet phase is generalizable for achieving emulsion or other secondary phase transitions, in emulsions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Observations indicate a strong correlation between the occurrence of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. While increased volcanic activity has been observed following both local and distal earthquakes, some of the largest recorded earthquakes aren’t known to have triggered an eruption. Here we investigate whether an eruption and associated dike intrusion at Ambrym volcano was triggered by an &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; 6.4 earthquake which occurred 30 hours earlier. Modeling suggests that stress changes induced by the earthquake were too small to account for the overpressure in the dike without additional bubble growth to pressurize the magma chamber. We find that the magma must be both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-saturated and at lower temperatures than those expected for newly intruded basalts. Too hot and the stress drop required to grow the bubbles is too large, too cold and the magma can no longer flow. These observations suggest that partially cooled and crystallized basaltic magmas are more susceptible to triggering from earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Patterned cell divisions require a precisely oriented spindle that segregates chromosomes and determines the cytokinetic plane. In this study, we investigated how the meiotic spindle orients through an obligatory rotation during meiotic division in mouse oocytes. We show that spindle rotation occurs at the completion of chromosome segregation, whereby the separated chromosome clusters each define a cortical actomyosin domain that produces cytoplasmic streaming, resulting in hydrodynamic forces on the spindle. These forces are initially balanced but become unbalanced to drive spindle rotation. This force imbalance is associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the distribution of the Arp2/3 complex and myosin-II on the cortex, brought about by feedback loops comprising Ran guanosine triphosphatase signaling, Arp2/3 complex activity, and myosin-II contractility. The torque produced by the unbalanced hydrodynamic forces, coupled with a pivot point at the spindle midzone cortical contract, constitutes a unique mechanical system for meiotic spindle rotation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The lubrication properties of nanoconfined liquids underpin countless natural and industrial processes. However, our current understanding of lubricated friction is still limited, especially for nonideal interfaces exhibiting nanoscale chemical and topographical defects. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to explore the equilibrium and dynamical behavior of a model lubricant, squalane, confined between a diamond tip and graphite in the vicinity of an atomic step. We combine high-resolution imaging of the interface with highly localized shear measurements at different velocities and temperatures to derive a quantitative picture of the lubricated friction around surface defects. We show that defects tend to promote local molecular order and increase friction forces by reducing the number of stable molecular configurations in their immediate vicinity. The effect is general, can propagate over hundreds of nanometers, and can be quantitatively described by a semiempirical model that bridges the molecular details and mesoscale observations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Oxygen activation is a critical step in ubiquitous heterogeneous oxidative processes, most prominently in catalysis, electrolysis, and pharmaceutical applications. We present here our findings on metal-free O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation on covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) as an important class of N-rich materials. The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation process was studied for the formation of aldehydes, ketones and imines. A detailed mechanistic study of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and the role of nitrogen heteroatoms were comprehensively investigated. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and control experiments provide strong evidence for the reaction mechanism proving the applicability of the CTFs to activate oxygen into superoxide species. This report highlights the importance of a self-templating procedure to introduce N functionalities for the development of metal-free catalytic materials. The presented findings reveal an important step toward the use of CTFs as inexpensive and high-performance alternatives to metal-based materials not only for catalysis but also for biorelated applications dealing with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We study the effect of rotational state–dependent alignment in the scattering of molecules by optical fields. CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules in their lowest few rotational states are adiabatically aligned and transversely accelerated by a nonresonant optical standing wave. The width of the measured transverse velocity distribution increases to 160 m/s with the field intensity, while its central peak position moves from 10 to –10 m/s. These changes are well reproduced by numerical simulations based on the rotational state–dependent alignment but cannot be modeled when ignoring these effects. Moreover, the molecular scattering by an off-resonant optical field amounts to manipulating the translational motion of molecules in a rotational state–specific way. Conversely, our results demonstrate that scattering from a nonresonant optical standing wave is a viable method for rotational state selection of nonpolar molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Blue natural pigments are rare, especially among plants. However, flowering species that evolved to attract Hymenoptera pollinators are colored by blue anthocyanin-metal complexes. Plants lacking anthocyanins are pigmented by betalains but are unable to produce blue hues. By extending the -system of betalains, we designed a photostable and metal-free blue dye named BeetBlue that did not show toxicity to human hepatic and retinal pigment epithelial cells and does not affect zebrafish embryonal development. This chiral dye can be conveniently synthesized from betalamic acid obtained from hydrolyzed red beetroot juice or by enzymatic oxidation of l-dopa. BeetBlue is blue in the solid form and in solution of acidified polar molecular solvents, including water. Its capacity to dye natural matrices makes BeetBlue the prototype of a new class of low-cost bioinspired chromophores suitable for a myriad of applications requiring a blue hue.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nanobubbles (NBs) are nanoscopic gaseous domains than can exist on solid surfaces or in bulk liquids. They have attracted substantial attention due to their long-time (meta)stability and a high potential for real-world applications. Using an approach not previously investigated, we exploit surface-electrostatic NB formation and stabilization via application of external electric fields in gas-liquid systems, with the marked result of massively increased gas uptake into the liquid in NB form. The de facto gas solubility enhancement (over many months) ranges from 2.5-fold for oxygen to 30-fold for methane vis-à-vis respective Henry’s law values for gas solubility; the more hydrophobic the gas, the more spectacular the increase. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the origin of NBs’ movement lies in dielectrophoresis, while substantial NB stabilization arises from a surface-polarization interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Personal moisture management fabrics that facilitate sweat transport away from the skin are highly desirable for wearer’s comfort and performance. Here, we demonstrate a &quot;skin-like&quot; directional liquid transport fabric, which enables continuous one-way liquid flow through spatially distributed channels acting like &quot;sweating glands&quot; yet repels external liquid contaminants. The water transmission rate can be 15 times greater than that of best commercial breathable fabrics. This exceptional property is achieved by creating gradient wettability channels across a predominantly superhydrophobic substrate. The flow directionality is explained by the Gibbs pinning criterion. The permeability, mechanical property, and abrasion resistance (up to 10,000 cycles) of the fabric were not affected by the treatment. In addition to functional clothing, this concept can be extended for developing materials for oil-water separation, wound dressing, geotechnical engineering, flexible microfluidics, and fuel cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Here, we describe a tripartite circular single-stranded (ss) DNA mycovirus, named Fusarium graminearum gemytripvirus 1 (FgGMTV1). The genome of FgGMTV1 comprises three circular ssDNA segments (DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C). Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that FgGMTV1 is nested within the family Genomoviridae. We also constructed the first infectious DNA clones of a DNA mycovirus. Our results show that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent for their replication and are associated with severely reduced colony growth and hypovirulence. DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B for replication and is necessary for the recovery of abnormal fungal phenotypes. DNA-C also enhances the accumulation of viral DNA in infected fungi and permits stable colonization and easy transmission via conidia. This is the first multipartite DNA virus isolated from a fungus. Our phylogenetic analyses also suggest that the multipartite genome of FgGMTV1 may have evolved from a monopartite genome of an ancient genomovirus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep-sea cold seeps are dynamic sources of methane release and unique habitats supporting ocean biodiversity and productivity. Here, we describe newly discovered animal-bacterial symbioses fueled by methane, between two species of annelid (a serpulid &lt;i&gt;Laminatubus&lt;/i&gt; and sabellid &lt;i&gt;Bispira&lt;/i&gt;) and distinct aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the Methylococcales, localized to the host respiratory crown. Worm tissue &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C of –44 to –58 are consistent with methane-fueled nutrition for both species, and shipboard stable isotope labeling experiments revealed active assimilation of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled methane into animal biomass, which occurs via the engulfment of methanotrophic bacteria across the crown epidermal surface. These worms represent a new addition to the few animals known to intimately associate with methane-oxidizing bacteria and may further explain their enigmatic mass occurrence at 150–million year–old fossil seeps. High-resolution seafloor surveys document significant coverage by these symbioses, beyond typical obligate seep fauna. These findings uncover novel consumers of methane in the deep sea and, by expanding the known spatial extent of methane seeps, may have important implications for deep-sea conservation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transient tunnels that assemble and disassemble to facilitate passage of unstable intermediates in enzymes containing multiple reaction centers are controlled by allosteric cues. Using the 140-kDa purine biosynthetic enzyme PurL as a model system and a combination of biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies, we show that long-distance communication between ~25-Å distal active sites is initiated by an allosteric switch, residing in a conserved catalytic loop, adjacent to the synthetase active site. Further, combinatory experiments seeded from molecular dynamics simulations help to delineate transient states that bring out the central role of nonfunctional adaptor domains. We show that carefully orchestrated conformational changes, facilitated by interplay of dynamic interactions at the allosteric switch and adaptor-domain interface, control reactivity and concomitant formation of the ammonia tunnel. This study asserts that substrate channeling is modulated by allosteric hotspots that alter protein energy landscape, thereby allowing the protein to adopt transient conformations paramount to function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Metal oxide semiconductor junctions are central to most electronic and optoelectronic devices, but ultrafast measurements of carrier transport have been limited to device-average measurements. Here, charge transport and recombination kinetics in each layer of a Ni-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Si junction is measured using the element specificity of broadband extreme ultraviolet (XUV) ultrafast pulses. After silicon photoexcitation, holes are inferred to transport from Si to Ni ballistically in ~100 fs, resulting in characteristic spectral shifts in the XUV edges. Meanwhile, the electrons remain on Si. After picoseconds, the transient hole population on Ni is observed to back-diffuse through the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, shifting the Ti spectrum to a higher oxidation state, followed by electron-hole recombination at the Si-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface and in the Si bulk. Electrical properties, such as the hole diffusion constant in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the initial hole mobility in Si, are fit from these transient spectra and match well with values reported previously.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Recent optical measurements of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers have revealed the presence of hybridized interlayer electron-hole pair excitations at energies defined by the superlattice potential. The corresponding quasiparticle band structures, so-called minibands, have remained elusive, and no such features have been reported for heterobilayers composed of a TMD and another type of 2D material. We introduce a new x-ray capillary technology for performing microfocused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of ~1 μm, and directly observe minibands at certain twist angles in mini Brillouin zones (mBZs). We discuss their origin in terms of initial and final state effects by analyzing their dispersion in distinct mBZs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The high-lying vibrational states of the magnesium dimer (Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which has been recognized as an important system in studies of ultracold and collisional phenomena, have eluded experimental characterization for half a century. Until now, only the first 14 vibrational states of Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been experimentally resolved, although it has been suggested that the ground-state potential may support five additional levels. Here, we present highly accurate ab initio potential energy curves based on state-of-the-art coupled-cluster and full configuration interaction computations for the ground and excited electronic states involved in the experimental investigations of Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our ground-state potential unambiguously confirms the existence of 19 vibrational levels, with ~1 cm&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; root mean square deviation between the calculated rovibrational term values and the available experimental and experimentally derived data. Our computations reproduce the latest laser-induced fluorescence spectrum and provide guidance for the experimental detection of the previously unresolved vibrational levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;Fake news,&quot; broadly defined as false or misleading information masquerading as legitimate news, is frequently asserted to be pervasive online with serious consequences for democracy. Using a unique multimode dataset that comprises a nationally representative sample of mobile, desktop, and television consumption, we refute this conventional wisdom on three levels. First, news consumption of any sort is heavily outweighed by other forms of media consumption, comprising at most 14.2% of Americans’ daily media diets. Second, to the extent that Americans do consume news, it is overwhelmingly from television, which accounts for roughly five times as much as news consumption as online. Third, fake news comprises only 0.15% of Americans’ daily media diet. Our results suggest that the origins of public misinformedness and polarization are more likely to lie in the content of ordinary news or the avoidance of news altogether as they are in overt fakery.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations in β-cardiac myosin and myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) lead to hypercontractility of the heart, an early hallmark of HCM. We show that hypercontractility caused by the HCM-causing mutation R663H cannot be explained by changes in fundamental myosin contractile parameters, much like the HCM-causing mutation R403Q. Using enzymatic assays with purified human β-cardiac myosin, we provide evidence that both mutations cause hypercontractility by increasing the number of functionally accessible myosin heads. We also demonstrate that the myosin mutation R403Q, but not R663H, ablates the binding of myosin with the C0-C7 fragment of MyBP-C. Furthermore, addition of C0-C7 decreases the wild-type myosin basal ATPase single turnover rate, while the mutants do not show a similar reduction. These data suggest that a primary mechanism of action for these mutations is to increase the number of myosin heads functionally available for interaction with actin, which could contribute to hypercontractility.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Many bacteria contain plasmids, but separating between contigs that originate on the plasmid and those that are part of the bacterial genome can be difficult. This is especially true in metagenomic assembly, which yields many contigs of unknown origin. Existing tools for classifying sequences of plasmid origin give less reliable results for shorter sequences, are trained using a fraction of the known plasmids, and can be difficult to use in practice. We present PlasClass, a new plasmid classifier. It uses a set of standard classifiers trained on the most current set of known plasmid sequences for different sequence lengths. We tested PlasClass sequence classification on held-out data and simulations, as well as publicly available bacterial isolates and plasmidome samples and plasmids assembled from metagenomic samples. PlasClass outperforms the state-of-the-art plasmid classification tool on shorter sequences, which constitute the majority of assembly contigs, allowing it to achieve higher F1 scores in classifying sequences from a wide range of datasets. PlasClass also uses significantly less time and memory. PlasClass can be used to easily classify plasmid and bacterial genome sequences in metagenomic or isolate assemblies.

Have you ever sought to use metagenomic DNA sequences reported in scientific publications? Were you successful? Here, we reveal that metagenomes from no fewer than 20% of the papers found in our literature search, published between 2016 and 2019, were not deposited in a repository or were simply inaccessible. The proportion of inaccessible data within the literature has been increasing year-on-year. Noncompliance with Open Data is best predicted by the scientific discipline of the journal. The number of citations, journal type (e.g., Open Access or subscription journals), and publisher are not good predictors of data accessibility. However, many publications in high–impact factor journals do display a higher likelihood of accessible metagenomic data sets. Twenty-first century science demands compliance with the ethical standard of data sharing of metagenomes and DNA sequence data more broadly. Data accessibility must become one of the routine and mandatory components of manuscript submissions—a requirement that should be applicable across the increasing number of disciplines using metagenomics. Compliance must be ensured and reinforced by funders, publishers, editors, reviewers, and, ultimately, the authors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J64iz9TnOSQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Histological atlases of the cerebral cortex, such as those made famous by Brodmann and von Economo, are invaluable for understanding human brain microstructure and its relationship with functional organization in the brain. However, these existing atlases are limited to small numbers of manually annotated samples from a single cerebral hemisphere, measured from 2D histological sections. We present the first whole-brain quantitative 3D laminar atlas of the human cerebral cortex. It was derived from a 3D histological atlas of the human brain at 20-micrometer isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many of the historical challenges with measurement of histological thickness in 2D, and the resultant laminar atlas provides an unprecedented level of precision and detail. We utilized this BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of cortical thickness and which cortical layers were contributing to these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V, and VI. In contrast, motor-frontal cortices showed the opposite pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness from motor to frontal association cortices. These findings illustrate how this laminar atlas will provide a link between single-neuron morphology, mesoscale cortical layering, macroscopic cortical thickness, and, ultimately, functional neuroanatomy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HwoRD4mJykw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Putting a name to a face is a highly common activity in our daily life that greatly enriches social interactions. Although this specific person–identity association becomes automatic with learning, it remains difficult and can easily be disrupted in normal circumstances or neurological conditions. To shed light on the neural basis of this important and yet poorly understood association between different input modalities in the human brain, we designed a crossmodal frequency-tagging paradigm coupled to brain activity recording via scalp and intracerebral electroencephalography. In Experiment 1, 12 participants were presented with variable pictures of faces and written names of a single famous identity at a 4-Hz frequency rate while performing an orthogonal task. Every 7 items, another famous identity appeared, either as a face or a name. Robust electrophysiological responses were found exactly at the frequency of identity change (i.e., 4 Hz / 7 = 0.571 Hz), suggesting a crossmodal neural response to person identity. In Experiment 2 with twenty participants, two control conditions with periodic changes of identity for faces or names only were added to estimate the contribution of unimodal neural activity to the putative crossmodal face-name responses. About 30% of the response occurring at the frequency of crossmodal identity change over the left occipito-temporal cortex could not be accounted for by the linear sum of unimodal responses. Finally, intracerebral recordings in the left ventral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in 7 epileptic patients tested with this paradigm revealed a small number of “pure” crossmodal responses, i.e., with no response to changes of identity for faces or names only. Altogether, these observations provide evidence for integration of verbal and nonverbal person identity-specific information in the human brain, highlighting the contribution of the left ventral ATL in the automatic retrieval of face-name identity associations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cTYTWtgKEDA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Human brain neurons express a novel splice variant of excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (hEAAT5v)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a2e4ce74-c563-48c4-88dd-00a739722fb5/cne24907-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately spliced human EAAT5 (hEAAT5v) which contains an additional intron after exon 7 of normally spliced human EAAT5 (7‐int) was cloned from human brain. Immunocytochemistry reveals expression of this protein in apical (A) and basal (B) dendrites and axons (Ax) of human cortical pyramidal neurons. The protein is also expressed by GABAergic neurons including Purkinje cells. It plausibly functions as a glutamate‐gated chloride conductance rather than as a glutamate transporter.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (EAAT5) is a protein that is known to be alternately spliced and to be abundantly expressed in the retina by populations of neurons including photoreceptors and bipolar cells. EAAT5 acts as a slow glutamate transporter and also as glutamate‐gated chloride channel, the chloride conductance being large enough for EAAT5 to serve functionally as an “inhibitory” glutamate receptor. However, there has been a long‐standing view that the classically spliced form of EAAT5 is not abundant or widespread in the brain and so it has not been extensively investigated in the literature. We recently identified a human‐specific splicing form of EAAT5 that was not expressed by rodents but was shown to be a functional glutamate transporter. We have examined the expression of this form of EAAT5, hEAAT5v at the mRNA, and protein level in human brain, and show that populations of human cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells show significant expression of hEAAT5v. Accordingly, we infer that EAAT5 may well be a player in modulating neuronal function in the human brain and propose that its localization in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons could be compatible with a role in influencing intracellular chloride and thereby neuronal parameters such as membrane potential rather than acting as a presynaptic glutamate transporter.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 10 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, β1, β2, β3, γ2, and δ) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits α1, α5, β2, β3, and γ2 were found in all layers, α2, α3, and β1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in α1, α2, α5, all three β‐subunits, γ2, and δ. Subunits α3 and α5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, α1, α2, β1, β2, γ2, and δ were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits α1, α2, α4, β2, β3, and γ2, whereas α1, α3, β1, and γ2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, γ2, and δ were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, and δ, and in the central amygdala α1, α2, β3, and γ2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit α3‐IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits α1, α2, α5, β2, β3, γ2, and δ were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas α1, α2, α3, α5, β1, β2, β3, and γ2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum. The distribution of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To make full use of optogenetic and molecular techniques in the study of motor control, rich behavioral paradigms for rodents must rise to the same level of sophistication and applicability. We describe the layout, construction, use and analysis of data from joystick-based reaching in a head-fixed mouse. The step-by-step guide is designed for both experienced rodent motor labs and new groups looking to enter into this research space. Using this platform, mice learn to consistently perform large, easily-quantified reaches, including during a two-armed bandit probabilistic learning task. The metrics of performance (reach trajectory, amplitude, speed, duration, and inter-reach interval) can be used to quantify behavior or administer stimulation in closed loop with behavior. We provide a highly customizable, low cost and reproducible open-source behavior training platform for studying motor control, decision-making, and reaching reaction time. The development of this software and hardware platform enables behavioral work to complement recent advances in rodents, while remaining accessible to smaller institutions and labs, thus providing a high-throughput method to study unexplored features of action selection, motivation, and value-based decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) after successful revascularization (SR) via endovascular therapy (EVT) is a known predictor of poor outcome. However, the optimal SBP goal following EVT is still unknown. Our objective was to compare functional and safety outcomes between different SBP goals after EVT with SR.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This international multicenter study included 8 comprehensive stroke centers and patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who were treated with EVT and achieved SR. SR was defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b to 3. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on SBP goal in the first 24 hours after EVT. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity analysis was used to assess the effect of different SBP goals on clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,019 patients were included. On IPTW analysis, the SBP goal of &amp;lt;140mmHg was associated with a higher likelihood of good functional outcome and lower odds of hemicraniectomy compared to SBP goal of &amp;lt;180mmHg. Similarly, SBP goal of &amp;lt;160mmHg was associated with lower odds of mortality compared to SBP goal of &amp;lt;180mmHg. In subgroup analysis including only patients with pre‐EVT SBP of ≥140mmHg, an SBP of &amp;lt;140mmHg was associated with a higher likelihood of good functional outcome, lower odds of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and lower odds of requirement for hemicraniectomy compared to SBP goal of &amp;lt;180mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SBP goals of &amp;lt;140 and &amp;lt; 160mmHg following SR with EVT appear to be associated with better clinical outcomes than SBP of &amp;lt;180mmHg. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge.org encourages community approaches to
developing new solutions for analyzing graphs and sparse data. Sparse AI
analytics present unique scalability difficulties. The Sparse Deep Neural
Network (DNN) Challenge draws upon prior challenges from machine learning, high
performance computing, and visual analytics to create a challenge that is
reflective of emerging sparse AI systems. The sparse DNN challenge is based on
a mathematically well-defined DNN inference computation and can be implemented
in any programming environment. In 2019 several sparse DNN challenge
submissions were received from a wide range of authors and organizations. This
paper presents a performance analysis of the best performers of these
submissions. These submissions show that their state-of-the-art sparse DNN
execution time, $T_{\rm DNN}$, is a strong function of the number of DNN
operations performed, $N_{\rm op}$. The sparse DNN challenge provides a clear
picture of current sparse DNN systems and underscores the need for new
innovations to achieve high performance on very large sparse DNNs.

 &lt;p&gt;Sequential neuronal activity underlies a wide range of processes in the
brain. Neuroscientific evidence for neuronal sequences has been reported in
domains as diverse as perception, motor control, speech, spatial navigation and
memory. Consequently, different dynamical principles have been proposed as
possible sequence-generating mechanisms. Combining experimental findings with
computational concepts like the Bayesian brain hypothesis and predictive coding
leads to the interesting possibility that predictive and inferential processes
in the brain are grounded on generative processes which maintain a sequential
structure. While probabilistic inference about ongoing sequences is a useful
computational model for both the analysis of neuroscientific data and a wide
range of problems in artificial recognition and motor control, research on the
subject is relatively scarce and distributed over different fields in the
neurosciences. Here we review key findings about neuronal sequences and relate
these to the concept of online inference on sequences as a model of
sensory-motor processing and recognition. We propose that describing sequential
neuronal activity as an expression of probabilistic inference over sequences
may lead to novel perspectives on brain function. Importantly, it is promising
to translate the key idea of probabilistic inference on sequences to machine
learning, in order to address challenges in the real-time recognition of speech
and human motion.

 &lt;p&gt;In this paper, we consider a class of sparse regression problems, whose
objective function is the summation of a convex loss function and a cardinality
penalty. By constructing a smoothing function for the cardinality function, we
propose a projected neural network and design a correction method for solving
this problem. The solution of the proposed neural network is unique, global
existent, bounded and globally Lipschitz continuous. Besides, we prove that all
accumulation points of the proposed neural network have a common support set
and a unified lower bound for the nonzero entries. Combining the proposed
neural network with the correction method, any corrected accumulation point is
a local minimizer of the considered sparse regression problem. Moreover, we
analyze the equivalent relationship on the local minimizers between the
considered sparse regression problem and another sparse problem. Finally, some
numerical experiments are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed
neural networks in solving some sparse regression problems in practice.

 &lt;p&gt;Non-volatile memory arrays can deploy pre-trained neural network models for
edge inference. However, these systems are affected by device-level noise and

mitigation strategy, and demonstrate its use in fabricated array of SONOS

 &lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework for a deep neural network
(DNN), which in a mathematically rigorous manner, allows us to incorporate
history (or memory) into the network -- it ensures all layers are connected to
one another. This DNN, called Fractional-DNN, can be viewed as a
time-discretization of a fractional in time nonlinear ordinary differential
equation (ODE). The learning problem then is a minimization problem subject to
that fractional ODE as constraints. We emphasize that an analogy between the
existing DNN and ODEs, with standard time derivative, is well-known by now. The
focus of our work is the Fractional-DNN. Using the Lagrangian approach, we
provide a derivation of the backward propagation and the design equations. We
test our network on several datasets for classification problems.
Fractional-DNN offers various advantages over the existing DNN. The key
benefits are a significant improvement to the vanishing gradient issue due to
the memory effect, and better handling of nonsmooth data due to the network's
ability to approximate non-smooth functions.

 &lt;p&gt;Inattentional blindness is the psychological phenomenon that causes one to
miss things in plain sight. It is a consequence of the selective attention in
perception that lets us remain focused on important parts of our world without
distraction from irrelevant details. Motivated by selective attention, we study
the properties of artificial agents that perceive the world through the lens of
a self-attention bottleneck. By constraining access to only a small fraction of
the visual input, we show that their policies are directly interpretable in
pixel space. We find neuroevolution ideal for training self-attention
architectures for vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, allowing us
to incorporate modules that can include discrete, non-differentiable operations
which are useful for our agent. We argue that self-attention has similar
properties as indirect encoding, in the sense that large implicit weight
matrices are generated from a small number of key-query parameters, thus
enabling our agent to solve challenging vision based tasks with at least 1000x
fewer parameters than existing methods. Since our agent attends to only task
critical visual hints, they are able to generalize to environments where task
irrelevant elements are modified while conventional methods fail. Videos of our

 &lt;p&gt;Automatic classification of epileptic seizure types in electroencephalograms
(EEGs) data can enable more precise diagnosis and efficient management of the
disease. This task is challenging due to factors such as low signal-to-noise
ratios, signal artefacts, high variance in seizure semiology among epileptic
patients, and limited availability of clinical data. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we present SeizureNet, a deep learning framework
which learns multi-spectral feature embeddings using an ensemble architecture
for accurate cross-patient seizure type classification. Experiments on the
recently released TUH EEG Seizure Corpus show that SeizureNet produces
state-of-the-art weighted F1 scores of 0.98 for seizure type classification
setting new benchmarks on the dataset. We also show that the high-level feature
embeddings learnt by SeizureNet considerably improve the classification
accuracy of smaller networks through knowledge distillation for applications
with low-memory and fast inference speed requirements.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;A large body of compelling evidence has been accumulated demonstrating that
embodiment - the agent's physical setup, including its shape, materials,
sensors and actuators - is constitutive for any form of cognition and as a
consequence, models of cognition need to be embodied. In contrast to methods
from empirical sciences to study cognition, robots can be freely manipulated
and virtually all key variables of their embodiment and control programs can be
systematically varied. As such, they provide an extremely powerful tool of
investigation. We present a robotic bottom-up or developmental approach,
focusing on three stages: (a) low-level behaviors like walking and reflexes,
(b) learning regularities in sensorimotor spaces, and (c) human-like cognition.
We also show that robotic based research is not only a productive path to
deepening our understanding of cognition, but that robots can strongly benefit
from human-like cognition in order to become more autonomous, robust,
resilient, and safe.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05344"/>

		<updated>2020-04-03T01:30:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We establish a general linear response relation for spiking neuronal
networks, based on chains with unbounded memory. This relation allows us to
predict the influence of a weak amplitude time-dependent external stimuli on
spatio-temporal spike correlations, from the spontaneous statistics (without
stimulus) in a general context where the memory in spike dynamics can extend
arbitrarily far in the past. Using this approach, we show how linear response
is explicitly related to neuronal dynamics with an example, the gIF model,
introduced by M. Rudolph and A. Destexhe. This example illustrates the
collective effect of the stimuli, intrinsic neuronal dynamics, and network
connectivity on spike statistics. We illustrate our results with numerical
simulations.

 &lt;p&gt;Nystatin is a pharmacological agent commonly used for the treatment of oral, mucosal and cutaneous fungal infections. Nystatin has also been extensively applied to study the cellular function of cholesterol-enriched structures because of its ability to bind and extract cholesterol from mammalian membranes. In neurons, cholesterol level is tightly regulated, being essential for synapse and dendrite formation, and axonal guidance. However, the action of Nystatin on axon regeneration has been poorly evaluated. Here, we examine the effect of Nystatin on primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, showing how acute dose (minutes) of Nystatin increases the area of growth cones, and chronic treatment (days) enhances axon length, axon branching, and axon regeneration post-axotomy. We describe two alternative signaling pathways responsible for the observed effects and activated at different concentrations of Nystatin. At elevated concentrations, Nystatin promotes growth cone expansion through phosphorylation of Akt; whereas, at low concentrations, Nystatin enhances axon length and regrowth by increasing nitric oxide levels. Together, our findings indicate new signaling pathways of Nystatin and propose this compound as a novel regulator of axon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cognitive deficits and positive symptoms in schizophrenia have both been linked to hippocampal dysfunction. Recently, subregion-specific aberrant and maladaptive hippocampal synaptic plasticity has been suggested as one of the mechanistic underpinnings. The subiculum is the final output hub of the hippocampus and orchestrates hippocampal information transfer to other brain regions. While most CA1 pyramidal neurons show regular-spiking behavior, subicular output neurons comprise bursting and regular-firing pyramidal cells. These two cell types target different brain regions and express unique forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we used a single systemic application of the noncompetitive glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 to model first-episode psychosis in rats and studied long-term potentiation (LTP) in subicular regular-firing cells in acute hippocampal slices. Previously, we have reported a facilitation of a presynaptic, late-onset LTP in subicular bursting pyramidal cells after systemic NMDAR antagonism. Here, we show that single systemic NMDAR antagonist application also facilitates the induction of a noncanonical, but postsynaptic NMDAR-independent LTP in ventral subicular but not in CA1 regular-firing pyramidal cells. This form of LTP was dependent on D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation. Activation of D1/D5 dopamine receptors by a specific agonist mimicked and occluded LTP induced by electrical high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Furthermore, our results indicate that this form of LTP relies on postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling and requires the activation of protein kinase A. Considering the pivotal role of the subiculum as information gatekeeper between the hippocampus and other brain regions, this aberrant LTP in ventral subicular regular-firing neurons is expected to interfere with physiological hippocampal output processing and might thereby contribute to hippocampal dysfunction in psychotic events.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) across thenuclear envelope (NE) is tightly regulated in eukaryotic cells and iscritical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its dysregulationleads to aging and neurodegeneration. Because they maintainaging-associated hallmarks, directly reprogrammed neurons from human fibroblasts are invaluable in understanding NCT. However, it is not clear whether NCT activity is influenced by neuronal maturation and sample sex [a key biological variable emphasized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy]. We examined here NCT activity at the single-cell level by measuring mRNA subcellular distribution and protein transport in directly induced motor neurons (diMNs) from adult human fibroblasts. The results show that mRNA subcellular distribution but not protein transport is affected by neuronal maturation stages, whereas both transport processes are not influenced by the sample sex. This study also provides quantitative methods and optimized conditions for measuring NCTs of mRNAs or protein cargoes, establishing a robust way for future functional examinations of NCT activity in directly induced neurons from diseased human patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Some individuals who suffer from obsessive–compulsive (OC) disorder (OCD), report disturbing sensory preoccupations. The inability to stop obsessing over stimuli resonates with a difficulty in sensory habituation. Impaired sensory habituation, to a degree that clearly dysregulates response to sensory stimuli, and impairs participation in everyday activities, can be part of a disorder known as sensory over-responsivity (SOR). Although previous studies indicated a correlation between OCD and SOR, physiological experiments show that individuals with OCD are not more sensitive to sensory stimuli than controls. In the current study, we (1) validated a sensory habituation psycho-physiological protocol and (2) tested whether a “slow to habituate” mechanism can explain the occurrence of elevated SOR and OC symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We designed a protocol to test auditory sensory habituation through electrodermal activity (EDA) recording. The protocol included two randomly ordered aversive and neutral sound conditions; each set of six everyday life sounds was presented as a continuous stimulus. During the presentation of sounds, EDA was measured and participants could press a button to shorten the stimuli. Participants also completed sensory and OC symptom questionnaires. Participants included 100 typically developing adults that were divided into high versus low OC symptom groups. Mixed models analysis was used throughout to meet the need for capturing the temporal nature of habituation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Distinct physiological indices were computed to measure sensitivity versus habituation. Habituation was slower in the aversive versus neutral condition. Sensitivity was higher for the aversive stimuli. Self-report of sensory habituation and sensitivity partially correlated with the physiological habituation indices. A comparison of the physiological pattern between those with high versus low OC symptoms revealed significant differences in the habituation and sensitivity indices, across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The interplay between SOR and OC symptoms can be explained by a “slow to habituate” mechanism. Identifying behavioral and physiological markers of sensory problems in OCD is important for assessment, intervention and the discovery of underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) express the photopigment melanopsin and project to central targets, allowing them to contribute to both image-forming and non-image forming vision. Recent studies have highlighted chemical and electrical synapses between ipRGCs and neurons of the inner retina, suggesting a potential influence from the melanopsin-born signal to affect visual processing at an early stage of the visual pathway. We investigated melanopsin responses in ganglion cell layer (GCL) neurons of both intact and dystrophic mouse retinas using 256 channel multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. A wide 200 μm inter-electrode spacing enabled a pan-retinal visualization of melanopsin’s influence upon GCL activity. Upon initial stimulation of dystrophic retinas with a long, bright light pulse, over 37% of units responded with an increase in firing (a far greater fraction than can be expected from the anatomically characterized number of ipRGCs). This relatively widespread response dissipated with repeated stimulation even at a quite long inter-stimulus interval (ISI; 120 s), to leave a smaller fraction of responsive units (&amp;lt;10%; more in tune with the predicted number of ipRGCs). Visually intact retinas appeared to lack such widespread melanopsin responses indicating that it is a feature of dystrophy. Taken together, our data reveal the potential for anomalously widespread melanopsin responses in advanced retinal degeneration. These could be used to probe the functional reorganization of retinal circuits in degeneration and should be taken into account when using retinally degenerate mice as a model of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the neural substrates and mechanisms that generate memory deficits, seizures and neuropsychiatric abnormalities in encephalitis with LGI1 antibodies using a data-driven, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Functional MRI data were acquired from 14 anti-LGI1 encephalitis patients and 14 age and gender matched normal controls. Independent component analysis with hierarchical partner matching (HPM-ICA) was used to assess the whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity. Granger causality (GC) was applied to investigate the effective connectivity among the brain regions that identified by HPM-ICA. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was utilized to investigate white matter microstructural changes of the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Participants with LGI1 antibodies encephalitis presented reduced functional connectivity in the brain areas associated with memory, cognition and motion circuits, while increased functional connectivity in putamen and caudate in comparison to the normal controls. Moreover, the effective connectivity in patients was decreased from the frontal cortex to supplementary motor area. Finally, patients had significant reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) for the corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus, accompanied by increases in mean diffusivity (MD) for these regions as compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the neural disorder and behavioral deficits of anti-LGI1 encephalitis may be associated with extensive changes in brain connectivity and microstructure. These pathological alterations affect the basal ganglia and limbic system besides the temporal and frontal lobe.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein, Striatum atrophy in HD leads to a progressive disturbance of psychiatric, motor, and cognitive function. Recent studies of HD patients revealed that the degeneration of cerebellum is also observed independently from the striatal atrophy during early HD stage and may contribute to the motor impairment and ataxia observed in HD. Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are responsible for the proper cerebellar pathways functioning and motor control. Recent studies on mouse models of HD have shown that the abnormality of the biochemical functions of PCs are observed in HD, suggesting the contribution of PC dysfunction and death to the impaired movement coordination observed in HD. To investigate ataxic symptoms in HD we performed a series of experiments with the yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of HD (YAC128). Using extracellular single-unit recording method we found that the portion of the cerebellar PCs with bursting and irregular patterns of spontaneous activity drastically rises in aged YAC128 HD mice when compared with wild type littermates. Previous studies demonstrated that SK channels are responsible for the cerebellar PC pacemaker activity and that positive modulation of SK channel activity exerted beneficial effects in different ataxic mouse models. Here we studied effects of the SK channels modulator chlorzoxazone (CHZ) on the motor behavior of YAC128 HD mice and also on the electrophysiological activity and neuroanatomy of the cerebellar PCs from these mice. We determined that the long-term intraperitoneal injections of CHZ alleviated the progressive impairment in the firing pattern of YAC128 PCs. We also demonstrated that treatment with CHZ rescued age-dependent motor incoordination and improved the cerebellar morphology in YAC128 mice. We propose that abnormal changes in the PC firing patterns might be a one of the possible causes of ataxic symptoms in HD and in other polyglutamine disorders and that the pharmacological activation of SK channels may serve as a potential way to improve the activity of cerebellar PCs and relieve the ataxic phenotype in HD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Our goal was to determine the influence of sex, age and the head/brain size on the compartmental brain volumes in the radiologically verified healthy population (96 subjects; 54 women and 42 men) from the Upper Silesia region in Poland. The MRI examinations were done using 3T Philips Achieva with the same T1-weighted and T2-weighted protocols. The image segmentation procedures were performed with SPM (Statistical Parameter Mapping) and FSL-FIRST software. The volumes of 14 subcortical structures for the left and right hemispheres and 4 overall volumes were calculated. The General Linear Models (GLM) analysis was used with and without the Total Brain Volume (TBV) and Intracranial Volume (ICV) parameters as the covariates to study the regional vs. global brain atrophy. After the ICV/TBV adjustments, the majority of sex differences in the specific volumes of interest (VOIs) revealed to be linked to the difference in the head/brain size parameters. The analysis also confirmed the significant effect of the aging process on the brain loss. After the TBV adjustment, the age- and sex-related volumetric trends for the gray and white matter volumes were observed: the negative age dependence of the gray matter volume is more pronounced in the males, while in case of the white matter the positive age-related trend in the female group is weaker. The local losses of the left caudate nucleus and the right thalamus are more advanced than the global brain atrophy. Different head-size correction strategies are not interchangeable and may yield various volumetric results, but when used together, facilitate studies on the regional dependencies inherent to a healthy, but aging, brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Computer simulation of the human brain at an individual neuron resolution is an ultimate goal of computational neuroscience. The Japanese flagship supercomputer, K, provides unprecedented computational capability toward this goal. The cerebellum contains 80% of the neurons in the whole brain. Therefore, computer simulation of the human-scale cerebellum will be a challenge for modern supercomputers. In this study, we built a human-scale spiking network model of the cerebellum, composed of 68 billion spiking neurons, on the K computer. As a benchmark, we performed a computer simulation of a cerebellum-dependent eye movement task known as the optokinetic response. We succeeded in reproducing plausible neuronal activity patterns that are observed experimentally in animals. The model was built on dedicated neural network simulation software called MONET (Millefeuille-like Organization NEural neTwork), which calculates layered sheet types of neural networks with parallelization by tile partitioning. To examine the scalability of the MONET simulator, we repeatedly performed simulations while changing the number of compute nodes from 1,024 to 82,944 and measured the computational time. We observed a good weak-scaling property for our cerebellar network model. Using all 82,944 nodes, we succeeded in simulating a human-scale cerebellum for the first time, although the simulation was 578 times slower than the wall clock time. These results suggest that the K computer is already capable of creating a simulation of a human-scale cerebellar model with the aid of the MONET simulator.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) often receive deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment, in which conductive leads are surgically implanted in the brain. While DBS treats tremor and rigidity, patients often continue to suffer from speech and swallowing impairments. There is preliminary evidence that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the cortex may be beneficial for these symptoms. However, the potential electromagnetic interactions of the strong magnetic fields from TMS on the conductive leads is unknown, and the combination therapy has not been approved for use. In this article, we report an experimental study of the safety of combining DBS and TMS. We fabricated an anatomically accurate head and brain phantom with electrical conductivities matching cerebrospinal fluid and averaged conductivity of gray and white matter. Induced current on an implanted DBS probe in the brain phantom was measured. Our results show that TMS will induce current values in the range or higher than typical DBS stimulation current. Thus, the combination of TMS/DBS treatment might cause over-stimulation in the brain when stimulated directly over the DBS lead with 100% TMS current intensity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: The adult brain’s potential for plastic reorganization is an important mechanism for the preservation and restoration of function in patients with primary glial neoplasm. Patients with recurrent brain tumors requiring multiple interventions over time present an opportunity to examine brain reorganization. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive imaging modality that can be used for motor cortical network mapping which, when performed at regular intervals, offers insight into this process of reorganization. Utilizing MEG-based motor mapping, we sought to characterize the reorganization of motor cortical networks over time in a cohort of 78 patients with recurrent glioma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: MEG-based motor cortical maps were obtained by measuring event-related desynchronization (ERD) in ß-band frequency during unilateral index finger flexion. Each patient presented at our Department at least on two occasions for tumor resection due to tumor recurrence, and MEG-based motor mapping was performed as part of preoperative assessment before each surgical resection. Whole-brain activation patterns from first to second MEG scan (obtained before first and second surgery) were compared. Additionally, we calculated distances of activation peaks, which represent the location of the primary motor cortex (MC), to determine the magnitude of movement in motor eloquent areas between the first and second MEG scan. We also explored which demographic, anatomic, and pathological factors influence these shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The whole-brain activation motor maps showed a subtle movement of the primary MC from first to second timepoint, as was confirmed by the determination of motor activation peaks. The shift of ipsilesional MC was directly correlated with a frontal-parietal tumor location (p &amp;lt; 0.001), presence of motor deficits (p = 0.021), and with a longer period between MEG scans (p = 0.048). Also, a disengagement of wide areas in the contralesional (ipsilateral to finger movement) hemisphere at the second time point was observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: MEG imaging is a sensitive method for depicting the plasticity of the motor cortical network. Although the location of the primary MC undergoes only subtle changes, appreciable shifts can occur in the setting of a stronger and longer impairment of the tumor on the MC. The ipsilateral hemisphere may serve as a reservoir for functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Cortical entrainment to speech correlates with speech intelligibility and attention to a speech stream in noisy environments. However, there is a lack of data on whether cortical entrainment can help in evaluating hearing aid fittings for subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss. One particular problem that may arise is that hearing aids may alter the speech stimulus during (pre-)processing steps, which might alter cortical entrainment to the speech. Here, the effect of hearing aid processing on cortical entrainment to running speech in hearing impaired subjects was investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Methodology&lt;p&gt;Seventeen native English-speaking subjects with mild-to-moderate hearing loss participated in the study. Hearing function and hearing aid fitting were evaluated using standard clinical procedures. Participants then listened to a 25-min audiobook under aided and unaided conditions at 70 dBA sound pressure level (SPL) in quiet conditions. EEG data were collected using a 32-channel system. Cortical entrainment to speech was evaluated using decoders reconstructing the speech envelope from the EEG data. Null decoders, obtained from EEG and the time-reversed speech envelope, were used to assess the chance level reconstructions. Entrainment in the delta- (1–4 Hz) and theta- (4–8 Hz) band, as well as wideband (1–20 Hz) EEG data was investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant cortical responses could be detected for all but one subject in all three frequency bands under both aided and unaided conditions. However, no significant differences could be found between the two conditions in the number of responses detected, nor in the strength of cortical entrainment. The results show that the relatively small change in speech input provided by the hearing aid was not sufficient to elicit a detectable change in cortical entrainment.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;For subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss, cortical entrainment to speech in quiet at an audible level is not affected by hearing aids. These results clear the pathway for exploring the potential to use cortical entrainment to running speech for evaluating hearing aid fitting at lower speech intensities (which could be inaudible when unaided), or using speech in noise conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing is the ability to capture, elaborate, and integrate information through the five senses and is impaired in over 90% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The ASD population shows hyper–hypo sensitiveness to sensory stimuli that can generate alteration in information processing, affecting cognitive and social responses to daily life situations. Structured and semi-structured interviews are generally used for ASD assessment, and the evaluation relies on the examiner’s subjectivity and expertise, which can lead to misleading outcomes. Recently, there has been a growing need for more objective, reliable, and valid diagnostic measures, such as biomarkers, to distinguish typical from atypical functioning and to reliably track the progression of the illness, helping to diagnose ASD. Implicit measures and ecological valid settings have been showing high accuracy on predicting outcomes and correctly classifying populations in categories.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Two experiments investigated whether sensory processing can discriminate between ASD and typical development (TD) populations using electrodermal activity (EDA) in two multimodal virtual environments (VE): forest VE and city VE. In the first experiment, 24 children with ASD diagnosis and 30 TDs participated in both virtual experiences, and changes in EDA have been recorded before and during the presentation of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli. In the second experiment, 40 children have been added to test the model of experiment 1.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The first exploratory results on EDA comparison models showed that the integration of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli in the forest environment provided higher accuracy (90.3%) on sensory dysfunction discrimination than specific stimuli. In the second experiment, 92 subjects experienced the forest VE, and results on 72 subjects showed that stimuli integration achieved an accuracy of 83.33%. The final confirmatory test set (n = 20) achieved 85% accuracy, simulating a real application of the models. Further relevant result concerns the visual stimuli condition in the first experiment, which achieved 84.6% of accuracy in recognizing ASD sensory dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;According to our studies’ results, implicit measures, such as EDA, and ecological valid settings can represent valid quantitative methods, along with traditional assessment measures, to classify ASD population, enhancing knowledge on the development of relevant specific treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) remains an unsolved problem. As a major component of the SCI lesion, the glial scar is primarily composed of scar-forming astrocytes and plays a crucial role in spinal cord regeneration. In recent years, it has become increasingly accepted that the glial scar plays a dual role in SCI recovery. However, the underlying mechanisms of this dual role are complex and need further clarification. This dual role also makes it difficult to manipulate the glial scar for therapeutic purposes. Here, we briefly discuss glial scar formation and some representative components associated with scar-forming astrocytes. Then, we analyze the dual role of the glial scar in a dynamic perspective with special attention to scar-forming astrocytes to explore the underlying mechanisms of this dual role. Finally, taking the dual role of the glial scar into account, we provide several pieces of advice on novel therapeutic strategies targeting the glial scar and scar-forming astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Post-stroke inflammation is almost involved in the whole process of stroke pathogenesis, which serves as a prime target for developing new stroke therapies. Despite known sex differences in the incidence and outcome of stroke, few preclinical or clinical studies take into account sex bias in treatment. Recent evidence suggests that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 inhibitor exerts sex-specific neuroprotection in the ischemic stroke. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of delayed PARP-1 inhibition on post-stroke inflammation and possible sexual dimorphism, and explore the possible relevant mediators. In male and female C57BL/6 mice subjected to transit middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we found that delayed treatment of PARP-1 inhibitor at 48 h following reperfusion could comparably alleviate neuro-inflammation at 72 h after stroke. Whereas, more remarkable reduction of iNOS and MMP9 induced by PARP-1 inhibition were found in male MCAO mice, and the improvement of behavioral outcomes was more prominent in male MCAO mice. In addition, we further identified that PARP-1 inhibitor might equivalently suppress microglial activation in males and females in vivo and in vitro. With proteomic analysis and western blotting assay, it was found that stroke-induced peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx1) expression was significantly affected by PARP-1 inhibition. Interestingly, injection of recombinant Prx1 into the ischemic core could block the anti-inflammatory effects of PARP-1 inhibitor in the experimental stroke. These findings suggest that PARP-1 inhibitor has effects on regulating microglial activation and post-stroke inflammation in males and females, and holds promise as a novel therapeutic agent for stroke with extended therapeutic time window. Efforts need to be made to delineate the actions of PARP-1 inhibition in stroke, and here we propose that Prx1 might be a critical mediator.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic stroke is a life-threatening neurological disease characterized by high mortality and morbidity. Various pathophysiological responses are initiated after blood enters the interstitial space of the brain, compressing the brain tissue and thus causing cell death. Recently, three new programmed cell deaths (PCDs), necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, were also found to be important contributors in the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke. Additionally, blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke. The primary insult following BBB dysfunction may disrupt the tight junctions (TJs), transporters, transcytosis, and leukocyte adhesion molecule expression, which may lead to brain edema, ionic homeostasis disruption, altered signaling, and immune infiltration, consequently causing neuronal cell death. This review article summarizes recent advances in our knowledge of the mechanisms regarding these new PCDs and reviews their contributions in hemorrhagic stroke and potential crosstalk in BBB dysfunction. Numerous studies revealed that necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis participate in cell death after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Endothelial dysfunction caused by these three PCDs may be the critical factor during BBB damage. Also, several signaling pathways were involved in PCDs and BBB dysfunction. These new PCDs (necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis), as well as BBB dysfunction, each play a critical role after hemorrhagic stroke. A better understanding of the interrelationship among them might provide us with better therapeutic targets for the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disease characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. There are approximately 7–10 million PD patients worldwide. Currently, there are no biomarkers available or pharmaceuticals that can halt the dopaminergic neuron degeneration. At the time of diagnosis about 60% of the midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons have already degenerated, resulting in a depletion of roughly 70% of striatal dopamine (DA) levels and synapses. Symptomatic treatment (e.g., with L-dopa) can initially restore DA levels and motor function, but with time often lead to side-effects like dyskinesia. Deep-brain-stimulation can alleviate these side-effects and some of the motor symptoms but requires repeat procedures and adds limitations for the patients. Restoration of dopaminergic synapses using neuronal cell replacement therapy has shown benefit in clinical studies using cells from fetal ventral midbrain. This approach, if done correctly, increases DA levels and restores synapses, allowing biofeedback regulation between the grafted cells and the host brain. Drawbacks are that it is not scalable for a large patient population and the patients require immunosuppression. Stem cells differentiated in vitro to mDA neurons or progenitors have shown promise in animal studies and is a scalable approach that allows for cryopreservation of transplantable cells and rigorous quality control prior to transplantation. However, all allogeneic grafts require immunosuppression. HLA-donor-matching, reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the need for immunosuppression, and is currently investigated in a clinical trial for PD in Japan. Since immune compatibility is very important in all areas of transplantation, these approaches may ultimately be of less benefit to the patients than an autologous approach. By using the patient’s own somatic cells, reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated to mDA neurons immunosuppression is not required, and may also present with several biological and functional advantages in the patients, as described in this article. The proof-of-principle of autologous iPSC mDA restoration of function has been shown in parkinsonian non-human primates (NHPs), and this can now be investigated in clinical trials in addition to the allogeneic and HLA-matched approaches. In this review, we focus on the autologous approach of cell therapy for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As the main driver of energy production in eukaryotes, mitochondria are invariably implicated in disorders of cellular bioenergetics. Given that dopaminergic neurons affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are particularly susceptible to energy fluctuations by their high basal energy demand, it is not surprising to note that mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a compelling candidate underlying PD. A recent approach towards forestalling dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD involves near-infrared (NIR) photobiomodulation (PBM), which is thought to enhance mitochondrial function of stimulated cells through augmenting the activity of cytochrome C oxidase. Notwithstanding this, our understanding of the neuroprotective mechanism of PBM remains far from complete. For example, studies focusing on the effects of PBM on gene transcription are limited, and the mechanism through which PBM exerts its effects on distant sites (i.e., its “abscopal effect”) remains unclear. Also, the clinical application of NIR in PD proves to be challenging. Efficacious delivery of NIR light to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the primary site of disease pathology in PD, is fraught with technical challenges. Concerted efforts focused on understanding the biological effects of PBM and improving the efficiency of intracranial NIR delivery are therefore essential for its successful clinical translation. Nonetheless, PBM represents a potential novel therapy for PD. In this review, we provide an update on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD and how PBM may help mitigate the neurodegenerative process. We also discussed clinical translation aspects of this treatment modality using intracranially implanted NIR delivery devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: An increasing lifespan and the resulting change in our expectations of later life stages are dependent on a good health state. This emphasizes the importance of the development of strategies to further strengthen healthy aging. One important aspect of good health in later life stages is sustained skilled motor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Here, we tested the effectiveness of robotic upper limb motor training in a game-like scenario assessing game-based learning and its transfer potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-six healthy participants (n = 18 elderly participants, n = 18 young controls) trained with a Pacman-like game using a hand-held Cellulo robot on 2 consecutive days. The game-related movements were conducted on a printed map displaying a maze and targets that had to be collected. Gradually, the task difficulty was adjusted between games by modifying or adding different game elements (e.g., speed and number of chasing ghosts, additional rules, and haptic feedback). Transfer was assessed by scoring simple robot manipulation on two different trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Elderly participants were able to improve their game performance over time [t&lt;sub&gt;(874)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.97, p &amp;lt; 0.01]. The applied game elements had similar effects on both age groups. Importantly, the game-based learning was transferable to simple robot manipulation that resembles activities of daily life. Only minor age-related differences were present (smaller overall learning gain and different effects of the wall-crash penalty rule in the elderly group).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Gamified motor training with the Cellulo system has the potential to translate into an efficient and relatively low-cost robotic motor training tool for promoting upper limb function to promote healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Subdistal appendages (sDAPs) are centriolar elements observed proximal to the distal appendages (DAPs) in vertebrates. Despite their obvious presence, structural and functional understanding of sDAPs remains elusive. Here, by combining super-resolved localization analysis and CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation, we find that, although DAPs and sDAPs are primarily responsible for distinct functions in ciliogenesis and microtubule anchoring respectively, the presence of one element actually affects the positioning of the other. Specifically, we find dual layers of both ODF2 and CEP89, where their localizations are differentially regulated by DAP and sDAP integrity. DAP depletion relaxes longitudinal occupancy of sDAP protein ninein to cover the DAP region, implying a role of DAPs in sDAP positioning. Removing sDAPs alter the distal border of centrosomal γ-tubulins, illustrating a new role of sDAPs. Together, our results provide an architectural framework of sDAPs to shed light on functional understanding, surprisingly revealing the coupling between DAPs and sDAPs.</content>

 Photoreceptor degeneration is a major cause of blindness and a considerable health burden during aging but effective therapeutic or preventive strategies have not so far become readily available. Here we show in mouse models that signaling through the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT protects photoreceptor cells against both light-induced and inherited retinal degeneration. Upon light damage, photoreceptor cells upregulate Kit ligand (KITL) and activate KIT signaling, which in turn induces nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor NRF2 and stimulates the expression of the antioxidant gene &lt;i&gt;Hmox1&lt;/i&gt;. Conversely, a viable &lt;i&gt;Kit&lt;/i&gt; mutation promotes light-induced photoreceptor damage, which is reversed by experimental expression of &lt;i&gt;Hmox1&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, overexpression of KITL from a viral AAV8 vector prevents photoreceptor cell death and partially restores retinal function after light damage or in genetic models of human retinitis pigmentosa. Hence, application of KITL may provide a novel therapeutic avenue for prevention or treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.</content>

 The peripheral somatosensory system bestows mammals with a diverse repertoire of sensory modalities: gentle touch, mechanical pain, itch, thermosensation, and proprioception. The cells and molecules that transduce many of these stimuli have already been characterized. But how somatosensory neurons transduce acutely painful mechanical forces is largely unknown and remains one of the ‘final frontiers’ of sensory neurobiology. In an effort to fill this gap in knowledge, recent studies have identified subpopulations of mechanical pain neurons and uncovered novel modulators of mechanical pain.</content>

Author summary: Conferences are great venues for disseminating algorithmic bioinformatics results, but they unfortunately do not offer an opportunity to make major revisions in the way that journals do. As a result, it is not possible for authors to fix mistakes that might be easily correctable but nevertheless can cause the paper to be rejected. As a reviewer, I wish that I had the opportunity to tell the authors, “Hey, you forgot to do this really important thing, without which it is hard to accept the paper, but if you could go back and fix it, you might have a great paper for the conference.” This lack of a back and forth can be especially problematic for first-time submitters or those from outside the field, e.g., biologists. In this article, I outline Ten Simple Rules to follow when writing an algorithmic bioinformatics conference paper to avoid having it rejected.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vz0yBVhdYvc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Multiscale modelling of infectious disease systems falls within the domain of complexity science—the study of complex systems. However, what should be made clear is that current progress in multiscale modelling of infectious disease dynamics is still as yet insufficient to present it as a mature sub-discipline of complexity science. In this article we present a methodology for development of multiscale models of infectious disease systems. This methodology is a set of partially ordered research and development activities that result in multiscale models of infectious disease systems built from different scientific approaches. Therefore, the conclusive result of this article is a methodology to design multiscale models of infectious diseases. Although this research and development process for multiscale models cannot be claimed to be unique and final, it constitutes a good starting point, which may be found useful as a basis for further refinement in the discourse for multiscale modelling of infectious disease dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x6ziJKg0pEU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The molecular mechanisms and functions in complex biological systems currently remain elusive. Recent high-throughput techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, have generated a wide variety of multiomics datasets that enable the identification of biological functions and mechanisms via multiple facets. However, integrating these large-scale multiomics data and discovering functional insights are, nevertheless, challenging tasks. To address these challenges, machine learning has been broadly applied to analyze multiomics. This review introduces multiview learning—an emerging machine learning field—and envisions its potentially powerful applications to multiomics. In particular, multiview learning is more effective than previous integrative methods for learning data’s heterogeneity and revealing cross-talk patterns. Although it has been applied to various contexts, such as computer vision and speech recognition, multiview learning has not yet been widely applied to biological data—specifically, multiomics data. Therefore, this paper firstly reviews recent multiview learning methods and unifies them in a framework called multiview empirical risk minimization (MV-ERM). We further discuss the potential applications of each method to multiomics, including genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, in an aim to discover the functional and mechanistic interpretations across omics. Secondly, we explore possible applications to different biological systems, including human diseases (e.g., brain disorders and cancers), plants, and single-cell analysis, and discuss both the benefits and caveats of using multiview learning to discover the molecular mechanisms and functions of these systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DGnjThFhIv0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Author summary: The purpose of this quick guide is to help new modelers who have little or no background in comparative modeling yet are keen to produce high-resolution protein 3D structures for their study by following systematic good modeling practices, using affordable personal computers or online computational resources. Through the available experimental 3D-structure repositories, the modeler should be able to access and use the atomic coordinates for building homology models. We also aim to provide the modeler with a rationale behind making a simple list of atomic coordinates suitable for computational analysis abiding to principles of physics (e.g., molecular mechanics). Keeping that objective in mind, these quick tips cover the process of homology modeling and some postmodeling computations such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD). A brief section was left for modeling nonprotein molecules, and a short case study of homology modeling is discussed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f1FXdcJi7Uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Recent advances in animal tracking technology have ushered in a new era in biologging. However, the considerable size of many sophisticated biologging devices restricts their application to larger animals, whereas older techniques often still represent the state-of-the-art for studying small vertebrates. In industrial applications, low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) fulfill requirements similar to those needed to monitor animal behavior at high resolution and at low tag mass. We developed a wireless biologging network (WBN), which enables simultaneous direct proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking, and long-range remote data download at tag masses of 1 to 2 g. Deployments to study wild bats created social networks and flight trajectories of unprecedented quality. Our developments highlight the vast capabilities of WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in biologging: fully automated tracking and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed habitats, at high spatial and temporal resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GWh2vVW6nuE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As primary producers, plants rely on a large aboveground surface area to collect carbon dioxide and sunlight and a large underground surface area to collect the water and mineral nutrients needed to support their growth and development. Accessibility of the essential nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the soil is affected by many factors that create a variable spatiotemporal landscape of their availability both at the local and global scale. Plants optimize uptake of the N and P available through modifications to their growth and development and engagement with microorganisms that facilitate their capture. The sensing of these nutrients, as well as the perception of overall nutrient status, shapes the plant’s response to its nutrient environment, coordinating its development with microbial engagement to optimize N and P capture and regulate overall plant growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–1 (PARP-1) inhibitors (PARPi) to treat cancer relates to their ability to trap PARP-1 at the site of a DNA break. Although different forms of PARPi all target the catalytic center of the enzyme, they have variable abilities to trap PARP-1. We found that several structurally distinct PARPi drive PARP-1 allostery to promote release from a DNA break. Other inhibitors drive allostery to retain PARP-1 on a DNA break. Further, we generated a new PARPi compound, converting an allosteric pro-release compound to a pro-retention compound and increasing its ability to kill cancer cells. These developments are pertinent to clinical applications where PARP-1 trapping is either desirable or undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Understanding the extinction of &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/i&gt; and origins of &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt; in South Africa has been hampered by the perceived complex geological context of hominin fossils, poor chronological resolution, and a lack of well-preserved early &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt; specimens. We describe, date, and contextualize the discovery of two hominin crania from Drimolen Main Quarry in South Africa. At ~2.04 million to 1.95 million years old, DNH 152 represents the earliest definitive occurrence of &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus robustus&lt;/i&gt;, and DNH 134 represents the earliest occurrence of a cranium with clear affinities to &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt;. These crania also show that &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/i&gt; were contemporaneous at ~2 million years ago. This high taxonomic diversity is also reflected in non-hominin species and provides evidence of endemic evolution and dispersal during a period of climatic variability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of emotion relies on objective readouts of the emotional state of an individual, which remains a major challenge especially in animal models. We found that mice exhibit stereotyped facial expressions in response to emotionally salient events, as well as upon targeted manipulations in emotion-relevant neuronal circuits. Facial expressions were classified into distinct categories using machine learning and reflected the changing intrinsic value of the same sensory stimulus encountered under different homeostatic or affective conditions. Facial expressions revealed emotion features such as intensity, valence, and persistence. Two-photon imaging uncovered insular cortical neuron activity that correlated with specific facial expressions and may encode distinct emotions. Facial expressions thus provide a means to infer emotion states and their neuronal correlates in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that results from the catastrophic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oncogenic signaling elevates lipid ROS production in many tumor types and is counteracted by metabolites that are derived from the amino acid cysteine. In this work, we show that the import of oxidized cysteine (cystine) via system x&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; is a critical dependency of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a leading cause of cancer mortality. PDAC cells used cysteine to synthesize glutathione and coenzyme A, which, together, down-regulated ferroptosis. Studying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system x&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subunit, &lt;i&gt;Slc7a11&lt;/i&gt;, induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth. This was replicated through the administration of cyst(e)inase, a drug that depletes cysteine and cystine, demonstrating a translatable means to induce ferroptosis in PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The design of modular protein logic for regulating protein function at the posttranscriptional level is a challenge for synthetic biology. Here, we describe the design of two-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built from de novo–designed proteins. These gates regulate the association of arbitrary protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional machinery in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells, where they control the expression of the &lt;i&gt;TIM3&lt;/i&gt; gene related to T cell exhaustion. Designed binding interaction cooperativity, confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the gates largely insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and the modularity of the approach enables ready extension to three-input OR, AND, and disjunctive normal form gates. The modularity and cooperativity of the control elements, coupled with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited number of protein components, should enable the design of sophisticated posttranslational control logic over a wide range of biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Slip of marine-terminating ice streams over beds of deformable till is responsible for most of the contribution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to sea level rise. Flow models of the ice sheet and till-bedded glaciers elsewhere require a law that relates slip resistance, slip velocity, and water pressure at the bed. We present results of experiments in which pressurized ice at its melting temperature is slid over a water-saturated till bed. Steady-state slip resistance increases with slip velocity owing to sliding of ice across the bed, but above a threshold velocity, till shears at its rate-independent Coulomb strength. These results motivate a generalized slip law for glacier-flow models that combines processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A defining feature of emergent phenomena in complex oxides is the competition and cooperation between ground states. In manganites, the balance between metallic and insulating phases can be tuned by the lattice; extending the range of lattice control would enhance the ability to access other phases. We stabilized uniform extreme tensile strain in nanoscale La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; membranes, exceeding 8% uniaxially and 5% biaxially. Uniaxial and biaxial strain suppresses the ferromagnetic metal at distinctly different strain values, inducing an insulator that can be extinguished by a magnetic field. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the insulator consists of charge-ordered Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; with staggered strain-enhanced Jahn-Teller distortions within the plane. This highly tunable strained membrane approach provides a broad opportunity to design and manipulate correlated electron states.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The Hayabusa2 spacecraft investigated the small asteroid Ryugu, which has a rubble-pile structure. We describe an impact experiment on Ryugu using Hayabusa2’s Small Carry-on Impactor. The impact produced an artificial crater with a diameter &amp;gt;10 meters, which has a semicircular shape, an elevated rim, and a central pit. Images of the impact and resulting ejecta were recorded by the Deployable CAMera 3 for &amp;gt;8 minutes, showing the growth of an ejecta curtain (the outer edge of the ejecta) and deposition of ejecta onto the surface. The ejecta curtain was asymmetric and heterogeneous and it never fully detached from the surface. The crater formed in the gravity-dominated regime; in other words, crater growth was limited by gravity not surface strength. We discuss implications for Ryugu’s surface age.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Precise three-dimensional (3D) atomic structure determination of individual nanocrystals is a prerequisite for understanding and predicting their physical properties. Nanocrystals from the same synthesis batch display what are often presumed to be small but possibly important differences in size, lattice distortions, and defects, which can only be understood by structural characterization with high spatial 3D resolution. We solved the structures of individual colloidal platinum nanocrystals by developing atomic-resolution 3D liquid-cell electron microscopy to reveal critical intrinsic heterogeneity of ligand-protected platinum nanocrystals in solution, including structural degeneracies, lattice parameter deviations, internal defects, and strain. These differences in structure lead to substantial contributions to free energies, consequential enough that they must be considered in any discussion of fundamental nanocrystal properties or applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) engages mitochondria at specialized ER domains known as mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). Here, we used three-dimensional high-resolution imaging to investigate the formation of pleomorphic &quot;megamitochondria&quot; with altered MAMs in brown adipocytes lacking the Sel1L-Hrd1 protein complex of ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Mice with ERAD deficiency in brown adipocytes were cold sensitive and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. ERAD deficiency affected ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial dynamics, at least in part, by regulating the turnover of the MAM protein, sigma receptor 1 (SigmaR1). Thus, our study provides molecular insights into ER-mitochondrial cross-talk and expands our understanding of the physiological importance of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing and postnatal brain have distinct positional identities that dictate the types of neurons they generate. Although morphogens initially establish NSC positional identity in the neural tube, it is unclear how such regional differences are maintained as the forebrain grows much larger and more anatomically complex. We found that the maintenance of NSC positional identity in the murine brain requires a &lt;i&gt;mixed-lineage leukemia 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mll1&lt;/i&gt;)–dependent epigenetic memory system. After establishment by sonic hedgehog, ventral NSC identity became independent of this morphogen. Even transient MLL1 inhibition caused a durable loss of ventral identity, resulting in the generation of neurons with the characteristics of dorsal NSCs in vivo. Thus, spatial information provided by morphogens can be transitioned to epigenetic mechanisms that maintain regionally distinct developmental programs in the forebrain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Axonal demyelination injury and neuronal degeneration are the primary causes of visual disability in multiple sclerosis (MS)-linked optic neuritis patients. Immunomodulatory therapies targeting inflammation have failed to avert the disease progression and no therapies exist to prevent the neuronal deficits seen in MS to date. Neuroprotective strategies targeting oligodendrocytes and astroglia have shown limited success due to a lack of axonal regeneration from injured neurons. In this study, we used the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS to investigate the axonal regenerative approach to improve the neuronal function. Our approach focused on targeted knock-out (KO) of the developmentally regulated axon growth inhibitory Krüppel-like factor 4 (&lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt;) gene in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/i&gt;mice by intravitreal delivery of AAV2-Cre-ires-EGFP recombinant virus (1) at the time of EAE sensitization and (2) after the onset of optic neuritis-mediated visual defects in the mice. &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene KO performed simultaneous with EAE sensitization prevented the visual loss as assessed by pattern electroretinograms (PERGs) in the mice and protected the RGCs from EAE-mediated death. More importantly, however, &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene KO after the onset of optic neuritis also resulted in RGC neuroprotection with additional restoration of their function, thereby improving the visual function outcomes in the EAE model. This study establishes the efficacy of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; targeted knock-down in EAE even after the onset of disease symptoms, and thus should be further explored as a potential treatment strategy for MS/optic neuritis patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of surgical treatment for supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and whether it is modified by key baseline characteristics and timing remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials of surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage aimed at clot removal. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases up to February 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2019. Primary outcome was good functional outcome at follow‐up; secondary outcomes were death and serious adverse events. We analyzed all types of surgery combined and minimally invasive approaches separately. We pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and assessed the modifying effect of age, Glasgow Coma Scale, hematoma volume and timing of surgery with meta‐regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 21 studies with 4145 patients; four (19%) were of the highest quality. Risk ratio of good functional outcome after any type of surgery was 1.40 (95% confidence interval 1.22–1.60; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 46%; 20 studies) and after minimally invasive surgery 1.47 (1.26–1.72; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 47%; 12 studies). For death the risk ratio for any type of surgery was 0.77 (0.68–0.85; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 23%; 21 studies), and for minimally invasive surgery 0.68 (0.56–0.83; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 14%; 13 studies). Serious adverse events were reported infrequently. Surgery seemed more effective when performed sooner after symptom onset (p = 0.04; 12 studies). Age, Glasgow Coma Scale and hematoma volume did not modify the effect of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage may be beneficial, in particular with minimally invasive procedures and when performed sooner after symptom onset. Further well‐designed randomized trials are needed to demonstrate whether (minimally‐invasive) surgery improves functional outcome after ICH and to determine the optimal time‐window of the treatment after symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prenatal and early postnatal stages represent a critical time window for human brain development. Interestingly, this window partly overlaps with the maturation of the intestinal flora (microbiota) that play a critical role in the bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems (microbiota‐gut‐brain axis). The microbial composition has important influences on general health and the development of several organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system, and also the brain. Clinical studies have shown that microbiota alterations are associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. In this review, we dissect the link between these neuropsychiatric disorders and the intestinal microbiota by focusing on their effect on synaptic pruning, a vital process in the maturation and establishing efficient functioning of the brain. We discuss in detail how synaptic pruning is dysregulated differently in the aforementioned neuropsychiatric disorders and how it can be influenced by dysbiosis and/or changes in the intestinal microbiota composition. We also review that the improvement in the intestinal microbiota composition by a change in diet, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may play a role in improving neuropsychiatric functioning, which can be at least partly explained &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the optimization of synaptic pruning and neuronal connections. Altogether, the demonstration of the microbiota's influence on brain function &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; microglial‐induced synaptic pruning addresses the possibility that the manipulation of microbiota‐immune crosstalk represents a promising strategy for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) not only stimulates focal target structures but also affects distributed brain networks. The impact this network modulation has on &lt;i&gt;non‐motor&lt;/i&gt; DBS effects is not well characterized. By focusing on the affective domain, we systematically investigate the impact of electrode placement and associated structural connectivity on changes in depressive symptoms following STN‐DBS which have been reported to improve, worsen or remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms before and after STN‐DBS surgery were documented in 116 PD patients from three DBS centers (Berlin, Queensland, Cologne). Based on individual electrode reconstructions, the volumes of tissue activated (VTA) were estimated and combined with normative connectome data to identify structural connections passing through VTAs. Berlin and Queensland cohorts formed a training and cross‐validation dataset used to identify structural connectivity explaining change in depressive symptoms. The Cologne data served as test‐set for which depressive symptom change was predicted.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural connectivity was linked to depressive symptom change under STN‐DBS. An optimal connectivity map trained on the Berlin cohort could predict changes in depressive symptoms in Queensland patients and vice versa. Furthermore, the joint training‐set map predicted changes in depressive symptoms in the independent test‐set. Worsening of depressive symptoms was associated with left prefrontal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibers linking the STN electrode with left prefrontal areas predicted worsening of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that for the left STN‐DBS lead, placement impacting fibers to left prefrontal areas should be avoided to maximize improvement of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In recent days, the amount of Cyber Security text data shared via social
media resources mainly Twitter has increased. An accurate analysis of this data
can help to develop cyber threat situational awareness framework for a cyber
threat. This work proposes a deep learning based approach for tweet data
analysis. To convert the tweets into numerical representations, various text
representations are employed. These features are feed into deep learning
architecture for optimal feature extraction as well as classification. Various
hyperparameter tuning approaches are used for identifying optimal text
representation method as well as optimal network parameters and network
structures for deep learning models. For comparative analysis, the classical
text representation method with classical machine learning algorithm is
employed. From the detailed analysis of experiments, we found that the deep
learning architecture with advanced text representation methods performed
better than the classical text representation and classical machine learning
algorithms. The primary reason for this is that the advanced text
representation methods have the capability to learn sequential properties which
exist among the textual data and deep learning architectures learns the optimal
features along with decreasing the feature size.

 &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the amount of Cyber Security data generated in the form of
unstructured texts, for example, social media resources, blogs, articles, and
so on has exceptionally increased. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an initial
step towards converting this unstructured data into structured data which can
be used by a lot of applications. The existing methods on NER for Cyber
Security data are based on rules and linguistic characteristics. A Deep
Learning (DL) based approach embedded with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) is
proposed in this paper. Several DL architectures are evaluated to find the most
optimal architecture. The combination of Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit
(Bi-GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and CRF performed better compared
to various other DL frameworks on a publicly available benchmark dataset. This
may be due to the reason that the bidirectional structures preserve the
features related to the future and previous words in a sequence.

 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal networks provide living organisms with the ability to process
information. They are also characterized by abundant recurrent connections,
which give rise to strong feedback that dictates their dynamics and endows them
with fading (short-term) memory. The role of recurrence in long-term memory, on
the other hand, is still unclear. Here we use the neuronal network of the
roundworm C. elegans to show that recurrent architectures in living organisms
can exhibit long-term memory without relying on specific hard-wired modules. A
genetic algorithm reveals that the experimentally observed dynamics of the
worm's neuronal network exhibits maximal complexity (as measured by permutation
entropy). In that complex regime, the response of the system to repeated
presentations of a time-varying stimulus reveals a consistent behavior that can
be interpreted as soft-wired long-term memory.

 &lt;p&gt;This paper derives, under minimal modelling assumptions, a simple to use
theorem for obtaining both order-$1$ and order-$2$ stability criteria for a
common class of particle swarm optimization (PSO) variants. Specifically, PSO
variants that can be rewritten as a finite sum of stochastically weighted
difference vectors between a particle's position and swarm informers are
covered by the theorem. Additionally, the use of the derived theorem allows a
PSO practitioner to obtain stability criteria that contains no artificial
restriction on the relationship between control coefficients. Almost all
previous PSO stability results have provided stability criteria under the
restriction that the social and cognitive control coefficients are equal; such
restrictions are not present when using the derived theorem. Using the derived
theorem, as demonstration of its ease of use, stability criteria are derived
without the imposed restriction on the relation between the control
coefficients for three popular PSO variants.

 &lt;p&gt;A key challenge to make effective use of evolutionary algorithms is to choose
appropriate settings for their parameters. However, the appropriate parameter
setting generally depends on the structure of the optimisation problem, which
is often unknown to the user. Non-deterministic parameter control mechanisms
adjust parameters using information obtained from the evolutionary process.
Self-adaptation -- where parameter settings are encoded in the chromosomes of
individuals and evolve through mutation and crossover -- is a popular parameter
control mechanism in evolutionary strategies. However, there is little
theoretical evidence that self-adaptation is effective, and self-adaptation has
largely been ignored by the discrete evolutionary computation community.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we show through a theoretical runtime analysis that a non-elitist,
discrete evolutionary algorithm which self-adapts its mutation rate not only
outperforms EAs which use static mutation rates on \leadingones, but also
improves asymptotically on an EA using a state-of-the-art control mechanism.
The structure of this problem depends on a parameter $k$, which is \emph{a
priori} unknown to the algorithm, and which is needed to appropriately set a
fixed mutation rate. The self-adaptive EA achieves the same asymptotic runtime
as if this parameter was known to the algorithm beforehand, which is an
asymptotic speedup for this problem compared to all other EAs previously
studied. An experimental study of how the mutation-rates evolve show that they
respond adequately to a diverse range of problem structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that self-adaptation should be adopted more broadly as
a parameter control mechanism in discrete, non-elitist evolutionary algorithms.

 &lt;p&gt;The deployment of Machine Learning (ML) models is a difficult and
time-consuming job that comprises a series of sequential and correlated tasks
that go from the data pre-processing, and the design and extraction of
features, to the choice of the ML algorithm and its parameterisation. The task
is even more challenging considering that the design of features is in many
cases problem specific, and thus requires domain-expertise. To overcome these
limitations Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) methods seek to automate, with
few or no human-intervention, the design of pipelines, i.e., automate the
selection of the sequence of methods that have to be applied to the raw data.
These methods have the potential to enable non-expert users to use ML, and
provide expert users with solutions that they would unlikely consider. In
particular, this paper describes AutoML-DSGE - a novel grammar-based framework
that adapts Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution (DSGE) to the evolution of
Scikit-Learn classification pipelines. The experimental results include
comparing AutoML-DSGE to another grammar-based AutoML framework, Resilient
ClassificationPipeline Evolution (RECIPE), and show that the average
performance of the classification pipelines generated by AutoML-DSGE is always
superior to the average performance of RECIPE; the differences are
statistically significant in 3 out of the 10 used datasets.

 &lt;p&gt;NeuroEvolution (NE) methods are known for applying Evolutionary Computation
to the optimisation of Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs). Despite aiding
non-expert users to design and train ANNs, the vast majority of NE approaches
disregard the knowledge that is gathered when solving other tasks, i.e.,
evolution starts from scratch for each problem, ultimately delaying the
evolutionary process. To overcome this drawback, we extend Fast Deep
Evolutionary Network Structured Representation (Fast-DENSER) to incremental
development. We hypothesise that by transferring the knowledge gained from
previous tasks we can attain superior results and speedup evolution. The
results show that the average performance of the models generated by
incremental development is statistically superior to the non-incremental
average performance. In case the number of evaluations performed by incremental
development is smaller than the performed by non-incremental development the
attained results are similar in performance, which indicates that incremental
development speeds up evolution. Lastly, the models generated using incremental
development generalise better, and thus, without further evolution, report a
superior performance on unseen problems.

 &lt;p&gt;Deep learning is being adopted in settings where accurate and justifiable
predictions are required, ranging from finance to medical imaging. While there
has been recent work providing post-hoc explanations for model predictions,
there has been relatively little work exploring more directly interpretable
models that can match state-of-the-art accuracy. Historically, decision trees
have been the gold standard in balancing interpretability and accuracy.
However, recent attempts to combine decision trees with deep learning have
resulted in models that (1) achieve accuracies far lower than that of modern
neural networks (e.g. ResNet) even on small datasets (e.g. MNIST), and (2)
require significantly different architectures, forcing practitioners pick
between accuracy and interpretability. We forgo this dilemma by creating
Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs) that (1) achieve neural network accuracy
and (2) require no architectural changes to a neural network. NBDTs achieve
accuracy within 1% of the base neural network on CIFAR10, CIFAR100,
TinyImageNet, using recently state-of-the-art WideResNet; and within 2% of
EfficientNet on ImageNet. This yields state-of-the-art explainable models on
ImageNet, with NBDTs improving the baseline by ~14% to 75.30% top-1 accuracy.
Furthermore, we show interpretability of our model's decisions both
qualitatively and quantitatively via a semi-automatic process. Code and
pretrained NBDTs can be found at

 &lt;p&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an emerging form of indirect
encoding. The GAN is trained to induce a latent space on training data, and a
real-valued evolutionary algorithm can search that latent space. Such Latent
Variable Evolution (LVE) has recently been applied to game levels. However, it
is hard for objective scores to capture level features that are appealing to
players. Therefore, this paper introduces a tool for interactive LVE of
tile-based levels for games. The tool also allows for direct exploration of the
latent dimensions, and allows users to play discovered levels. The tool works
for a variety of GAN models trained for both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend
of Zelda, and is easily generalizable to other games. A user study shows that
both the evolution and latent space exploration features are appreciated, with
a slight preference for direct exploration, but combining these features allows
users to discover even better levels. User feedback also indicates how this
system could eventually grow into a commercial design tool, with the addition
of a few enhancements.

 &lt;p&gt;In science, macro level descriptions of the causal interactions within
complex, dynamical systems are typically deemed convenient, but ultimately
reducible to a complete causal account of the underlying micro constituents.
Yet, such a reductionist perspective is hard to square with several issues
related to autonomy and agency: (1) agents require (causal) borders that
separate them from the environment, (2) at least in a biological context,
agents are associated with macroscopic systems, and (3) agents are supposed to
act upon their environment. Integrated information theory (IIT) (Oizumi et al.,
2014) offers a quantitative account of causation based on a set of causal
principles, including notions such as causal specificity, composition, and
irreducibility, that challenges the reductionist perspective in multiple ways.
First, the IIT formalism provides a complete account of a system's causal
structure, including irreducible higher-order mechanisms constituted of
multiple system elements. Second, a system's amount of integrated information
($\Phi$) measures the causal constraints a system exerts onto itself and can
peak at a macro level of description (Hoel et al., 2016; Marshall et al.,
2018). Finally, the causal principles of IIT can also be employed to identify
and quantify the actual causes of events (&quot;what caused what&quot;), such as an
agent's actions (Albantakis et al., 2019). Here, we demonstrate this framework
by example of a simulated agent, equipped with a small neural network, that
forms a maximum of $\Phi$ at a macro scale.

 &lt;p&gt;Mathematical proofs are both paradigms of certainty and some of the most
explicitly-justified arguments that we have in the cultural record. Their very
explicitness, however, leads to a paradox, because their probability of error
grows exponentially as the argument expands. Here we show that under a
cognitively-plausible belief formation mechanism that combines deductive and
abductive reasoning, mathematical arguments can undergo what we call an
epistemic phase transition: a dramatic and rapidly-propagating jump from
uncertainty to near-complete confidence at reasonable levels of claim-to-claim
error rates. To show this, we analyze an unusual dataset of forty-eight
machine-aided proofs from the formalized reasoning system Coq, including major
theorems ranging from ancient to 21st Century mathematics, along with four
hand-constructed cases from Euclid, Apollonius, Spinoza, and Andrew Wiles. Our
results bear both on recent work in the history and philosophy of mathematics,
and on a question, basic to cognitive science, of how we form beliefs, and
justify them to others.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In most network problems, the optimum behaviors of agents in the network are
not known before deployment. In addition to that, agents might be required to
adapt, i.e. change their behavior based on the environment conditions. In these
scenarios, offline optimization is usually costly and inefficient, while online
methods might be more suitable. In this work we propose a distributed embodied
evolutionary approach to optimize spatially distributed, locally interacting
agents by allowing them to exchange their behavior parameters and learn from
each other to adapt to a certain task within a given environment. Our numerical
results show that the local exchange of information, performed by means of
crossover of behavior parameters with neighbors, allows the network to converge
to the global optimum more efficiently than the cases where local interactions
are not allowed, even when there are large differences on the optimal behaviors
within a neighborhood.

			<subtitle type="html">Nature Reviews Neuroscience is the leading review journal in the neurosciences. It publishes articles that review recent progress in brain and nervous system research. Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry. One of the unique features of Nature Reviews Neuroscience is its extraordinary breadth and depth of coverage. This very broad scope – from molecules to mind – captures the essence of modern neuroscience, and allows the journal to attract readers from all areas of this ever-expanding discipline.</subtitle>

Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry. One of the unique features of Nature Reviews Neuroscience is its extraordinary breadth and depth of coverage. This very broad scope – from molecules to mind – captures the essence of modern neuroscience, and allows the journal to attract readers from all areas of this ever-expanding discipline.</subtitle>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) affect the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent systems that degenerate during disease progression. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells (PCs) are the most vulnerable and their prominent loss in the late phase of the pathology is the main characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the constant advancement in the discovery of affected molecules and cellular pathways, a comprehensive description of the events leading to the development of motor impairment and degeneration is still lacking. However, in the last years the possible causal role for altered cerebellar development and neuronal circuit wiring in SCAs has been emerging. Not only wiring and synaptic transmission deficits are a common trait of SCAs, but also preventing the expression of the mutant protein during cerebellar development seems to exert a protective role. By discussing this tight relationship between cerebellar development and SCAs, in this review, we aim to highlight the importance of cerebellar circuitry for the investigation of SCAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;With increasing distribution of endovascular stroke therapies, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice now more than ever depicts a relevant patient population with recanalized M1 occlusion. In this case, the desired therapeutic effect of blood flow restauration is accompanied by breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and secondary reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to elucidate short and intermediate-term transcriptional patterns and the involved pathways covering the different cellular players at the neurovascular unit after transient large vessel occlusion. To achieve this, male C57Bl/6J mice were treated according to an intensive post-stroke care protocol after 60 min occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or sham surgery to allow a high survival rate. After 24 h or 7 days, RNA from microvessel fragments from the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemispheres was isolated and used for mRNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses allowed us to depict gene expression changes at two timepoints of neurovascular post-stroke injury and regeneration. We validated our dataset by quantitative real time PCR of BBB-associated targets with well-characterized post-stroke dynamics. Hence, this study provides a well-controlled transcriptome dataset of a translationally relevant mouse model 24 h and 7 days after stroke which might help to discover future therapeutic targets in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Stimulation of the pineal gland via its sympathetic innervation pathway results in the production of N-acetylserotonin and melatonin. Melatonin has many therapeutic roles and is heavily implicated in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. In addition, N-acetylserotonin has recently been reported to promote neurogenesis in the brain. Upregulation of these indoleamines is possible via neuromodulation of the pineal gland. This is achieved by electrical stimulation of structures or fibres in the pineal gland sympathetic innervation pathway. Many studies have performed such pineal neuromodulation using both invasive and non-invasive methods. However, the effects of various experimental variables and stimulation paradigms has not yet been reviewed and evaluated. This review summarises these studies and presents the optimal experimental protocols and stimulation parameters necessary for maximal upregulation of melatonin metabolic output.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapses in the mammalian cortex are highly diverse, both in terms of their structure and function. However, relationships between synaptic features indicate they are highly coordinated entities. Imaging techniques, that enable physiology at the resolution of individual synapses to be investigated, have allowed the presynaptic activity level of the synapse to be related to postsynaptic function. This approach has revealed that neuronal activity induces the pre- and post-synapse to be functionally correlated and that subsets of synapses are more susceptible to certain forms of synaptic plasticity. As presynaptic function is often examined in isolation from postsynaptic properties, the effect it has on the post-synapse is not fully understood. However, since postsynaptic receptors at excitatory synapses respond to release of glutamate, it follows that they may be differentially regulated depending on the frequency of its release. Therefore, examining postsynaptic properties in the context of presynaptic function may be a useful way to approach a broad range of questions on synaptic physiology. In this review, we focus on how optophysiology tools have been utilized to study relationships between the pre- and the post-synapse. Multiple imaging techniques have revealed correlations in synaptic properties from the submicron to the dendritic level. Optical tools together with advanced imaging techniques are ideally suited to illuminate this area further, due to the spatial resolution and control they allow.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have been implicated in regulating oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vitro, although their functions in vivo remain less well defined. Using a novel approach to locally ablate GFAP+ astrocytes, we demonstrate that astrocytes are required for normal CNS myelin compaction during development, and for maintaining myelin integrity in the adult. Transient ablation of GFAP+ astrocytes in the mouse spinal cord during the first postnatal week reduced the numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and inhibited myelin formation, while prolonged ablation resulted in myelin that lacked compaction and structural integrity. Ablation of GFAP+ astrocytes in the adult spinal cord resulted in the rapid, local loss of myelin integrity and regional demyelination. The loss of myelin integrity induced by astrocyte ablation was greatly reduced by NMDA receptor antagonists, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that myelin stability was affected by elevation of local glutamate levels following astrocyte ablation. Furthermore, targeted delivery of glutamate into adult spinal cord white matter resulted in reduction of myelin basic protein expression and localized disruption of myelin compaction which was also reduced by NMDA receptor blockade. The pathology induced by localized astrocyte loss and elevated exogenous glutamate, supports the concept that astrocytes are critical for maintenance of myelin integrity in the adult CNS and may be primary targets in the initiation of demyelinating diseases of the CNS, such as Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine whether the influence of hypertension (HTN) status on longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism was modified by the apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) status among older people with normal cognition.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this study, we included 217 older individuals with normal cognition from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Participants were divided into the HTN and no HTN groups based on self-reported medical history. Brain glucose metabolism was assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Linear mixed model was fitted to examine the association between the HTN × APOE4 interaction and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism after controlling for several covariates.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we found that the association between HTN status and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism varied as a function of the APOE4 status, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG SUVR than all other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the rate of decline in FDG SUVR among other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The APOE4 genotype interacted with hypertension status to affect longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism among older individual with normal cognition, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG SUVR than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Variation in the risk and severity of many autoimmune diseases, malignancies and infections is strongly associated with polymorphisms in the HLA class I loci. These genetic associations provide a powerful opportunity for understanding the etiology of human disease. HLA class I associations are often interpreted in the light of 'protective' or 'detrimental' CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses which are restricted by the host HLA class I allotype. However, given the diverse receptors which are bound by HLA class I molecules, alternative interpretations are possible. As well as binding T cell receptors on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, HLA class I molecules are important ligands for inhibitory and activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) which are found on natural killer cells and some T cells; for the CD94:NKG2 family of receptors also expressed mainly by NK cells and for leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) on myeloid cells. The aim of this study is to develop an immunogenetic approach for identifying and quantifying the relative contribution of different receptor-ligand interactions to a given HLA class I disease association and then to use this approach to investigate the immune interactions underlying HLA class I disease associations in three viral infections: Human T cell Leukemia Virus type 1, Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 and Hepatitis C Virus as well as in the inflammatory condition Crohn's disease.</content>

 The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is a unique brain region maintaining neural stem cells (NCSs) and neurogenesis into adulthood. We used multiphoton imaging to visualize for genetically defined progenitor subpopulations in live slices across key stages of mouse DG development testing decades old static models of DG formation, with molecular identification, genetic-lineage tracing, and mutant analyses. We found novel progenitor migrations, timings, dynamic cell-cell interactions, signaling activities, and routes underlie mosaic DG formation. Intermediate progenitors (IPs, Tbr2+) pioneered migrations, supporting and guiding later emigrating NSCs (Sox9+) through multiple transient zones prior to converging at the nascent outer adult niche in a dynamic settling process, generating all prenatal and postnatal granule neurons in defined spatiotemporal order. IPs (Dll1+) extensively targeted contacts to mitotic NSCs (Notch active), revealing a substrate for cell-cell contact support during migrations, a developmental feature maintained in adults. Mouse DG formation shares conserved features of human neocortical expansion.</content>

 Protein turnover, the net result of protein synthesis and degradation, enables cells to remodel their proteomes in response to internal and external cues. Previously, we analyzed protein turnover rates in cultured brain cells under basal neuronal activity and found that protein turnover is influenced by subcellular localization, protein function, complex association, cell type of origin, and by the cellular environment (Dörrbaum et al., 2018). Here, we advanced our experimental approach to quantify changes in protein synthesis and degradation, as well as the resulting changes in protein turnover or abundance in rat primary hippocampal cultures during homeostatic scaling. Our data demonstrate that a large fraction of the neuronal proteome shows changes in protein synthesis and/or degradation during homeostatic up- and down-scaling. More than half of the quantified synaptic proteins were regulated, including pre- as well as postsynaptic proteins with diverse molecular functions.</content>

 Proper function and repair of the digestive system are vital to most animals. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in these processes requires an atlas of gene expression and cell types. Here, we applied laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-seq to characterize the intestinal transcriptome of &lt;i&gt;Schmidtea mediterranea&lt;/i&gt;, a planarian flatworm that can regenerate all organs, including the gut. We identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression undetected by previous approaches. Systematic analyses revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. Furthermore, spatial LCM enabled us to uncover previously unappreciated regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, especially among intestinal goblet cells. Finally, we identified two intestine-enriched transcription factors that specifically regulate regeneration (hedgehog signaling effector &lt;i&gt;gli-1&lt;/i&gt;) or maintenance (&lt;i&gt;RREB2&lt;/i&gt;) of goblet cells. Altogether, this work provides resources for further investigation of mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair and regeneration.</content>

In bacteria functionally related genes comprising metabolic pathways and protein complexes are frequently encoded in operons and are widely conserved across phylogenetically diverse species. The evolution of these operon-encoded processes is affected by diverse mechanisms such as gene duplication, loss, rearrangement, and horizontal transfer. These mechanisms can result in functional diversification, increasing the potential evolution of novel biological pathways, and enabling pre-existing pathways to adapt to the requirements of particular environments. Despite the fundamental importance that these mechanisms play in bacterial environmental adaptation, a systematic approach for studying the evolution of operon organization is lacking. Herein, we present a novel method to study the evolution of operons based on phylogenetic clustering of operon-encoded protein families and genomic-proximity network visualizations of operon architectures. We applied this approach to study the evolution of the synthase dependent exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthetic systems: cellulose, acetylated cellulose, poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PNAG), Pel, and alginate. These polymers have important roles in biofilm formation, antibiotic tolerance, and as virulence factors in opportunistic pathogens. Our approach revealed the complex evolutionary landscape of EPS machineries, and enabled operons to be classified into evolutionarily distinct lineages. Cellulose operons show phyla-specific operon lineages resulting from gene loss, rearrangement, and the acquisition of accessory loci, and the occurrence of whole-operon duplications arising through horizonal gene transfer. Our evolution-based classification also distinguishes between PNAG production from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria on the basis of structural and functional evolution of the acetylation modification domains shared by PgaB and IcaB loci, respectively. We also predict several &lt;i&gt;pel&lt;/i&gt;-like operon lineages in Gram-positive bacteria and demonstrate in our companion paper (Whitfield &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; PLoS Pathogens, in press) that &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; produces a Pel-dependent biofilm that is regulated by cyclic-3’,5’-dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V0mOj-urAFQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Despite over a century of intensive efforts, the great gains promised by the War on Cancer nearly 50 years ago have not materialized. Since 1999, we have analyzed the lack of progress in explaining and “curing” cancer by examining the merits of the premises that determine how cancer is understood and treated. Our ongoing critical analyses have aimed at clarifying the sources of misunderstandings at the root of the cancer puzzle while providing a plausible and comprehensive biomedical perspective as well as a new theory of carcinogenesis that is compatible with evolutionary theory. In this essay, we explain how this new theory, the tissue organization field theory (TOFT), can help chart a path to progress for cancer researchers by explaining features of cancer that remain unexplainable from the perspective of the still hegemonic somatic mutation theory (SMT) and its variants. Of equal significance, the premises underlying the TOFT offer new perspectives on basic biological phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/d3ENxC6IJQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R"/>
		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the neurobiology of migraine with aura (MWA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies reveal networks of microvessels linking brain‐meninges‐bone marrow. CSD activates the trigeminovascular system, evoking a meningeal inflammatory response. Accordingly, this study examines the upregulation of an inflammatory marker in extra‐axial tissues in migraine with visual aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used simultaneously acquired &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐PBR28 PET/MRI data of 18 kDa translocator protein (an inflammatory marker) in MWA patients (n = 11) who experienced headaches and visual aura in the preceding month. We measured mean tracer uptake (SUVR) in four regions of interest comprising the meninges plus the adjacent overlying skull bone (parameningeal tissues, PMT). These data were compared to healthy controls and patients with pain (chronic low‐back pain, CLBP).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MWA had significantly higher mean SUVR in PMT overlying occipital cortex than both other groups, though not in the PMT overlying three other cortical areas. A positive correlation was also found between the number of visual auras and tracer uptake in occipital PMT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong persistent extra‐axial inflammatory signal was found in meninges and calvarial bone overlying the occipital lobe in migraine with visual auras. Our findings are reminiscent of CSD‐induced meningeal inflammation and provide the first imaging evidence implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of migraine meningeal symptoms. We suspect that this inflammatory focus results from a signal that migrates from underlying brain and if so, may implicate newly discovered bridging vessels that crosstalk between brain and skull marrow, a finding of potential relevance to migraine plus other neuroinflammatory brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Low oral bioavailability of peptide drugs has limited their application to parenteral administration, which suffers from poor patient compliance. Here, we show that molecular targeting of the FATP4 transporter is an effective approach to specifically transport long-chain fatty acid (LCFA)–conjugated peptides across the enterocytic membrane and, thus, enables oral delivery of drug peptides. We packaged LCFA-conjugated exendin-4 (LCFA-Ex4) into liposomes and coated with chitosan nanoparticles to form an orally deliverable Ex4 (OraEx4). OraEx4 protected LCFA-Ex4 from damage by the gastric fluid and released LCFA-Ex4 in the intestinal cavity, where LCFA-Ex4 was transported across the enterocyte membrane by the FAPT4 transporter. OraEx4 had a high bioavailability of 24.8% with respect to subcutaneous injection and exhibited a substantial hypoglycemic effect in murine models of diabetes mellitus. Thus, molecular targeting of the FATP4 transporter enhances oral absorption of therapeutic peptides and provides a platform for oral peptide drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Overactivation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling has been identified in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. BEZ235 is an effective dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, but it was withdrawn from early-phase clinical trials owing to poor solubility and on-target/off-tumor toxicity. Here, we developed a nanoparticle (NP)–based pretargeted system for the therapeutic delivery of BEZ235 to CD20- and HLA-DR–expressing lymphoma cells for targeted therapy. The pretargeted system is composed of dibenzocyclooctyne-functionalized anti-CD20 and anti-Lym1 antibodies as the tumor-targeting components and azide-functionalized BEZ235-encapsulated NPs as the effector drug carrier. Using lymphoma cell lines with different CD20 and HLA-DR antigen densities as examples, we demonstrate that the dual antibody pretargeted strategy effectively raises the number of NPs retained on the target tumor cells and improves the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of BEZ235 through the inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Our data demonstrate that the NP-based pretargeted system improves the therapeutic window of small-molecule kinase inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no methods available offering solutions to select and identify antibodies binding to a specific conformational epitope of an antigen. Here, we developed a method to allow epitope-directed antibody selection from a phage display library by photocrosslinking bound antibodies to a site that specifically incorporates a noncanonical amino acid, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBpa), on the target antigen epitope. By one or two rounds of panning against antibody phage display libraries, those hits that covalently bind to the proximity site of pBpa on specific epitopes of target antigens after ultraviolet irradiation are enriched and selected. This method was applied to specific epitopes on human interleukin-1β and complement 5a. In both cases, more than one-third of hits identified bind to the target epitopes, demonstrating the feasibility and versatility of this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Many viruses are known to form cellular compartments, also called viral factories. Paramyxoviruses, including measles virus, colocalize their proteomic and genomic material in puncta in infected cells. We demonstrate that purified nucleoproteins (N) and phosphoproteins (P) of measles virus form liquid-like membraneless organelles upon mixing in vitro. We identify weak interactions involving intrinsically disordered domains of N and P that are implicated in this process, one of which is essential for phase separation. Fluorescence allows us to follow the modulation of the dynamics of N and P upon droplet formation, while NMR is used to investigate the thermodynamics of this process. RNA colocalizes to droplets, where it triggers assembly of N protomers into nucleocapsid-like particles that encapsidate the RNA. The rate of encapsidation within droplets is enhanced compared to the dilute phase, revealing one of the roles of liquid-liquid phase separation in measles virus replication.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human brains are three times larger, are organized differently, and mature for a longer period of time than those of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Together, these characteristics are important for human cognition and social behavior, but their evolutionary origins remain unclear. To study brain growth and organization in the hominin species &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/i&gt; more than 3 million years ago, we scanned eight fossil crania using conventional and synchrotron computed tomography. We inferred key features of brain organization from endocranial imprints and explored the pattern of brain growth by combining new endocranial volume estimates with narrow age at death estimates for two infants. Contrary to previous claims, sulcal imprints reveal an ape-like brain organization and no features derived toward humans. A comparison of infant to adult endocranial volumes indicates protracted brain growth in &lt;i&gt;A. afarensis&lt;/i&gt;, likely critical for the evolution of a long period of childhood learning in hominins.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal activities depend heavily on microtubules, which shape neuronal processes and transport myriad molecules within them. Although constantly remodeled through growth and shrinkage events, neuronal microtubules must be sufficiently stable to maintain nervous system wiring. This stability is somehow maintained by various microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), but little is known about how these proteins work. Here, we show that MAP6, previously known to confer cold stability to microtubules, promotes growth. More unexpectedly, MAP6 localizes in the lumen of microtubules, induces the microtubules to coil into a left-handed helix, and forms apertures in the lattice, likely to relieve mechanical stress. These features have not been seen in microtubules before and could play roles in maintaining axonal width or providing flexibility in the face of compressive forces during development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Transplantation of patient-derived Schwann cells is a promising regenerative medicine therapy for spinal cord injuries; however, therapeutic efficacy is compromised by inefficient cell delivery. We present a materials-based strategy that addresses three common causes of transplanted cell death: (i) membrane damage during injection, (ii) cell leakage from the injection site, and (iii) apoptosis due to loss of endogenous matrix. Using protein engineering and peptide-based assembly, we designed injectable hydrogels with modular cell-adhesive and mechanical properties. In a cervical contusion model, our hydrogel matrix resulted in a greater than 700% improvement in successful Schwann cell transplantation. The combination therapy of cells and gel significantly improved the spatial distribution of transplanted cells within the endogenous tissue. A reduction in cystic cavitation and neuronal loss were also observed with substantial increases in forelimb strength and coordination. Using an injectable hydrogel matrix, therefore, can markedly improve the outcomes of cellular transplantation therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The remarkable power of enzymes to undertake catalysis frequently stems from their grouping of multiple, complementary chemical units within close proximity around the enzyme active site. Motivated by this, we report here a bioinspired surfactant catalyst that incorporates a variety of chemical functionalities common to hydrolytic enzymes. The textbook hydrolase active site, the catalytic triad, is modeled by positioning the three groups of the triad (-OH, -imidazole, and -CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) on a single, trifunctional surfactant molecule. To support this, we recreate the hydrogen bond donating arrangement of the oxyanion hole by imparting surfactant functionality to a guanidinium headgroup. Self-assembly of these amphiphiles in solution drives the collection of functional headgroups into close proximity around a hydrophobic nano-environment, affording hydrolysis of a model ester at rates that challenge α-chymotrypsin. Structural assessment via NMR and XRD, paired with MD simulation and QM calculation, reveals marked similarities of the co-micelle catalyst to native enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic network of membranes. Here, we combine live-cell microscopy with in situ cryo–electron tomography to directly visualize ER dynamics in several secretory cell types including pancreatic β-cells and neurons under near-native conditions. Using these imaging approaches, we identify a novel, mobile form of ER, ribosome-associated vesicles (RAVs), found primarily in the cell periphery, which is conserved across different cell types and species. We show that RAVs exist as distinct, highly dynamic structures separate from the intact ER reticular architecture that interact with mitochondria via direct intermembrane contacts. These findings describe a new ER subcompartment within cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cave bear is one of the best known extinct large mammals that inhabited Europe during the &quot;Ice Age,&quot; becoming extinct 24,000 years ago along with other members of the Pleistocene megafauna. Long-standing hypotheses speculate that many cave bears died during their long hibernation periods, which were necessary to overcome the severe and prolonged winters of the Last Glacial. Here, we investigate how long hibernation periods in cave bears would have directly affected their feeding biomechanics using CT-based biomechanical simulations of skulls of cave and extant bears. Our results demonstrate that although large paranasal sinuses were necessary for, and consistent with, long hibernation periods, trade-offs in sinus-associated cranial biomechanical traits restricted cave bears to feed exclusively on low energetic vegetal resources during the predormancy period. This biomechanical trade-off constitutes a new key factor to mechanistically explain the demise of this dominant Pleistocene megafaunal species as a direct consequence of climate cooling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Paired associative stimulation (PAS) has been explored in humans as a noninvasive tool to drive plasticity and promote recovery after neurologic insult. A more thorough understanding of PAS-induced plasticity is needed to fully harness it as a clinical tool. Here, we tested the efficacy of PAS with multiple interstimulus intervals in an awake rat model to study the principles of associative plasticity. Using chronically implanted electrodes in motor cortex and forelimb, we explored PAS parameters to effectively drive plasticity. We assessed changes in corticomotor excitability using a closed-loop, EMG-controlled cortical stimulation paradigm. We tested 11 PAS intervals, chosen to force the coincidence of neuronal activity in the motor cortex and spinal cord of rats with timings relevant to the principles of Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity. However, despite a relatively large number of stimulus pairings (300), none of the tested intervals reliably changed corticospinal excitability relative to control conditions. Our results question PAS effectiveness under these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2960?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation with sustained microglial activation occurs following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is believed to contribute to subsequent neurodegeneration and neurological deficits. Microglia, the primary innate immune cells in brain, are dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling for their survival. In this preclinical study, we examined the effects of delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia on functional recovery and neurodegeneration up to 3 months postinjury. A CSF1R inhibitor, Plexxikon (PLX) 5622, was administered to adult male C57BL/6J mice at 1 month after controlled cortical impact to remove chronically activated microglia, and the inhibitor was withdrawn 1-week later to allow for microglial repopulation. Following TBI, the repopulated microglia displayed a ramified morphology similar to that of Sham uninjured mice, whereas microglia in vehicle-treated TBI mice showed the typical chronic posttraumatic hypertrophic morphology. PLX5622 treatment limited TBI-associated neuropathological changes at 3 months postinjury; these included a smaller cortical lesion, reduced hippocampal neuron cell death, and decreased NOX2- and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia after TBI led to widespread changes in the cortical transcriptome and altered gene pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity. Using a variety of complementary neurobehavioral tests, PLX5622-treated TBI mice also had improved long-term motor and cognitive function recovery through 3 months postinjury. Together, these studies demonstrate that chronic phase removal of neurotoxic microglia after TBI using CSF1R inhibitors markedly reduce chronic neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration, as well as related motor and cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a debilitating neurological disorder that can seriously impact the patient's quality of life. Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation is induced after severe TBI and contributes to neurological deficits and on-going neurodegenerative processes. Here, we investigated the effect of breaking the neurotoxic neuroinflammatory loop at 1-month after controlled cortical impact in mice by pharmacological removal of chronically activated microglia using a colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, Plexxikon 5622. Overall, we show that short-term elimination of microglia during the chronic phase of TBI followed by repopulation results in long-term improvements in neurological function, suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, and a reduction in persistent neurodegenerative processes. These studies are clinically relevant and support new concepts that the therapeutic window for TBI may be far longer than traditionally believed if chronic and evolving microglial-mediated neuroinflammation can be inhibited or regulated in a precise manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Analysis of rats of both sexes revealed a dramatic reduction in brain size compared with WT (&lt;i&gt;Pclo&lt;sup&gt;wt/wt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) animals, attributed to a decrease in the size of the cerebral cortical, cerebellar, and pontine regions. Analysis of the cerebellum and brainstem revealed a reduced granule cell layer and a reduction in size of pontine nuclei. Moreover, the maturation of mossy fiber afferents from pontine neurons and the expression of the α6 GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunit at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse are perturbed, as well as the innervation of Purkinje cells by cerebellar climbing fibers. Ultrastructural and functional studies revealed a reduced size of mossy fiber boutons, with fewer synaptic vesicles and altered synaptic transmission. These data imply that Piccolo is required for the normal development, maturation, and function of neuronal networks formed between the brainstem and cerebellum. Consistently, behavioral studies demonstrated that adult &lt;i&gt;Pclo&lt;sup&gt;gt/gt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; rats display impaired motor coordination, despite adequate performance in tasks that reflect muscle strength and locomotion. Together, these data suggest that loss of Piccolo function in patients with PCH3 could be involved in many of the observed anatomical and behavioral symptoms, and that the further analysis of these animals could provide fundamental mechanistic insights into this devastating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3 is a devastating developmental disorder associated with severe developmental delay, progressive microcephaly with brachycephaly, optic atrophy, seizures, and hypertonia with hyperreflexia. Recent genetic studies have identified non-sense mutations in the coding region of the PCLO gene, suggesting a functional link between this disorder and the presynaptic active zone. Our analysis of Piccolo KO rats supports this hypothesis, formally demonstrating that anatomical and behavioral phenotypes seen in patients with Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 3 are also exhibited by these Piccolo deficient animals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, dopamine signaling to the mushroom body intrinsic neurons, Kenyon cells (KCs), is critical to stabilize olfactory memory. Little is known about the downstream intracellular molecular signaling underlying memory stabilization. Here we address this question in the context of sugar-rewarded olfactory long-term memory (LTM). We show that associative training increases the phosphorylation of MAPK in KCs, via Dop1R2 signaling. Consistently, the attenuation of &lt;i&gt;Dop1R2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Raf&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;MAPK&lt;/i&gt; expression in KCs selectively impairs LTM, but not short-term memory. Moreover, we show that the LTM deficit caused by the knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Dop1R2&lt;/i&gt; can be rescued by expressing active Raf in KCs. Thus, the Dop1R2/Raf/MAPK pathway is a pivotal downstream effector of dopamine signaling for stabilizing appetitive olfactory memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopaminergic input to the Kenyon cells (KCs) is pivotal to stabilize memory in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. This process is mediated by dopamine receptors like Dop1R2. Nevertheless, little is known for its underlying molecular mechanism. Here we show that the Raf/MAPK pathway is specifically engaged in appetitive long-term memory in KCs. With combined biochemical and behavioral experiments, we reveal that activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway is regulated through Dop1R2, shedding light on how dopamine modulates intracellular signaling for memory stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Regulation of emotional behavior is essential for human social interactions. Recent work has exposed its cognitive complexity, as well as its unexpected reliance on portions of the anterior PFC (aPFC) also involved in exploration, relational reasoning, and counterfactual choice, rather than on dorsolateral and medial prefrontal areas involved in several forms of cognitive control. This study anatomically qualifies the contribution of aPFC territories to the regulation of prepotent approach–avoidance action tendencies elicited by emotional faces, and explores a possible structural pathway through which this emotional action regulation might be implemented. We provide converging evidence from task-based fMRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional connectivity fingerprints for a novel neural element in emotional regulation. Task-based fMRI in human male participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 40) performing an emotional approach–avoidance task identified aPFC territories involved in the regulation of action tendencies elicited by emotional faces. Connectivity fingerprints, based on diffusion-weighted imaging and resting-state connectivity, localized those task-defined frontal regions to the lateral frontal pole (FPl), an anatomically defined portion of the aPFC that lacks a homologous counterpart in macaque brains. Probabilistic tractography indicated that 10%–20% of interindividual variation in emotional regulation abilities is accounted for by the strength of structural connectivity between FPl and amygdala. Evidence from an independent replication sample (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 50; 10 females) further substantiated this result. These findings provide novel neuroanatomical evidence for incorporating FPl in models of control over human action tendencies elicited by emotional faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Successful regulation of emotional behaviors is a prerequisite for successful participation in human society, as is evidenced by the social isolation and loss of occupational opportunities often encountered by people suffering from emotion regulation disorders, such as social-anxiety disorder and psychopathy. Knowledge about the precise cortical regions and connections supporting this control is crucial for understanding both the nature of computations needed to successfully traverse the space of possible actions in social situations, and the potential interventions that might result in efficient treatment of social-emotional disorders. This study provides evidence for a precise cortical region (lateral frontal pole) and a structural pathway (the ventral amygdalofugal bundle) through which a cognitively complex form of emotional action regulation might be implemented in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The meaning of a sentence can be understood, whether presented in written or spoken form. Therefore, it is highly probable that brain processes supporting language comprehension are at least partly independent of sensory modality. To identify where and when in the brain language processing is independent of sensory modality, we directly compared neuromagnetic brain signals of 200 human subjects (102 males) either reading or listening to sentences. We used multiset canonical correlation analysis to align individual subject data in a way that boosts those aspects of the signal that are common to all, allowing us to capture word-by-word signal variations, consistent across subjects and at a fine temporal scale. Quantifying this consistency in activation across both reading and listening tasks revealed a mostly left-hemispheric cortical network. Areas showing consistent activity patterns included not only areas previously implicated in higher-level language processing, such as left prefrontal, superior and middle temporal areas, and anterior temporal lobe, but also parts of the control network as well as subcentral and more posterior temporal-parietal areas. Activity in this supramodal sentence-processing network starts in temporal areas and rapidly spreads to the other regions involved. The findings indicate not only the involvement of a large network of brain areas in supramodal language processing but also that the linguistic information contained in the unfolding sentences modulates brain activity in a word-specific manner across subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain can extract meaning from written and spoken messages alike. This requires activity of both brain circuits capable of processing sensory modality-specific aspects of the input signals as well as coordinated brain activity to extract modality-independent meaning from the input. Using traditional methods, it is difficult to disentangle modality-specific activation from modality-independent activation. In this work, we developed and applied a multivariate methodology that allows for a direct quantification of sensory modality-independent brain activity, revealing fast activation of a wide network of brain areas, both including and extending beyond the core network for language.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;To date it is poorly understood how and when deviance processing interacts with awareness and task relevance. Furthermore, an important issue in the study of consciousness is the prevalent confound of conscious perception with the requirement of reporting it. This study addresses these topics using a no-report inattentional blindness paradigm with a visual oddball sequence of geometrical shapes presented to male and female human participants. Electrophysiological responses were obtained in three physically identical Phases A–C that differed only with respect to the instructions: (A) participants were uninformed about the shapes and attended an unrelated foreground task (inattentional blind), (B) were informed about the shapes but still attended the foreground task, and (C) attended the shapes. Conscious processing of shapes was indexed by the visual awareness negativity but not a P3. Deviance processing was associated with the visual mismatch negativity independently of consciousness and task relevance. The oddball P3, however, only emerged when the stimuli were task relevant, and was absent for consciously perceived but task irrelevant stimuli. The P3 thus does not represent a reliable marker of stimulus awareness. This result pattern supports the view of hierarchical predictive processing, where lower levels display automatic deviance processing, whereas higher levels require attention and task relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To react to potentially important changes in our environment it is fundamental to detect deviations from regularities of sensory input. It has yet to be understood how awareness and task relevance of this input interact with deviance processing. We investigated the role of awareness in deviance detection while at the same time circumventing the confound of awareness and report by means of a no-report paradigm. Our results suggest that early processes are elicited automatically, whereas, contrary to prominent theories, late processes do not depend on awareness but on task-based attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;A fundamental feature of sleep is reduced behavioral responsiveness to external events, but the extent of processing along sensory pathways remains poorly understood. While responses are comparable across wakefulness and sleep in auditory cortex (AC), neuronal activity in downstream regions remains unknown. Here we recorded spiking activity in 435 neuronal clusters evoked by acoustic stimuli in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and in AC of freely behaving male rats across wakefulness and sleep. Neuronal responses in AC showed modest (~10%) differences in response gain across vigilance states, replicating previous studies. By contrast, PRC neuronal responses were robustly attenuated by 47% and 36% during NREM sleep and REM sleep, respectively. Beyond the separation according to cortical region, response latency in each neuronal cluster was correlated with the degree of NREM sleep attenuation, such that late (&amp;gt;40 ms) responses in all monitored regions diminished during NREM sleep. The robust attenuation of late responses prevalent in PRC represents a novel neural correlate of sensory disconnection during sleep, opening new avenues for investigating the mediating mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reduced behavioral responsiveness to sensory stimulation is at the core of sleep's definition, but it is still unclear how the sleeping brain responds differently to sensory stimuli. In the current study, we recorded neuronal spiking responses to sounds along the cortical processing hierarchy of rats during wakefulness and natural sleep. Responses in auditory cortex only showed modest changes during sleep, whereas sleep robustly attenuated the responses of neurons in high-level perirhinal cortex. We also found that, during NREM sleep, the response latency predicts the degree of sleep attenuation in individual neurons above and beyond their anatomical location. These results provide anatomical and temporal signatures of sensory disconnection during sleep and pave the way to understanding the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor integration in the cerebellum is essential for refining motor output, and the first stage of this processing occurs in the granule cell layer. Recent evidence suggests that granule cell layer synaptic integration can be contextually modified, although the circuit mechanisms that could mediate such modulation remain largely unknown. Here we investigate the role of ACh in regulating granule cell layer synaptic integration in male rats and mice of both sexes. We find that Golgi cells, interneurons that provide the sole source of inhibition to the granule cell layer, express both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. While acute ACh application can modestly depolarize some Golgi cells, the net effect of longer, optogenetically induced ACh release is to strongly hyperpolarize Golgi cells. Golgi cell hyperpolarization by ACh leads to a significant reduction in both tonic and evoked granule cell synaptic inhibition. ACh also reduces glutamate release from mossy fibers by acting on presynaptic muscarinic receptors. Surprisingly, despite these consistent effects on Golgi cells and mossy fibers, ACh can either increase or decrease the spike probability of granule cells as measured by noninvasive cell-attached recordings. By constructing an integrate-and-fire model of granule cell layer population activity, we find that the direction of spike rate modulation can be accounted for predominately by the initial balance of excitation and inhibition onto individual granule cells. Together, these experiments demonstrate that ACh can modulate population-level granule cell responses by altering the ratios of excitation and inhibition at the first stage of cerebellar processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cerebellum plays a key role in motor control and motor learning. While it is known that behavioral context can modify motor learning, the circuit basis of such modulation has remained unclear. Here we find that a key neuromodulator, ACh, can alter the balance of excitation and inhibition at the first stage of cerebellar processing. These results suggest that ACh could play a key role in altering cerebellar learning by modifying how sensorimotor input is represented at the input layer of the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The neuromodulator dopamine plays a key role in motivation, reward-related learning, and normal motor function. The different affinity of striatal D1 and D2 dopamine receptor types has been argued to constrain the D1 and D2 signaling pathways to phasic and tonic dopamine signals, respectively. However, this view assumes that dopamine receptor kinetics are instantaneous so that the time courses of changes in dopamine concentration and changes in receptor occupation are basically identical. Here we developed a neurochemical model of dopamine receptor binding taking into account the different kinetics and abundance of D1 and D2 receptors in the striatum. Testing a large range of behaviorally-relevant dopamine signals, we found that the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor populations responded very similarly to tonic and phasic dopamine signals. Furthermore, because of slow unbinding rates, both receptor populations integrated dopamine signals over a timescale of minutes. Our model provides a description of how physiological dopamine signals translate into changes in dopamine receptor occupation in the striatum, and explains why dopamine ramps are an effective signal to occupy dopamine receptors. Overall, our model points to the importance of taking into account receptor kinetics for functional considerations of dopamine signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current models of basal ganglia function are often based on a distinction of two types of dopamine receptors, D1 and D2, with low and high affinity, respectively. Thereby, phasic dopamine signals are believed to mostly affect striatal neurons with D1 receptors, and tonic dopamine signals are believed to mostly affect striatal neurons with D2 receptors. This view does not take into account the rates for the binding and unbinding of dopamine to D1 and D2 receptors. By incorporating these kinetics into a computational model we show that D1 and D2 receptors both respond to phasic and tonic dopamine signals. This has implications for the processing of reward-related and motivational signals in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In Parkinson's disease (PD), pathologically high levels of beta activity (12–30 Hz) reflect specific symptomatology and normalize with pharmacological or surgical intervention. Although beta characterization in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) has now been translated into adaptive DBS paradigms, a limited number of studies have characterized beta power in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), an equally effective DBS target. Our objective was to compare beta power in the STN and GPi during rest and movement in people with PD undergoing DBS. Thirty-seven human female and male participants completed a simple behavioral experiment consisting of periods of rest and button presses, leading to local field potential recordings from 19 (15 participants) STN and 26 (22 participants) GPi nuclei. We examined overall beta power as well as beta time-domain dynamics (i.e., beta bursts). We found higher beta power during rest and movement in the GPi, which also had more beta desynchronization during movement. Beta power was positively associated with bradykinesia and rigidity severity; however, these clinical associations were present only in the GPi cohort. With regards to beta dynamics, bursts were similar in duration and frequency in the GPi and STN, but GPi bursts were stronger and correlated to bradykinesia-rigidity severity. Beta dynamics therefore differ across basal ganglia nuclei. Relative to the STN, beta power in the GPi may be readily detected, modulates more with movement, and relates more to clinical impairment. Together, this could point to the GPi as a potentially effective target for beta-based adaptive DBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is known that subthalamic nucleus (STN) beta activity is linked to symptom severity in Parkinson's disease (PD), but few studies have characterized beta activity in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), another effective target for deep brain stimulation (DBS). We compared beta power in the STN and GPi during rest and movement in 37 people with PD undergoing DBS. We found that beta dynamics differed across basal ganglia nuclei. Our results show that, relative to the STN, beta power in the GPi may be readily detected, modulates more with movement, and relates more to clinical impairment. Together, this could point to the GPi as a potentially effective target for beta-based adaptive DBS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Cortical projections to the thalamus arise from corticothalamic (CT) neurons in layer 6 and pyramidal tract-type (PT) neurons in layer 5B. We dissected the excitatory synaptic connections in the somatosensory thalamus formed by CT and PT neurons of the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, focusing on mouse forelimb S1. Mice of both sexes were studied. The CT neurons in S1 synaptically excited S1-projecting thalamocortical (TC) neurons in subregions of both the ventral posterior lateral and posterior (PO) nuclei, forming a pair of recurrent cortico-thalamo-cortical (C-T-C) loops. The PT neurons in S1 also formed a recurrent loop with S1-projecting TC neurons in the same subregion of the PO. The PT neurons in the adjacent primary motor (M1) cortex formed a separate recurrent loop with M1-projecting TC neurons in a nearby subregion of the PO. Collectively, our results reveal that C-T-C circuits of mouse forelimb S1 are primarily organized as multiple cortical cell-type-specific and thalamic subnucleus-specific recurrent loops, with both CT and PT neurons providing the strongest excitatory input to TC neurons that project back to S1. The findings, together with those of related studies of C-T-C circuits, thus suggest that recurrently projecting thalamocortical neurons are the principal targets of cortical excitatory input to the mouse somatosensory and motor thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Bidirectional cortical communication with the thalamus is considered an important aspect of sensorimotor integration for active touch in the somatosensory system, but the cellular organization of the circuits mediating this process is not well understood. We used an approach combining cell-type-specific anterograde optogenetic excitation with single-cell recordings targeted to retrogradely labeled thalamocortical neurons to dissect these circuits. The findings reveal a consistent pattern: cortical projections to the somatosensory thalamus target thalamocortical neurons that project back to the same cortical area. Commonalities of these findings to previous descriptions of related circuits in other areas suggest that cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits may generally be organized primarily as recurrent loops.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The extraordinary diversity of excitatory synapse sizes is commonly attributed to activity-dependent processes that drive synaptic growth and diminution. Recent studies also point to activity-independent size fluctuations, possibly driven by innate synaptic molecule dynamics, as important generators of size diversity. To examine the contributions of activity-dependent and independent processes to excitatory synapse size diversity, we studied glutamatergic synapse size dynamics and diversification in cultured rat cortical neurons (both sexes), silenced from plating. We found that in networks with no history of activity whatsoever, synaptic size diversity was no less extensive than that observed in spontaneously active networks. Synapses in silenced networks were larger, size distributions were broader, yet these were rightward-skewed and similar in shape when scaled by mean synaptic size. Silencing reduced the magnitude of size fluctuations and weakened constraints on size distributions, yet these were sufficient to explain synaptic size diversity in silenced networks. Model-based exploration followed by experimental testing indicated that silencing-associated changes in innate molecular dynamics and fluctuation characteristics might negatively impact synaptic persistence, resulting in reduced synaptic numbers. This, in turn, would increase synaptic molecule availability, promote synaptic enlargement, and ultimately alter fluctuation characteristics. These findings suggest that activity-independent size fluctuations are sufficient to fully diversify glutamatergic synaptic sizes, with activity-dependent processes primarily setting the scale rather than the shape of size distributions. Moreover, they point to reciprocal relationships between synaptic size fluctuations, size distributions, and synaptic numbers mediated by the innate dynamics of synaptic molecules as they move in, out, and between synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sizes of glutamatergic synapses vary tremendously, even when formed on the same neuron. This diversity is commonly thought to reflect the outcome of activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, yet activity-independent processes might also play some part. Here we show that in neurons with no history of activity whatsoever, synaptic sizes are no less diverse. We show that this diversity is the product of activity-independent size fluctuations, which are sufficient to generate a full repertoire of synaptic sizes at correct proportions. By combining modeling and experimentation we expose reciprocal relationships between size fluctuations, synaptic sizes and synaptic counts, and show how these phenomena might be connected through the dynamics of synaptic molecules as they move in, out, and between synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Perturbations to postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GluRs) trigger retrograde signaling to precisely increase presynaptic neurotransmitter release, maintaining stable levels of synaptic strength, a process referred to as homeostatic regulation. However, the structural change of homeostatic regulation remains poorly defined. At wild-type &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction synapse, there is one Bruchpilot (Brp) ring detected by superresolution microscopy at active zones (AZs). In the present study, we report multiple Brp rings (i.e., multiple T-bars seen by electron microscopy) at AZs of both male and female larvae when GluRs are reduced. At &lt;i&gt;GluRIIC&lt;/i&gt;-deficient neuromuscular junctions, quantal size was reduced but quantal content was increased, indicative of homeostatic presynaptic potentiation. Consistently, multiple Brp rings at AZs were observed in the two classic synaptic homeostasis models (i.e., &lt;i&gt;GluRIIA&lt;/i&gt; mutant and pharmacological blockade of GluRIIA activity). Furthermore, postsynaptic overexpression of the cell adhesion protein Neuroligin 1 partially rescued multiple Brp rings phenotype. Our study thus supports that the formation of multiple Brp rings at AZs might be a structural basis for synaptic homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic homeostasis is a conserved fundamental mechanism to maintain efficient neurotransmission of neural networks. Active zones (AZs) are characterized by an electron-dense cytomatrix, which is largely composed of Bruchpilot (Brp) at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction synapses. It is not clear how the structure of AZs changes during homeostatic regulation. To address this question, we examined the structure of AZs by superresolution microscopy and electron microscopy during homeostatic regulation. Our results reveal multiple Brp rings at AZs of glutamate receptor-deficient neuromuscular junction synapses compared with single Brp ring at AZs in wild type (WT). We further show that Neuroligin 1-mediated retrograde signaling regulates multiple Brp ring formation at glutamate receptor-deficient synapses. This study thus reveals a regulatory mechanism for synaptic homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Addictive drugs usurp the brain's intrinsic mechanism for reward, leading to compulsive and destructive behaviors. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the center of the brain's reward circuit, GABAergic neurons control the excitability of dopamine (DA) projection neurons and are the site of initial psychostimulant-dependent changes in signaling. Previous work established that cocaine/methamphetamine exposure increases protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, which dephosphorylates the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 subunit, promotes internalization of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R) and leads to smaller GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-activated G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) currents in VTA GABA neurons. How the actions of PP2A become selective for a particular signaling pathway is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that PP2A can associate directly with a short peptide sequence in the C terminal domain of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R1 subunit, and that GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and PP2A are in close proximity in rodent neurons (mouse/rat; mixed sexes). We show that this PP2A-GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R interaction can be regulated by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, a peptide that potentially reduces recruitment of PP2A to GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and thereby limits receptor dephosphorylation increases the magnitude of baclofen-induced GIRK currents. Thus, limiting PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs may be a useful strategy to increase receptor signaling for treating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dysregulation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) underlies altered neurotransmission in many neurological disorders. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is involved in dephosphorylating and subsequent internalization of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs in models of addiction and depression. Here, we provide new evidence that PP2A B55 regulatory subunit interacts directly with a small region of the C-terminal domain of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R1 subunit, and that this interaction is sensitive to intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. We demonstrate that a short peptide corresponding to the PP2A interaction site on GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R1 competes for PP2A binding, enhances phosphorylation GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 S783, and affects functional signaling through GIRK channels. Our study highlights how targeting PP2A dependent dephosphorylation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs may provide a specific strategy to modulate GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling in disease conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">The Relationship Between Glutamate Dynamics and Activity-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity</title>
		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/14/2793?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The spatiotemporal dynamics of excitatory neurotransmission must be tightly regulated to achieve efficient synaptic communication. By limiting spillover, glutamate transporters are believed to prevent excessive activation of extrasynaptically located receptors that can impair synaptic plasticity. While glutamate transporter expression is reduced in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, the contributions of transporter dysfunction to disease pathophysiology remain ambiguous as the fundamental relationship between glutamate dynamics and plasticity, and the mechanisms linking these two phenomena, remain poorly understood. Here, we combined electrophysiology and real-time high-speed imaging of extracellular glutamate transients during LTP induction and characterized the sensitivity of the relationship between glutamate dynamics during theta burst stimulation (TBS) and the resulting magnitude of LTP consolidation, both in control conditions and following selective and nonselective glutamate transporter blockade. Glutamate clearance times were negatively correlated with LTP magnitude following nonselective glutamate transporter inhibition but not following selective blockade of a majority of GLT-1, the brain's most abundant glutamate transporter. Although glutamate transporter inhibition reduced the postsynaptic population response to TBS, calcium responses to TBS were greatly exaggerated. The source of excess calcium was dependent on NMDARs, L-type VGCCs, GluA2-lacking AMPARs, and internal calcium stores. Surprisingly, inhibition of L-type VGCCs, but not GluA2-lacking AMPARs or ryanodine receptors, was required to restore robust LTP. In all, these data provide a detailed understanding of the relationship between glutamate dynamics and plasticity and uncover important mechanisms by which poor glutamate uptake can negatively impact LTP consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Specific patterns of neural activity can promote long-term changes in the strength of synaptic connections through a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is well accepted to represent the cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory, and many forms of plasticity are initiated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. While essential for rapid cellular communication in the brain, excessive levels of extracellular glutamate can negatively impact brain function. In this study, we demonstrate that pharmacological manipulations that increase the availability of extracellular glutamate during neural activity can have profoundly negative consequences on synaptic plasticity. We identify mechanisms through which excess glutamate can negatively influence synaptic plasticity, and we discuss the relevance of these findings to neurodegenerative diseases and in the aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Early detection remains a significant challenge for the treatment of depression. In our work, we proposed a novel approach to mild depression recognition using electroencephalography (EEG). First, we explored abnormal organization in the functional connectivity network of mild depression using graph theory. Second, we proposed a novel classification model for recognizing mild depression. Considering the powerful ability of CNN to process two-dimensional data, we applied CNN separately to the two-dimensional data form of the functional connectivity matrices from five EEG bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). In addition, inspired by recent breakthroughs in the ability of deep recurrent CNNs to classify mental load, we merged the functional connectivity matrices from the three EEG bands that performed the best into a three-channel image to classify mild depression-related and normal EEG signals using the CNN. The results of the graph theory analysis showed that the brain functional network of the mild depression group had a larger characteristic path length and a lower clustering coefficient than the healthy control group, showing deviation from the small-world network. The proposed classification model obtained a classification accuracy of 80.74% for recognizing mild depression. The current study suggests that the combination of a CNN and functional connectivity matrix may provide a promising objective approach for diagnosing mild depression. Deep learning approaches such as this might have the potential to inform clinical practice and aid in research on psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at high risk of progressing to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial for early treatment of AD. However, it is difficult to predict the cognitive states of patients. This study developed an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based grading method to efficiently fuse multimodal data and predict MCI-to-AD conversion. First, features were extracted from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and useful features were selected using a feature selection method. Second, multiple modalities of MCI subjects, including MRI, positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and gene data, were individually graded using the ELM method. Finally, these grading scores calculated from different modalities were fed into a classifier to discriminate subjects with progressive MCI from those with stable MCI. The proposed approach has been validated on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, and an accuracy of 84.7% was achieved for an AD prediction within 3 years. Experiments on predicting AD conversion from MCI within different periods showed similar results with the 3-year prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach benefits from the efficient fusion of four modalities, resulting in an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 The dorsal raphe nucleus is the predominant source of central serotonin, where neuronal activity regulates complex emotional behaviors. Action potential firing of serotonin dorsal raphe neurons is driven via a1-adrenergic receptors (a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) activation. Despite this crucial role, the ion channels responsible for a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated depolarization are unknown. Here, we show in mouse brain slices that a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission is mediated by the ionotropic glutamate receptor homolog cation channel, delta glutamate receptor 1 (GluD1). GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-channels are constitutively active under basal conditions carrying tonic inward current and synaptic activation of a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;s augments tonic GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-channel current. Further, loss of dorsal raphe GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-channels produces an anxiogenic phenotype. Thus, GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-channels are responsible for a1-A&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent induction of persistent pacemaker-type firing of dorsal raphe neurons and regulate dorsal raphe-related behavior. Given the widespread distribution of these channels, ion channel function of GluD1&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; as a regulator of neuronal excitability is proposed to be widespread in the nervous system.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The choroid, which provides vascular supply to the outer retina, demonstrates progressive degeneration in aging and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However mechanisms that maintain or compromise choroidal homeostasis are obscure. We discovered that the ablation of choroidal macrophages via CSF1R blockade was associated with choroidal vascular atrophy and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) changes including structural disruption, downregulation of visual cycle genes, and altered angiogenic factor expression. Suspending CSF1R blockade following ablation enabled spontaneous macrophage regeneration, which fully restored original macrophage distributions and morphologies. Macrophage regeneration was accompanied by arrested vascular degeneration and ameliorated pathological RPE alterations. These findings suggest that choroidal macrophages play a previously unappreciated trophic role in maintaining choroidal vasculature and RPE cells, implicating insufficiency in choroidal macrophage function as a factor in aging- and AMD-associated pathology. Modulating macrophage function may constitute a strategy for the therapeutic preservation of the choroid and RPE in age-related retinal disorders.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are prevalent across the tree of life and regulate nearly all aspects of cellular functions. The evolutionary basis for their complex and diverse modes of catalytic functions remain enigmatic. Here, based on deep mining of over half million GT-A fold sequences, we define a minimal core component shared among functionally diverse enzymes. We find that variations in the common core and emergence of hypervariable loops extending from the core contributed to GT-A diversity. We provide a phylogenetic framework relating diverse GT-A fold families for the first time and show that inverting and retaining mechanisms emerged multiple times independently during evolution. Using evolutionary information encoded in primary sequences, we trained a machine learning classifier to predict donor specificity with nearly 90% accuracy and deployed it for the annotation of understudied GTs. Our studies provide an evolutionary framework for investigating complex relationships connecting GT-A fold sequence, structure, function and regulation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Coordinated assembly and disassembly of integrin-mediated focal adhesions (FAs) is essential for cell migration. Many studies have shown that FA disassembly requires Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, however our understanding of this process remains incomplete. Here we show that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx via STIM1/Orai1 calcium channels, which cluster near FAs, leads to activation of the GTPase Arf5 via the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated GEF IQSec1, and that both IQSec1 and Arf5 activation are essential for adhesion disassembly. We further show that IQSec1 forms a complex with the lipid transfer protein ORP3, and that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx triggers PKC-dependent translocation of this complex to ER/plasma membrane contact sites adjacent to FAs. In addition to allosterically activating IQSec1, ORP3 also extracts PI4P from the PM, in exchange for phosphatidylcholine. ORP3-mediated lipid exchange is also important for FA turnover. Together, these findings identify a new pathway that links calcium influx to FA turnover during cell migration.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Planar cell polarity (PCP) and neural tube defects (NTDs) are linked, with a subset of NTD patients found to harbour mutations in PCP genes, but there is limited data on whether these mutations disrupt PCP signaling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The core PCP gene &lt;i&gt;Van Gogh&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vang&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Vangl1&lt;/i&gt;/2 in mammals, is the most specific for PCP. We thus addressed potential causality of NTD-associated &lt;i&gt;Vangl1&lt;/i&gt;/2 mutations, from either mouse or human patients, in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; allowing intricate analysis of the PCP pathway. Introducing the respective mammalian mutations into &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Vang&lt;/i&gt; revealed defective phenotypic and functional behaviors, with changes to Vang localization, post-translational modification, and mechanistic function, such as its ability to interact with PCP effectors. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into how different mammalian mutations contribute to developmental disorders and strengthen the link between PCP and NTD. Importantly, analyses of the human mutations revealed that each is a causative factor for the associated NTD.</content>

 Although heterogeneity is recognized within the murine satellite cell pool, a comprehensive understanding of distinct subpopulations and their functional relevance in human satellite cells is lacking. We used a combination of single cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry to identify, distinguish, and physically separate novel subpopulations of human PAX7+ satellite cells (Hu-MuSCs) from normal muscles. We found that, although relatively homogeneous compared to activated satellite cells and committed progenitors, the Hu-MuSC pool contains clusters of transcriptionally distinct cells with consistency across human individuals. New surface marker combinations were enriched in transcriptional subclusters, including a subpopulation of Hu-MuSCs marked by CXCR4/CD29/CD56/CAV1 (CAV1+). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, CAV1+ Hu-MuSCs are morphologically distinct, and characterized by resistance to activation compared to CAV1- Hu-MuSCs. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, CAV1+ Hu-MuSCs demonstrated increased engraftment after transplantation. Our findings provide a comprehensive transcriptional view of normal Hu-MuSCs and describe new heterogeneity, enabling separation of functionally distinct human satellite cell subpopulations.</content>

Protein structure determines biological function. Accurately conceptualizing 3D protein/ligand structures is thus vital to scientific research and education. Virtual reality (VR) enables protein visualization in stereoscopic 3D, but many VR molecular-visualization programs are expensive and challenging to use; work only on specific VR headsets; rely on complicated model-preparation software; and/or require the user to install separate programs or plugins. Here we introduce ProteinVR, a web-based application that works on various VR setups and operating systems. ProteinVR displays molecular structures within 3D environments that give useful biological context and allow users to situate themselves in 3D space. Our web-based implementation is ideal for hypothesis generation and education in research and large-classroom settings. We release ProteinVR under the open-source BSD-3-Clause license. A copy of the program is available free of charge from http://durrantlab.com/protein-vr/, and a working version can be accessed at http://durrantlab.com/pvr/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v_Hjpdfwolo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Spatial analyses of pathogen occurrence in their natural surroundings entail unique opportunities for assessing in vivo drivers of disease epidemiology. Such studies are however confronted by the complexity of the landscape driving epidemic spread and disease persistence. Since relevant information on how the landscape influences epidemiological dynamics is rarely available, simple spatial models of spread are often used. In the current study we demonstrate both how more complex transmission pathways could be incorpoted to epidemiological analyses and how this can offer novel insights into understanding disease spread across the landscape. Our study is focused on &lt;i&gt;Podosphaera plantaginis&lt;/i&gt;, a powdery mildew pathogen that transmits from one host plant to another by wind-dispersed spores. Its host populations often reside next to roads and thus we hypothesize that the road network influences the epidemiology of &lt;i&gt;P. plantaginis&lt;/i&gt;. To analyse the impact of roads on the transmission dynamics, we consider a spatial dataset on the presence-absence records on the pathogen collected from a fragmented landscape of host populations. Using both mechanistic transmission modeling and statistical modeling with road-network summary statistics as predictors, we conclude the evident role of the road network in the progression of the epidemics: a phenomena which is manifested both in the enhanced transmission along the roads and in infections typically occurring at the central hub locations of the road network. We also demonstrate how the road network affects the spread of the pathogen using simulations. Jointly our results highlight how human alteration of natural landscapes may increase disease spread.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4FS5-GTdITw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Icosahedral viral capsids must undergo conformational rearrangements to coordinate essential processes during the viral life cycle. Capturing such conformational flexibility has been technically challenging yet could be key for developing rational therapeutic agents to combat infections. Noroviruses are nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses of global importance to human health. They are a common cause of acute gastroenteritis, yet no vaccines or specific antiviral agents are available. Here, we use genetics and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study the high-resolution solution structures of murine norovirus as a model for human viruses. By comparing our 3 structures (at 2.9- to 3.1-Å resolution), we show that whilst there is little change to the shell domain of the capsid, the radiating protruding domains are flexible, adopting distinct states both independently and synchronously. In doing so, the capsids sample a range of conformational space, with implications for maintaining virion stability and infectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xAeZ9_qOVGY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral data shows that humans and animals have the capacity to learn rules of associations applied to specific examples, and generalize these rules to a broad variety of contexts. This article focuses on neural circuit mechanisms to perform a context‐dependent association task that requires linking sensory stimuli to behavioral responses and generalizing to multiple other symmetrical contexts. The model uses neural gating units that regulate the pattern of physiological connectivity within the circuit. These neural gating units can be used in a learning framework that performs low‐rank matrix factorization analogous to recommender systems, allowing generalization with high accuracy to a wide range of additional symmetrical contexts. The neural gating units are trained with a biologically inspired framework involving traces of Hebbian modification that are updated based on the correct behavioral output of the network. This modeling demonstrates potential neural mechanisms for learning context‐dependent association rules and for the change in selectivity of neurophysiological responses in the hippocampus. The proposed computational model is evaluated using simulations of the learning process and the application of the model to new stimuli. Further, human subject behavioral experiments were performed and the results validate the key observation of a low‐rank synaptic matrix structure linking stimuli to responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid cells provide a compelling example of a link between cellular activity and an abstract and difficult to define concept like space. Accordingly, a &lt;i&gt;representational&lt;/i&gt; perspective on grid coding argues that neural grid coding underlies a fundamentally spatial metric. Recently, some theoretical proposals have suggested extending such a framework to nonspatial cognition as well, such as category learning. Here, we provide a critique of the frequently employed assumption of an isomorphism between patterns of neural activity (e.g., grid cells), mental representation, and behavior (e.g., navigation). Specifically, we question the strict isomorphism between these three levels and suggest that human spatial navigation is perhaps best characterized by a wide variety of both metric and nonmetric strategies. We offer an alternative perspective on how grid coding might relate to human spatial navigation, arguing that grid coding is part of a much larger conglomeration of neural activity patterns that dynamically tune to accomplish specific behavioral outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase precessing place cells encode spatial information on fine timescales via the timing of their spikes. This phase code has been extensively studied on linear tracks and for short runs in the open field. However, less is known about the phase code on unconstrained trajectories lasting tens of minutes, typical of open field foraging. In previous work (Monsalve‐Mercado and Leibold, Physical Review Letters, 119, 38101 (2017)), an analytic expression was derived for the spike‐time cross‐correlation between phase precessing place cells during natural foraging in the open field. This expression makes two predictions on how this phase code differs from the linear track case: cross‐correlations are symmetric with respect to time, and they represent the distance between pairs of place fields in that the theta‐filtered cross‐correlations around zero time lag are positive for cells with nearby fields while they are negative for those with fields further apart. Here we analyze several available open field recordings and show that these predictions hold for pairs of CA1 place cells. We also show that the relationship remains during remapping in CA1, and it is also present in place cells in area CA3. For CA1 place cells of Fmr1‐null mice, which exhibit normal place fields but somewhat weaker temporal coordination with respect to theta compared to wild type, the cross‐correlations still remain symmetric but the relationship to place field overlap is largely lost. The relationship discussed here describes how spatial information is communicated by place cells to downstream areas in a finer theta‐timescale, relevant for learning and memory formation in behavioral tasks lasting tens of minutes in the open field.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby grid cells have been observed to express a remarkable degree of long‐range order, which is often idealized as extending potentially to infinity. Yet their strict periodic firing and ensemble coherence are theoretically possible only in flat environments, much unlike the burrows which rodents usually live in. Are the symmetrical, coherent grid maps inferred in the lab relevant to chart their way in their natural habitat? We consider spheres as simple models of curved environments and waiting for the appropriate experiments to be performed, we use our adaptation model to predict what grid maps would emerge in a network with the same type of recurrent connections, which on the plane produce coherence among the units. We find that on the sphere such connections distort the maps that single grid units would express on their own, and aggregate them into clusters. When remapping to a different spherical environment, units in each cluster maintain only partial coherence, similar to what is observed in disordered materials, such as spin glasses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Spike conduction velocity characteristically differs between myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Here we test whether spikes of myelinated and unmyelinated paths differ in other respects by measuring rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spike duration in the intraretinal, unmyelinated nerve fiber layer and the extraretinal, myelinated optic nerve and optic chiasm. We find that rapid spike firing and illumination broaden spikes in intraretinal axons but not in extraretinal axons. RGC axons thus initiate spikes intraretinally and normalize spike duration extraretinally. Additionally, we analyze spikes that were recorded in a previous study of rhesus macaque retinogeniculate transmission and find that rapid spike firing does not broaden spikes in optic tract. The spike normalization we find reduces the number of spike properties that can change during RGC light responses. However, this is not because identical spikes fire in all axons. Instead, our recordings show that different subtypes of RGC generate axonal spikes of different durations and that the differences resemble spike duration increases that alter neurotransmitter release from other neurons. Moreover, previous studies have shown that RGC spikes of shorter duration can fire at higher maximum frequencies. These properties should facilitate signal transfer by different mechanisms at RGC synapses onto subcortical target neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Taste processing is an essential ability in all animals signaling potential harm or benefit of ingestive behavior. However, current evidence for cortical taste representations remains contradictory. To address this issue, high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis were used to characterize taste-related informational content in human insular cortex, which...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/9yVUbz8utws&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal system contains neural populations that encode an animal's position and velocity as it navigates through space. Here, we show that such populations can embed two codes within their spike trains: a &lt;i&gt;firing rate code&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;) conveyed by within‐cell spike intervals, and a &lt;i&gt;co‐firing rate code&lt;/i&gt; () conveyed by between‐cell spike intervals. These two codes behave as &lt;i&gt;conjugates&lt;/i&gt; of one another, obeying an analog of the uncertainty principle from physics: information conveyed in &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; comes at the expense of information in , and vice versa. An exception to this trade‐off occurs when spike trains encode a pair of conjugate variables, such as position and velocity, which do not compete for capacity across &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and . To illustrate this, we describe two biologically inspired methods for decoding &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and , referred to as &lt;i&gt;sigma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;sigma‐chi&lt;/i&gt; decoding, respectively. Simulations of head direction and grid cells show that if firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity), then position is recovered by sigma decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma‐chi decoding. Conversely, simulations of oscillatory interference among theta‐modulated “speed cells” show that if co‐firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity), then position is recovered by sigma‐chi decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma decoding. Between these two extremes, information about both variables can be distributed across both channels, and partially recovered by both decoders. These results suggest that populations with different spatial and temporal tuning properties—such as speed versus grid cells—might not encode different information, but rather, distribute similar information about position and velocity in different ways across &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and . Such conjugate coding of position and velocity may influence how hippocampal populations are interconnected to form functional circuits, and how biological neurons integrate their inputs to decode information from firing rates and spike correlations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are notoriously variable in their responses, despite the striking hexagonal arrangement of their spatial firing fields. Indeed, when the animal moves through a firing field, grid cells often fire much more vigorously than predicted or do not fire at all. The source of this trial‐to‐trial variability is not completely understood. By analyzing grid‐cell spike trains from mice running in open arenas and on linear tracks, we characterize the phenomenon of “missed” firing fields using the statistical theory of zero inflation. We find that one major cause of grid‐cell variability lies in the spatial representation itself: firing fields are not as strongly anchored to spatial location as the averaged grid suggests. In addition, grid fields from different cells drift together from trial to trial, regardless of whether the environment is real or virtual, or whether the animal moves in light or darkness. Spatial realignment across trials sharpens the grid representation, yielding firing fields that are more pronounced and significantly narrower. These findings indicate that ensembles of grid cells encode relative position more reliably than absolute position.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theory and model of spatial coordinate transforms in the dorsal visual system through the parietal cortex that enable an interface via posterior cingulate and related retrosplenial cortex to allocentric spatial representations in the primate hippocampus is described. First, a new approach to coordinate transform learning in the brain is proposed, in which the traditional gain modulation is complemented by temporal trace rule competitive network learning. It is shown in a computational model that the new approach works much more precisely than gain modulation alone, by enabling neurons to represent the different combinations of signal and gain modulator more accurately. This understanding may have application to many brain areas where coordinate transforms are learned. Second, a set of coordinate transforms is proposed for the dorsal visual system/parietal areas that enables a representation to be formed in allocentric spatial view coordinates. The input stimulus is merely a stimulus at a given position in retinal space, and the gain modulation signals needed are eye position, head direction, and place, all of which are present in the primate brain. Neurons that encode the bearing to a landmark are involved in the coordinate transforms. Part of the importance here is that the coordinates of the allocentric view produced in this model are the same as those of spatial view cells that respond to allocentric view recorded in the primate hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. The result is that information from the dorsal visual system can be used to update the spatial input to the hippocampus in the appropriate allocentric coordinate frame, including providing for idiothetic update to allow for self‐motion. It is further shown how hippocampal spatial view cells could be useful for the transform from hippocampal allocentric coordinates to egocentric coordinates useful for actions in space and for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cellular and synaptic architecture of the rodent hippocampus has been described in thousands of peer‐reviewed publications. However, no human‐ or machine‐readable public catalog of synaptic electrophysiology data exists for this or any other neural system. Harnessing state‐of‐the‐art information technology, we have developed a cloud‐based toolset for identifying empirical evidence from the scientific literature pertaining to synaptic electrophysiology, for extracting the experimental data of interest, and for linking each entry to relevant text or figure excerpts. Mining more than 1,200 published journal articles, we have identified eight different signal modalities quantified by 90 different methods to measure synaptic amplitude, kinetics, and plasticity in hippocampal neurons. We have designed a data structure that both reflects the differences and maintains the existing relations among experimental modalities. Moreover, we mapped every annotated experiment to identified potential connections, that is, specific pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron types. To this aim, we leveraged &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt;, an open‐access knowledge base of morphologically, electrophysiologically, and molecularly characterized neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. Specifically, we have implemented a computational pipeline to systematically translate neuron type properties into formal queries in order to find all compatible potential connections. With this system, we have collected nearly 40,000 synaptic data entities covering 88% of the 3,120 potential connections in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt;. Correcting membrane potentials with respect to liquid junction potentials significantly reduced the difference between theoretical and experimental reversal potentials, thereby enabling the accurate conversion of all synaptic amplitudes to conductance. This data set allows for large‐scale hypothesis testing of the general rules governing synaptic signals. To illustrate these applications, we confirmed several expected correlations between synaptic measurements and their covariates while suggesting previously unreported ones. We release all data open‐source at &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt; in order to further research across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Multiple human autism risk genes are predicted to converge on the β-catenin (β-cat)/Wnt pathway. However, direct tests to link β-cat up- or down-regulation with autism are largely lacking, and the associated pathophysiological changes are poorly defined. Here we identify excessive β-cat as a risk factor that causes expression changes in several genes relevant to human autism. Our studies utilize mouse lines with β-cat dysregulation in forebrain excitatory neurons, identified as cell types with a convergent expression of autism-linked genes in both human and mouse brains. We show that mice expressing excessive β-cat display behavioral and molecular changes, including decreased social interest, increased repetitive behaviors, reduced parvalbumin and altered expression levels of additional genes identified as potential risk factors for human autism. These behavioral and molecular phenotypes are averted by reducing β-cat in neurons predisposed by gene mutations to express elevated β-cat. Using next-generation sequencing of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), we identify 87 dysregulated genes that are shared between mouse lines with excessive β-cat and autism-like behaviors, but not mouse lines with reduced β-cat and normal social behavior. Our findings provide critical new insights into β-cat, Wnt pathway dysregulation in the brain causing behavioral phenotypes relevant to the disease and the molecular etiology which includes several human autism risk genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The two hemispheres of the vertebrate brain are connected through several commissures. Although the anterior commissure (AC) is the most conserved white matter structure in the brains of different vertebrates, its complete physiological functionality remains elusive. Since the AC is involved in the connection between two amygdalae and because amygdalae are critical for emotional behaviors and social interaction, we assessed amygdalar activity and function to investigate the physiological role of the AC. We first performed ex vivo electrophysiological recording on mouse brains to demonstrate that the AC delivers a positive signal to facilitate synaptic responses and to recruit basolateral amygdalar neurons via glutamatergic synapses. Transection was then undertaken to investigate the role of the AC in vivo. Results from in vivo optogenetic stimulation suggest that AC transection impairs mutual activation between two basolateral amygdalae. Behavioral analyses were then used to assess if AC surgical lesioning results in hyperactivity, anxiety, social reduction or learning/memory impairment, which are behavioral features associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders. We found that AC transection results in higher locomotor activity, aberrant social interaction and reduced associative memory, but not anxiety. Moreover, systemic administration of D-cycloserine, a coagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, ameliorated auditory fear memory in AC-transected mice, reinforcing our evidence that the AC potentiates the activity of basolateral amygdalae. Our study suggests that the AC regulates basolateral amygdalar activity and influences neuropsychiatry-related behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cellular communication processes are highly dynamic and mediated, at least in part, by contacts between various membrane structures. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the major biosynthetic organelle of the cell, establishes an extensive network with other membrane structures to regulate the transport of intracellular molecules. Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), an ER-localized metazoan-specific protein, plays important roles in the formation of autophagosomes and communication between the ER and other organelles, including mitochondria, autophagosome precursor membranes, Golgi, lipid droplets, and endosomes. Increasing evidence has indicated that autophagy and ER–membrane communication at membrane contact sites are closely related to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we summarize the roles of VMP1 in autophagy and ER–membrane contacts and discuss their potential implications in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: The neuromuscular mechanisms leading to impaired motor performance in the presence of mental fatigue remain unclear. It is also unknown if mental fatigue differentially impacts motor performance in males and females. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of mental fatigue on force production and motor unit (MU) firing behavior in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Nineteen participants performed 10-s isometric dorsiflexion (DF) contractions at 20 and 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) before, during, and after completing 22 min of the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), to induce mental fatigue. The DF force and indwelling MU firing behavior of the tibialis anterior (TA) was measured before and immediately following the PVT and within the first and final minutes of the PVT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Force steadiness and motor unit firing rate (MUFR) variability did not change during or following the PVT at either contraction intensity (p ≥ 0.16). Overall, females had more variability than males in MUFR during the 20% MVCs (15.98 ± 2.19 vs. 13.64 ± 2.19%, p = 0.03), though no sex differences were identified during the 50% MVCs (p = 0.20). Mean MUFR decreased following mental fatigue in both sexes in the 20% MVC condition (14.79 ± 3.20 vs. 12.92 ± 2.53 Hz, p = 0.02), but only in males during the 50% MVC condition (18.65 ± 5.21 vs. 15.03 ± 2.60 Hz, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These results suggest possible sex and contraction intensity-specific neuromuscular changes in the presence of mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Progressive accumulation of the pre-synaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn) has been strongly associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders of the aging population such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy. While the precise mechanisms are not fully understood, alterations in kinase pathways including that of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 have been proposed to play a role. In AD, p38α activation has been linked to neuro-inflammation while alterations in p38γ have been associated with tau phosphorylation. Although p38 has been studied in AD, less is known about its role in DLB/PD and other α-synucleinopathies. For this purpose, we investigated the expression of the p38 family in brains from α-syn overexpressing transgenic mice (α-syn Tg: Line 61) and patients with DLB/PD. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in healthy human controls and non-Tg mice, p38α associated with neurons and astroglial cells and p38γ localized to pre-synaptic terminals. In DLB and α-syn Tg brains, however, p38α levels were increased in astroglial cells while p38γ immunostaining was redistributed from the synaptic terminals to the neuronal cell bodies. Double immunolabeling further showed that p38γ colocalized with α-syn aggregates in DLB patients, and immunoblot and qPCR analysis confirmed the increased levels of p38α and p38γ. α1-syntrophin, a synaptic target of p38γ, was present in the neuropil and some neuronal cell bodies in human controls and non-Tg mice. In DLB and and Tg mice, however, α1-syntrophin was decreased in the neuropil and instead colocalized with α-syn in intra-neuronal inclusions. In agreement with these findings, in vitro studies showed that α-syn co-immunoprecipitates with p38γ, but not p38α. These results suggest that α-syn might interfere with the p38γ pathway and play a role in the mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in DLB/PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;MR Tractography enables non-invasive preoperative depiction of language subcortical tracts, which is crucial for the presurgical work-up of brain tumors; however, it cannot evaluate the exact function of the fibers.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;A systematic pipeline was developed to combine tractography reconstruction of language fiber bundles, based on anatomical landmarks (Anatomical-T), with language fMRI cortical activations. A fMRI-targeted Tractography (fMRI-T) was thus obtained, depicting the subsets of the anatomical tracts whose endpoints are located inside a fMRI activation. We hypothesized that fMRI-T could provide additional functional information regarding the subcortical structures, better reflecting the eloquent white matter structures identified intraoperatively.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Both Anatomical-T and fMRI-T of language fiber tracts were performed on 16 controls and preoperatively on 16 patients with left-hemisphere brain tumors, using a q-ball residual bootstrap algorithm based on High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) datasets (b = 3000 s/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 60 directions); fMRI ROIs were obtained using picture naming, verbal fluency, and auditory verb generation tasks. In healthy controls, normalized MNI atlases of fMRI-T and Anatomical-T were obtained. In patients, the surgical resection of the tumor was pursued by identifying eloquent structures with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation mapping and extending surgery to the functional boundaries. Post-surgical MRI allowed to identify Anatomical-T and fMRI-T non-eloquent portions removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;MNI Atlases showed that fMRI-T is a subset of Anatomical-T, and that different task-specific fMRI-T involve both shared subsets and task-specific subsets – e.g., verbal fluency fMRI-T strongly involves dorsal frontal tracts, consistently with the phonogical-articulatory features of this task. A quantitative analysis in patients revealed that Anatomical-T removed portions of AF-SLF and IFOF were significantly greater than verbal fluency fMRI-T ones, suggesting that fMRI-T is a more specific approach. In addition, qualitative analyses showed that fMRI-T AF-SLF and IFOF predict the exact functional limits of resection with increased specificity when compared to Anatomical-T counterparts, especially the superior frontal portion of IFOF, in a subcohort of patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that performing fMRI-T in addition to the ‘classic’ Anatomical-T may be useful in a preoperative setting to identify the ‘high-risk subsets’ that should be spared during the surgical procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a widely used algorithm used to depict the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). Wavelet transform (WT) is more effective in representing the complex waveform due to its adaptivity to non-stationary or local features of data and many varieties of wavelet functions with different shapes being available. However, there is a paucity of RS-fMRI studies that systematically compare between the results of FFT versus WT. The present study employed five cohorts of datasets and compared the sensitivity and reproducibility of FFT-ALFF with those of Wavelet-ALFF based on five mother wavelets (namely, db2, bior4.4, morl, meyr, and sym3). In addition to the conventional frequency band of 0.0117–0.0781 Hz, a comparison was performed in sub-bands, namely, Slow-6 (0–0.0117 Hz), Slow-5 (0.0117–0.0273 Hz), Slow-4 (0.0273–0.0742 Hz), Slow-3 (0.0742–0.1992 Hz), and Slow-2 (0.1992–0.25 Hz). The results indicated that the Wavelet-ALFF of all five mother wavelets was generally more sensitive and reproducible than FFT-ALFF in all frequency bands. Specifically, in the higher frequency band Slow-2 (0.1992–0.25 Hz), the mean sensitivity of db2-ALFF results was 1.54 times that of FFT-ALFF, and the reproducibility of db2-ALFF results was 2.95 times that of FFT-ALFF. The findings suggest that wavelet-ALFF can replace FFT-ALFF, especially in the higher frequency band. Future studies should test more mother wavelets on other RS-fMRI metrics and multiple datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are a prominent class of neurological diseases currently without a cure. They are characterized by an inexorable loss of a specific type of neurons. The selective vulnerability of specific neuronal clusters (typically a subcortical cluster) in the early stages, followed by the spread of the disease to higher cortical areas, is a typical pattern of disease progression. Neurodegenerative diseases share a range of molecular and cellular pathologies, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate toxicity, calcium load, proteolytic stress, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and aging, which contribute to neuronal death. Efforts to treat these diseases are often limited by the fact that they tend to address any one of the above pathological changes while ignoring others. Lack of clarity regarding a possible root cause that underlies all the above pathologies poses a significant challenge. In search of an integrative theory for neurodegenerative pathology, we hypothesize that metabolic deficiency in certain vulnerable neuronal clusters is the common underlying thread that links many dimensions of the disease. The current review aims to present an outline of such an integrative theory. We present a new perspective of neurodegenerative diseases as metabolic disorders at molecular, cellular, and systems levels. This helps to understand a common underlying mechanism of the many facets of the disease and may lead to more promising disease-modifying therapeutic interventions. Here, we briefly discuss the selective metabolic vulnerability of specific neuronal clusters and also the involvement of glia and vascular dysfunctions. Any failure in satisfaction of the metabolic demand by the neurons triggers a chain of events that precipitate various manifestations of neurodegenerative pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The development of new technologies, and more specifically the opportunity to immerse participants in virtual controlled environments, provides a new ecological framework for researchers to study complex behaviors. This experiment aimed to compare post-immersion craving in occasional and heavy alcohol drinkers. Twenty-two occasional drinkers and eighteen heavy drinkers were recruited and immersed in a virtual bar, including alcoholic beverages. After the exposure, heavy drinkers reported a significantly higher craving than occasional drinkers. Post-immersion alcohol craving was significantly related to the levels of perceived ecological validity of the virtual environment. Finally, a moderation analysis suggested that the levels of craving more strongly increased with perceived ecological validity in heavy drinkers than in occasional drinkers. Therefore, the perceived ecological validity was an important experimental parameter to study craving in a virtual environment. These results further suggested that virtual reality might be a useful tool for both the scientific study of alcohol addiction and the treatment of alcohol dependence and relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The goal of the present study was to investigate spatial memory in a group of patients with amnesia due to Korsakoff’s syndrome (KS). We used a virtual spatial memory task that allowed us to separate the use of egocentric and allocentric spatial reference frames to determine object locations. Research investigating the ability of patients with Korsakoff’s amnesia to use different reference frames is scarce and it remains unclear whether these patients are impaired in using ego- and allocentric reference frames to the same extent. Twenty Korsakoff patients and 24 matched controls watched an animation of a bird flying in one of three trees standing in a virtual environment. After the bird disappeared, the camera turned around, by which the trees were briefly out of sight and then turned back to the center of the environment. Participants were asked in which tree the bird was hiding. In half of the trials, a landmark was shown. Half of the trials required an immediate response whereas in the other half a delay of 10 s was present. Patients performed significantly worse than controls. For all participants trials with a landmark were easier than without a landmark and trials without a delay were easier than with a delay. While controls were above chance on all trials patients were at chance in allocentric trials without a landmark present and with a memory delay. Patients showed no difference in the ego- and the allocentric condition. Together the findings suggest that despite the amnesia, spatial memory and especially the use of ego- and allocentric reference frames in Korsakoff patients are spared.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Top-down attention towards nociceptive stimuli can be modulated by asking participants to pay attention to specific features of a stimulus, or to provide a rating about its intensity/unpleasantness. Whether and how these different top-down processes may lead to different modulations of the cortical response to nociceptive stimuli remains an open question. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to brief nociceptive laser stimuli in 24 healthy participants while they performed a task in which they had to compare two subsequent stimuli on their Spatial location (Location task) or Intensity (Intensity Task). In two additional blocks (Location + Ratings, and Intensity + Ratings) participants had to further provide a rating of the perceived intensity of the stimulus. Such a design allowed us to investigate whether focusing on spatial or intensity features of a nociceptive stimulus and rating its intensity would exert different effects on the EEG responses. We did not find statistical evidence for an effect on the signal while participants were focusing on different features of the signal. We only observed a significant cluster difference in frontoparietal leads at approximately 300–500 ms post-stimulus between the magnitude of the signal in the Intensity and Intensity + Rating conditions, with a less negative response in the Intensity + Rating condition in frontal electrodes, and a less positive amplitude in parietal leads. We speculatively propose that activity in those electrodes and time window reflects magnitude estimation processes. Moreover, the smaller frontal amplitude in the Intensity + Rating condition can be explained by greater working memory engagement known to reduce the magnitude of the EEG signal. We conclude that different top-down attentional processes modulate responses to nociceptive laser stimuli at different electrodes and time windows depending on the underlying processes that are engaged.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Planning ability is fundamental for goal-directed spatial navigation. Preliminary findings from patients and healthy individuals suggest that travel planning (TP)—namely, navigational planning—can be considered a distinct process from visuospatial planning (VP) ability. To shed light on this distinction, two right brain-damaged patients without hemineglect were compared with a control group on two tasks aimed at testing VP (i.e., Tower of London-16, ToL-16) and TP (i.e., Minefield Task, MFT). The former requires planning the moves to reach the right configuration of three colored beads on three pegs, whereas the latter was opportunely developed to assess TP in the navigational environment when obstacles are present. Specifically, the MFT requires participants to plan a route on a large carpet avoiding some hidden obstacles previously observed. Patient 1 showed lesions encompassing the temporoparietal region and the insula; she performed poorer than the control group on the ToL-16 but showed no deficit on the MFT. Conversely, Patient 2 showed lesions mainly located in the occipitoparietal network of spatial navigation; she performed worse than the control group on the MFT but not on the ToL-16. In both cases performances satisfied the criteria for a classical dissociation, meeting criteria for a double dissociation. These results support the idea that TP is a distinct ability and that it is dissociated from VP skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Most cochlear implant (CI) users have difficulty in listening tasks that rely strongly on perception of frequency changes (e.g., speech perception in noise, musical melody perception, etc.). Some previous studies using behavioral or subjective assessments have shown that short-term music training can benefit CI users’ perception of music and speech. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings may reveal the neural basis for music training benefits in CI users.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine the effects of short-term music training on CI hearing outcomes using a comprehensive test battery of subjective evaluation, behavioral tests, and EEG measures.&lt;/p&gt;Design&lt;p&gt;Twelve adult CI users were recruited for a home-based music training program that focused on attentive listening to music genres and materials that have an emphasis on melody. The participants used a music streaming program (i.e., Pandora) downloaded onto personal electronic devices for training. The participants attentively listened to music through a direct audio cable or through Bluetooth streaming. The training schedule was 40 min/session/day, 5 days/week, for either 4 or 8 weeks. The pre-training and post-training tests included: hearing thresholds, Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ12) questionnaire, psychoacoustic tests of frequency change detection threshold (FCDT), speech recognition tests (CNC words, AzBio sentences, and QuickSIN), and EEG responses to tones that contained different magnitudes of frequency changes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;All participants except one finished the 4- or 8-week training, resulting in a dropout rate of 8.33%. Eleven participants performed all tests except for two who did not participate in EEG tests. Results showed a significant improvement in the FCDTs as well as performance on CNC and QuickSIN after training (p &amp;lt; 0.05), but no significant improvement in SSQ scores (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Results of the EEG tests showed larger post-training cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) in seven of the nine participants, suggesting a better cortical processing of both stimulus onset and within-stimulus frequency changes.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These preliminary data suggest that extensive, focused music listening can improve frequency perception and speech perception in CI users. Further studies that include a larger sample size and control groups are warranted to determine the efficacy of short-term music training in CI users.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Environment learning is essential in everyday life. In individuals with Down syndrome (DS), this skill has begun to be examined using virtual exploration. Previous studies showed that individuals with DS can learn and remember paths in terms of sequences of turns and straight stretches, albeit with some difficulty, and this learning is supported by their cognitive abilities. This study further investigates environment learning in the DS population, newly examining their ability to learn a path from actual movements, and to learn increasingly long paths, and how their performance relates to their visuo-spatial abilities and everyday spatial activities. A group of 30 individuals with DS and 30 typically-developing (TD) children matched for receptive vocabulary performed a 4 × 4 Floor Matrix task in a grid comprising 16 squares (total area 2.3 × 2.3 meters). The task involved repeating increasingly long sequences of steps by actually moving in the grid. The sequences were presented in two learning conditions, called Observation (when participants watched the experimenter’s moves), or Map (when they were shown a map reproducing the path). Several visuo-spatial measures were also administered. The results showed a clear difference between the two groups’ performance in the individual visuo-spatial measures. In the Floor Matrix task, after controlling for visuo-spatial reasoning ability, both groups benefited to the same degree from the Observation condition vis-à-vis the Map condition, and no group differences emerged. In the group with DS, visuo-spatial abilities were more predictive of performance in the Floor Matrix task in the Observation condition than in the Map condition. The same was true of the TD group, but this difference was much less clear-cut. The visuo-spatial working memory and visualization tasks were the strongest predictors of Floor Matrix task performance. Finally, the group with DS showed a significant relation between Floor Matrix task performance in the Observation condition and everyday spatial activity. These results enlarge on what we know about path learning in individuals with DS and its relation to their visuo-spatial abilities. These findings are discussed within the frame of spatial cognition and the atypical development domain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The use of head-mounted displays (HMD) for virtual reality (VR) application-based purposes including therapy, rehabilitation, and training is increasing. Despite advancements in VR technologies, many users still experience sickness symptoms. VR sickness may be influenced by technological differences within HMDs such as resolution and refresh rate, however, VR content also plays a significant role. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the literature on HMDs that report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores to determine the impact of content. User factors associated with VR sickness were also examined. A systematic search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 3,016 participants (mean age range 19.5–80; 41% female). Findings show gaming content recorded the highest total SSQ mean 34.26 (95%CI 29.57–38.95). VR sickness profiles were also influenced by visual stimulation, locomotion and exposure times. Older samples (mean age ≥35 years) scored significantly lower total SSQ means than younger samples, however, these findings are based on a small evidence base as a limited number of studies included older users. No sex differences were found. Across all types of content, the pooled total SSQ mean was relatively high 28.00 (95%CI 24.66–31.35) compared with recommended SSQ cut-off scores. These findings are of relevance for informing future research and the application of VR in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Attributing mental states to others in social interactions [Theory of Mind (ToM)] often depends on visual social cues like eye gaze or mimic. This study presents an event-related potentials task (Brainy-ERP) that was developed in order to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of first-, second-, and third-order cognitive and affective ToM processing. The task was based on social visual cues and involved electroencephalographic event-related potential (ERP) analyses and exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography analyses (eLORETA) source localization analyses. Results showed that in cognitive and affective conditions, first-order trials elicited greater Anterior P2 (180–370 ms) amplitudes. In the cognitive condition, third-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in the broadly distributed early negative slow wave (eNSW, 260–470 ms) and the late NSW (LNSW, 460–1,000 ms). In the affective condition, third-order and second-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in a broadly distributed NSW (250–1,000 ms). Regarding affective trials in the NSW time span, statistical significant differences and trends were shown regarding activation of underlying brain regions. Third-order trials elicited greatest activation in a number of regions typically associated with the ToM network, especially the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), cuneus, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Furthermore, ToM low performers (participants with high accuracy but longer reaction times) showed by trend smaller Posterior N1 and significantly smaller eNSW amplitudes compared to average and high performers. This study offers new insights into electrophysiological correlates of basic and higher order cognitive and affective ToM processing and its precise time course.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objective: In brain machine interfaces (BMIs), the functional mapping between neural activities and kinematic parameters varied over time owing to changes in neural recording conditions. The variability in neural recording conditions might result in unstable long-term decoding performance. Relevant studies trained decoders with several days of training data to make them inherently robust to changes in neural recording conditions. However, these decoders might not be robust to changes in neural recording conditions when only a few days of training data are available. In time-series prediction and feedback control system, an error feedback was commonly adopted to reduce the effects of model uncertainty. This motivated us to introduce an error feedback to a neural decoder for dealing with the variability in neural recording conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approach: We proposed an evolutionary constructive and pruning neural network with error feedback (ECPNN-EF) as a neural decoder. The ECPNN-EF with partially connected topology decoded the instantaneous firing rates of each sorted unit into forelimb movement of a rat. Furthermore, an error feedback was adopted as an additional input to provide kinematic information and thus compensate for changes in functional mapping. The proposed neural decoder was trained on data collected from a water reward-related lever-pressing task for a rat. The first 2 days of data were used to train the decoder, and the subsequent 10 days of data were used to test the decoder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main Results: The ECPNN-EF under different settings was evaluated to better understand the impact of the error feedback and partially connected topology. The experimental results demonstrated that the ECPNN-EF achieved significantly higher daily decoding performance with smaller daily variability when using the error feedback and partially connected topology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: These results suggested that the ECPNN-EF with partially connected topology could cope with both within- and across-day changes in neural recording conditions. The error feedback in the ECPNN-EF compensated for decreases in decoding performance when neural recording conditions changed. This mechanism made the ECPNN-EF robust against changes in functional mappings and thus improved the long-term decoding stability when only a few days of training data were available.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In the neocortex, neuronal processing of sensory events is significantly influenced by context. For instance, responses in sensory cortices are suppressed to repetitive or redundant stimuli, a phenomenon termed “stimulus-specific adaptation” (SSA). However, in a context in which that same stimulus is novel, or deviates from expectations, neuronal responses are augmented. This augmentation is termed “deviance detection” (DD). This contextual modulation of neural responses is fundamental for how the brain efficiently processes the sensory world to guide immediate and future behaviors. Notably, context modulation is deficient in some neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ), as quantified by reduced “mismatch negativity” (MMN), an electroencephalography waveform reflecting a combination of SSA and DD in sensory cortex. Although the role of NMDA-receptor function and other neuromodulatory systems on MMN is established, the precise microcircuit mechanisms of MMN and its underlying components, SSA and DD, remain unknown. When coupled with animal models, the development of powerful precision neurotechnologies over the past decade carries significant promise for making new progress into understanding the neurobiology of MMN with previously unreachable spatial resolution. Currently, rodent models represent the best tool for mechanistic study due to the vast genetic tools available. While quantifying human-like MMN waveforms in rodents is not straightforward, the “oddball” paradigms used to study it in humans and its underlying subcomponents (SSA/DD) are highly translatable across species. Here we summarize efforts published so far, with a focus on cortically measured SSA and DD in animals to maintain relevance to the classically measured MMN, which has cortical origins. While mechanistic studies that measure and contrast both components are sparse, we synthesize a potential set of microcircuit mechanisms from the existing rodent, primate, and human literature. While MMN and its subcomponents likely reflect several mechanisms across multiple brain regions, understanding fundamental microcircuit mechanisms is an important step to understand MMN as a whole. We hypothesize that SSA reflects adaptations occurring at synapses along the sensory-thalamocortical pathways, while DD depends on both SSA inherited from afferent inputs and resulting disinhibition of non-adapted neurons arising from the distinct physiology and wiring properties of local interneuronal subpopulations and NMDA-receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether the CSF-contacting nucleus receives brainstem and spinal cord projections and to understand the functional significance of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CB) was injected into the CSF-contacting nucleus in Sprague-Dawley rats according the previously reported stereotaxic coordinates. After 7–10 days, these rats were perfused and their brainstem and spinal cord were sliced (thickness, 40 μm) using a freezing microtome. All the sections were subjected to CB immunofluorescence staining. The distribution of CB-positive neuron in different brainstem and spinal cord areas was observed under fluorescence microscope.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The retrograde labeled CB-positive neurons were found in the midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Four functional areas including one hundred and twelve sub-regions have projections to the CSF-contacting nucleus. However, the density of CB-positive neuron distribution ranged from sparse to dense.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Based on the connectivity patterns of the CSF-contacting nucleus receives anatomical inputs from the brainstem and spinal cord, we preliminarily conclude and summarize that the CSF-contacting nucleus participates in pain, visceral activity, sleep and arousal, emotion, and drug addiction. The present study firstly illustrates the broad projections of the CSF-contacting nucleus from the brainstem and spinal cord, which implies the complicated functions of the nucleus especially for the unique roles of coordination in neural and body fluids regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Gut peptide hormones are one group of secretory factors produced from gastrointestinal endocrine cells with potent functions in modulating digestive functions. In recent decades, they have been found across different brain regions, many of which are involved in autism-related social, emotional and cognitive deficits. Clinical studies have revealed possible correlation between those hormones and autism spectrum disorder pathogenesis. In animal models, gut peptide hormones modulate neurodevelopment, synaptic transmission and neural plasticity, explaining their behavioral relevance. This review article will summarize major findings from both clinical and basic research showing the role of gut peptide hormones in mediating autism-related neurological functions, and their potential implications in autism pathogenesis. The pharmaceutical value of gut hormones in alleviating autism-associated behavioral syndromes will be discussed to provide new insights for future drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) plays a critical role in neuronal function related to development and degeneration. Here, we investigated whether autophagy is developmentally regulated in the striatum, a brain region implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. We demonstrate that autophagic flux is suppressed during striatal postnatal development, reaching adult levels around postnatal day 28 (P28). We also find that mTOR signaling, a key regulator of autophagy, increases during the same developmental period. We further show that mTOR signaling is responsible for suppressing autophagy, via regulation of Beclin-1 and VPS34 activity. Finally, we discover that autophagy is downregulated during late striatal postnatal development (P28) in mice with in utero exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an established mouse model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). VPA-exposed mice also display deficits in striatal neurotransmission and social behavior. Correction of hyperactive mTOR signaling in VPA-exposed mice restores social behavior. These results demonstrate that neurons coopt metabolic signaling cascades to developmentally regulate autophagy and provide additional evidence that mTOR-dependent signaling pathways represent pathogenic signaling cascades in ASD mouse models that are active during specific postnatal windows.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Microglia are constantly surveying their microenvironment and rapidly react to impairments by changing their morphology, migrating toward stimuli and adopting gene expression profiles characterizing their activated state. The increased expression of the M2-like marker Mannose receptor 1 (Mrc1), which is also referred to as CD206, in microglia has been reported after M2-like activation in vitro and in vivo. Mrc1 is a 175-kDa transmembrane pattern recognition receptor which binds a variety of carbohydrates and is involved in the pinocytosis and the phagocytosis of immune cells, including microglia, and thought to contribute to a neuroprotective microglial phenotype. Here we analyzed the effects of TGFβ signaling on Mrc1 expression in microglia in vivo and in vitro. Using C57BL/6 wild type and Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2&lt;/sup&gt;:R26-YFP:Tgfbr2&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice-derived microglia, we show that the silencing of TGFβ signaling results in the upregulation of Mrc1, whereas recombinant TGFβ1 induced the delayed downregulation of Mrc1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments provided evidence that Mrc1 is not a direct Smad2/Smad4 target gene in microglia. Altogether our data indicate that the changes in Mrc1 expression after the activation or the silencing of microglial TGFβ signaling are likely to be mediated by modifications of the secondary intracellular signaling events influenced by TGFβ signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Aim&lt;p&gt;To investigate the role of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) deacetylation activity in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin 3 domain (NLRP3) inflammatory response and explore the effects of pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 with tubastatin A (TBA) on dopaminergic injury.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Using 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson’s disease (PD) models, we examined the effects of TBA on NLRP3 activation and cell injury in SH-SY5Y cells. We also investigated the effects of TBA on NLRP3 inflammatory responses and dopaminergic injury in the nigrostriatal system in mice and analyzed the acetylation levels of peroxiredoxin2 (Prx2) and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;TBA inhibited 6-OHDA-induced NLRP3 activation, as demonstrated by decreased expressions of NLRP3 and matured caspase-1 and IL-1β, and also alleviated glial proliferation and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Notably, TBA recovered acetylation levels of Prx2 and reduced oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 with TBA attenuates NLRP3 inflammation and protects dopaminergic neurons, probably through Prx2 acetylation. This study suggests that the deacetylase catalytic domain of HDAC6 is a potential target for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Hyperlipidemia has been proposed as a risk factor of dementia and cognitive decline. However, the findings of the relationship between cholesterol level and cognitive/brain function have been inconsistent. Here, using a well-controlled sample from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), we investigated the probable non-linear relationship between plasma total cholesterol (TC) level, gray matter volume (GMv), and cognitive performance in 117 non-demented subjects (mean age, 61.5 ± 8.9 years), including 67 Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and 50 demographically matched controls. A quadratic relationship between semantic fluency (SF) performance and TC levels was identified. Within the subjects with a desirable TC level (TC &amp;lt; 200 mg/dl), low TC (lTC) levels were associated with reduced SF performance, as well as reduced GMv in three medial temporal regions [including bilateral anterior hippocampus (HIP)]. In contrast, no significant relationship between TC and cognition performance/GMv was found in individuals with a high cholesterol level (i.e., TC ≥ 200 mg/dl). Further region of interest (ROI)-based analysis showed that individuals with TC levels ranging from 100 to 160 mg/dl had the lowest GMv in the medial temporal regions. These findings suggest that low-normal TC level may be associated with reduced cognitive function and brain atrophy in regions implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, adding to a growing body of literature supporting a probable non-linear relationship between cholesterol level and brain health. However, this finding needs to be verified with other large public cohort data that do not include PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a harsh reminder of the fact that, whether in a single human host or a wave of infection across continents, viral dynamics is often a story about the numbers. In this snapshot, our aim is to provide a one-stop, curated graphical source for the key numbers that help us understand the virus driving our current global crisis. The discussion is framed around two broad themes: 1) the biology of the virus itself and 2) the characteristics of the infection of a single human host. Our one-page summary provides the key numbers pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, based mostly on peer-reviewed literature. The numbers reported in summary format are substantiated by the annotated references below. Readers are urged to remember that much uncertainty remains and knowledge of this pandemic and the virus driving it is rapidly evolving. In the paragraphs below we provide 'back of the envelope' calculations that exemplify the insights that can be gained from knowing some key numbers and using quantitative logic. These calculations serve to improve our intuition through sanity checks, but do not replace detailed epidemiological analysis.</content>

 Enzyme instability is an important limitation for the investigation and application of enzymes. Therefore, methods to rapidly and effectively improve enzyme stability are highly appealing. In this study we applied a computational method (FRESCO) to guide the engineering of an alcohol dehydrogenase. Of the 177 selected mutations, 25 mutations brought about a significant increase in apparent melting temperature (Δ&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ +3 °C). By combining mutations, a 10-fold mutant was generated with a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of 94 °C (+51 °C relative to wildtype), almost reaching water's boiling point, and the highest increase with FRESCO to date. The 10-fold mutant's structure was elucidated, which enabled the identification of an activity-impairing mutation. After reverting this mutation, the enzyme showed no loss in activity compared to wildtype, while displaying a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of 88 °C (+45 °C relative to wildtype). This work demonstrates the value of enzyme stabilization through computational library design.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Phytochrome proteins control the growth, reproduction, and photosynthesis of plants, fungi, and bacteria. Light is detected by a bilin cofactor, but it remains elusive how this leads to activation of the protein through structural changes. We present serial femtosecond X-ray crystallographic data of the chromophore-binding domains of a bacterial phytochrome at delay times of 1 ps and 10 ps after photoexcitation. The data reveal a twist of the D-ring, which leads to partial detachment of the chromophore from the protein. Unexpectedly, the conserved so-called pyrrole water is photodissociated from the chromophore, concomitant with movement of the A-ring and a key signalling aspartate. The changes are wired together by ultrafast backbone and water movements around the chromophore, channeling them into signal transduction towards the output domains. We suggest that the observed collective changes are important for the phytochrome photoresponse, explaining the earliest steps of how plants, fungi and bacteria sense red light.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175) is a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective ion channel expressed in lysosomal membranes, where it establishes a membrane potential essential for lysosomal function and its dysregulation is associated with the development of Parkinson's Disease. TMEM175 is evolutionarily distinct from all known channels, predicting novel ion-selectivity and gating mechanisms. Here we present cryo-EM structures of human TMEM175 in open and closed conformations, enabled by resolutions up to 2.6Å. Human TMEM175 adopts a homodimeric architecture with a central ion-conduction pore lined by the side chains of the pore-lining helices. Conserved isoleucine residues in the center of the pore serve as the gate in the closed conformation. In the widened channel in the open conformation, these same residues establish a constriction essential for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity. These studies reveal the mechanisms of permeation, selectivity and gating and lay the groundwork for understanding the role of TMEM175 in lysosomal function.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Mechanoelectrical transduction is a cellular signalling pathway where physical stimuli are converted into electro-chemical signals by mechanically activated ion channels. We describe here the presence of mechanically activated currents in melanoma cells that are dependent on TMEM87a, which we have renamed Elkin1. Heterologous expression of this protein in PIEZO1-deficient cells, that exhibit no baseline mechanosensitivity, is sufficient to reconstitute mechanically activated currents. Melanoma cells lacking functional Elkin1 exhibit defective mechanoelectrical transduction, decreased motility and increased dissociation from organotypic spheroids. By analysing cell adhesion properties, we demonstrate that Elkin1 deletion is associated with increased cell-substrate adhesion and decreased homotypic cell-cell adhesion strength. We therefore conclude that Elkin1 supports a PIEZO1-independent mechanoelectrical transduction pathway and modulates cellular adhesions and regulates melanoma cell migration and cell-cell interactions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The brains of Alzheimer's Disease patients show a decrease in brain mass and a preponderance of extracellular Amyloid-β plaques. These plaques are formed by aggregation of polypeptides that are derived from the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). Amyloid-β plaques are thought to play either a direct or an indirect role in disease progression, however the exact role of aggregation and plaque formation in the aetiology of Alzheimer's Disease is subject to debate as the biological effects of soluble and aggregated Amyloid-β peptides are difficult to separate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To investigate the consequences of formation of Amyloid-β oligomers in living tissues, we developed a fluorescently tagged, optogenetic Amyloid-β peptide that oligomerizes rapidly in the presence of blue light. We applied this system to the crucial question of how intracellular Amyloid-β oligomers underlie the pathologies of Alzheimer's Disease. We use &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D. rerio&lt;/i&gt; to show that, although both expression and induced oligomerization of Amyloid-β were detrimental to lifespan and healthspan, we were able to separate the metabolic and physical damage caused by light-induced Amyloid-β oligomerization from Amyloid-β expression alone. The physical damage caused by Amyloid-β oligomers also recapitulated the catastrophic tissue loss that is a hallmark of late AD. We show that the lifespan deficit induced by Amyloid-β oligomers was reduced with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; treatment. Our results present the first model to separate different aspects of disease progression.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Fast signaling from vision and proprioception to muscle activation plays essential roles in quickly correcting movement. Though many studies have demonstrated modulation of the quick sensorimotor responses as depending on context in each modality, the contribution of multimodal information has not been established. Here, we examined whether state estimates contributing to stretch reflexes are represented solely by proprioceptive information or by multimodal information. Unlike previous studies, we newly found a significant stretch-reflex attenuation by the distortion and elimination of visual-feedback without any change in motor tasks. Furthermore, the stretch-reflex amplitude reduced with increasing elimination durations which would degrade state estimates. By contrast, even though a distortion was introduced in the target-motor-mapping, the stretch reflex was not simultaneously attenuated with visuomotor reflex. Our results therefore indicate that the observed stretch-reflex attenuation is specifically ascribed to uncertainty increase in estimating hand states, suggesting multimodal contributions to the generation of stretch reflexes.</content>

 Cardiomyocyte b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenoceptors (b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs) coupled to soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)-dependent production of the second messenger 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) have been shown to protect from heart failure. However, the exact localization of these receptors to fine membrane structures and subcellular compartmentation of b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-AR/cGMP signals underpinning this protection in health and disease remain elusive. Here, we used a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based cGMP biosensor combined with scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) to show that functional β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs are mostly confined to the T-tubules of healthy rat cardiomyocytes. Heart failure, induced via myocardial infarction, causes a decrease of the cGMP levels generated by these receptors and a change of subcellular cGMP compartmentation. Furthermore, attenuated cGMP signals led to impaired phosphodiesterase 2 dependent negative cGMP-to-cAMP cross-talk. In conclusion, topographic and functional reorganization of the b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-AR/cGMP signalosome happens in heart failure and should be considered when designing new therapies acting via this receptor.</content>

 Central mammalian synapses release synaptic vesicles in dedicated structures called docking/release sites. It has been assumed that when voltage-dependent calcium entry is sufficiently large, synaptic output attains a maximum value of one synaptic vesicle per action potential and per site. Here we use deconvolution to count synaptic vesicle output at single sites (mean site number per synapse: 3.6). When increasing calcium entry with tetraethylammonium in 1.5 mM external calcium concentration, we find that synaptic output saturates at 0.22 vesicle per site, not at 1 vesicle per site. Fitting the results with current models of calcium-dependent exocytosis indicates that the 0.22 vesicle limit reflects the probability of docking sites to be occupied by synaptic vesicles at rest, as only docked vesicles can be released. With 3 mM external calcium, the maximum output per site increases to 0.47, indicating an increase in docking site occupancy as a function of external calcium concentration.</content>

 Mammalian mitochondrial inner membrane fusion is mediated by optic atrophy 1 (OPA1). Under physiological conditions, OPA1 undergoes proteolytic processing to form a membrane-anchored long isoform (L-OPA1) and a soluble short isoform (S-OPA1). A combination of L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 is essential for efficient membrane fusion; however, the relevant mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we investigate the cryo-electron microscopic structures of S-OPA1–coated liposomes in nucleotide-free and GTPγS-bound states. S-OPA1 exhibits a general dynamin-like structure and can assemble onto membranes in a helical array with a dimer building block. We reveal that hydrophobic residues in its extended membrane-binding domain are critical for its tubulation activity. The binding of GTPγS triggers a conformational change and results in a rearrangement of the helical lattice and tube expansion similar to that of S-Mgm1. These observations indicate that S-OPA1 adopts a dynamin-like power stroke membrane remodeling mechanism during mitochondrial inner membrane fusion.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Current xenogeneic mouse models cannot evaluate on-target off-tumor adverse effect, hindering the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for solid tumors, due to limited human/mouse cross-reactivity of antibodies used in CAR and sever graft-versus-host disease induced by administered human T cells. We have evaluated safety and antitumor efficacy of CAR-T cells targeting glypican-1 (GPC1) overexpressed in various solid tumors. GPC1-specific human and murine CAR-T cells generated from our original anti-human/mouse GPC1 antibody showed strong antitumor effects in xenogeneic and syngeneic mouse models, respectively. Importantly, the murine CAR-T cells enhanced endogenous T cell responses against a non-GPC1 tumor antigen through the mechanism of antigen-spreading and showed synergistic antitumor effects with anti-PD-1 antibody without any adverse effects in syngeneic models. Our study shows the potential of GPC1 as a CAR-T cell target for solid tumors and the importance of syngeneic and xenogeneic models for evaluating their safety and efficacy.</content>

		<link href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48964"/>

		<content type="html">
 An extracellular matrix of Fibronectin adheres the neural tube to the two flanking columns of paraxial mesoderm and is required for normal vertebrate development. Here, we find that the bilaterally symmetric interfaces between the zebrafish neural tube and paraxial mesoderm function as optimally engineered adhesive lap joints with rounded edges, graded Fibronectin ‘adhesive’ and an arced adhesive spew filet. Fibronectin is a ‘smart adhesive’ that remodels to the lateral edges of the neural tube-paraxial mesoderm interfaces where shear stress is highest. Fibronectin remodeling is mechanically responsive to contralateral variation morphogenesis, and Fibronectin-mediated inter-tissue adhesion is required for bilaterally symmetric morphogenesis of the paraxial mesoderm. Strikingly, however, perturbation of the Fibronectin matrix rescues the neural tube convergence defect of &lt;i&gt;cadherin 2&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Therefore, Fibronectin-mediated inter-tissue adhesion dynamically coordinates bilaterally symmetric morphogenesis of the vertebrate trunk but predisposes the neural tube to convergence defects that lead to spina bifida.</content>

The excess of 15-30 Hz (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-band) oscillations in the basal ganglia is one of the key signatures of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The STN-GPe network is integral to generation and modulation of &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; band oscillations in basal ganglia. However, the role of changes in the firing rates and spike bursting of STN and GPe neurons in shaping these oscillations has remained unclear. In order to uncouple their effects, we studied the dynamics of STN-GPe network using numerical simulations. In particular, we used a neuron model, in which firing rates and spike bursting can be independently controlled. Using this model, we found that while STN firing rate is predictive of oscillations but GPe firing rate is not. The effect of spike bursting in STN and GPe neurons was state-dependent. That is, only when the network was operating in a state close to the border of oscillatory and non-oscillatory regimes, spike bursting had a qualitative effect on the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; band oscillations. In these network states, an increase in GPe bursting enhanced the oscillations whereas an equivalent proportion of spike bursting in STN suppressed the oscillations. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the transient &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; bursts and how duration and power of &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; band oscillations may be controlled by an interplay of GPe and STN firing rates and spike bursts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtyKKb1Lty8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mechanisms that control movements range from navigational mechanisms, in which the animal employs directional cues to reach a specific destination, to search movements during which there are little or no environmental cues. Even though most real-world movements result from an interplay between these mechanisms, an experimental system and theoretical framework for the study of interplay of these mechanisms is not available. Here, we rectify this deficit. We create a new method to stimulate the olfactory system in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; or fruit flies. As flies explore a circular arena, their olfactory receptor neuron (ORNs) are optogenetically activated within a central region making this region attractive to the flies without emitting any clear directional signals outside this central region. In the absence of ORN activation, the fly’s locomotion can be described by a random walk model where a fly’s movement is described by its speed and turn-rate (or kinematics). Upon optogenetic stimulation, the fly’s behavior changes dramatically in two respects. First, there are large kinematic changes. Second, there are more turns at the border between light-zone and no-light-zone and these turns have an inward bias. Surprisingly, there is no increase in turn-rate, rather a large decrease in speed that makes it appear that the flies are turning at the border. Similarly, the inward bias of the turns is a result of the increase in turn angle. These two mechanisms entirely account for the change in a fly’s locomotion. No complex mechanisms such as path-integration or a careful evaluation of gradients are necessary.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/91c5cfhMBKw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

This work reports a dynamical Markov state model of CLC-2 “fast” (pore) gating, based on 600 microseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In the starting conformation of our CLC-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-EM structure of the bovine CLC-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;. Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low (∼1%), consistent with the low open probability of CLC-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 mV). In the second additional state, GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population (∼1%), is only accessible when GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the CLC-2 selectivity filter, as a function of GLU&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of CLC-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jTCDQXkF0cw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Compact CRISPR/Cas9 systems that can be packaged into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) hold great promise for gene therapy. Unfortunately, currently available small Cas9 nucleases either display low activity or require a long protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, limiting their extensive applications. Here, we screened a panel of Cas9 nucleases and identified a small Cas9 ortholog from &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus auricularis&lt;/i&gt; (SauriCas9), which recognizes a simple NNGG PAM, displays high activity for genome editing, and is compact enough to be packaged into an AAV for genome editing. Moreover, the conversion of adenine and cytosine bases can be achieved by fusing SauriCas9 to the cytidine and adenine deaminase. Therefore, SauriCas9 holds great potential for both basic research and clinical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nuaTGLVxbGA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Vocal learning is the ability to modify vocal output on the basis of experience. Traditionally, species have been classified as either displaying or lacking this ability. A recent proposal, the vocal learning continuum, recognizes the need to have a more nuanced view of this phenotype and abandon the yes–no dichotomy. However, it also limits vocal learning to production of novel calls through imitation, moreover subserved by a forebrain-to-phonatory-muscles circuit. We discuss its limitations regarding the characterization of vocal learning across species and argue for a more permissive view.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pN_KTsdURbA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Science communication and outreach are essential for training the next generation of scientists and raising public awareness for science. Providing effective science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational outreach to students in classrooms is challenging because of the need to form partnerships with teachers, the time commitment required for the presenting scientist, and the limited class time allotted for presentations. In our Present Your Ph.D. Thesis to a 12-Year Old outreach project, our novel solution to this problem is hosting a youth science workshop (YSW) on our university campus. The YSW is an interpersonal science communication and outreach experience in which graduate students from diverse scientific disciplines introduce middle and high school students to their cutting-edge research and mentor them to develop a white-board presentation to communicate the research to the workshop audience. Our assessment of the YSW indicated that participating young students expressed significantly more positive attitudes toward science and increased motivation to work in a STEM career after attending the workshop. Qualitative follow-up interviews with participating graduate students’ show that even with minimal time commitment, an impactful science communication training experience can be achieved. The YSW is a low-cost, high-reward educational outreach event amenable to all disciplines of science. It enhances interest and support of basic science research while providing opportunities for graduate students to engage with the public, improve their science communication skills, and enhance public understanding of science. This YSW model can be easily implemented at other higher education institutions to globally enhance science outreach initiatives.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HlMbjtbeoUM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the prevalence of the perfusion‐weighted imaging (PWI) ‐ diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch and response to intravenous thrombolysis in the WAKE‐UP trial.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prespecified post‐hoc analysis of ischemic stroke patients screened for DWI ‐ fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch in WAKE‐UP who underwent PWI. We defined PWI‐DWI mismatch as ischemic core volume &amp;lt; 70 ml, mismatch volume &amp;gt; 10 ml and mismatch ratio &amp;gt; 1.2. Primary efficacy endpoint was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days, adjusted for age and symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1,362 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screened patients, 431 underwent PWI. Of these, 57 (13%) had a double mismatch, 151 (35%) only a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch and 54 (13%) only a PWI‐DWI mismatch. DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was more prevalent than PWI‐DWI mismatch (48%; 95% CI 43%–53% vs 26%; 95% CI 22%–30%, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Screening for either one of the mismatch profiles resulted in a yield of 61% (95% CI 56%–65%). Prevalence of PWI‐DWI mismatch was similar in patients with (27%) or without (24%) DWI‐FLAIR mismatch (p = 0.52). In an exploratory analysis in the small subgroup of 208 randomized patients with PWI, PWI‐DWI mismatch status did not modify the treatment response (p for interaction = 0.73).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating both the DWI‐FLAIR and PWI‐DWI mismatch pattern in patients with unknown time of stroke onset will result in the highest yield of thrombolysis treatment. The treatment benefit of alteplase in patients with a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch seems not merely driven by the presence of a PWI‐DWI mismatch, although this analysis was underpowered.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining if traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). This constitutes a research priority for the Veterans Administration (VA) with implications for screening policy and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population‐based, matched case‐control study among veterans using VA healthcare facilities from 10/1/1999 to 09/30/2013. We identified 176,871 PD cases and 707,484 randomly selected PD‐free matched controls. Parkinson's Disease, TBI and PTSD were ascertained by validated ICD‐9 code‐based algorithms. We examined the association between both risk factors and PD employing race‐adjusted conditional logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall study cohort prevalence for TBI &lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt;, TBI &lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt;, and PTSD was 0.65%, 0.69% and 5.5% respectively. Both TBI and PTSD were significantly associated with PD in single‐risk factor race‐adjusted analyses (conditional odds ratio (cOR) =2.99 (95% CI: 2.69‐3.32), 3.82 (95% CI: 3.67‐3.97), and 2.71 (95% CI: 2.66‐2.77) for TBI &lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt;, TBI &lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt; and PTSD, respectively). There was suggestive positive interaction observed with comorbid PTSD/TBI in dual‐risk factor analyses, with significant 2.69‐fold and 3.70‐fold excess relative PD risk in veterans with TBI &lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt; and TBI &lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt; vs. those without TBI when PTSD was present vs. 2.17‐fold and 2.80‐fold excess risk when PTSD was absent.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study was the first to demonstrate that both TBI and PTSD are independently associated with increased relative PD risk in a diverse nationwide cohort of military service veterans, and the first to suggest a potential modest synergistic excess risk in those with comorbid TBI/PTSD. Longitudinal research is needed to confirm these suggestive findings.&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Decades of research have implicated the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in motivation, learning and reward processing. We and others recently demonstrated that it also serves as an important node in sleep/wake regulation. Specifically, VTA-dopaminergic neuron activation is sufficient to drive wakefulness and necessary for the maintenance of wakefulness. However, the role of VTA-GABAergic neurons in arousal regulation is not fully understood. It is still unclear whether VTA-GABAergic neurons predictably alter their activity across arousal states, what is the nature of interactions between VTA-GABAergic activity and cortical oscillations, and how activity in VTA-GABAergic neurons relates to VTA-dopaminergic neurons in the context of sleep/wake regulation. To address these, we simultaneously recorded population activity from VTA subpopulations and electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG) signals during spontaneous sleep/wake states and in the presence of salient stimuli in freely-behaving mice. We found that VTA-GABAergic neurons exhibit robust arousal-state-dependent alterations in population activity, with high activity and transients during wakefulness and REM sleep. During wakefulness, population activity of VTA-GABAergic neurons, but not VTA-dopaminergic neurons, was positively correlated with EEG  power and negatively correlated with  power. During NREM sleep, population activity in both VTA-GABAergic and VTA-dopaminergic neurons negatively correlated with , , and  power bands. Salient stimuli, with both positive and negative valence, activated VTA-GABAergic neurons. Together, our data indicate that VTA-GABAergic neurons, like their dopaminergic counterparts, drastically alter their activity across sleep-wake states. Changes in their activity predicts cortical oscillatory patterns reflected in the EEG, which are distinct from EEG spectra associated with dopaminergic neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in Parkinson disease (PD) is not uniform, as dopamine neurons from the ventral tier are lost more rapidly than those of the dorsal tier. Identifying the intrinsic differences that account for this differential vulnerability may provide a key for developing new treatments for PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we compared the RNA‐sequenced transcriptomes of ~100 laser captured microdissected SNpc neurons from each tier from 7 healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expression levels of dopaminergic markers were similar across the tiers, whereas markers specific to the neighboring ventral tegmental area were virtually undetected. After accounting for unwanted sources of variation, we identified 106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the SNpc tiers. The genes higher in the dorsal/resistant SNpc tier neurons displayed coordinated patterns of expression across the human brain, their protein products had more interactions than expected by chance, and they demonstrated evidence of functional convergence. No significant shared functionality was found for genes higher in the ventral/vulnerable SNpc tier. Surprisingly but importantly, none of the identified DEGs was among the familial PD genes or genome‐wide associated loci. Finally, we found some DEGs in opposite tier orientation between human and analogous mouse populations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results highlight functional enrichments of vesicular trafficking, ion transport/homeostasis and oxidative stress genes showing higher expression in the resistant neurons of the SNpc dorsal tier. Furthermore, the comparison of gene expression variation in human and mouse SNpc populations strongly argues for the need of human‐focused omics studies. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Retinal topography and spectral sensitivity of the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e3ebe4bf-4097-4d3a-8d5a-9fb2bd3235ce/cne24911-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histological sections and electroretinography suggest the presence of a heavily rod dominated (and possibly rod‐only) retina in Port Jackson sharks. Mapping of the distribution of retinal neurons reveals a specialisation for higher visual acuity in a narrow horizontal band that corresponds to the part of the visual field covering the water‐substrate interface. Such a specialised retina would be well‐adapted to low‐light (scotopic) vision and a benthic lifestyle, and may assist the shark in finding food and avoiding predators.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the visual system of the Port Jackson shark &lt;i&gt;Heterodontus portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt;, a shallow‐dwelling benthic species and generalist predator endemic to the temperate coastal waters around southern Australia. Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark‐ or light‐adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (~80,000 rods mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ganglion cell (~1,800 cells mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialisation would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate‐water interface and remove the need for &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; was 3.14 cycles deg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs. Taken together, these results suggest that the retina of &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; is well adapted for nocturnal vision.&lt;/p&gt;

 Senescent cells secrete several molecules, collectively named &lt;i&gt;senescence-associated secretory phenotype&lt;/i&gt; (SASP). In the SASP of cells that became senescent following several &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; chemical and physical stress, we identified the IGFBP-4 protein that can be considered a general stress mediator. This factor appeared to play a key role in senescence-paracrine signaling. We provided evidences showing that genotoxic injury, such as low dose irradiation, may promote an IGFBP-4 release in bloodstream both in mice irradiated with 100 mGy X-ray and in human subjects that received Computer Tomography. Increased level of circulating IGFBP-4 may be responsible of pro-aging effect. We found a significant increase of senescent cells in the lungs, heart, and kidneys of mice that were intraperitoneally injected with IGFBP-4 twice a week for two months. We then analyzed how genotoxic stressors may promote the release of IGFBP-4 and the molecular pathways associated with the induction of senescence by this protein.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Myocardial insulin resistance contributes to heart failure in response to pathological stresses, therefore, a therapeutic strategy to maintain cardiac insulin pathways requires further investigation. We demonstrated that insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) was reduced in failing mouse hearts post-myocardial infarction (MI) and failing human hearts. The mice manifesting severe cardiac dysfunction post-MI displayed elevated &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; in the myocardium. Ischemia-upregulated &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; promoted &lt;i&gt;Irs1&lt;/i&gt; degradation. Using rat cardiomyocytes and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, we elucidated that mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7, also known as ERK5)-mediated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPβ) transcriptionally represses &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; under hypoxia. Therapeutically, functional studies demonstrated gene therapy-delivered cardiac-specific MAPK7 restoration or overexpression of CEBPβ impeded cardiac injury after MI, at least partly due to normalization of &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, inhibition of &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; preserved &lt;i&gt;Irs1&lt;/i&gt; and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction post-MI. In conclusion, we reveal that targeting &lt;i&gt;mir128-3p&lt;/i&gt; mitigates myocardial insulin resistance, thereafter slowing down the progression of heart failure post-ischemia.</content>

 While classical views of cerebellar learning have suggested that this structure predominantly operates according to an error-based supervised learning rule to refine movements, emerging evidence suggests that the cerebellum may also harness a wider range of learning rules to contribute to a variety of behaviors, including cognitive processes. Together, such evidence points to a broad role for cerebellar circuits in generating and testing predictions about movement, reward, and other non-motor operations. However, this expanded view of cerebellar processing also raises many new questions about how such apparent diversity of function arises from a structure with striking homogeneity. Hence, this review will highlight both current evidence for predictive cerebellar circuit function that extends beyond the classical view of error-driven supervised learning, as well as open questions that must be addressed to unify our understanding cerebellar circuit function.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In most vertebrate neurons, action potentials are triggered at the distal end of the axon initial segment (AIS). Both position and length of the AIS vary across and within neuron types, with activity, development and pathology. What is the impact of AIS geometry on excitability? Direct empirical assessment has proven difficult because of the many potential confounding factors. Here we carried a principled theoretical analysis to answer this question. We provide a simple formula relating AIS geometry and sodium conductance density to the somatic voltage threshold. A distal shift of the AIS normally produces a (modest) increase in excitability, but we explain how this pattern can reverse if a hyperpolarizing current is present at the AIS, due to resistive coupling with the soma. This work provides a theoretical tool to assess the significance of structural AIS plasticity for electrical function.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;A novel mouse model of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor expression: A look at the brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3545434f-0429-43b0-9a38-ca2f7e330ffb/cne24905-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a BAC transgenic mouse model of the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor (GLP‐1R) whereby expression of a red fluorescent protein (mApple) was driven by the GLP‐1R promoter. We further characterized the expression patterns and cellular specificity of these neurons in order to better understand the functional roles of GLP‐1R.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) is an incretin hormone with a number of functions to maintain energy homeostasis and contribute to motivated behavior, both peripherally and within the central nervous system (CNS). These functions, which include insulin secretion, gastric emptying, satiety, and the hedonic aspects of food and drug intake, are primarily mediated through stimulation of the GLP‐1 receptor. While this receptor plays an important role in a variety of physiological outcomes, data regarding its CNS expression has been primarily limited to regional receptor binding and single‐label transcript expression studies. We thus developed a bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse, in which expression of a red fluorescent protein (mApple) is driven by the GLP‐1R promoter. Using this reporter mouse, we characterized the regional and cellular expression patterns of GLP‐1R expressing cells in the CNS, using double‐label immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. GLP‐1R‐expressing cells were enriched in several key brain regions and circuits, including the lateral septum, hypothalamus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hippocampus, ventral midbrain, periaqueductal gray, and cerebral cortex. In most regions, GLP‐1R primarily colocalized with GABAergic neurons, except within some regions such as the hippocampus, where it was co‐expressed in glutamatergic neurons. GLP‐1R‐mApple cells were highly co‐expressed with 5‐HT3 receptor‐containing neurons within the cortex and striatum, as well as with dopamine receptor‐ and calbindin‐expressing cells within the lateral septum, the brain region in which GLP‐1R is most highly expressed. In this manuscript, we provide detailed images of GLP‐1R‐mApple expression and distribution within the brain and characterization of these neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The day‐night differences in ERK1/2, GSK3β activity and c‐Fos levels in the brain, and the responsiveness of various brain structures to morphine&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d19a97bc-c759-445d-9ca9-ddd28ceb0687/cne24906-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of brain structures in which acute morphine induced or suppressed the level of c‐Fos, pERK1/2 and pGSK3β. While the c‐Fos level in the brain is either upregulated or unchanged, the levels of phosphorylated forms of both kinases can be upregulated as well as downregulated below the baseline level. The day/night variation in the spontaneous levels of all markers may affect the direction, rate, and magnitude of the response to morphine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other drugs or pharmaceuticals, opioids differ in their rewarding or analgesic effects depending on when they are applied. In the previous study, we have demonstrated the day/night difference in the sensitivity of the major circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus to a low dose of morphine, and showed the bidirectional effect of morphine on pERK1/2 and pGSK3β levels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus depending on the time of administration. The main aim of this study was to identify other brain structures that respond differently to morphine depending on the time of its administration. Using immunohistochemistry, we identified 44 structures that show time‐of‐day specific changes in c‐Fos level and activity of ERK1/2 and GSK3β kinases in response to a single dose of 1 mg/kg morphine. Furthermore, comparison among control groups revealed the differences in the spontaneous levels of all markers with a generally higher level during the night, that is, in the active phase of the day. We thus provide further evidence for diurnal variations in the activity of brain regions outside the suprachiasmatic nucleus indicated by the temporal changes in the molecular substrate. We suggest that these changes are responsible for generating diurnal variation in the reward behavior or analgesic effect of opioid administration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the adult mouse hippocampus, new neurons are produced by radial glia‐like (RGL) neural stem cells in the subgranular zone, which extend their apical processes toward the molecular layer, and express the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, but not the astrocyte marker S100β. In rodent models of epilepsy, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was reported to be increased after acute and mild seizures, but to be decreased by chronic and severe epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated how the severity of seizures affects neurogenesis and RGL neural stem cells in acute stages of epilepsy, using an improved mouse pilocarpine model in which pilocarpine‐induced hypothermia was prevented by maintaining body temperature, resulting in a high incidence rate of epileptic seizures and low rate of mortality. In mice that experienced seizures without status epilepticus (SE), the number of proliferating progenitors and immature neurons were significantly increased, whereas no changes were observed in RGL cells. In mice that experienced seizures with SE, the number of proliferating progenitors and immature neurons were unchanged, but the number of RGL cells with an apical process was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the processes of the majority of RGL cells extended inversely toward the hilus, and about half of the aberrant RGL cells expressed S100β. These results suggest that seizures with SE lead to changes in the polarity and properties of RGL neural stem cells, which may direct them toward astrocyte differentiation, resulting in the reduction of neural stem cells producing new granule cells. This also suggests the possibility that cell polarity of RGL stem cells is important for maintaining the stemness of adult neural stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new information is relevant to prior knowledge or schema, it can be learned and remembered better. Rodent studies have suggested that the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are important for processing schema‐related information. However, there are inconsistent findings from human studies on the involvement of the hippocampus and its interaction with the vmPFC in schema‐related memory retrieval. To address these issues, we used a human analog of the rodent spatial schema task to compare brain activity during immediate retrieval of paired associations (PAs) in schema‐consistent and schema‐inconsistent conditions. The results showed that the anterior hippocampus was more involved in retrieving PAs in the schema‐consistent condition than in the schema‐inconsistent condition. Connectivity analyses showed that the anterior hippocampus had stronger coupling with the vmPFC when the participants retrieved newly learned PAs successfully in the schema‐consistent (vs. schema‐inconsistent) condition, whereas the coupling of the posterior hippocampus with the vmPFC showed the opposite. Taken together, the results shed light on how the long axis of the hippocampus and vmPFC interact to serve memory retrieval via different networks that differ by schema condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it has been known for over half a century that interference with the normal activity of septohippocampal neurons can abolish hippocampal theta rhythmicity, a definitive answer to the question of its function has remained elusive. To clarify the role of septal circuits and theta in location‐specific activity of place cells and spatial behavior, three drugs were delivered to the medial septum of rats: Tetracaine, a local anesthetic; muscimol, a GABA‐A agonist; and gabazine, a GABA‐A antagonist. All three drugs disrupted normal oscillatory activity in the hippocampus. However, tetracaine and muscimol both reduced spatial firing and interfered with the rat's ability to navigate to a hidden goal. After gabazine, location‐specific firing was preserved in the absence of theta, but rats were unable to accurately locate the hidden goal. These results indicate that theta is unnecessary for location‐specific firing of hippocampal cells, and that place cell activity cannot support accurate navigation when septal circuits are disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left and right rodent hippocampi exhibit striking lateralization in some of the very neural substrates considered to be critical for hippocampal cognitive function. Despite this, there is an overwhelming lack of consideration for hemispheric differences in studies of the rodent hippocampus. Asymmetries identified so far suggest that a bilateral model of the hippocampus will be essential for an understanding of this brain region, and perhaps of the brain more widely. Although hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the left and right hippocampi contribute to behavior and cognition, these hypotheses have either been refuted by more recent studies or have been limited in the scope of data they explain. Here, I will first review data on human and rodent hippocampal lateralization. The implications of these data suggest that considering the hippocampus as a bilateral structure with functional lateralization will be critical moving forward in understanding the function and mechanisms of this brain region. In exploring these implications, I will then propose a hypothesis of the hippocampus as a bilateral structure. This discrete‐continuous hypothesis proposes that the left and right hippocampi contribute to spatial memory and navigation in a complementary manner. Specifically, the left hemisphere stores spatial information as discrete, salient locations, and the right hemisphere represents space continuously, contributing to route computation and flexible spatial navigation. Consideration of hippocampal lateralization in designing future studies may provide insight into the function of the hippocampus and resolve debates concerning its function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primates use saccades to gather information about objects and their relative spatial arrangement, a process essential for visual perception and memory. It has been proposed that signals linked to saccades reset the phase of local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the hippocampus, providing a temporal window for visual signals to activate neurons in this region and influence memory formation. We investigated this issue by measuring hippocampal LFPs and spikes in two macaques performing different tasks with unconstrained eye movements. We found that LFP phase clustering (PC) in the alpha/beta (8–16 Hz) frequencies followed foveation onsets, while PC in frequencies lower than 8 Hz followed spontaneous saccades, even on a homogeneous background. Saccades to a solid grey background were not followed by increases in local neuronal firing, whereas saccades toward appearing visual stimuli were. Finally, saccade parameters correlated with LFPs phase and amplitude: saccade direction correlated with delta (≤4 Hz) phase, and saccade amplitude with theta (4–8 Hz) power. Our results suggest that signals linked to saccades reach the hippocampus, producing synchronization of delta/theta LFPs without a general activation of local neurons. Moreover, some visual inputs co‐occurring with saccades produce LFP synchronization in the alpha/beta bands and elevated neuronal firing. Our findings support the hypothesis that saccade‐related signals enact sensory input‐dependent plasticity and therefore memory formation in the primate hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have taken a number of different approaches in their exploration of hippocampal function. One approach seeks to describe hippocampal function by probing the memory representations that the hippocampus supports. Another approach focuses on the role of the hippocampus in pattern separation and completion. Each of these approaches to understanding hippocampal function utilizes a distinct set of specialized tasks, and both of these task sets are known to be sensitive to changes in hippocampal function with age and disease status. But the question remains whether the tasks utilized in these two approaches tap into the same aspects of hippocampal function. We explored this question in the context of hippocampal development. Preadolescent children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 73) and young adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 41) completed an identical battery of cognitive tasks consisting of a spatial reconstruction relational memory task, the mnemonic similarity task (MST)—an object‐based pattern separation task, and a novel hybrid task—the Object Discrimination and Distribution (ODD) Task—designed to integrate and simultaneously tax pattern separation and spatial relational memory. Children did not demonstrate impairments in lure discrimination relative to young adults on either the object‐based pattern separation task or for aspects of the ODD task that required pattern separation in the absence of relational memory demands but performed more poorly across aspects of tasks that required relational binding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal formation contains several classes of neurons thought to be involved in navigational processes, in particular place cells and grid cells. Place cells have been associated with a topological strategy for navigation, while grid cells have been suggested to support metric vector navigation. Grid cell‐based vector navigation can support novel shortcuts across unexplored territory by providing the direction toward the goal. However, this strategy is insufficient in natural environments cluttered with obstacles. Here, we show how navigation in complex environments can be supported by integrating a grid cell‐based vector navigation mechanism with local obstacle avoidance mediated by border cells and place cells whose interconnections form an experience‐dependent topological graph of the environment. When vector navigation and object avoidance fail (i.e., the agent gets stuck), place cell replay events set closer subgoals for vector navigation. We demonstrate that this combined navigation model can successfully traverse environments cluttered by obstacles and is particularly useful where the environment is underexplored. Finally, we show that the model enables the simulated agent to successfully navigate experimental maze environments from the animal literature on cognitive mapping. The proposed model is sufficiently flexible to support navigation in different environments, and may inform the design of experiments to relate different navigational abilities to place, grid, and border cell firing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal and ventral regions of the rat longitudinal hippocampal axis are functionally distinct. That is, each region is associated with different behavioral tasks and disease susceptibilities due to underlying anatomical, and physiological differences. These differences are especially pronounced in area CA1, where significant differences in morphology, synaptic physiology, intrinsic excitability, and gene expression have been reported between CA1 pyramidal neurons from the dorsal (DHC) and ventral hippocampus (VHC). However, despite a significant amount of recent attention, a cogent picture of the intrinsic electrophysiological profile of DHC and VHC neurons has remained elusive, due, in part, to experiments performed on rats at different developmental time points. Moreover, the resulting intrinsic electrophysiological profiles are sufficiently different as to warrant a thorough investigation of the spatial and temporal changes in the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons across developmental time. Accordingly, in this study, I have characterized the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons from acute hippocampal slices prepared from the DHC and VHC throughout an approximately 3‐week developmental period (P14–P37). DHC and VHC neurons exhibited distinct intra‐region changes (DHC or VHC) and inter‐region differences (DHC versus VHC) in their intrinsic electrophysiological properties, which yielded two developmental timelines: (a) a common developmental timeline describing changes observed in both DHC and VHC neurons, and (b) a differential developmental timeline highlighting unique features observed in DHC neurons. Specifically, DHC neurons exhibited significant inter‐region differences in RMP, input resistance, threshold, and spike frequency adaptation relative to VHC neurons, as well as an intra‐region change in the rebound slope (a proxy for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). These observations both integrate and reconcile previous work performed with rats at different developmental stages and suggest a distinct developmental trajectory for DHC neurons that might shed light on the normal physiological functions and disease susceptibility of the DHC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Retinal morphology in Astyanax mexicanus during eye degeneration&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bf732163-249b-4437-924e-d846bbe237d7/cne24835-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we use immunohistochemistry to show that the degenerating retina of the cavefish &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is marked by two important features. First, the neuroretina contains all cell types commonly see in the circuit. Presumably these components will later degenerate as the lens dies. Second, the outer segments of the photoreceptors are already malformed from early stages of development. It is interesting to note how evolution has severed a cell in half.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teleost &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is one species extant in two readily available forms. One that lives in Mexican rivers and various convergent forms that live in nearby caves. These fish are born with eyes but in the cavefish, they degenerate during development. It is known that the lens of cavefish undergoes apoptosis and that some cells in the neuroretina also die. It has not been described, however, if glia and various components of the neuroretina form before complete eye degeneration. Here we examined the development of the retina of the closest living ancestor that lives in the rivers and two independently adapted of cavefish. We report that although the neuroretina is smaller and more compact, it has all cell types and layers including amacrine cells and Müller glia. While various makers for photoreceptors are present in the cavefish inner segments, the outer segments of the photoreceptors in cavefish are missing from the earliest stages examined. This shows that the machinery for visual transducing discs might still be present but not organized in one part of the cell. It is interesting to note that the deficiencies in Astyanax cavefish resemble retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Inner retinal preservation in the photoinducible I307N rhodopsin mutant mouse, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b4d8995f-7c4c-47b5-a529-861c939fdb1a/cne24838-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tvrm4 rhodopsin mutant mice undergo rapid photoreceptor loss upon bright light exposure. Early consequences on the inner retina involve mainly second‐order neurons and include quick dendritic retraction and axonal shrinkage in rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and, later, in cone BCs and the presence of anomalous globular synaptic ribbons (GR). Yet, BC survival is nearly 100% and retinal architecture is overall well preserved. Hence, early remodeling in this adult mutant is moderate and similar to what observed in developmental paradigms of retinitis pigmentosa.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rod‐cone degenerations, for example, retinitis pigmentosa are leading causes of blindness worldwide. Despite slow disease progression in humans, vision loss is inevitable; therefore, development of vision restoration strategies is crucial. Among others, promising approaches include optogenetics and prosthetic implants, which aim to bypass lost photoreceptors (PRs). Naturally, the efficacy of these therapeutic strategies will depend on inner retinal structural and functional preservation. The present study shows that in photoinducible I307N rhodopsin mice (Translational Vision Research Model 4 [Tvrm4]), a 12k lux light exposure eliminates PRs in the central retina in 1 week, but interneurons and their synapses are maintained for as long as 9 weeks postinduction. Despite bipolar cell dendritic retraction and moderate loss of horizontal cells, the survival rate of various cell types is very high. Significant preservation of conventional synapses and gap junctions in the inner plexiform layer is also observed. We found the number of synaptic ribbons to gradually decline and their ultrastructure to become transiently abnormal, although based on our findings intrinsic retinal architecture is maintained despite complete loss of PRs. Unlike common rodent models of PR degeneration, where the disease phenotype often interferes with retinal development, in Tvrm4 mice, the degenerative process can be induced after retinal development is complete. This time course more closely mimics the timing of disease onset in affected patients. Stability of the inner retina found in these mutants 2 months after PR degeneration suggests moderate, stereotyped remodeling in the early stages of the human disease and represents a promising finding for prompt approaches of vision restoration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health threat in low TB incidence countries, through a combination of reactivated disease and onward transmission. Using surveillance data from the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands (NL), we demonstrate a simple and predictable relationship between the probability of observing a cluster and its size (the number of cases with a single genotype). We demonstrate that the full range of observed cluster sizes can be described using a modified branching process model with the individual reproduction number following a Poisson lognormal distribution. We estimate that, on average, between 2010 and 2015, a TB case generated 0.41 (95% CrI 0.30,0.60) secondary cases in the UK, and 0.24 (0.14,0.48) secondary cases in the NL. A majority of cases did not generate any secondary cases. Recent transmission accounted for 39% (26%,60%) of UK cases and 23%(13%,37%) of NL cases. We predict that reducing UK transmission rates to those observed in the NL would result in 538(266,818) fewer cases annually in the UK. In conclusion, while TB in low incidence countries is strongly associated with reactivated infections, we demonstrate that recent transmission remains sufficient to warrant policies aimed at limiting local TB spread.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zOdHl606mLw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Social insect colonies exhibit colony-level phenotypes such as social immunity and task coordination, which are produced by the individual phenotypes. Mapping the genetic basis of such phenotypes requires associating the colony-level phenotype with the genotypes in the colony. In this paper, we examine alternative approaches to DNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing for genome wide association studies (GWAS) of colony-level traits using a population sample of &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis niger&lt;/i&gt; ants. We evaluate the accuracy of allele frequency estimation from sequencing a pool of individuals (pool-seq) from each colony using either whole-genome sequencing or reduced representation genomic sequencing. Based on empirical measurement of the experimental noise in sequenced DNA pools, we show that reduced representation pool-seq is drastically less accurate than whole-genome pool-seq. Surprisingly, normalized pooling of samples did not result in greater accuracy than un-normalized pooling. Subsequently, we evaluate the power of the alternative approaches for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) of colony-level traits by using simulations that account for an environmental effect on the phenotype. Our results can inform experimental designs and enable optimizing the power of GWAS depending on budget, availability of samples and research goals. We conclude that for a given budget, sequencing un-normalized pools of individuals from each colony provides optimal QTL detection power.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q_GOl3uKNVE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Credibility of scientific claims is established with evidence for their replicability using new data. According to common understanding, replication is repeating a study’s procedure and observing whether the prior finding recurs. This definition is intuitive, easy to apply, and incorrect. We propose that replication is a study for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research. This definition reduces emphasis on operational characteristics of the study and increases emphasis on the interpretation of possible outcomes. The purpose of replication is to advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence. Ironically, the value of replication may be strongest when existing understanding is weakest. Successful replication provides evidence of generalizability across the conditions that inevitably differ from the original study; Unsuccessful replication indicates that the reliability of the finding may be more constrained than recognized previously. Defining replication as a confrontation of current theoretical expectations clarifies its important, exciting, and generative role in scientific progress.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uaQ3infk5f8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Obesity leads to multiple health problems, including diabetes, fatty liver, and even cancer. Here, we report that urolithin A (UA), a gut-microflora–derived metabolite of pomegranate ellagitannins (ETs), prevents diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunctions in mice without causing adverse effects. UA treatment increases energy expenditure (EE) by enhancing thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inducing browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Mechanistically, UA-mediated increased thermogenesis is caused by an elevation of triiodothyronine (T3) levels in BAT and inguinal fat depots. This is also confirmed in UA-treated white and brown adipocytes. Consistent with this mechanism, UA loses its beneficial effects on activation of BAT, browning of white fat, body weight control, and glucose homeostasis when thyroid hormone (TH) production is blocked by its inhibitor, propylthiouracil (PTU). Conversely, administration of exogenous tetraiodothyronine (T4) to PTU-treated mice restores UA-induced activation of BAT and browning of white fat and its preventive role on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced weight gain. Together, these results suggest that UA is a potent antiobesity agent with potential for human clinical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bLupb1iHL9c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In the last half of the 2010s, we saw an upswing in antiscience movements and unprecedented attacks on scientists in the United States and elsewhere. All indications suggest that this trend will not slow or reverse anytime soon, and it is now increasingly apparent that it will fall to the scientists themselves to respond, engage a skeptical public, and lead the defense of science. Accordingly, we must recognize opportunities to both reorganize science doctoral and postdoctoral training and incentivize senior scientists as a means to establish a new ecosystem for science public engagement. Such activities may become essential if the assaults on our profession continue or expand. Today, the commitment of young scientists to public service is at an all-time high. However, we must work quickly to capture that enthusiasm and channel it into a social good, lest we lose this opportunity. Potentially, open-access publishers could play a central role.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XU7VvEvo0OU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gp1 mGluRs), including mGluR1 and mGluR5, are critical regulators for neuronal and synaptic plasticity. Dysregulated Gp1 mGluR signaling is observed with various neurologic disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). It is well established that acute activation of Gp1 mGluRs leads to elevation of neuronal intrinsic excitability and long-term synaptic depression. However, it remains unknown how chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs can affect neural activity and what molecular mechanisms might be involved. In the current study, we employed a multielectrode array (MEA) recording system to evaluate neural network activity of primary mouse cortical neuron cultures. We demonstrated that chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs leads to elevation of spontaneous spike frequency while burst activity and cross-electrode synchronization are maintained at the baseline. We further showed that these neural network properties are achieved through proteasomal degradation of Akt that is dependent on the tumor suppressor p53. Genetically knocking down p53 disrupts the elevation of spontaneous spike frequency and alters the burst activity and cross-electrode synchronization following chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs. Importantly, these deficits can be restored by pharmacologically inhibiting Akt to mimic inactivation of Akt mediated by p53. Together, our findings reveal the effects of chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs on neural network activity and identify a unique signaling pathway involving p53 and Akt for these effects. Our data can provide insights into constitutively active Gp1 mGluR signaling observed in many neurologic and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Feeding, a critical behavior for survival, consists of a complex series of behavioral steps. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, the initial steps of feeding are food choice, during which the quality of a potential food source is judged, and ingestion, during which the selected food source is ingested into the digestive tract. It remains unclear whether these steps employ different mechanisms of neural perception. Here, we provide insight into the two initial steps of feeding in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larva. We find that substrate choice and ingestion are determined by independent circuits at the cellular level. First, we took 22 candidate bitter compounds and examined their influence on choice preference and ingestion behavior. Interestingly, certain bitter tastants caused different responses in choice and ingestion, suggesting distinct mechanisms of perception. We further provide evidence that certain gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the external terminal organ are involved in determining choice preference, and a pair of larval pharyngeal GRNs is involved in mediating both avoidance and suppression of ingestion. Our results show that feeding behavior is coordinated by a multi-step regulatory process employing relatively independent neural elements. These findings are consistent with a model in which distinct sensory pathways act as modulatory circuits controlling distinct subprograms during feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Here we provide molecular and cellular evidence that feeding can indeed be dissected into two distinct steps, namely the determination of preference and initiation of ingestion. We find that bitter tastants have individual characteristics when negatively affecting feeding, with most chemicals negatively affecting both preference and ingestion, and certain chemicals negatively affecting only preference. These characteristics are due to different sensory neurons being responsible for detecting different bitter compounds. The different sensory neurons appear to act in relatively independent neural circuits to differentially affect the multiple steps that comprise feeding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Harmful environmental agents cause nasal inflammation, and chronic nasal inflammation induces a loss of olfactory sensory neurons and reversible atrophy of the olfactory bulb (OB). Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying this inflammation-induced OB atrophy by histologically and biochemically comparing the OB changes in mouse models of nasal inflammation and odor deprivation. In addition, we examined whether odor stimulation is necessary for OB recovery from atrophy. One group of adult male C57BL/6 mice was administered lipopolysaccharide unilaterally for 10 weeks to induce nasal inflammation (control animals received saline), and a second group received unilateral naris closures for 10 weeks of odor deprivation. The OBs atrophied in both models, but odor deprivation shrank the glomerular, external plexiform, mitral, and granule cell layers, whereas the olfactory nerve, glomerular, and external plexiform layers atrophied as a result of nasal inflammation. Additionally, nasal inflammation, but not odor deprivation, caused neuroinflammation in the OB, inducing glial activation and elevated expression of IL–1β and TNFα. After 10 weeks of nasal inflammation, mice were housed for another 10 weeks with no additional treatment or with unilateral naris closure. Nasal inflammation and glial activation subsided in both groups, but glomerular and external plexiform layers recovered only in those with no additional treatment. Our findings demonstrate that nasal inflammation and odor deprivation differentially induce layer-specific degeneration in the OB, that loss of olfactory sensory neuron activity rather than neuroinflammation is a major cause of inflammation-induced OB atrophy, and that odor stimulation is required for OB recovery from atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Chronic nasal inflammation causes a loss of olfactory sensory neurons and atrophy of the olfactory bulb, which recovers when inflammation subsides. To reveal the mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced olfactory bulb atrophy, we compared the histological and biochemical changes in olfactory bulbs in mouse models of nasal inflammation and odor deprivation. In addition, we examined whether odor stimulation was required for the recovery of the olfactory bulb from atrophy. Our findings revealed that nasal inflammation and odor deprivation differentially induce layer-specific degeneration in the olfactory bulb, that loss of olfactory sensory neuron activity rather than neuroinflammation is a major cause of inflammation-induced olfactory bulb atrophy, and that odor stimulation is required for the olfactory bulb to recover from atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with a substantial genetic component and immune‐mediated neurodegeneration. Patients with MS show structural brain differences relative to individuals without MS, including smaller regional volumes and alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure. Whether genetic risk for MS is associated with brain structure during early neurodevelopment remains unclear. In this study, we explore the association between MS polygenic risk scores (PRS) and brain imaging outcomes from a large, population‐based pediatric sample to gain insight into the underlying neurobiology of MS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 8‐ to 12‐year‐old genotyped participants from the Generation R Study in whom T1‐weighted volumetric (n = 1,136) and/or diffusion tensor imaging (n = 1,088) had been collected. PRS for MS were calculated based on a large genome‐wide association study of MS (n = 41,505) and were regressed on regional volumes, global and tract‐specific fractional anisotropy (FA), and global mean diffusivity using linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No associations were observed for the regional volumes. We observed a positive association between the MS PRS and global FA (β = 0.098, standard error [SE] = 0.030, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.08 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). Tract‐specific analyses showed higher FA and lower radial diffusivity in several tracts. We replicated our findings in an independent sample of children (n = 186) who were scanned in an earlier phase (global FA; β = 0.189, SE = 0.072, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 9.40 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to show that greater genetic predisposition for MS is associated with higher global brain WM FA at an early age in the general population. Our results suggest a preadolescent time window within neurodevelopment in which MS risk variants act upon the brain. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much controversy about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep‐disordered breathing on the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between markers of sleep‐related hypoxemia and brain anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used data from a large‐scale cohort from the general population (n = 775, 50.6% males, age range = 45–86 years, mean age = 60.3 ± 9.9) that underwent full polysomnography and brain MRI to correlate respiratory variables with regional brain volume estimates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors, only mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with bilateral volume of hippocampus (right: p = 0.001; left: p &amp;lt; 0.001), thalamus (right: p &amp;lt; 0.001; left: p &amp;lt; 0.001), putamen (right: p = 0.001; left: p = 0.001) and angular gyrus (right: p = 0.011; left: p = 0.001). We observed the same relationship in left hemispheric amygdala (p = 0.010), caudate (p = 0.008), inferior frontal gyrus (p = 0.004) and supramarginal gyrus (p = 0.003). The other respiratory variables ‐ lowest oxygen saturation, % of sleep time with oxygen saturation &amp;lt; 90%, apnea‐hypopnea index and oxygen desaturation index ‐ did not show any significant association with brain volumes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with atrophy of cortical and subcortical brain areas known for high sensitivity to oxygen supply. Their vulnerability to hypoxemia may contribute to behavioral phenotype and cognitive decline in patients with sleep‐disordered breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Long-term synaptic plasticity is widely believed to underlie learning and memory in the brain. Whether plasticity is primarily expressed pre- or postsynaptically has been the subject of considerable debate for many decades. More recently, it is generally agreed that the locus of plasticity depends on a number of factors, such as developmental stage, induction protocol, and synapse type. Since presynaptic expression alters not just the gain but also the short-term dynamics of a synapse, whereas postsynaptic expression only modifies the gain, the locus has fundamental implications for circuits dynamics and computations in the brain. It therefore remains crucial for our understanding of neuronal circuits to know the locus of expression of long-term plasticity. One classical method for elucidating whether plasticity is pre- or postsynaptically expressed is based on analysis of the coefficient of variation (CV), which serves as a measure of noise levels of synaptic neurotransmission. Here, we provide a practical guide to using CV analysis for the purposes of exploring the locus of expression of long-term plasticity, primarily aimed at beginners in the field. We provide relatively simple intuitive background to an otherwise theoretically complex approach as well as simple mathematical derivations for key parametric relationships. We list important pitfalls of the method, accompanied by accessible computer simulations to better illustrate the problems (downloadable from GitHub), and we provide straightforward solutions for these issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Experience-dependent learning and memory require multiple forms of plasticity at hippocampal and cortical synapses that are regulated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDAR, AMPAR). These plasticity mechanisms include long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), which are Hebbian input-specific mechanisms that rapidly increase or decrease AMPAR synaptic strength at specific inputs, and homeostatic plasticity that globally scales-up or -down AMPAR synaptic strength across many or even all inputs. Frequently, these changes in synaptic strength are also accompanied by a change in the subunit composition of AMPARs at the synapse due to the trafficking to and from the synapse of receptors lacking GluA2 subunits. These GluA2-lacking receptors are most often GluA1 homomeric receptors that exhibit higher single-channel conductance and are Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable (CP-AMPAR). This review article will focus on the role of protein phosphorylation in regulation of GluA1 CP-AMPAR recruitment and removal from hippocampal synapses during synaptic plasticity with an emphasis on the crucial role of local signaling by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN) that is coordinated by the postsynaptic scaffold protein A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP79/150).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sex-determining region Y box 2 (Sox2), expressed in neural tissues, plays an important role as a transcription factor not only in the pluripotency and proliferation of neuronal cells but also in the opposite function of cell differentiation. Nevertheless, how Sox2 is linked to motor neuron development remains unknown. Here, we showed that Sox2 was localized in the motor neurons of spinal cord by in situ hybridization and cell separation, which acted as a positive regulator of motor neuron development. The deficiency of Sox2 in zebrafish larvae resulted in abnormal PMN development, including truncated but excessively branched CaP axons, loss of MiP, and increase of undifferentiated neuron cells. Importantly, transcriptome analysis showed that Sox2-depleted embryos caused many neurogenesis, axonogenesis, axon guidance, and differentiation-related gene expression changes, which further support the vital function of Sox2 in motor neuron development. Taken together, these data indicate that Sox2 plays a crucial role in the motor neuron development by regulating neuron differentiation and morphology of neuron axons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To understand the neural mechanism of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), the after-effects following one session or multiple days of stimulation have been widely investigated. However, the relation between the short-term effect (STE) and long-term effect (LTE) of rTMS is largely unknown. This study aims to explore whether the after-effects of 5-day rTMS on supplementary motor area (SMA) network could be predicted by one-session response. A primary cohort of 38 healthy participants underwent five daily sessions of real or sham continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) on the left SMA. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired at the first (before and after the first stimulation) and sixth experimental day. The SMA connectivity changes after the first cTBS and after 5 days of stimulation were defined as STE and LTE, respectively. Compared to the baseline, significant STE and LTE were found in the bilateral paracentral gyrus (ParaCG) after real stimulation, suggesting shared neural correlates of short- and long-term stimulations. Region-of-interest analysis indicated that the resting-state functional connectivity between SMA and ParaCG increased after real stimulation, while no significant change was found after sham stimulation. Leave-one-out cross-validation indicated that the LTE in ParaCG could be predicted by the STE after real but not sham stimulations. In an independent cohort, the after-effects of rTMS on ParaCG and short- to long-term prediction were reproduced at the region-of-interest level. These imaging evidences indicate that one-session rTMS can aid to predict the regions responsive to long-term stimulation and the individualized response degree.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Itinerant dynamics of the brain generates transient and recurrent spatiotemporal patterns in neuroimaging data. Characterizing metastable functional connectivity (FC) – particularly at rest and using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) – has shaped the field of dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). Mainstream DFC research relies on (sliding window) correlations to identify recurrent FC patterns. Recently, functional relevance of the instantaneous phase synchrony (IPS) of fMRI signals has been revealed using imaging studies and computational models. In the present paper, we identify the repertoire of whole-brain inter-network IPS states at rest. Moreover, we uncover a hierarchy in the temporal organization of IPS modes. We hypothesize that connectivity disorder in schizophrenia (SZ) is related to the (deep) temporal arrangement of large-scale IPS modes. Hence, we analyze resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy controls (HC) and 51 SZ patients. Seven resting-state networks (and their sub-components) are identified using spatial independent component analysis. IPS is computed between subject-specific network time courses, using analytic signals. The resultant phase coupling patterns, across time and subjects, are clustered into eight IPS states. Statistical tests show that the relative expression and mean lifetime of certain IPS states have been altered in SZ. Namely, patients spend (45%) less time in a globally coherent state and a subcortical-centered state, and (40%) more time in states reflecting anticoupling within the cognitive control network, compared to the HC. Moreover, the transition profile (between states) reveals a deep temporal structure, shaping two metastates with distinct phase synchrony profiles. A metastate is a collection of states such that within-metastate transitions are more probable than across. Remarkably, metastate occupation balance is altered in SZ, in favor of the less synchronous metastate that promotes disconnection across networks. Furthermore, the trajectory of IPS patterns is less efficient, less smooth, and more restricted in SZ subjects, compared to the HC. Finally, a regression analysis confirms the diagnostic value of the defined IPS measures for SZ identification, highlighting the distinctive role of metastate proportion. Our results suggest that the proposed IPS features may be used for classification studies and for characterizing phase synchrony modes in other (clinical) populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Developing a machine learning-based approach which could provide quantitative identification of major depressive disorder (MDD) is essential for the diagnosis and intervention of this disorder. However, the performances of traditional algorithms using static functional connectivity (SFC) measures were unsatisfactory. In the present work, we exploit the hidden information embedded in dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) and developed an accurate and objective image-based diagnosis system for MDD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;MRI images were collected from 99 participants including 56 healthy controls and 43 MDD patients. DFC was calculated using a sliding-window algorithm. A non-linear support vector machine (SVM) approach was then used with the DFC matrices as features to distinguish MDD patients from healthy controls. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the most discriminative features were then investigated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The area under the curve (AUC) of the SVM classifier with DFC measures reached 0.9913, while this value is only 0.8685 for the algorithm using SFC measures. Spatially, the most discriminative 28 connections distributed in the visual network (VN), somatomotor network (SMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), limbic network (LN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and default mode network (DMN), etc. Notably, a large portion of these connections were associated with the FPN, DMN, and VN. Temporally, the most discriminative connections transited from the cortex to deeper regions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results clearly suggested that DFC is superior to SFC and provide a reliable quantitative identification method for MDD. Our findings may furnish a better understanding of the neural mechanisms of MDD as well as improve accurate diagnosis and early intervention of this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previously conducted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on the neuroanatomical correlates of mathematical abilities and competencies have several methodological limitations. Besides small sample sizes, the majority of these studies have employed voxel-based morphometry (VBM)—a method that, although it is easy to implement, has some major drawbacks. Taking this into account, the current study is the first to investigate in a large sample of typically developed adults the associations between mathematical abilities and variations in brain surface structure by using surface-based morphometry (SBM). SBM is a method that also allows the investigation of brain morphometry by avoiding the pitfalls of VBM. Eighty-nine young adults were tested with a large battery of psychometric tests to measure mathematical competencies in four different areas: (1) simple arithmetic; (2) complex arithmetic; (3) higher-order mathematics; and (4) numerical intelligence. Also, we asked participants for their mathematics grades for their final school exams. Inside the MRI scanner, we collected high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images from each subject. SBM analyses were performed with the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12) and indices for cortical thickness, for cortical surface complexity, for gyrification, and sulcal depth were calculated. Further analyses revealed associations between: (1) the cortical surface complexity of the right superior temporal gyrus and numerical intelligence; (2) the depth of the right central sulcus and adults’ ability to solve complex arithmetic problems; and (3) the depth of the left parieto-occipital sulcus and adults’ higher-order mathematics competence. Interestingly, no relationships with previously reported brain regions were observed, thus, suggesting the importance of similar research to confirm the role of the brain regions found in this study.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Measures of the brain’s automatic electrophysiological responses to sounds represent a potential tool for identifying age- and depression-related neural markers. However, these markers have rarely been studied related to aging and depression within one study. Here, we investigated auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in the brain that may show different alterations related to aging and depression. We used an oddball condition employing changes in sound intensity to investigate: (i) sound intensity dependence; (ii) sensory gating; and (iii) change detection, all within a single paradigm. The ERPs of younger (18–40 years) and older (62–80 years) depressed female participants and age-matched non-depressed participants were measured. Intensity dependence was examined as the difference between N1 responses to repeated high- and low-intensity sounds, sensory gating as N1 responses to rare and repeated sounds, and change detection as indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN). We found that intensity dependence was greater in older participants than younger ones, indicating effects related to aging but not to depression. For sensory gating, we found depression- and age-related alterations as increased N1 responses. No group differences were found for MMN. Although a sensory gating deficit was expected in older adults, this study is the first to demonstrate age-related overexcitability in sound intensity dependency. The results indicate that automatic brain responses to sound intensity changes are suitable for studying age- and depression-related neural markers but may not be sensitive enough to differentiate the effects of aging and depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Meaningfulness has been suggested as one of the fundamental psychological needs, as one would actively pursue meaning in both his/her work life and personal life. Previous studies consistently showed that a lack of meaning in work would reduce one’s autonomous motivation in the current job, which is the motivation to engage in self-determined activities driven by one’s own interests or personal beliefs. However, researchers overlooked the fact that in work settings, it is not uncommon that people work on multiple tasks in a row. As a result, the cross-task effect of work meaningfulness remains understudied. Based on the meaning maintenance model (MMM) and the suggested fluid compensation strategy, we predicted that the disappearance of the meaning of work may induce a compensatory response and thus enhance one’s autonomous motivation in an irrelevant ensuing activity. To test this hypothesis, we invited participants to work on an encyclopedic knowledge quiz in Session 1 and a StopWatch (SW) task in Session 2. A between-subject design was adopted. While participants in the control group successfully completed their tasks in Session 1, those in the experimental group encountered unexpected program quits by the end of the quiz, and their previous efforts suddenly became futile and meaningless. Electroencephalography was recorded during the experiment to measure reward positivity (RewP). In Session 2, a more pronounced RewP in the win–lose difference wave was observed in the experimental group in contrast to the control group, suggesting that the disappearance of the meaning of work enhanced one’s autonomous motivation in an irrelevant activity that follows. Therefore, results of this study provided preliminary electrophysiological evidence for one’s pursuit of meaning and the compensation effect induced by the disappearance of the meaning of work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
