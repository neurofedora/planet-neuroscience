 The strength of learned associations between pairs of stimuli is affected by multiple factors, the most extensively studied of which is prior experience with the stimuli themselves. In contrast, little data is available regarding how experience with incidental stimuli (independent of any conditioning situation) impacts later learning. This lack of research is striking given the importance of incidental experience to survival. We have recently begun to fill this void using conditioned taste aversion (CTA), wherein an animal learns to avoid a taste that has been associated with malaise. We previously demonstrated that incidental exposure to salty and sour tastes (taste pre-exposure, TPE) enhances aversions learned later to sucrose. Here, we investigate the neurobiology underlying this phenomenon. First, we use immediate early gene (cFos) expression to identify gustatory cortex (GC) as a site at which TPE specifically increases the neural activation caused by taste-malaise pairing (i.e., TPE did not change cFos induced by either stimulus in isolation). Next, we use site-specific infection with the optical silencer Archaerhodopsin-T to show that GC inactivation during TPE inhibits the expected enhancements of both learning and CTA related cFos expression, a full day later. Thus, we conclude that GC is almost certainly a vital part of the circuit that integrates incidental experience into later associative learning.</content>

 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) modulate attention, memory, and higher executive functioning, but it has remained unclear whether nAChR sub-receptors tap into different neural mechanisms of these functions. We therefore set out to contrast the contributions of selective alpha-7 nAChR and alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR agonists in mediating value learning and attentional filtering of distractors in the nonhuman primate. We found that the alpha-7 nAChR agonist PHA- 543613 selectively enhanced the learning speed of feature values but did not modulate how salient distracting information was filtered from ongoing choice processes. In contrast, the selective alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR agonist ABT-089 did not affect learning speed but reduced distractibility. This double dissociation was dose-dependent and evident in the absence of systematic changes in overall performance, reward intake, motivation to perform the task, perseveration tendencies, or reaction times. These results suggest nicotinic sub-receptor-specific mechanisms consistent with (1) alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR specific amplification of cholinergic transients in prefrontal cortex linked to enhanced cue detection in light of interferences, and (2) alpha-7 nAChR specific activation prolonging cholinergic transients, which could facilitate subjects to follow-through with newly established attentional strategies when outcome contingencies change. These insights will be critical for developing function-specific drugs alleviating attention and learning deficits in neuro-psychiatric diseases.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) of the non-human primate show neural firing correlations and synchronize at theta and beta frequencies during the monitoring and shifting of attention. These functional interactions might be based on synaptic connectivity that is equally efficacious in both directions, but it might be that there are systematic asymmetries in connectivity consistent with reports of more effective inhibition within the ACC than lPFC, or with a preponderance of ACC projections synapsing onto inhibitory neurons in the lPFC. Here, we tested effective ACC-lPFC connectivity in awake monkeys and report systematic asymmetries in the temporal patterning and latencies of effective connectivity as measured using electrical microstimulation. We found that ACC stimulation triggered evoked fields (EFPs) were more likely to be multiphasic in the lPFC than in the reverse direction, with a large proportion of connections showing 2-4 inflection points resembling resonance in the 20-30 Hz beta frequency range. Stimulation of ACC [-&amp;gt;] lPFC resulted, on average, in shorter-latency EFPs than lPFC [-&amp;gt;] ACC. Overall, latencies and connectivity strength varied more than two-fold depending on the precise anterior-to-posterior location of the connections. These findings reveal systematic asymmetries in effective connectivity between ACC and lPFC in the awake non-human primate and document the spatial and temporal patchiness of effective synaptic connections. We speculate that measuring effective connectivity profiles will be essential for understanding how local synaptic efficacy and synaptic connectivity translates into functional neuronal interactions to support adaptive behaviors.</content>

 Altered protein post-translational modifications such as glycosylation have become a target of investigation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Disrupted glycosylation associated processes including atypical sphingolipid metabolism, reduced polysialylation of cell adhesion molecules, abnormal proteoglycan expression, and irregular glycan synthesis and branching have also been reported in this disorder. These pathways are regulated by the expression of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, classes of enzymes which comprise approximately 2% of the genome. Many glycosylation enzymes can participate in multiple glycosylation pathways and dysregulation of enzyme expression could represent a common mechanism leading to a variety of glycan processing deficits in schizophrenia. In matched pairs of elderly schizophrenia and comparison subject (N = 12 pairs) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we measured mRNA levels of 84 key glycosylation enzymes by qPCR array. We found dysregulated transcript expression of 36 glycosylation enzymes from 12 functional categories. All of the abnormally expressed enzymes demonstrated increased transcript expression in schizophrenia, and many altered enzymes are known to modify substrates that have been previously implicated in the pathophysiology this illness. These findings suggest that abnormal glycosylation enzyme expression in schizophrenia may contribute to dysregulation of multiple glycosylation pathways, and disruptions of these central cell signaling processes may underlie a variety of deficits in schizophrenia.</content>

 Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons are increasingly used as a model to study developmental aspects of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. To study the complex relationship of rare (penetrant) variant(s) and common (weaker) polygenic risk variant(s) to ASD, isogenic iPSC-derived neurons from probands and family-based controls, for modeling, is critical. We developed a standardized set of procedures, designed to control for heterogeneity in reprogramming and differentiation, and generated 53 different iPSC-derived glutamatergic neuronal lines from 25 participants from 12 unrelated families with ASD (14 ASD-affected individuals, 3 unaffected siblings, 8 unaffected parents). Heterozygous de novo (7 families; 16p11.2, NRXN1, DLGAP2, CAPRIN1, VIP, ANOS1, THRA) and rare-inherited (2 families; CNTN5, AGBL4) presumed-damaging variants were characterized in ASD risk genes/loci. In three additional families, functional candidates for ASD (SET), and combinations of putative etiologic variants (GLI3/KIF21A and EHMT2/UBE2I combinations in separate families), were modeled. We used a large-scale multi-electrode array (MEA) as our primary high-throughput phenotyping assay, followed by patch clamp recordings. Our most compelling new results revealed a consistent spontaneous network hyperactivity in neurons deficient for CNTN5 or EHMT2. Our biobank of iPSC-derived neurons and accompanying genomic data are available to accelerate ASD research.</content>

 The modulation of an animal's behavior through external sensory stimuli, previous experience and its internal state is crucial to survive in a constantly changing environment. In mammals, the adrenergic system modulates a variety of physiological processes and behaviors by shifting the organism from a relaxed or dormant condition to a responsive, excited and alerted state. In insects, this response is mediated by the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline, octopamine (OA) and its precursor tyramine (TA). Even though OA/TA neurons of the central brain are described on single cell level in Drosophila melanogaster, the periphery was largely omitted from anatomical studies. Given that OA/TA is involved in behaviors like feeding, flying and locomotion, which highly depend on a variety of peripheral organs, it is necessary to study the peripheral connections of these neurons to get a complete picture of the OA/TA circuitry. We here describe the anatomy of this aminergic system in relation to peripheral tissues of the entire fly. OA/TA neurons arborize onto skeletal muscles all over the body and innervate reproductive organs, the heart, the corpora allata, and sensory neurons in the antenna, wings and halteres underlining their relevance in modulating complex behaviors.</content>

To study synaptic plasticity in human neuronal circuits poses a huge challenge, since live human neurons and synapses are not readily accessible. Despite this, various lines of research have provided insights in properties of adult human synapses and their plasticity both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with some unexpected surprises. We first discuss the experimental approaches to study activity-dependent plasticity of adult human synapses, and then highlight rules and mechanisms of Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) found in these synapses. Finally, we conclude with thoughts on how these synaptic principles can underlie human learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to partially complementary regions within the 3’UTR of their target genes. Computational methods play an important role in target prediction and assume that the miRNA “seed region” (nt 2 to 8) is required for functional targeting, but typically only identify ∼80% of known bindings. Recent studies have highlighted a role for the entire miRNA, suggesting that a more flexible methodology is needed. We present a novel approach for miRNA target prediction based on Deep Learning (DL) which, rather than incorporating any knowledge (such as seed regions), investigates the entire miRNA and 3’TR mRNA nucleotides to learn a uninhibited set of feature descriptors related to the targeting process. We collected more than 150,000 experimentally validated homo sapiens miRNA:gene targets and cross referenced them with different CLIP-Seq, CLASH and iPAR-CLIP datasets to obtain ∼20,000 validated miRNA:gene exact target sites. Using this data, we implemented and trained a deep neural network—composed of autoencoders and a feed-forward network—able to automatically learn features describing miRNA-mRNA interactions and assess functionality. Predictions were then refined using information such as site location or site accessibility energy. In a comparison using independent datasets, our DL approach consistently outperformed existing prediction methods, recognizing the seed region as a common feature in the targeting process, but also identifying the role of pairings outside this region. Thermodynamic analysis also suggests that site accessibility plays a role in targeting but that it cannot be used as a sole indicator for functionality.

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Selecting the most advantageous actions in a changing environment is a central feature of adaptive behavior. The midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons along with the major targets of their projections, including dopaminoceptive neurons in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia, play a key role in this process. Here, we investigate the consequences of a selective genetic disruption of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGluR5) receptors in the DA system on adaptive choice behavior, in mice. We tested the effects of the mutation on performance in the probabilistic reinforcement learning and probability discounting tasks. In case of the probabilistic choice, both the loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or loss mGluR5 receptors in D1 receptor-expressing dopaminoceptive neurons reduced the probability of selecting the more rewarded alternative and lowered the likelihood of returning to the previously rewarded alternative (win-stay). When observed behavior was fitted to reinforcement learning models, we found that these two mutations were associated with reduced effect of expected outcome on choice, i.e. more random choices. None of the mutations affected probability discounting, which indicates that all animals had normal ability to assess probability. However, in both behavioral tasks animals with targeted loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or mGluR5 receptors in D1 neurons were significantly slower to perform choices. In conclusion, these results show that glutamate receptor-dependent signaling in the DA system is essential for the speed and accuracy of choices, but at the same time probably not critical for correct estimation of probable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the role of glutamate signaling in the brain’s reward system in adaptive decision-making. We used genetically modified mice with disruption of glutamate signaling, that was caused by deletion of glutamate receptors in dopamine-producing and dopamine-sensitive neurons. When mutant mice were offered a choice between two alternatives with varying chances of being rewarded, the mutations decreased the probability of selecting the more often rewarded alternative, and the likelihood of repeating previously rewarded choice. Moreover, mutant animals were much slower in performing choices. Our results show that when glutamate signaling in the reward system is disrupted, it causes an impairment in decision-making, by increasing randomness and reducing the speed of decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;&quot;Slips of action&quot; occur in everyday life when we momentarily lose sight of a goal (for example when in a rush or distracted). Associative models propose that these habitual responses can be activated via a direct stimulus-response mechanism, regardless of the current hedonic value of the outcome. The slips-of-action task (SOAT) has been extensively used in both healthy and pathological populations to measure habit tendencies – the likelihood of making erroneous responses for devalued outcomes. Inspection of behavioral performance does not reveal, however, whether the impairments were due to impaired goal-directed control or aberrantly strong habit formation. In the current study we used functional MRI while human participants performed both the instrumental training and SOAT test phases, to elucidate the relative contributions of these mechanisms to performance on the SOAT. On trials in which conflict arises between competing goal-directed and habitual responses we observed increased activation across areas including the anterior cingulate cortex, paracingulate gyrus, lateral OFC, insula and inferior frontal gyrus. Responding for devalued outcomes was related to increased activation in the premotor cortex and cerebellum – implicating these regions in habitual responding. Increased activation in the caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal pole during training was associated with better performance during the test phase, indicative of goal-directed action control. These results endorse interpretation of the SOAT in terms of competing goal-directed and habitual mechanisms and highlight that cognitive control processes present an additional bottleneck for successful performance on this task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Imagine that you step in the car intending to drive to your new office but distracted, end up driving the route to your old office instead. We are all familiar with the feeling that results from inadvertently carrying out a previously valid behavior, even if we no longer desire the consequence. In the current study we examined how the brain reacts to cues that signal a previously rewarded response whose outcome value has now changed. We were also able to identify the brain regions that were activated when participants made an erroneous (habitual) response under time-pressure. These results give us a richer sense of how the brain acts to control behavior when goal-directed processes are otherwise engaged.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that functional connectivity (FC) can accurately
predict the identity of a subject performing a task and the type of task being
performed. We replicate these results using a large dataset collected at the
OSU Center for Cognitive and Behavioral Brain Imaging. We also introduce a
novel perspective on task and subject identity prediction: BOLD Variability
(BV). Conceptually, BV is a region-specific measure based on the variance
within each brain region. BV is simple to compute, interpret, and visualize. We
show that both FC and BV are predictive of task and subject, even across
scanning sessions separated by multiple years. Subject differences rather than
task differences account for the majority of changes in BV and FC. Similar to
results in FC, we show that BV is reduced during cognitive tasks relative to
rest.

 &lt;p&gt;A fundamental understanding of the network architecture of the brain is
necessary for the further development of theories explicating circuit function.
Perhaps as a derivative of its initial application to abstract informational
systems, network science provides many methods and summary statistics that
address the network's topological characteristics with little or no thought to
its physical instantiation. Recent progress has capitalized on quantitative
tools from network science to parsimoniously describe and predict neural
activity and connectivity across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Yet, for
embedded systems, physical laws can directly constrain processes of network
growth, development, and function, and an appreciation of those physical laws
is therefore critical to an understanding of the system. Recent evidence
demonstrates that the constraints imposed by the physical shape of the brain,
and by the mechanical forces at play in its development, have marked effects on
the observed network topology and function. Here, we review the rules imposed
by space on the development of neural networks and show that these rules give
rise to a specific set of complex topologies. We present evidence that these
fundamental wiring rules affect the repertoire of neural dynamics that can
emerge from the system, and thereby inform our understanding of network
dysfunction in disease. We also discuss several computational tools,
mathematical models, and algorithms that have proven useful in delineating the
effects of spatial embedding on a given networked system and are important
considerations for addressing future problems in network neuroscience. Finally,
we outline several open questions regarding the network architectures that
support circuit function, the answers to which will require a thorough and
honest appraisal of the role of physical space in brain network anatomy and
physiology.

 &lt;p&gt;This review presents recent and older results on elementary quantitative and
qualitative aspects of consciousness and cognition and tackles the question
&quot;What is consciousness?&quot; conjointly from biological, neuroscience-cognitive,
physical and mathematical points of view. It proposes to unify various results
and theories by means of information topology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapter presents the postulates and results on elementary
perception at various organizational scales of the nervous system and proposes
the hypothesis of an electrodynamic intrinsic nature of consciousness which is
sustained by an analogical code. It underlines the diversity of the learning
mechanisms that sustain the dynamics of perception and consciousness, including
adaptive and homeostatic processes on multiple scales.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second chapter investigates the logical aspects of cognition and
consciousness and proposes an axiomatization based on measure and probability
theory. Topos and constructive logic are presented as providing an intrinsic
probabilistic logic, with the long-term aim of avoiding the paradoxical
decomposition induced by the Axiom of Choice. We sketch an elementary procedure
allowing an expression of the information of a mathematical formula a la Godel.
We then present the formalism of information topology and propose that it
provides a preliminary basis for synthesizing the main models of cognition and
consciousness within a formal Gestalt theory. Information topology establishes
a characterization of information theory functions, allowing for a precise
expression of information structures and patterns. It provides a quantification
of the structure of statistical interactions and their expression in terms of
statistical physics and machine learning. Notably, those topological methods
allow conciliation of some of the main theories of consciousness.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;P300-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are often trained per-user and
per-application space. Training such models requires ground truth knowledge of
target and non-target stimulus categories during model training, which imparts
bias into the model. Additionally, not all non-targets are created equal; some
may contain visual features that resemble targets or may otherwise be visually
salient. Current research has indicated that non-target distractors may elicit
attenuated P300 responses based on the perceptual similarity of these
distractors to the target category. To minimize this bias, and enable a more
nuanced analysis, we use a generalized BCI approach that is fit to neither user
nor task. We do not seek to improve the overall accuracy of the BCI with our
generalized approach; we instead demonstrate the utility of our approach for
identifying target-related image features. When combined with other intelligent
agents, such as computer vision systems, the performance of the generalized
model equals that of the user-specific models, without any user specific data.

 The severity of intestinal disease associated with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is variable in the patient population and this variability is partially conferred by the influence of modifier genes. Genome-wide association studies have identified &lt;i&gt;SLC6A14&lt;/i&gt;, an electrogenic amino acid transporter, as a genetic modifier of CF-associated meconium ileus. The purpose of the current work was to determine the biological role of &lt;i&gt;Slc6a14&lt;/i&gt;, by disrupting its expression in CF mice bearing the major mutation, F508del. We found that disruption of &lt;i&gt;Slc6a14&lt;/i&gt; worsened the intestinal fluid secretion defect characteristic of these mice. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of mouse intestinal organoids revealed that exacerbation of the primary defect was associated with reduced arginine uptake across the apical membrane, with aberrant nitric oxide and cyclic GMP mediated regulation of the major CF-causing mutant protein. Together, these studies highlight the role of this apical transporter in modifying cellular nitric oxide levels, residual function of the major CF mutant and potentially, its promise as a therapeutic target.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represent two ends of a disease spectrum with shared clinical, genetic and pathological features. These include near ubiquitous pathological inclusions of the RNA binding protein (RBP) TDP-43, and often the presence of a GGGGCC expansion in the &lt;i&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/i&gt; (C9) gene. Previously we reported that the sequestration of hnRNP H altered the splicing of target transcripts in C9ALS patients (Conlon et al. 2016). Here we show that this signature also occurs in half of 50 post-mortem sporadic, non-C9 ALS/FTD brains. Furthermore, and equally surprisingly, these 'like-C9' brains also contained correspondingly high amounts of insoluble TDP-43, as well as several other disease-related RBPs, and this correlates with widespread global splicing defects. Finally, we show that the like-C9 sporadic patients, like actual C9ALS patients, were much more likely to have developed FTD. We propose that these unexpected links between C9 and sporadic ALS/FTD define a common mechanism in this disease spectrum.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Many Bacteria and Archaea employ the heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr)-like sulfur oxidation pathway. The relevant genes are inevitably associated with genes encoding lipoate-binding proteins (LbpA). Here, deletion of the gene identified LbpA as an essential component of the Hdr-like sulfur-oxidizing system in the Alphaproteobacterium &lt;i&gt;Hyphomicrobium denitrificans&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, a biological function was established for the universally conserved cofactor lipoate that is markedly different from its canonical roles in central metabolism. LbpAs likely function as sulfur-binding entities presenting substrate to different catalytic sites of the Hdr-like complex, similar to the substrate-channeling function of lipoate in carbon-metabolizing multienzyme complexes, e.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase. LbpAs serve a specific function in sulfur oxidation, cannot functionally replace the related GcvH protein in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis &lt;/i&gt;and are not modified by the canonical &lt;i&gt;E. coli &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt; lipoyl attachment machineries. Instead, LplA-like lipoate-protein ligases encoded in or in immediate vicinity of &lt;i&gt;hdr-lpbA &lt;/i&gt;gene clusters act specifically on these proteins.</content>

 We report the near atomic resolution (3.3 Å) of the human polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1 (polycystin 2-l1) ion channel. Encoded by PKD2L1, polycystin 2-l1 is a calcium and monovalent cation-permeant ion channel in primary cilia and plasma membranes. The related primary cilium-specific polycystin-2 protein, encoded by PKD2, shares a high degree of sequence similarity, yet has distinct permeability characteristics.

 Sequential sampling models have provided a dominant theoretical framework guiding computational and neurophysiological investigations of perceptual decision-making. While these models share the basic principle that decisions are formed by accumulating sensory evidence to a bound, they come in many forms that can make similar predictions of choice behaviour despite invoking fundamentally different mechanisms. The identification of neural signals that reflect some of the core computations underpinning decision formation offers new avenues for empirically testing and refining key model assumptions.</content>

 The central nervous system is not a static, hard-wired organ. Examples of neuroplasticity, whether at the level of the synapse, the cell, or within and between circuits, can be found during development, throughout the progression of disease, or after injury. One essential component of the molecular, anatomical, and functional changes associated with neuroplasticity is the spinal interneuron (SpIN). Here, we draw on recent multidisciplinary studies to identify and interrogate subsets of SpINs and their roles in locomotor and respiratory circuits.</content>

 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is increasingly evaluated for a myriad of clinical indications and performance enhancement mainly related to cognitive and motor applications. As a result tDCS has been tested with diverse inclusion criteria and subject populations. tDCS is customized for applications by many factors, including stimulation dose (montage, current, time), associated training and subject inclusion/exclusion criteria. The rapid proliferation of applications, technological advancements and emerging scientific discoveries presents challenges to the organization and consolidation of tDCS data - which can lead to scientific, clinical and public confusions. In this paper, we develop a system to summarize and consolidate methodological aspects of tDCS, concentrating on study design and the physical parameters of the stimulation. We introduce a community-driven, open access database, where these parameters, including stimulation intensities, duration, electrode sizes, montages, and subject information, are noted for relevant tDCS publications. The transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Studies Open Database (tDCS-OD) (http://tdcsdatabase.com) will support constructive dialogue on research and clinical tDCS applications, critical evaluation of past work, and identification of promising protocols, while reducing ambiguity about stimulation methodology. The database design allows ongoing updates and editing, with transparent version control. At the moment, the database includes information about 56,613 tDCS sessions.</content>

 Quick reorientation is an essential part of successful navigation. Despite growing attention to this ability, little is known about how reorientation happens in humans. To this aim, we recorded EEG from 34 participants. Participants were navigating a simple virtual reality plus-maze where at the beginning of each trial they were randomly teleported to either the North or the South alley. Results show that the teleportation event caused a quick reorientation effect over occipito-parietal areas as early as 100 msec; meaning that despite the known stochastic nature of the teleportation, participants built up expectations for their place of arrival. This result has important consequences for the optimal design of virtual reality locomotion.</content>

 The corticospinal tract (CST) is one of the most well-studied tracts in human neuroanatomy. Its clinical significance can be demonstrated in many notable traumatic conditions and diseases such as stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). With the advent of diffusion MRI and tractography the computational representation of the human CST in a 3D model became available. However, the representation of the entire CST and, specifically, the hand motor area has remained elusive. In this paper we proposed a novel method, using manually-drawn ROIs based on robustly identifiable neuroanatomic structures to delineate the entire CST and isolate its hand motor representation as well as to estimate their variability and generate a database of their volume, length and biophysical parameters. Using 37 healthy human subjects we performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the CST and the hand-related motor fiber tracts (HMFTs). Finally, we have created variability heatmaps from 37 subjects for both the aforementioned tracts, which could be utilized as reference for clinicians to explore neuropathology in both trauma and disease states.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Dysregulation of the complement system is implicated in neurodegeneration, including human and animal glaucoma. Optic nerve and retinal damage in glaucoma is preceded by local complement upregulation and activation, but whether targeting this early innate immune response could have therapeutic benefit remains undefined. Because complement signals through three pathways that intersect at complement C3 activation, here we targeted this step to restore complement balance in the glaucomatous retina, and to determine its contribution to degeneration onset and/or progression. To achieve this, we combined adeno-associated viral retinal gene therapy with the targeted C3 inhibitor CR2-Crry. We show that intravitreal injection of AAV2.CR2-Crry produced sustained Crry overexpression in the retina, and reduced deposition of the activation product complement C3d on retinal ganglion cells and the inner retina of DBA/2J mice. This resulted in neuroprotection of retinal ganglion cell axons and somata despite continued intraocular pressure elevation, suggesting a direct restriction of neurodegeneration onset and progression, and significant delay to terminal disease stages. Our study uncovers a damaging effect of complement C3 or downstream complement activation in glaucoma and establishes AAV2.CR2-Crry as a viable therapeutic strategy to target pathogenic C3-mediated complement activation in the glaucomatous retina.</content>

 The United States is experiencing an opioid epidemic of significant proportions, imposing enormous fiscal and societal costs. While prescription opioid analgesics are essential for treating pain, the cessation of these drugs can induce a withdrawal syndrome, and thus opioid use often persists to alleviate or avoid these symptoms. Therefore, it is essential to understand the neurobiology underlying this critical window of withdrawal from opioid analgesics to prevent continued usage. To model this, we administered a low dose of morphine, and precipitated withdrawal with naloxone to investigate the behavioral and cellular responses in C57BL/6J male and female mice. Following 3 days of administration, both male and female mice sensitized to the repeated bouts of withdrawal, as evidenced by their composite global withdrawal score. Female mice exhibited increased withdrawal symptoms on some individual measures, but did not show characteristic weight loss observed in male mice. Because of its role in mediating withdrawal-associated behaviors, we examined neuronal excitability and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) 24 hours following the final precipitated withdrawal. In male mice, morphine withdrawal increased spontaneous GABAergic signaling compared to controls. In contrast, morphine withdrawal decreased spontaneous GABAergic signaling, and increased BNST projection neuron excitability in female mice. Intriguingly, these opposing GABAergic effects were dependent on within slice excitability. Our findings suggest that male and female mice manifest divergent cellular responses in the BNST following morphine withdrawal, and alterations in BNST inhibitory signaling may be a significant factor contributing to the expression of behaviors following opioid withdrawal.</content>

 In the absence of external feedback, a decision maker must rely on a subjective estimate of their decision accuracy in order to appropriately guide behavior. Normative models of perceptual decision making relate subjective estimates of internal signal quality (e.g. confidence) directly to the internal signal quality itself, thereby making it unknowable whether the subjective estimate or the underlying signal is what drives behavior. We constructed stimuli that dissociated human observer's performance on a visual estimation task from their subjective estimates of confidence in their performance, thus violating normative principles. To understand whether confidence influences future decision making, we examined serial dependence in observer's responses, a phenomenon whereby the estimate of a stimulus on the current trial can be biased towards the stimulus from the previous trial. We found that when decisions were made with high confidence, they conferred stronger biases upon the following trial, suggesting that confidence may enhance serial dependence. Critically, this finding was true also when confidence was experimentally dissociated from task performance, indicating that subjective confidence, in and of itself, can amplify serial dependence. These findings demonstrate an effect of confidence on future behavior, independent of task performance, and suggest that subjective confidence functions to enhance the continuity of the visual environment.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Since Denis Gabor's 1947 paper on the discrete Gabor Expansion [Gabor, 1947], time-frequency signal analysis has proven to be an important tool for many fields. In neurophysiology, time-frequency analysis has often been used to characterize and describe transient bursts in local field potential data. However, these transient bursts have a wide range of variable durations, suggesting that a time-frequency-scale dictionary composed of elementary signal &quot;atoms&quot; may prove useful to more accurately match recorded bursts. While overcomplete multiscale dictionaries are useful, generating a sparse code over such dictionaries is a difficult computational problem. Existing adaptive algorithms for discovering a sparse description are slow and computationally intensive. Here we describe the Multiscale Adaptive Gabor Expansion (MAGE), which uses an implicit dictionary of parametric time-frequency-scale Gabor atoms to perform fast parameter reassignment to accelerate discovery of a sparse decomposition. Using analytic expressions together with numerical computation, MAGE is a greedy pursuit algorithm similar to Matching Pursuit, restricted to a dictionary of multiscale Gaussian-envelope Gabor atoms. MAGE parameter reassignment is robust in the presence of moderate noise. By expressing a unknown signal as a weighted sum of Gabor atoms, MAGE permits a more accurate estimate of the amplitude and phase of transient bursts than existing methods.</content>

 Tau protein accumulation is the most common pathology among degenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), traumatic brain injury (TBI) and over twenty others. Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation is the closest correlate with cognitive decline and cell loss, yet the mechanisms mediating tau toxicity are poorly understood. NFT-containing neurons do not die, which suggests secondary mechanisms are driving toxicity. We evaluated gene expression patterns of NFT-containing neurons microdissected from AD patient brains and found they develop an expression profile consistent with cellular senescence described in dividing cells. This complex stress response induces a near permanent cell cycle arrest, adaptations to maintain survival, cellular remodeling, and metabolic dysfunction. Moreover, senescent cells induce chronic degeneration of surrounding tissue through the secretion of pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic molecules termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Using transgenic mouse models of tau-associated pathogenesis we found that NFTs induced a senescence-like phenotype including DNA damage, karyomegaly, mitochondrial dysfunction and SASP. Cdkn2a transcript level, a hallmark measure of senescence, directly correlated with brain atrophy and NFT load. This relationship extended to postmortem brain tissue from humans with PSP to indicate a phenomenon common to tau toxicity. Tau transgenic mice with late stage pathology were treated with senolytics to remove senescent cells. Despite the advanced age and disease progression, senolytic treatment reduced total NFT burden, neuron loss and ventricular enlargement; and normalized cerebral blood flow to that of non-transgenic control mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that NFTs induce cellular senescence in the brain, which contributes to neurodegeneration and brain dysfunction. Moreover, given the prevalence of tau protein deposition among neurodegenerative diseases, these findings have broad implications for understanding, and potentially treating, dozens of brain diseases.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Visual pattern detection and discrimination are essential first steps for scene analysis. Numerous human psychophysical studies have modeled visual pattern detection and discrimination by estimating linear templates for classifying noisy stimuli defined by spatial variations in pixel intensities. However, such methods are poorly suited to understanding sensory processing mechanisms for complex visual stimuli such as second-order boundaries defined by spatial differences in contrast or texture. Methodology / Principal Findings: We introduce a novel machine learning framework for modeling human perception of second-order visual stimuli, using image-computable hierarchical neural network models fit directly to psychophysical trial data. We apply this framework to modeling visual processing of boundaries defined by differences in the contrast of a carrier texture pattern, in two different psychophysical tasks: (1) boundary orientation identification, and (2) fine orientation discrimination. We utilize cross-validation analysis to optimize model hyper-parameters, and demonstrate that our models are able to accurately predict human performance on novel stimulus sets not used for fitting model parameters. We find that, like the ideal observer, human observers take a region-based approach to the orientation identification task, while taking an edge-based approach to the fine orientation discrimination task. We further investigate how observers integrate contrast modulation across orientation channels, by fitting psychophysical data with two models representing competing hypotheses, finding a preference for a model which combines multiple orientations at the earliest possible stage. We argue that this machine learning approach has much potential to advance the study of second-order visual processing, and we outline future steps towards generalizing our method to modeling visual segmentation of natural texture boundaries. Conclusions / Significance: This study demonstrates that machine learning methodology can be fruitfully applied to psychophysical studies of second-order visual processing.</content>

 The functional significance of the computations performed by Stellate cells of the Medial Entorhinal Cortex, proven time and again, makes them insightful, yet intriguing. The gradients of the intrinsic properties of these cells, aligned to the actual grid cell spacing gradients, have encouraged many thoughtful experiments. A long sought question in the stellate cell literature is thus the one seeking mechanistic implications for these correlates. The intrinsic dynamics of these cells have been tested previously in this light, primarily focusing on their spectral characteristics. However, the resonance phenomenon underlying these dynamics has not received the attention it deserves, and its potency under the in-vivo high conductance states to influence the input-output mapping remains to be estimated. In this light, we analyzed the signal gain of stellate cells in the presence of in-vivo like fluctuating conductance based synaptic inputs injected through the Dynamic clamp, in rat brain slices. We observed a consistent, HCN current sensitive, theta frequency peak in signal gain, indicating that the HCN current mediated resonance mechanisms are functional even under a heavy input barrage. Next, we tested the effects of an array of input statistics on this signal gain and observed it to be mostly unaffected by the input strength, but relatively susceptible to the input kinetics. Additionally, as a possible reflection of the underlying signal gain, we observed a significant theta modulation of inputs by HCN current, the extent of which was found to be influenced by the excitatory, but not inhibitory synaptic kinetics. Surprisingly, a corresponding modulation in the gamma frequencies was also observed for the firing rate response, wherein the signal gain in gamma frequencies was found to be higher in the presence of HCN, which also coincided with increased occurrence of bursts. A computational model with HCN-persistent sodium channels with similar simulated in vivo conditions could reproduce the experimental results, additionally suggesting the strength of inhibition and the kinetics of excitation as the input statistic based alternate resonance mechanisms which can operate independent of HCN. Our results thus suggest frequency dependent gain as an appropriate measure for analyzing the input-output mapping in the stellate cells, and point out the mechanisms via which the HCN currents and input statistics can interact and determine the scaling of responses in these cells.</content>

 Hunger state can substantially alter the perceived value of a stimulus, even to the extent that the same sensory cue can trigger antagonistic behaviors. How the nervous system uses such graded perceptual shifts to select between opposed motor patterns remains enigmatic. Here we challenged food-deprived and satiated Lymnaea to choose between two mutually exclusive behaviors, ingestion or egestion, produced by the same feeding central pattern generator. Decoding the underlying neural circuit reveals that the activity of central dopaminergic interneurons defines hunger state and drives network reconfiguration, biasing satiated animals towards the rejection of stimuli deemed palatable by food-deprived ones. By blocking the action of these neurons, satiated animals can be reconfigured to exhibit a hungry animal phenotype. This centralized mechanism occurs in the complete absence of sensory retuning and generalizes across different sensory modalities, allowing food-deprived animals to increase their perception of food value in a stimulus-independent manner to maximize potential calorific intake.</content>

 The proteome of the postsynaptic terminal of excitatory synapses comprises over one thousand proteins in vertebrate species and plays a central role in behavior and brain disease. The brain is organized into anatomically distinct regions and whether the synapse proteome differs across these regions is poorly understood. Postsynaptic proteomes were isolated from seven forebrain and hindbrain regions in mice and their composition determined using proteomic mass spectrometry. Seventy-four percent of proteins showed differential expression and each region displayed a unique compositional signature. These signatures correlated with the anatomical divisions of the brain and their embryological origins. Biochemical pathways controlling plasticity and disease, protein interaction networks and individual proteins involved with cognition all showed differential regional expression. Combining proteomic and connectomic data shows that interconnected regions have specific proteome signatures. Diversity in synapse proteome composition is key feature of mouse and human brain structure.</content>

 Little is known about the organization of central circuits by which external and internal sensory in-puts act on motor outputs to regulate fundamental behaviors such as feeding. We reconstructed, from a whole CNS EM volume, the synaptic map of input and output neurons that underlie food in-take behavior of Drosophila larvae. The input neurons originate from enteric, pharyngeal and external sensory organs and converge onto seven distinct sensory synaptic compartments within the CNS, as defined by distribution patterns of their presynaptic sites. The output neurons consist of pharyngeal motor neurons, serotonergic modulatory neurons, and neuroendocrine neurons that target the ring gland, a key endocrine organ. Monosynaptic connections from a set of sensory synaptic compartments cover the motor and endocrine targets in overlapping domains. Polysynaptic routes can be superimposed on top of the monosynaptic connections, resulting in divergent sensory paths that converge on common motor outputs. A completely different set of sensory compartments is connected to the mushroom body calyx of the memory circuits. Our results illustrate a circuit architecture in which monosynaptic and multisynaptic connections from sensory inputs traverse onto output neurons via a series of converging paths.</content>

 Glutamate secretion at excitatory synapses is tightly regulated to allow for the precise tuning of synaptic strength. Vesicular Glutamate Transporters (VGLUT) accumulate glutamate into synaptic vesicles (SV) and thereby regulate quantal size. Further, the number of release sites and the release probability of SVs maybe regulated by the organization of active zone proteins and SV clusters. In the present work, we uncover a mechanism mediating an increased SV clustering through a tripartite interaction of VGLUT1, endophilinA1 and intersectin1. This strengthening of SV clusters results in a combined reduction of axonal SV super-pool size and miniature excitatory events frequency. Our findings support a model in which clustered vesicles are held together through multiple weak interactions between SH3 domains and proline rich sequences of synaptic proteins. In mammals, VGLUT1 gained a poly-proline sequence that recruits endophilinA1 and turns the transporter into a dual regulator of quantal release parameters at excitatory synapses.</content>

Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for hepatitis C treatment tend to fare better in individuals who are also likely to respond well to interferon-alpha (IFN), a surprising correlation given that DAAs target specific viral proteins whereas IFN triggers a generic antiviral immune response. Here, we posit a causal relationship between IFN-responsiveness and DAA treatment outcome. IFN-responsiveness restricts viral replication, which would prevent the growth of viral variants resistant to DAAs and improve treatment outcome. To test this hypothesis, we developed a multiscale mathematical model integrating IFN-responsiveness at the cellular level, viral kinetics and evolution leading to drug resistance at the individual level, and treatment outcome at the population level. Model predictions quantitatively captured data from over 50 clinical trials demonstrating poorer response to DAAs in previous non-responders to IFN than treatment-naïve individuals, presenting strong evidence supporting the hypothesis. Model predictions additionally described several unexplained clinical observations, viz., the percentages of infected individuals who 1) spontaneously clear HCV, 2) get chronically infected but respond to IFN-based therapy, and 3) fail IFN-based therapy but respond to DAA-based therapy, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of HCV infection and treatment. An implication of the causal relationship is that failure of DAA-based treatments may be averted by adding IFN, a strategy of potential use in settings with limited access to DAAs. A second, wider implication is that individuals with greater IFN-responsiveness would require shorter DAA-based treatment durations, presenting a basis and a promising population for response-guided therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YZvCWuoO10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, &lt;i&gt;Hirudo verbana&lt;/i&gt;, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion) and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3), an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bidirectional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury, crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependence on afferent information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However, when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here, we test humans, rats, monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, tree shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance, and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: while monkeys and tree shrews based their choices largely on visual information, rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders often manifest in genetically susceptible individuals after psychosocial stress, but the mechanisms underlying these gene-environment interactions are largely unknown. We used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model to study resilience and susceptibility to chronic psychosocial stress. We identified a strong genetic background effect in CSDS-induced social avoidance (SA) using four inbred mouse strains: 69% of C57BL/6NCrl (B6), 23% of BALB/cAnNCrl, 19% of 129S2/SvPasCrl, and 5% of DBA/2NCrl (D2) mice were stress resilient. Furthermore, different inbred mouse strains responded differently to stress, suggesting they use distinct coping strategies. To identify biological pathways affected by CSDS, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of three brain regions of two strains, B6 and D2: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We discovered overrepresentation of oligodendrocyte (OLG)-related genes in the differentially expressed gene population. Because OLGs myelinate axons, we measured myelin thickness and found significant region and strain-specific differences. For example, in resilient D2 mice, mPFC axons had thinner myelin than controls, whereas susceptible B6 mice had thinner myelin than controls in the vHPC. Neither myelin-related gene expression in several other regions nor corpus callosum thickness differed between stressed and control animals. Our unbiased gene expression experiment suggests that myelin plasticity is a substantial response to chronic psychosocial stress, varies across brain regions, and is genetically controlled. Identification of genetic regulators of the myelin response will provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of stress-related diseases, such as anxiety disorders, a critical step in developing targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Desmosomes are adhesive junctions composed of two desmosomal cadherins: desmocollin (Dsc) and desmoglein (Dsg). Previous studies demonstrate that E-cadherin (Ecad), an adhesive protein that interacts in both &lt;i&gt;trans &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; conformations, facilitates desmosome assembly via an unknown mechanism. Here we use structure-function analysis to resolve the mechanistic roles of Ecad in desmosome formation. Using AFM force measurements, we demonstrate that Ecad interacts with isoform 2 of Dsg via a conserved Leu-175 on the Ecad &lt;i&gt;cis &lt;/i&gt;binding interface. Super-resolution imaging reveals that Ecad is enriched in nascent desmosomes, supporting a role for Ecad in early desmosome assembly. Finally, confocal imaging demonstrates that desmosome assembly is initiated at sites of Ecad mediated adhesion, and that Ecad-L175 is required for efficient Dsg2 and desmoplakin recruitment to intercellular contacts. We propose that Ecad &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; interactions at nascent cell-cell contacts initiate the recruitment of Dsg through direct &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; interactions with Ecad which facilitates desmosome assembly.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Dengue virus (DV) is a compact, icosahedrally symmetric, enveloped particle, covered by 90 dimers of envelope protein (E), which mediates viral attachment and membrane fusion. Fusion requires a dimer-to-trimer transition and membrane engagement of hydrophobic 'fusion loops'. We previously characterized the steps in membrane fusion for the related West Nile virus (WNV), using recombinant, WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) for single-particle experiments (Chao et al., 2014). Trimerization and membrane engagement are rate-limiting; fusion requires at least two adjacent trimers; availability of competent monomers within the contact zone between virus and target membrane creates a trimerization bottleneck. We now report an extension of that work to dengue VLPs, from all four serotypes, finding an essentially similar mechanism. Small-molecule inhibitors of dengue virus infection that target E block its fusion-inducing conformational change. We show that ~12-14 bound molecules per particle (~20-25% occupancy) completely prevent fusion, consistent with the proposed mechanism.</content>

 Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of human hemoglobin (Hb) give results in disagreement with experiment. Although it is known that the unliganded (T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;) and liganded (R&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;4&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;) tetramers are stable in solution, the published MD simulations of T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; undergo a rapid quaternary transition to an R-like structure. We show that T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is stable only when the periodic solvent box contains ten times more water molecules than the standard size for such simulations. The results suggest that such a large box is required for the hydrophobic effect, which stabilizes the T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; tetramer, to be manifested. Even in the largest box, T&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt; is not stable unless His146 is protonated, providing an atomistic validation of the Perutz model. The possibility that extra large boxes are required to obtain meaningful results will have to be considered in evaluating existing and future simulations of a wide range of systems.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Metazoan development depends on tightly regulated gene expression programs that instruct progenitor cells to adopt specialized fates. Recent work found that posttranslational modifications, such as monoubiquitylation, can determine cell fate also independently of effects on transcription, yet how monoubiquitylation is implemented during development is poorly understood. Here, we have identified a regulatory circuit that controls monoubiquitylation-dependent neural crest specification by the E3 ligase CUL3 and its substrate adaptor KBTBD8. We found that CUL3KBTBD8 monoubiquitylates its essential targets only after these have been phosphorylated in multiple motifs by CK2, a kinase whose levels gradually increase during embryogenesis. Its dependency on multisite phosphorylation allows CUL3KBTBD8 to convert the slow rise in embryonic CK2 into decisive recognition of ubiquitylation substrates, which in turn is essential for neural crest specification. We conclude that multisite dependency of an E3 ligase provides a powerful mechanism for switch-like cell fate transitions controlled by monoubiquitylation.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Spatial size tuning in the visual cortex has been considered as an important neuronal functional property for sensory perception. However, an analogous mechanism in the auditory system has remained controversial. In the present study, cell-attached recordings in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake mice revealed that excitatory neurons can be categorized into three types according to their bandwidth tuning profiles in response to band-passed noise (BPN) stimuli: nonmonotonic (NM), flat, and monotonic, with the latter two considered as non-tuned for bandwidth. The prevalence of bandwidth-tuned (i.e., NM) neurons increases significantly from layer 4 to layer 2/3. With sequential cell-attached and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from the same neurons, we found that the bandwidth preference of excitatory neurons is largely determined by the excitatory synaptic input they receive, and that the bandwidth selectivity is further enhanced by flatly tuned inhibition observed in all cells. The latter can be attributed at least partially to the flat tuning of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons. The tuning of auditory cortical neurons for bandwidth of BPN may contribute to the processing of complex sounds.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

We examined the heritability of regional brain volumes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; ~ 100) captured by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UK Biobank (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 9000). We found that regional brain volumes are highly heritable in this study population and common genetic variants can explain up to 80% of their variabilities (median heritability 34.8%). We observed omnigenic impact across the genome and examined the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Principal components derived from regional volume data are also highly heritable, but the amount of variance in brain volume explained by the component did not seem to be related to its heritability. Heritability estimates vary substantially across large-scale functional networks, exhibit a symmetric pattern across left and right hemispheres, and are consistent in females and males (correlation = 0.638). We repeated the main analysis in Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 1100), Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 600), and Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 500) datasets, which demonstrated that more stable estimates can be obtained from the UK Biobank.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Interactions with the environment happen within one’s peripersonal space (PPS)—the space surrounding the body. Studies in monkeys and humans have highlighted a multisensory distributed cortical network representing the PPS. However, knowledge about the temporal dynamics of PPS processing around the trunk is lacking. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in humans while administering tactile stimulation (T), approaching auditory stimuli (A), and the 2 combined (AT). To map PPS, tactile stimulation was delivered when the sound was far, intermediate, or close to the body. The 19% of the electrodes showed AT multisensory integration. Among those, 30% showed a PPS effect, a modulation of the response as a function of the distance between the sound and body. AT multisensory integration and PPS effects had similar spatiotemporal characteristics, with an early response (~50 ms) in the insular cortex, and later responses (~200 ms) in precentral and postcentral gyri. Superior temporal cortex showed a different response pattern with AT multisensory integration at ~100 ms without a PPS effect. These results, represent the first iEEG delineation of PPS processing in humans and show that PPS and multisensory integration happen at similar neural sites and time periods, suggesting that PPS representation is based on a spatial modulation of multisensory integration.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The presubiculum contains head direction cells that are crucial for spatial orientation. Here, we examined the connectivity and strengths of thalamic inputs to presubicular layer 3 neurons projecting to the medial entorhinal cortex in the mouse. We recorded pairs of projection neurons and interneurons while optogenetically stimulating afferent fibers from the anterior thalamic nuclei. Thalamic input differentially affects presubicular neurons: layer 3 pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are directly and monosynaptically activated, with depressing dynamics, whereas somatostatin-expressing interneurons are indirectly excited, during repetitive anterior thalamic nuclei activity. This arrangement ensures that the thalamic excitation of layer 3 cells is often followed by disynaptic inhibition. Feedforward inhibition is largely mediated by parvalbumin interneurons, which have a high probability of connection to presubicular pyramidal cells, and it may enforce temporally precise head direction tuning during head turns. Our data point to the potential contribution of presubicular microcircuits for fine-tuning thalamic head direction signals transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How microcircuits participate in shaping neural inputs is crucial to understanding information processing in the brain. Here, we show how the presubiculum may process thalamic head directional information before transmitting it to the medial entorhinal cortex. Synaptic inputs from the anterior thalamic nuclei excite layer 3 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons, which mediate disynaptic feedforward inhibition. Somatostatin interneurons are excited indirectly. Presubicular circuits may switch between two regimens depending on the angular velocity of head movements. During immobility, somatostatin-pyramidal cell interactions could support maintained head directional firing with attractor-like dynamics. During rapid head turns, in contrast, parvalbumin-mediated feedforward inhibition may act to tune the head direction signal transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In language production, humans are confronted with considerable word selection demands. Often, we must select a word from among similar, acceptable, and competing alternative words to construct a sentence that conveys an intended meaning. In recent years, the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has been identified as being critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on network approaches to understanding language, how the LIFG interacts with the brain's complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance remains unknown. Here, we take a novel approach to understanding word selection as a network control process in the brain. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging, we computed network controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the LIFG between administrations of language tasks that vary in response (cognitive control) demands: open-response tasks (word generation) versus closed response tasks (number naming). We found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of communication across modules in the human connectome explains TMS-induced changes in open-response language task performance only. Moreover, we found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of difficult-to-reach states explains vulnerability to TMS in the closed-ended (but not open-ended) response task. These findings establish a link among network controllability, cognitive function, and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work illustrates that network control statistics applied to anatomical connectivity data demonstrate relationships with cognitive variability during controlled language tasks and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system are critically involved in hypertension development. Although angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons to increase sympathetic vasomotor tone, the molecular mechanism mediating this action remains unclear. The glutamate NMDAR in the PVN controls sympathetic outflow in hypertension. In this study, we determined the interaction between α2-1 (encoded by &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt;), commonly known as a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subunit, and NMDARs in the hypothalamus and its role in Ang II-induced synaptic NMDAR activity in PVN presympathetic neurons. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that α2-1 interacted with the NMDAR in the hypothalamus of male rats and humans (both sexes). Ang II increased the prevalence of synaptic α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus. Also, Ang II increased presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity via AT1 receptors, and such effects were abolished either by treatment with pregabalin, an inhibitory α2-1 ligand, or by interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction with an α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide. In &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice (both sexes), Ang II failed to affect the presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity of PVN neurons. In addition, the α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide blocked the sympathoexcitatory response to microinjection of Ang II into the PVN. Our findings indicate that Ang II augments sympathetic vasomotor tone and excitatory glutamatergic input to PVN presympathetic neurons by stimulating α2-1-bound NMDARs at synapses. This information extends our understanding of the molecular basis for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems and suggests new strategies for treating neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although both the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system are closely involved in hypertension development, the molecular mechanisms mediating this involvement remain unclear. We showed that α2-1, previously known as a calcium channel subunit, interacts with NMDARs in the hypothalamus of rodents and humans. Angiotensin II (Ang II) increases the synaptic expression level of α2-1–NMDAR complexes. Furthermore, inhibiting α2-1, interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction, or deleting α2-1 abolishes the potentiating effects of Ang II on presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity in the hypothalamus. In addition, the sympathoexcitatory response to Ang II depends on α2-1-bound NMDARs. Thus, α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus serve as an important molecular substrate for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system. This evidence suggests that α2-1 may be a useful target for the treatment neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6379?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Metacognition is the capacity to introspectively monitor and control one's own cognitive processes. Previous anatomical and functional neuroimaging findings implicated the important role of the precuneus in metacognition processing, especially during mnemonic tasks. However, the issue of whether this medial parietal cortex is a domain-specific region that supports mnemonic metacognition remains controversial. Here, we focally disrupted this parietal area with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy human participants of both sexes, seeking to ascertain its functional necessity for metacognition in memory versus perceptual decisions. Perturbing precuneal activity selectively impaired metacognitive efficiency of temporal-order memory judgment, but not perceptual discrimination. Moreover, the correlation in individuals' metacognitive efficiency between domains disappeared when the precuneus was perturbed. Together, these findings provide evidence reinforcing the notion that the precuneal region plays an important role in mediating metacognition of episodic memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Theories on the neural basis of metacognition have thus far been largely centered on the role of the prefrontal cortex. Here we refined the theoretical framework through characterizing a unique precuneal involvement in mnemonic metacognition with a noninvasive but inferentially powerful method: transcranial magnetic stimulation. By quantifying metacognitive efficiency across two distinct domains (memory vs perception) that are matched for stimulus characteristics, we reveal an instrumental role of the precuneus in mnemonic metacognition. This causal evidence corroborates ample clinical reports that parietal lobe lesions often produce inaccurate self-reports of confidence in memory recollection and establish the precuneus as a nexus for the introspective ability to evaluate the success of memory judgment in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states. While the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) plays a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of sleep, the lateral posterior part of the hypothalamus contains neuronal populations implicated in maintenance of arousal, including orexin-producing neurons (orexin neurons) in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). During a search for neurons that make direct synaptic contact with histidine decarboxylase-positive (HDC+), histaminergic neurons (HDC neurons) in the TMN and orexin neurons in the LHA of male mice, we found that these arousal-related neurons are heavily innervated by GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area including the VLPO. We further characterized GABAergic neurons electrophysiologically in the VLPO (GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) that make direct synaptic contact with these hypothalamic arousal-related neurons. These neurons (GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO-&amp;gt;HDC&lt;/sup&gt; or GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO-&amp;gt;orexin&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) were both potently inhibited by noradrenaline and serotonin, showing typical electrophysiological characteristics of sleep-promoting neurons in the VLPO. This work provides direct evidence of monosynaptic connectivity between GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and hypothalamic arousal neurons and identifies the effects of monoamines on these neuronal pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Rabies-virus-mediated tracing of input neurons of two hypothalamic arousal-related neuron populations, histaminergic and orexinergic neurons, showed that they receive similar distributions of input neurons in a variety of brain areas, with rich innervation by GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area, including the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), a region known to play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of sleep. Electrophysiological experiments found that GABAergic neurons in the VLPO (GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) that make direct input to orexin or histaminergic neurons are potently inhibited by noradrenaline and serotonin, suggesting that these monoamines disinhibit histamine and orexin neurons. This work demonstrated functional and structural interactions between GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and hypothalamic arousal-related neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurons in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area of Macaques exhibit both sensory and oculomotor preparatory responses. During perceptual decision making, the preparatory responses have been shown to track the state of the evolving evidence leading to the decision. The sensory responses are known to reflect categorical properties of visual stimuli, but it is not known whether these responses also track evolving evidence. We recorded neural responses from lateral intraparietal area of 2 female rhesus monkeys during a direction discrimination task. We compared sensory and oculomotor-preparatory responses in the same neurons when either the discriminandum (random dot motion) or an eye movement choice-target was in the neuron's response field. The neural responses in both configurations reflected the strength and direction of motion and were correlated with the animal's choice, albeit more prominently when the choice-target was in the response field. However, the variance and autocorrelation pattern of only the motor preparatory responses reflected the process of evidence accumulation. Simulations suggest that the task related activity of sensory responses could be inherited through lateral interactions with neurons that are carrying evidence accumulation signals in their motor-preparatory responses. The results are consistent with the proposal that evolving decision processes are supported by persistent neural activity in the service of actions or intentions, as opposed to high-order representations of stimulus properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Perceptual decision making is the process of choosing an appropriate motor action based on perceived sensory information. Association areas of the cortex play an important role in this sensory-motor transformation. The neurons in these areas show both sensory- and motor-related activity. We show here that, in the macaque parietal association area LIP, signatures of the process of evidence accumulation that underlies the decisions are predominantly reflected in the motor-related activity. This finding supports the proposal that perceptual decision making is implemented in the brain as a process of choosing between available motor actions rather than as a process of representing the properties of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The amygdala is important for processing emotion, including negative emotion such as anxiety and depression induced by chronic pain. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in recent years on amygdala regulation of both negative (fear) and positive (reward) behavioral responses, our current understanding is still limited regarding how the amygdala processes and integrates these negative and positive emotion responses within the amygdala circuits. In this study with optogenetic stimulation of specific brain circuits, we investigated how amygdala circuits regulate negative and positive emotion behaviors, using pain as an emotional assay in male rats. We report here that activation of the excitatory pathway from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) that relays peripheral pain signals to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) is sufficient to cause behaviors of negative emotion including anxiety, depression, and aversion in normal rats. In strong contrast, activation of the excitatory pathway from basolateral amygdala (BLA) that conveys processed corticolimbic signals to CeA dramatically opposes these behaviors of negative emotion, reducing anxiety and depression, and induces behavior of reward. Surprisingly, activating the PBN–CeA pathway to simulate pain signals does not change pain sensitivity itself, but activating the BLA–CeA pathway inhibits basal and sensitized pain. These findings demonstrate that the pain signal conveyed through the PBN–CeA pathway is sufficient to drive negative emotion and that the corticolimbic signal via the BLA–CeA pathway counteracts the negative emotion, suggesting a top-down brain mechanism for cognitive control of negative emotion under stressful environmental conditions such as pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It remains unclear how the amygdala circuits integrate both negative and positive emotional responses and the brain circuits that link peripheral pain to negative emotion are largely unknown. Using optogenetic stimulation, this study shows that the excitatory projection from the parabrachial nucleus to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) is sufficient to drive behaviors of negative emotion including anxiety, depression, and aversion in rats. Conversely, activation of the excitatory projection from basolateral amygdala to CeA counteracts each of these behaviors of negative emotion. Thus, this study identifies a brain pathway that mediates pain-driven negative emotion and a brain pathway that counteracts these emotion behaviors in a top-down mechanism for brain control of negative emotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6323?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis that arm/hand motor recovery after injury of the lateral sensorimotor cortex is associated with upregulation of the corticoreticular projection (CRP) from the supplementary motor cortex (M2) to the gigantocellular reticular nucleus of the medulla (Gi). Three groups of rhesus monkeys of both genders were studied: five controls, four cases with lesions of the arm/hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1) and the lateral premotor cortex (LPMC; F2 lesion group), and five cases with lesions of the arm/hand area of M1, LPMC, S1, and anterior parietal cortex (F2P2 lesion group). CRP strength was assessed using high-resolution anterograde tracers injected into the arm/hand area of M2 and stereology to estimate of the number of synaptic boutons in the Gi. M2 projected bilaterally to the Gi, primarily targeting the medial Gi subsector and, to a lesser extent, lateral, dorsal, and ventral subsectors. Total CRP bouton numbers were similar in controls and F2 lesion cases but F2P2 lesion cases had twice as many boutons as the other two groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002). Recovery of reaching and fine hand/digit function was strongly correlated with estimated numbers of CRP boutons in the F2P2 lesion cases. Because we previously showed that F2P2 lesion cases experience decreased strength of the M2 corticospinal projection (CSP), whereas F2 lesion monkeys experienced increased strength of the M2 CSP, these results suggest one mechanism underlying arm/hand motor recovery after F2P2 injury is upregulation of the M2 CRP. This M2-CRP response may influence an important reticulospinal tract contribution to upper-limb motor recovery following frontoparietal injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We previously showed that after brain injury affecting the lateral motor cortex controlling arm/hand motor function, recovery is variable and closely associated with increased strength of corticospinal projection (CSP) from an uninjured medial cortical motor area. Hand motor recovery also varies after brain injury affecting the lateral sensorimotor cortex, but medial motor cortex CSP strength decreases and cannot account for recovery. Here we observed that motor recovery following sensorimotor cortex injury is closely associated with increased strength of the descending projection from an uninjured medial cortical motor area to a brainstem reticular nucleus involved in control of arm/hand function, suggesting an enhanced corticoreticular projection may compensate for injury to the sensorimotor cortex to enable recovery of arm/hand motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6310?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;A population of kisspeptin-GABA coexpressing neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) is believed to activate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons to generate the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge triggering ovulation. Selective optogenetic activation of RP3V kisspeptin (RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons in female mice for &amp;gt;30 s and ≥10 Hz in either a continuous or bursting mode was found to reliably generate a delayed and long-lasting activation of GnRH neuron firing in brain slices. Optogenetic activation of RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; at 10 Hz generated substantial increments in LH secretion of similar amplitude to the endogenous LH surge. Studies using GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists and optogenetic activation of RP3V GABA (RP3V&lt;sup&gt;GABA&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; revealed that low-frequency (2 Hz) stimulation generated immediate and transient GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated increases in GnRH neuron firing, whereas higher frequencies (10 Hz) recruited the long-lasting activation observed following RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neuron stimulation. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, 2 Hz activation of RP3V&lt;sup&gt;GABA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons did not alter LH secretion, whereas 10 Hz stimulation evoked a sustained large increase in LH identical to RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neuron activation. Optogenetic activation of RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in which kisspeptin had been deleted did not alter LH secretion. These studies demonstrate the presence of parallel transmission streams from RP3V neurons to GnRH neurons that are frequency dependent and temporally distinct. This comprises a rapid and transient GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated activation and a slower onset kisspeptin-mediated stimulation of long duration. At the time of the LH surge, GABA release appears to be functionally redundant with the neuropeptide kisspeptin being the dominant cotransmitter influencing GnRH neuron output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Miscommunication between the brain and ovaries is thought to represent a major cause of infertility in humans. Studies in rodents suggest that a population of neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) are critical for activating the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that trigger ovulation. The present study provides evidence that an RP3V neuron population coexpressing kisspeptin and GABA provides a functionally important excitatory input to GnRH neurons at the time of ovulation. This neural input releases GABA and/or kisspeptin in the classical frequency dependent and temporally distinct nature of amino acid-neuropeptide cotransmission. Unusually, however, the neuropeptide stream is found to be functionally dominant in activating GnRH neurons at the time of ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Episodic memories are rich in sensory information and often contain integrated information from different sensory modalities. For instance, we can store memories of a recent concert with visual and auditory impressions being integrated in one episode. Theta oscillations have recently been implicated in playing a causal role synchronizing and effectively binding the different modalities together in memory. However, an open question is whether momentary fluctuations in theta synchronization predict the likelihood of associative memory formation for multisensory events. To address this question we entrained the visual and auditory cortex at theta frequency (4 Hz) and in a synchronous or asynchronous manner by modulating the luminance and volume of movies and sounds at 4 Hz, with a phase offset at 0° or 180°. EEG activity from human subjects (both sexes) was recorded while they memorized the association between a movie and a sound. Associative memory performance was significantly enhanced in the 0° compared with the 180° condition. Source-level analysis demonstrated that the physical stimuli effectively entrained their respective cortical areas with a corresponding phase offset. The findings suggested a successful replication of a previous study (Clouter et al., 2017). Importantly, the strength of entrainment during encoding correlated with the efficacy of associative memory such that small phase differences between visual and auditory cortex predicted a high likelihood of correct retrieval in a later recall test. These findings suggest that theta oscillations serve a specific function in the episodic memory system: binding the contents of different modalities into coherent memory episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How multisensory experiences are bound to form a coherent episodic memory representation is one of the fundamental questions in human episodic memory research. Evidence from animal literature suggests that the relative timing between an input and theta oscillations in the hippocampus is crucial for memory formation. We precisely controlled the timing between visual and auditory stimuli and the neural oscillations at 4 Hz using a multisensory entrainment paradigm. Human associative memory formation depends on coincident timing between sensory streams processed by the corresponding brain regions. We provide evidence for a significant role of relative timing of neural theta activity in human episodic memory on a single-trial level, which reveals a crucial mechanism underlying human episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Neuron activity accompanies synapse formation and maintenance, but how early circuit activity contributes to behavior development is not well understood. Here, we use the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; egg-laying motor circuit as a model to understand how coordinated cell and circuit activity develops and drives a robust two-state behavior in adults. Using calcium imaging in behaving animals, we find the serotonergic hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) and vulval muscles show rhythmic calcium transients in L4 larvae before eggs are produced. HSN activity in L4 is tonic and lacks the alternating burst-firing/quiescent pattern seen in egg-laying adults. Vulval muscle activity in L4 is initially uncoordinated but becomes synchronous as the anterior and posterior muscle arms meet at HSN synaptic release sites. However, coordinated muscle activity does not require presynaptic HSN input. Using reversible silencing experiments, we show that neuronal and vulval muscle activity in L4 is not required for the onset of adult behavior. Instead, the accumulation of eggs in the adult uterus renders the muscles sensitive to HSN input. Sterilization or acute electrical silencing of the vulval muscles inhibits presynaptic HSN activity and reversal of muscle silencing triggers a homeostatic increase in HSN activity and egg release that maintains ~12–15 eggs in the uterus. Feedback of egg accumulation depends upon the vulval muscle postsynaptic terminus, suggesting that a retrograde signal sustains HSN synaptic activity and egg release. Our results show that egg-laying behavior in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; is driven by a homeostat that scales serotonin motor neuron activity in response to postsynaptic muscle feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The functional importance of early, spontaneous neuron activity in synapse and circuit development is not well understood. Here, we show in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; that the serotonergic hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) and postsynaptic vulval muscles show activity during circuit development, well before the onset of adult behavior. Surprisingly, early activity is not required for circuit development or the onset of adult behavior and the circuit remains unable to drive egg laying until fertilized embryos are deposited into the uterus. Egg accumulation potentiates vulval muscle excitability, but ultimately acts to promote burst firing in the presynaptic HSNs which results in egg laying. Our results suggest that mechanosensory feedback acts at three distinct steps to initiate, sustain, and terminate &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; egg-laying circuit activity and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Disorganization of nodes of Ranvier is associated with motor and sensory dysfunctions. Mechanisms that allow nodal recovery during pathological processes remain poorly understood. A highly enriched nodal cytoskeletal protein βIV spectrin anchors and stabilizes the nodal complex to actin cytoskeleton. Loss of murine βIV spectrin allows the initial nodal organization, but causes gradual nodal destabilization. Mutations in human βIV spectrin cause auditory neuropathy and impairment in motor coordination. Similar phenotypes are caused by nodal disruption due to demyelination. Here we report on the precise timelines of nodal disorganization and reorganization by following disassembly and reassembly of key nodal proteins in βIV spectrin mice of both sexes before and after βIV spectrin re-expression at specifically chosen developmental time points. We show that the timeline of nodal restoration has different outcomes in the PNS and CNS with respect to nodal reassembly and functional restoration. In the PNS, restoration of nodes occurs within 1 month regardless of the time of βIV spectrin re-expression. In contrast, the CNS nodal reorganization and functional restoration occurs within a critical time window; after that, nodal reorganization diminishes, leading to less efficient motor recovery. We demonstrate that timely restoration of nodes can improve both the functional properties and the ultrastructure of myelinated fibers affected by long-term nodal disorganization. Our studies, which indicate a critical timeline for nodal restoration together with overall motor performance and prolonged life span, further support the idea that nodal restoration is more beneficial if initiated before any axonal damage, which is critically relevant to demyelinating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Nodes of Ranvier are integral to efficient and rapid signal transmission along myelinated fibers. Various demyelinating disorders are characterized by destabilization of the nodal molecular complex, accompanied by severe reduction in nerve conduction and the onset of motor and sensory dysfunctions. This study is the first to report &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; reassembly of destabilized nodes with sequential improvement in overall motor performance. Our study reveals that nodal restoration is achievable before any axonal damage, and that long-term nodal destabilization causes irreversible axonal structural changes that prevent functional restoration. Our studies provide significant insights into timely restoration of nodal domains as a potential therapeutic approach in treatment of demyelinating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;White matter (WM) damage following a stroke underlies a majority of the neurological disability that is subsequently observed. Although ischemic injury mechanisms are age-dependent, conserving axonal mitochondria provides consistent post-ischemic protection to young and aging WM. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation is a major cause of oxidative and mitochondrial injury in gray matter during ischemia; therefore, we used a pure WM tract, isolated male mouse optic nerve, to investigate whether NOS inhibition provides post-ischemic functional recovery by preserving mitochondria. We show that pan-NOS inhibition applied before oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) promotes functional recovery of young and aging axons and preserves WM cellular architecture. This protection correlates with reduced nitric oxide (NO) generation, restored glutathione production, preserved axonal mitochondria and oligodendrocytes, and preserved ATP levels. Pan-NOS inhibition provided post-ischemic protection to only young axons, whereas selective inhibition of NOS3 conferred post-ischemic protection to both young and aging axons. Concurrently, genetic deletion of NOS3 conferred long-lasting protection to young axons against ischemia. OGD upregulated NOS3 levels in astrocytes, and we show for the first time that inhibition of NOS3 generation in glial cells prevents axonal mitochondrial fission and restores mitochondrial motility to confer protection to axons by preserving Miro-2 levels. Interestingly, NOS1 inhibition exerted post-ischemic protection selectively to aging axons, which feature age-dependent mechanisms of oxidative injury in WM. Our study provides the first evidence that inhibition of glial NOS activity confers long-lasting benefits to WM function and structure and suggests caution in defining the role of NO in cerebral ischemia at vascular and cellular levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; White matter (WM) injury during stroke is manifested as the subsequent neurological disability in surviving patients. Aging primarily impacts CNS WM and mechanisms of ischemic WM injury change with age. Nitric oxide is involved in various mitochondrial functions and we propose that inhibition of glia-specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms promotes axon function recovery by preserving mitochondrial structure, function, integrity, and motility. Using electrophysiology and three-dimensional electron microscopy, we show that NOS3 inhibition provides a common target to improve young and aging axon function, whereas NOS1 inhibition selectively protects aging axons when applied after injury. This study provides the first evidence that inhibition of glial cell NOS activity confers long-lasting benefits to WM structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This process, called arealization, depends on the graded expression of transcription factors in neocortical progenitors and postmitotic neurons prenatally, and on external activity-dependent cues driven by thalamocortical axons during postnatal stages. Thalamic inputs are guided within an intrinsically determined genetic framework to selectively target and innervate layer 4 (L4) cortical neurons in a somatotopic manner. L4 spiny stellate neurons are excitatory locally projecting neurons, which undergo a drastic dendrite remodeling during the first postnatal week and represent the principal sensory gateway to the neocortex. In this review, we will discuss the way intrinsic cortical gene regulation and extrinsic activity-dependent inputs instruct the cellular reorganization of L4 spiny stellate neurons, necessary for proper formation of the barrel cortex during the development of primary somatosensory maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03696"/>

		<updated>2018-07-11T01:30:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) typically have normal
conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hence diagnosis based on MRI is
challenging. Anatomical abnormalities underlying brain dysfunctions in IGE are
unclear and their relation to the pathomechanisms of epileptogenesis is poorly
understood. In this study, we applied connectometry, an advanced quantitative
neuroimaging technique for investigating localised changes in white-matter
tissues in vivo. Analysing white matter structures of 32 subjects we
incorporated our in vivo findings in a computational model of seizure dynamics
to suggest a plausible mechanism of epileptogenesis. Patients with IGE have
significant bilateral alterations in major white-matter fascicles. In cingulum,
fornix, and superior longitudinal fasciculus, tract integrity is compromised,
whereas in specific parts of tracts between thalamus and the precentral gyrus,
tract integrity is enhanced in patients. Incorporating these alterations in a
classification framework, we found that patients and controls are linearly
separable with 81.3% accuracy and 83.3% sensitivity. The computational model,
informed with the findings on the tract abnormalities, specifically highlighted
the importance of enhanced cortico-reticular connections along with impaired
cortico-cortical connections in inducing pathological seizure-like dynamics. We
emphasise taking directionality of brain connectivity into consideration
towards understanding the pathological mechanisms; this is possible by
combining neuroimaging and computational modelling. Our imaging evidence of
structural alterations in IGEs may be applied as non-invasive diagnostic
biomarker. We suggest that impaired connectivity from cortical regions to the
thalamic reticular nucleus offers a therapeutic target for selectively
modifying the brain circuit to reverse the mechanisms leading to
epileptogenesis.

 Recent lineage tracing analyses have significantly improved our understanding of immune system development and highlighted the importance of the different hematopoietic waves. The current challenge is to understand whether these waves interact and whether this affects the function of the immune system. Here we report a molecular pathway regulating the immune response and involving the communication between embryonic and larval hematopoietic waves in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Down-regulating the transcription factor Gcm specific to embryonic hematopoiesis enhances the larval phenotypes induced by over-expressing the pro-inflammatory Jak/Stat pathway or by wasp infestation. Gcm works by modulating the transduction of the Upd cytokines to the site of larval hematopoiesis and hence the response to chronic (Jak/Stat over-expression) and acute (wasp infestation) immune challenges. Thus, homeostatic interactions control the function of the immune system in physiology and pathology. Our data also indicate that a transiently expressed developmental pathway has a long-lasting effect on the immune response.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The architecture of normal and diseased tissues strongly influences the development and progression of disease as well as responsiveness and resistance to therapy. We describe a tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) method for highly multiplexed immuno-fluorescence imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens mounted on glass slides, the most widely used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. t-CyCIF generates up to 60-plex images using an iterative process (a cycle) in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high dimensional representation. t-CyCIF requires no specialized instruments or reagents and is compatible with super-resolution imaging; we demonstrate its application to quantifying signal transduction cascades, tumor antigens and immune markers in diverse tissues and tumors.

Many species rely on olfaction to navigate towards food sources or mates. Olfactory navigation is a challenging task since odor environments are typically turbulent. While time-averaged odor concentration varies smoothly with the distance to the source, instaneous concentrations are intermittent and obtaining stable averages takes longer than the typical intervals between animals’ navigation decisions. How to effectively sample from the odor distribution to determine sampling location is the focus on this article. To investigate which sampling strategies are most informative about the location of an odor source, we recorded three naturalistic stimuli with planar lased-induced fluorescence and used an information-theoretic approach to quantify the information that different sampling strategies provide about sampling location. Specifically, we compared multiple sampling strategies based on a fixed number of coding bits for encoding the olfactory stimulus. When the coding bits were all allocated to representing odor concentration at a single sensor, information rapidly saturated. Using the same number of coding bits in two sensors provides more information, as does coding multiple samples at different times. When accumulating multiple samples at a fixed location, the temporal sequence does not yield a large amount of information and can be averaged with minimal loss. Furthermore, we show that histogram-equalization is not the most efficient way to use coding bits when using the olfactory sample to determine location.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zIMMO9rrGJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Architecture of phase relationships among neural oscillations is central for their functional significance but has remained theoretically poorly understood. We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster oscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for in-silico results. If nodes are in anti-phase regime, then a distance &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt; is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical studies, and we scrutinize the method’s impact. The choice of surrogates do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged. Taken together, the results describe quantitatively the impact of the spatio-temporal connectivity of the brain to the synchronization patterns between brain regions, and to uncover mechanisms through which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain renders phases to be distributed around 0 and &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt;.

 Macrophages are key immune cells for the initiation and development of atherosclerotic lesions. However, the macrophage regulatory nodes that determine how lesions progress in response to dietary challenges are not fully understood. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are sterol-regulated transcription factors that play a central role in atherosclerosis by integrating cholesterol...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/V4Hu-DNRwRM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 The tumor microenvironment restrains conventional T cell (Tconv) activation while facilitating the expansion of Tregs.

 Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB) is an incurable, devastating, and mostly fatal inherited skin disease for which there is only supportive care. H-JEB is caused by loss-of-function mutations in LAMA3, LAMB3, or LAMC2, leading to complete loss of laminin 332, the major component of anchoring filaments, which mediate epidermal-dermal adherence....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/9at3P0uWt3s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine whether maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mouse dams to fluoxetine (FLX) during different periods of gestation and lactation and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with FLX. FLX re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal FLX treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synchronization of finite spike sequences is the way two brain regions
compare their content and extract the most suitable sequence. This is the core
of the linguistic comparison between a word and a previous one retrieved by
memory. Classifying the information content of neural spike trains, an
uncertainty relation emerges between the bit size of a word and its duration.
This uncertainty affects the task of synchronizing spike trains of different
duration representing different words, entailing the occurrence of entangled
sequences, so that word comparison amounts to a measurement based quantum
computation. Entanglement explains the inverse Bayes inference that connects
different words in a linguistic search. The behaviour here discussed provides
an explanation for other reported evidences of quantum effects in human
cognitive processes lacking a plausible framework, since either no assignment
of an appropriate quantum constant had been associated, or speculating on
microscopic processes dependent on Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic
de-coherence times.

 &lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry permits monitoring fluorescent indicators of neural activity
in behaving animals. Optical fibers are typically used to excite and collect
fluorescence from genetically-encoded calcium indicators expressed by a subset
of neurons in a circuit of interest. However, a quantitative understanding of
the brain volumes from which signal is collected and how this depends on the
properties of the optical fibers are lacking. Here we analytically model and
experimentally measure the light emission and collection fields for optical
fibers in solution and scattering tissue, providing a comprehensive
characterization of fibers commonly employed for fiber photometry. Since
photometry signals depend on both excitation and collection efficiency, a
combined confocal/2-photon microscope was developed to evaluate these
parameters independently. We find that the 80% of the effective signal arises
from a 10^5-10^6 um3 volume extending ~200 um from the fiber face, and thus
permitting a spatial interpretation of measurements made with fiber photometry.

 &lt;p&gt;The permutation test is known as the exact test procedure in statistics.
However, often it is not exact in practice and only an approximate method since
only a small fraction of every possible permutation is generated. Even for a
small sample size, it often requires to generate tens of thousands
permutations, which can be a serious computational bottleneck. In this paper,
we propose a novel combinatorial inference procedure that enumerates all
possible permutations combinatorially without any resampling. The proposed
method is validated against the standard permutation test in simulation studies
with the ground truth. The method is further applied in twin DTI study in
determining the genetic contribution of the minimum spanning tree of the
structural brain connectivity.

 &lt;p&gt;Background: The n-back and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) are
commonly used verbal working memory tasks that have partially overlapping uses
in clinical and experimental psychology. We performed three activation
likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses, comparing two load levels of the
n-back task (2-back, 3-back) to the PASAT and to each-other. These analyses
aimed to determine the involvement of cognitive and emotional brain regions for
these tasks. Results: We observed higher overall likelihood of activation the
frontal eye fields in the 3-back. The PASAT exhibited higher overall activation
in the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA), left supramarginal gyrus, and
left superior parietal lobule. Furthermore, the 3-back exhibited higher
activation in the right SMA, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex versus the
2-back, and the PASAT exhibited higher activation in a cluster near the right
premotor area versus the 2-back. A laterality effect was observed in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the PASAT (left) and 3-back(right).
These data suggest greater activation of regions traditionally associated with
the phonological loop during the PASAT, compared to the 2- and 3-back tasks.
Furthermore, individual ALE analyses suggest involvement of emotional
processing and salience network regions (insula, cingulate) in addition to the
well-established verbal working memory regions (Broca's region, bilateral SMA,
premotor, posterior parietal cortices) in all 3 tasks. Conclusions: Here we
identify regions activated by the PASAT, which has not been meta-analytically
reviewed prior to this study. Using ALE meta-analysis, we have also identified
meaningful differences in activation associated with specific cognitive and
emotional aspects of verbal working memory during these tasks.

 &lt;p&gt;A convex code is a binary code generated by the pattern of intersections of a
collection of open convex sets in some Euclidean space. Convex codes are
relevant to neuroscience as they arise from the activity of neurons that have
convex receptive fields. In this paper, we use algebraic methods to determine
if a code is convex. Specifically, we use the neural ideal of a code, which is
a generalization of the Stanley-Reisner ideal. Using the neural ideal together
with its standard generating set, the canonical form, we provide algebraic
signatures of certain families of codes that are non-convex. We connect these
signatures to the precise conditions on the arrangement of sets that prevent
the codes from being convex. Finally, we also provide algebraic signatures for
some families of codes that are convex, including the class of
intersection-complete codes. These results allow us to detect convexity and
non-convexity in a variety of situations, and point to some interesting open
questions.

 &lt;p&gt;Multi-subject fMRI data analysis is an interesting and challenging problem in
human brain decoding studies. The inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects make it necessary to do both anatomical and
functional alignment before classification analysis. Besides, when it comes to
big data, time complexity becomes a problem that cannot be ignored. This paper
proposes Gradient Hyperalignment (Gradient-HA) as a gradient-based functional
alignment method that is suitable for multi-subject fMRI datasets with large
amounts of samples and voxels. The advantage of Gradient-HA is that it can
solve independence and high dimension problems by using Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Validation using
multi-classification tasks on big data demonstrates that Gradient-HA method has
less time complexity and better or comparable performance compared with other
state-of-the-art functional alignment methods.

 &lt;p&gt;We study stochastic Amari-type neural field equations, which are mean-field
models for neural activity in the cortex. We prove that under certain
assumptions on the coupling kernel, the neural field model can be viewed as a
gradient flow in a nonlocal Hilbert space. This makes all gradient-flow methods
available for the analysis, which could previously not be used, as it was not
known, whether a rigorous gradient flow formulation exists. We show that the
equation is well-posed in the nonlocal Hilbert space in the sense that
solutions starting in this space also remain in it for all times and space-time
regularity results hold for the case of spatially correlated noise. Uniqueness
of invariant measures and ergodic properties for the associated Feller
semigroups are also discussed.

 &lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of astrocytes in brain computation is a nascent
challenge, promising immense rewards, in terms of new neurobiological knowledge
that can be translated into artificial intelligence. In our ongoing effort to
identify principles endow-ing the astrocyte with unique functions in brain
computation, and translate them into neural-astrocytic networks (NANs), we
propose a biophysically realistic model of an astrocyte that preserves the
experimentally observed spatial allocation of its distinct subcellular
compartments. We show how our model may encode, and modu-late, the extent of
synchronous neural activity via calcium waves that propagate intracellularly
across the astrocytic compartments. This relationship between neural activity
and astrocytic calcium waves has long been speculated but it is still lacking a
mechanistic explanation. Our model suggests an astrocytic &quot;calcium cascade&quot;
mechanism for neuronal synchronization, which may empower NANs by imposing
periodic neural modulation known to reduce coding errors. By expanding our
notions of information processing in astrocytes, our work aims to solidify a
computational role for non-neuronal cells and incorporate them into artificial
networks.

 Neurons communicate through neurotransmitter release at specialized synaptic regions known as active zones (AZs). Using biosensors to visualize single synaptic vesicle fusion events at &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junctions, we analyzed the developmental and molecular determinants of release probability (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) for a defined connection with ~300 AZs. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; was heterogeneous but represented a stable feature of each AZ. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;remained stable during high frequency stimulation and retained heterogeneity in mutants lacking the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor Synaptotagmin 1. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; correlated with both presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel abundance and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx at individual release sites. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; heterogeneity also correlated with glutamate receptor abundance, with high &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; connections developing receptor subtype segregation. Intravital imaging throughout development revealed that AZs acquire high &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; during a multi-day maturation period, with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; heterogeneity largely reflecting AZ age. The rate of synapse maturation was activity-dependent, as both increases and decreases in neuronal activity modulated glutamate receptor field size and segregation.</content>

 Many organisms use free running circadian clocks to anticipate the day night cycle. However, others organisms use simple stimulus-response strategies ('hourglass clocks') and it is not clear when such strategies are sufficient or even preferable to free running clocks. Here, we find that free running clocks, such as those found in the cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus elongatus&lt;/i&gt; and humans, can efficiently project out light intensity fluctuations due to weather patterns ('external noise') by exploiting their limit cycle attractor. However, such limit cycles are necessarily vulnerable to 'internal noise'. Hence, at sufficiently high internal noise, point attractor-based 'hourglass' clocks, such as those found in a smaller cyanobacterium with low protein copy number, &lt;i&gt;Prochlorococcus marinus&lt;/i&gt;, outperform free running clocks. By interpolating between these two regimes in a diverse range of oscillators drawn from across biology, we demonstrate biochemical clock architectures that are best suited to different relative strengths of external and internal noise.</content>

 The RAS family of proteins is amongst the most highly mutated in human cancers and has so far eluded drug therapy. Currently, much effort is being made to discover mutant RAS inhibitors and in vitro screening for RAS-binding drugs must be followed by cell-based assays. Here, we have developed a robust set of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based RAS biosensors that enable monitoring of RAS-effector interaction inhibition in living cells. These include KRAS, HRAS and NRAS and a variety of different mutations that mirror those found in human cancers with the major RAS effectors such as CRAF, PI3K and RALGDS. We highlighted the utility of these RAS biosensors by showing a RAS-binding compound is a potent pan-RAS-effector interactions inhibitor in cells. The RAS biosensors represent a useful tool to investigate and characterize the potency of anti-RAS inhibitors in cells and more generally any RAS protein-protein interaction (PPI) in cells.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Throughout metazoans, germ cells undergo incomplete cytokinesis to form syncytia connected by intercellular bridges. Gamete formation ultimately requires bridge closure, yet how bridges are reactivated to close is not known. The most conserved bridge component is centralspindlin, a complex of the Rho family GTPase-activating protein (GAP) CYK-4/MgcRacGAP and the microtubule motor ZEN-4/kinesin-6. Here, we show that oocyte production by the syncytial &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; germline requires CYK-4 but not ZEN-4, which contrasts with cytokinesis, where both are essential. Longitudinal imaging after conditional inactivation revealed that CYK-4 activity is important for oocyte cellularization, but not for the cytokinesis-like events that generate syncytial compartments. CYK-4's lipid-binding C1 domain and the GTPase-binding interface of its GAP domain were both required to target CYK-4 to intercellular bridges and to cellularize oocytes. These results suggest that the conserved C1-GAP region of CYK-4 constitutes a targeting module required for closure of intercellular bridges in germline syncytia.</content>

 Tauopathies feature progressive accumulation of tau amyloids. Pathology may begin when these amplify from a protein template, or seed, whose structure is unknown. We have purified and characterized distinct forms of tau monomer—inert (M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and seed-competent (M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;). Recombinant M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; triggered intracellular tau aggregation, induced tau fibrillization in vitro, and self-assembled. M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; from Alzheimer’s disease also seeded aggregation and self-assembled in vitro to form seed-competent multimers. We used crosslinking with mass spectrometry to probe structural differences in M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; vs. M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. Crosslinks informed models of local peptide structure within the repeat domain which suggest relative inaccessibility of residues that drive aggregation (VQIINK/VQIVYK) in M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and exposure in M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. Limited proteolysis supported this idea. Although tau monomer has been considered to be natively unstructured, our findings belie this assumption and suggest that initiation of pathological aggregation could begin with conversion of tau monomer from an inert to a seed-competent form.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The neural control of transition between posture and movement encompasses the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. Optimal feedback theory suggests that such transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another. To test this possibility, we investigated the continuity of the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet, while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS). The relationship between EVS and ground reactions forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. Discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results show humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies, as predicted by optimal feedback theory.</content>

 Over 500 genetic loci have been associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), however most loci are located in gene-distal non-coding regions and their target genes are not known. Here, we generated high-resolution promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) maps in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) to provide a resource for identifying and prioritizing the functional targets of CVD associations. We validate these maps by demonstrating that promoters preferentially contact distal sequences enriched for tissue-specific transcription factor motifs and are enriched for chromatin marks that correlate with dynamic changes in gene expression. Using the CM PCHi-C map, we linked 1,999 CVD-associated SNPs to 347 target genes. Remarkably, more than 90% of SNP-target gene interactions did not involve the nearest gene, while 40% of SNPs interacted with at least two genes, demonstrating the importance of considering long-range chromatin interactions when interpreting functional targets of disease loci.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms infecting hundreds of millions of people. These parasites alternate between asexual reproduction in molluscan hosts and sexual reproduction in mammalian hosts; short-lived, water-borne stages infect each host. Thriving in such disparate environments requires remarkable developmental plasticity, manifested by five body plans deployed throughout the parasite’s life cycle. Stem cells in &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt; provide a potential source for such plasticity; however, the relationship between stem cells from different life-cycle stages remains unclear, as does the origin of the germline, required for sexual reproduction. Here, we show that subsets of larvally derived stem cells are likely sources of adult stem cells and the germline. We also identify a novel gene that serves as the earliest marker for the schistosome germline, which emerges inside the mammalian host and is ultimately responsible for disease pathology. This work reveals the stem cell heterogeneity driving the propagation of the schistosome life cycle.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations and excitability levels in the primary motor cortex (M1). These effects can last for more than an hour and an involvement of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-methyl-&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated synaptic plasticity has been suggested. However, to date the cortical mechanisms underlying tACS after-effects have not been explored. Here, we applied 20 Hz beta tACS to M1 while participants received either the NMDAR antagonist dextromethorphan or a placebo and the effects on cortical beta oscillations and excitability were explored. When a placebo medication was administered, beta tACS was found to increase cortical excitability and beta oscillations for at least 60 min, whereas when dextromethorphan was administered, these effects were completely abolished. These results provide the first direct evidence that tACS can induce NMDAR-mediated plasticity in the motor cortex, which contributes to our understanding of tACS-induced influences on human motor cortex physiology.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Microglial cells are increasingly recognized as modulators of brain development. We previously showed that microglia colonize the cortical proliferative zones in the prenatal brain and regulate the number of precursor cells through phagocytosis. To better define cellular interactions between microglia and proliferative cells, we performed lentiviral vector-mediated intraventricular gene transfer to induce enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in fetal cerebrocortical cells. Tissues were collected and counterstained with cell-specific markers to label microglial cells and identify other cortical cell types. We found that microglial cells intimately interact with the radial glial scaffold and make extensive contacts with neural precursor cells throughout the proliferative zones, particularly in the rhesus monkey fetus when compared to rodents. We also identify a subtype of microglia, which we term ‘periventricular microglia’, that interact closely with mitotic precursor cells in the ventricular zone. Our data suggest that microglia are structural modulators that facilitate remodeling of the proliferative zones as precursor cells migrate away from the ventricle and may facilitate the delamination of precursor cells. Taken together, these results indicate that microglial cells are an integral component of cortical proliferative zones and contribute to the interactive milieu in which cortical precursor cells function.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation of recent memories. However, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of consolidation during sleep remain poorly understood. In this study, using a realistic computational model of the thalamocortical network, we tested the role of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep in memory consolidation. We found that sleep spindles (the hallmark of N2 stage sleep) and slow oscillations (the hallmark of N3 stage sleep) both promote replay of the spike sequences learned in the awake state and replay was localized around the trained network locations. Memory performance improved after a period of NREM sleep but not after the same time period in awake. When multiple memories were trained, the local nature of the spike sequence replay during spindles allowed replay of the distinct memory traces independently, while slow oscillations promoted competition that could prevent replay of the weak memories in a presence of the stronger memory traces. This could lead to extinction of the weak memories unless when sleep spindles (N2 sleep) preceded slow oscillations (N3 sleep), as observed during the natural sleep cycle. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the role of sleep rhythms in memory consolidation and proposes a testable hypothesis how the natural structure of sleep stages provides an optimal environment to consolidate memories.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jzS-ldh1Muw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Intracellular polarization, where a cell specifies a spatial axis by segregation of specific factors, is a fundamental biological process. In the early embryo of the nematode worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)&lt;/i&gt;, polarization is often accompanied by deformations of the cortex, a highly contractile structure consisting of actin filaments cross-linked by the motor protein myosin (actomyosin). It has been suggested that the eggshell surrounding the early embryo plays a role in polarization although its function is not understood. Here we develop a mathematical model which couples a reaction-diffusion model of actomyosin dynamics with a phase field model of the cell cortex to implicitly track cell shape changes in the early &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryo. We investigate the potential rigidity effect of the geometric constraint imposed by the presence and size of the eggshell on polarization dynamics. Our model suggests that the geometric constraint of the eggshell is essential for proper polarization and the size of the eggshell also affects the dynamics of polarization. Therefore, we conclude that geometric constraint on a cell might affect the dynamics of a biochemical processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S0GKlDO6sm0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Neurons process and convey information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition typically suppresses the output firing activity of a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a &lt;i&gt;subtractive&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;divisive&lt;/i&gt; effect on a neuron’s output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing activity. Since these two “modes” of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that distinguish these response profiles. In this study, we use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the specific conditions (parameter sets) for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive effects. Significantly, we identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). In our model, this fast-activating, slowly-inactivating outward current acts as a switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. In particular, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is strong (large maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In contrast, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical systems methods (plane analysis and fast-slow dissection) to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic inputs and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Our findings suggest that neurons can “self-regulate” the gain control effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FDIMHtgjtOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here we test Humans, Rats, Monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, Tree Shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, Rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: While Monkeys and Tree Shrews based their choices largely on visual information, Rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, Rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Research into the biology of cognition and behavior increasingly relies on studies performed in murine species (mice and rats). This is due to the explosion of powerful new, murine specific, genetic tools allowing for unprecedented control in imaging and manipulation of neural circuit elements. Lacking, are concomitant comparative behavioral studies necessary toward translating these exciting results to other species, particularly humans. We show here that, unlike primates, muridae incorporate species-specific predispositions and bias into their behavioral strategy toward the solution of a simple visual task, and are therefore engaging specific circuits not used by primates during task performance. This contradicts the long held idea that learning abolishes species-specific predispositions, and highlights the importance of comparative behavioral studies in translational neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02479"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this work is to construct a model for the functional
architecture of the primary visual cortex (V1), based on a structure of metric
measure space induced by the underlying organization of receptive profiles
(RPs) of visual cells. In order to account for the horizontal connectivity of
V1 in such a context, a diffusion process compatible with the geometry of the
space is defined following the classical approach of K.-T. Sturm. The
construction of our distance function does neither require any group
parameterization of the family of RPs, nor involve any differential structure.
As such, it adapts to non-parameterized sets of RPs, possibly obtained through
numerical procedures; it also allows to model the lateral connectivity arising
from non-differential metrics such as the one induced on a pinwheel surface by
a family of filters of vanishing scale. On the other hand, when applied to the
classical framework of Gabor filters, this construction yields a distance
approximating the sub-Riemannian structure proposed as a model for V1 by G.
Citti and A. Sarti [J Math Imaging Vis 24: 307 (2006)], thus showing itself to
be consistent with existing cortex models.

 &lt;p&gt;Neural codes are binary codes in $\{0,1\}^n$; here we focus on the ones which
represent the firing patterns of a type of neurons called place cells. There is
much interest in determining which neural codes can be realized by a collection
of convex sets. However, drawing representations of these convex sets,
particularly as the number of neurons in a code increases, can be very
difficult. Nevertheless, for a class of codes that are said to be
$k$-inductively pierced for $k=0,1,2$ there is an algorithm for drawing Euler
diagrams. Here we use the toric ideal of a code to show sufficient conditions
for a code to be 1- or 2-inductively pierced, so that we may use the existing
algorithm to draw realizations of such codes.

 &lt;p&gt;It is true that the &quot;best&quot; neural network is not necessarily the one with the
most &quot;brain-like&quot; behavior. Understanding biological intelligence, however, is
a fundamental goal for several distinct disciplines. Translating our
understanding of intelligence to machines is a fundamental problem in robotics.
Propelled by new advancements in Neuroscience, we developed a spiking neural
network (SNN) that draws from mounting experimental evidence that a number of
individual neurons is associated with spatial navigation. By following the
brain's structure, our model assumes no initial all-to-all connectivity, which
could inhibit its translation to a neuromorphic hardware, and learns an
uncharted territory by mapping its identified components into a limited number
of neural representations, through spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). In
our ongoing effort to employ a bioinspired SNN-controlled robot to real-world
spatial mapping applications, we demonstrate here how an SNN may robustly
control an autonomous robot in mapping and exploring an unknown environment,
while compensating for its own intrinsic hardware imperfections, such as
partial or total loss of visual input.

 &lt;p&gt;The human brain is a complex dynamical system that gives rise to cognition
through spatiotemporal patterns of coherent and incoherent activity between
brain regions. As different regions dynamically interact to perform cognitive
tasks, variable patterns of partial synchrony can be observed, forming chimera
states. We propose that the emergence of such states plays a fundamental role
in the cognitive organization of the brain, and present a novel
cognitively-informed, chimera-based framework to explore how large-scale brain
architecture affects brain dynamics and function. Using personalized brain
network models, we systematically study how regional brain stimulation produces
different patterns of synchronization across predefined cognitive systems. We
then analyze these emergent patterns within our novel framework to understand
the impact of subject-specific and region-specific structural variability on
brain dynamics. Our results suggest a classification of cognitive systems into
four groups with differing levels of subject and regional variability that
reflect their different functional roles.

 &lt;p&gt;The human brain is ultimately responsible for all thoughts and movements that
the body produces. This allows humans to successfully interact with their
environment. If the brain is not functioning properly many abilities of human
can be damaged. The goal of cerebral signal analysis is to learn about brain
function. The idea that distinct areas of the brain are responsible for
specific tasks, the functional segregation, is a key aspect of brain function.
Functional integration is an important feature of brain function, it is the
concordance of multiple segregated brain areas to produce a unified response.
There is an amplified feedback mechanism in the brain called reentry which
requires specific timing relations. This specific timing requires neurons
within an assembly to synchronize their firing rates. This has led to increased
interest and use of phase variables, particularly their synchronization, to
measure connectivity in cerebral signals. Herein, we propose a comprehensive
review on concepts and methods previously presented for assessing cerebral
synchrony, with focus on phase synchronization, as a tool for brain
connectivity evaluation.

Motor decision-making is an essential component of everyday life which requires weighing potential rewards and punishments against the probability of successfully executing an action. To achieve this, humans rely on two key mechanisms; a flexible, instrumental, value-dependent process and a hardwired, Pavlovian, value-independent process. In economic decision-making, age-related decline in risk taking is explained by reduced Pavlovian biases that promote action toward reward. Although healthy ageing has also been associated with decreased risk-taking in motor decision-making, it is currently unknown whether this is a result of changes in Pavlovian biases, instrumental processes or a combination of both. Using a newly established approach-avoidance computational model together with a novel app-based motor decision-making task, we measured sensitivity to reward and punishment when participants (n = 26,532) made a ‘go/no-go’ motor gamble based on their perceived ability to execute a complex action. We show that motor decision-making can be better explained by a model with both instrumental and Pavlovian parameters, and reveal age-related changes across punishment- and reward-based instrumental and Pavlovian processes. However, the most striking effect of ageing was a decrease in Pavlovian attraction towards rewards, which was associated with a reduction in optimality of choice behaviour. In a subset of participants who also played an independent economic decision-making task (n = 17,220), we found similar decision-making tendencies for motor and economic domains across a majority of age groups. Pavlovian biases, therefore, play an important role in not only explaining motor decision-making behaviour but also the changes which occur through normal ageing. This provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms which shape motor decision-making across the lifespan.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7I9gI6jfrH8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Temporally ordered multi-neuron patterns likely encode information in the brain. We introduce an unsupervised method, SPOTDisClust (Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity Clustering), for their detection from high-dimensional neural ensembles. SPOTDisClust measures similarity between two ensemble spike patterns by determining the minimum transport cost of transforming their corresponding normalized cross-correlation matrices into each other (SPOTDis). Then, it performs density-based clustering based on the resulting inter-pattern dissimilarity matrix. SPOTDisClust does not require binning and can detect complex patterns (beyond sequential activation) even when high levels of out-of-pattern “noise” spiking are present. Our method handles efficiently the additional information from increasingly large neuronal ensembles and can detect a number of patterns that far exceeds the number of recorded neurons. In an application to neural ensemble data from macaque monkey V1 cortex, SPOTDisClust can identify different moving stimulus directions on the sole basis of temporal spiking patterns.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ve-KmnATpsw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In experimental assays of angiogenesis in three-dimensional fibrin matrices, a temporary scaffold formed during wound healing, the type and composition of fibrin impacts the level of sprouting. More sprouts form on high molecular weight (HMW) than on low molecular weight (LMW) fibrin. It is unclear what mechanisms regulate the number and the positions of the vascular-like structures in cell cultures. To address this question, we propose a mechanistic simulation model of endothelial cell migration and fibrin proteolysis by the plasmin system. The model is a hybrid, cell-based and continuum, computational model based on the cellular Potts model and sets of partial-differential equations. Based on the model results, we propose that a positive feedback mechanism between uPAR, plasmin and transforming growth factor &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 (TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1) selects cells in the monolayer for matrix invasion. Invading cells releases TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 from the extracellular matrix through plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation. The activated TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 further stimulates fibrin degradation and keeps proteolysis active as the sprout invades the fibrin matrix. The binding capacity for TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 of LMW is reduced relative to that of HMW. This leads to reduced activation of proteolysis and, consequently, reduced cell ingrowth in LMW fibrin compared to HMW fibrin. Thus our model predicts that endothelial cells in LMW fibrin matrices compared to HMW matrices show reduced sprouting due to a lower bio-availability of TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dJeJLhtrNNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive control—a set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different groups of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory posits that correlated and anticorrelated brain activity may signify cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas that subserve adaptive behavior. In this study, we use a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological motifs of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquire fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they perform two cognitive control tasks—a Stroop interference task and a local-global perception switching task using Navon figures—each with low and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we construct dynamic functional brain networks and use a parts-based, network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captures distributed network structures involved in different phases of cooperative and competitive control processes. Our results demonstrate that temporal expression of the subgraphs fluctuate alongside changes in cognitive demand and are associated with individual differences in task performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of cognitive systems map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XzG9sFK-qtk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The time scale of neuronal network dynamics is determined by synaptic interactions and neuronal signal integration, both of which occur on the time scale of milliseconds. Yet many behaviors like the generation of movements or vocalizations of sounds occur on the much slower time scale of seconds. Here we ask the question of how neuronal networks of the brain can support reliable behavior on this time scale. We argue that excitable neuronal assemblies with spike-frequency adaptation may serve as building blocks that can flexibly adjust the speed of execution of neural circuit function. We show in simulations that a chain of neuronal assemblies can propagate signals reliably, similar to the well-known synfire chain, but with the crucial difference that the propagation speed is slower and tunable to the behaviorally relevant range. Moreover we study a grid of excitable neuronal assemblies as a simplified model of the somatosensory barrel cortex of the mouse and demonstrate that various patterns of experimentally observed spatial activity propagation can be explained.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7s2Bl1Mmz-s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell-types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This analysis is one of the first of the Allen Brain Observatory’s visual cortex dataset. The mouse has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to primates and carnivorous species as a model for studying visual perception. Mice offer the benefit of large-scale, high-throughput experiments and sophisticated genetic tools useful to investigating highly specific components of visual perception. Preliminary work in identifying the functional organization of mouse extrastriate areas has focused on single neurons and lacks analysis at the population level. Our population decoding analysis contributes novel evidence about the role of many distinct areas and layers of the mouse visual cortex in visual information processing to further establish the mouse as a viable model for future visual system research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Decision-making under risk entails the possibility of simultaneously receiving positive (reward) and negative (punishment) stimuli. To learn in this context, one must integrate conflicting information related to the magnitude of reward and the probability of punishment. Long-term inactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) disrupts this process and increases risky behavior. In a recent study published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, Orisini et al., (2017) showed that briefly inhibiting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) may result in increased or decreased risk-taking behavior, depending on the phase of the decision process in which BLA activity is disrupted. Here we discuss the results and propose future experiments that could improve our understanding of how the BLA contributes to adaptive learning under risk and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a novel mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that moves the site of kainate injection from the rodent dorsal hippocampus (corresponding to the human posterior hippocampus) to the ventral hippocampus (corresponding to the human anterior hippocampus). We compare the phenotypes of this new model – with respect to seizures, cognitive impairment, affective deficits, and histopathology – to the standard dorsal intrahippocampal kainate model. Our results demonstrate that histopathological measures of granule cell dispersion and mossy fiber sprouting maximize near the site of kainate injection. Somewhat surprisingly, both the dorsal and ventral models exhibit similar spatial memory impairments in addition to similar electrographic and behavioral seizure burdens. In contrast, we find a more pronounced affective (anhedonic) phenotype specifically in the ventral model. These results demonstrate that the ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model recapitulates critical pathologies of the dorsal model while providing a means to further study affective phenotypes such as depression in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by spontaneous recurring seizures. TLE additionally features cognitive and affective comorbidities that impair quality of life. Animal models studying TLE are critical to advance our understanding of the disorder. A current popular model targets the dorsal hippocampus with a focal injection of kainic acid to induce epilepsy. Evidence suggest targeting the ventral hippocampus may produce a model of TLE with distinct benefits. We present data demonstrating that targeting the mouse ventral hippocampus with kainic acid creates a TLE model with similar seizure and cognitive phenotypes to the standard dorsal model but with additional, pronounced affective features, including anhedonia. These results describe a new tool for epilepsy researchers to better study comorbidities of TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In this paper, we explore how Integrated Information Theory of consciousness
(IIT) has evolved and what problems are involved in the theory. IIT is a
hypothesis that consciousness can be explained in terms of integrated
information. It argues that a number of fundamental properties of experience
can be properly analyzed and explained by physical systems' informational
properties. Throughout the last decade, there have been many advances in IIT's
theoretical structure and mathematical model. In addition, as all hypotheses in
the field of science of consciousness, IIT has given rise to several
controversies and issues. In this context, a critical survey for IIT is
urgently needed. To this end, we first introduce fundamental concepts of IIT
and related issues. Thereafter, we discuss major transitions IIT has been
through and how they affect IIT. Finally, in the last section, some theoretical
issues involved in IIT's principles are presented. The paper concludes by
suggesting that, for the sake of future development, IIT should more seriously
take metacognitive accessibility to experience.

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) is conventionally considered to be solely dependent on local protein synthesis. Given the impact of epigenetics on memory, the intriguing question is whether epigenetic regulation influences mGluR-LTD as well. G9a/GLP histone lysine methyltransferase complex is crucial for brain development and goal-directed learning as well as for drug-addiction. In this study, we analyzed whether the epigenetic regulation by G9a/GLP complex affects mGluR-LTD in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons of 5–7 weeks old male Wistar rats. In hippocampal slices with intact CA1 dendritic regions, inhibition of G9a/GLP activity abolished mGluR-LTD. The inhibition of this complex upregulated the expression of plasticity proteins like PKMζ, which mediated the prevention of mGluR-LTD expression by regulating the NSF-GluA2-mediated trafficking of AMPA receptors towards the postsynaptic site. G9a/GLP inhibition during the induction of mGluR-LTD also downregulated the protein levels of phosphorylated-GluA2 and Arc. Interestingly, G9a/GLP inhibition could not impede the mGluR-LTD when the cell-body was severed. Our study highlights the role of G9a/GLP complex in intact neuronal network as a bidirectional switch; when turned on, it facilitates the expression of mGluR-LTD, and when turned off, it promotes the expression of long-term potentiation.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Higher brain function relies on proper development of the cerebral cortex, including correct positioning of neurons and dendrite morphology. Disruptions in these processes may result in various neurocognitive disorders. Mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CPE&lt;/span&gt; gene, which encodes carboxypeptidase E (CPE), have been linked to depression and intellectual disability. However, it remains unclear whether CPE is involved in early brain development and in turn contributes to the pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders. Here, we investigate the effects of CPE knockdown on early brain development and explore the functional significance of the interaction between CPE and its binding partner p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt;. We demonstrate that CPE is required for cortical neuron migration and dendrite arborization. Furthermore, we show that expression of CPE-C10 redistributes p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; from the centrosome and that disruption of CPE interaction with p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; leads to abnormal neuronal migration and dendrite morphology, suggesting that a complex between CPE and p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; is necessary for proper neurodevelopment.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Elucidating axonal and dendritic projection patterns of individual neurons is a key for understanding the cytoarchitecture of neural circuits in the brain. This requires genetic approaches to achieve Golgi-like sparse labeling of desired types of neurons. Here, we explored a novel strategy of stochastic gene activation with regulated sparseness (STARS), in which the stochastic choice between 2 competing Cre-&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; recombination events is controlled by varying the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; efficiency and cassette length. In a created STARS transgenic mouse crossed with various Cre driver lines, sparse neuronal labeling with a relatively uniform level of sparseness was achieved across different brain regions and cell types in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Tracing of individual type II peripheral auditory fibers revealed for the first time that they undergo experience-dependent developmental refinement, which is impaired by attenuating external sound input. Our results suggest that STARS strategy can be applied for circuit mapping and sparse gene manipulation.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When we speak, we get correlated sensory feedback from speech sounds and from the muscles and soft tissues of the vocal tract. Here we dissociate the contributions of auditory and somatosensory feedback to identify brain networks that underlie the somatic contribution to speech motor learning. The technique uses a robotic device that selectively alters somatosensory inputs in combination with resting-state fMRI scans that reveal learning-related changes in functional connectivity. A partial correlation analysis is used to identify connectivity changes that are not explained by the time course of activity in any other learning-related areas. This analysis revealed changes related to behavioral improvements in movement and separately, to changes in auditory perception: Speech motor adaptation itself was associated with connectivity changes that were primarily in non-motor areas of brain, specifically, to a strengthening of connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex and between presupplementary motor area and the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, connectively changes associated with alterations to auditory perception were restricted to speech motor areas, specifically, primary motor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our findings show that during adaptation, somatosensory inputs result in a broad range of changes in connectivity in areas associated with speech motor control and learning.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Research on memory has been a major focus in the neurosciences over the past decades. An important advance was achieved by Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute, who reported from the 1930s to the 1950s about experiential phenomena induced by electrical brain stimulation in humans, implying neuronal causation of memory. Since then, neuroscientists have addressed the topic of memory from a range of subdisciplines; however, these reports by Penfield and his group as well as those on patient H. M. by Brenda Milner at the same institution continue to be referenced as groundbreaking. Further experimental work by Nobel laureates Eric Kandel and John O’Keefe, as well as by Edvard and May-Britt Moser related Penfield’s patient documentation to experiential phenomena. However, our reassessment of Penfield’s original patient documentation questions the stance that he had uncovered the “storehouse of memories.” Human memory must be regarded more as context sensitive and as representative of an active reconstructive process, than as a simple recording of events. Hence, strategies aiming at naturalizing all phenomena of mind (including memory) to cellular and molecular mechanisms cannot convincingly refer to Penfield’s electrophysiological studies alone as evidence that memories are solely caused by neuronal firing patterns.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Focal adhesions are protein complexes that anchor cells to the extracellular matrix. During migration, the growth and disassembly of these structures are spatiotemporally regulated, with new adhesions forming at the leading edge of the cell and mature adhesions disassembling at the rear. Signalling proteins and structural cytoskeletal components tightly regulate adhesion dynamics. Paxillin, an adaptor protein within adhesions, is one of these proteins. Its phosphorylation at serine 273 (S273) is crucial for maintaining fast adhesion assembly and disassembly. Paxillin is known to bind to a GIT1-βPIX-PAK1 complex, which increases the local activation of the small GTPase Rac. To understand quantitatively the behaviour of this system and how it relates to adhesion assembly/disassembly, we developed a mathematical model describing the dynamics of the small GTPases Rac and Rho as determined by paxillin S273 phosphorylation. Our model revealed that the system possesses bistability, where switching between uninduced (active Rho) and induced (active Rac) states can occur through a change in rate of paxillin phosphorylation or PAK1 activation. The bistable switch is characterized by the presence of memory, minimal change in the levels of active Rac and Rho within the induced and uninduced states, respectively, and the limited regime of monostability associated with the uninduced state. These results were validated experimentally by showing the presence of bimodality in adhesion assembly and disassembly rates, and demonstrating that Rac activity increases after treating Chinese Hamster Ovary cells with okadaic acid (a paxillin phosphatase inhibitor), followed by a modest recovery after 20 min washout. Spatial gradients of phosphorylated paxillin in a reaction-diffusion model gave rise to distinct regions of Rac and Rho activities, resembling polarization of a cell into front and rear. Perturbing several parameters of the model also revealed important insights into how signalling components upstream and downstream of paxillin phosphorylation affect dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4Bo3nqD1NCA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-models) explicitly compute the optimal proteome composition of a growing cell. ME-models expand upon the well-established genome-scale models of metabolism (M-models), and they enable a new fundamental understanding of cellular growth. ME-models have increased predictive capabilities and accuracy due to their inclusion of the biosynthetic costs for the machinery of life, but they come with a significant increase in model size and complexity. This challenge results in models which are both difficult to compute and challenging to understand conceptually. As a result, ME-models exist for only two organisms (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thermotoga maritima&lt;/i&gt;) and are still used by relatively few researchers. To address these challenges, we have developed a new software framework called COBRAme for building and simulating ME-models. It is coded in Python and built on COBRApy, a popular platform for using M-models. COBRAme streamlines computation and analysis of ME-models. It provides tools to simplify constructing and editing ME-models to enable ME-model reconstructions for new organisms. We used COBRAme to reconstruct a condensed &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; ME-model called &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JL1678b-ME. This reformulated model gives functionally identical solutions to previous &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; ME-models while using 1/5 the number of free variables and solving in less than 10 minutes, a marked improvement over the 6 hour solve time of previous ME-model formulations. Errors in previous ME-models were also corrected leading to 52 additional genes that must be expressed in &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JL1678b-ME to grow aerobically in glucose minimal &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; media. This manuscript outlines the architecture of COBRAme and demonstrates how ME-models can be created, modified, and shared most efficiently using the new software framework.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cjOqyaA5KvQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Perceiving an external stimulus depends not only on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations (8–30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual precision, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers’ subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task independent. We found that correct detection was more likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval (i.e., 8–17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval), consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) in the CNS is suggested as a common mechanism contributing to headache. Despite strong evidence for CNS involvement in headache disorders, drug development for headache disorders remains focused on peripheral targets. Difficulty in delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may partially account for this disparity. It is known, however, that BBB permeability is increased during several CNS pathologies. In this study, we investigated BBB changes in response to KCl-induced CSD events and subsequent allodynia in rats. Cortical KCl injection in awake, freely moving rats produced facial allodynia with peak intensity between 1.5 and 3 hours and CSD induction within 0.5 to 2 hours post-injection. Brain perfusion of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-sucrose as a marker of BBB paracellular permeability revealed increased leak in the cortex, but not brainstem, beginning 0.5 hours post-KCl injection and resolving within 6 hours; no changes in tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin or claudin-5 expression were observed. Acute pre-treatment with topiramate to inhibit CSD did not prevent the increased BBB paracellular permeability. CNS delivery of the abortive anti-migraine agent sumatriptan was increased in the cortex 1.5 hours post-KCl injection. Surprisingly, sumatriptan uptake was also increased in the brainstem following CSD induction, suggesting regulation of active transport mechanisms at the BBB. Together these results demonstrate the ability of CSD events to produce transient, time-dependent changes in BBB permeability when allodynia is present and to mediate access of clinically relevant therapeutics (i.e., sumatriptan) to the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The need to overcome the BBB is one of the major hurdles in designing CNS active drugs. CNS mechanisms have been shown to play a vital role in primary and secondary headache disorders. In this study we show that BBB permeability is transiently increased in a rat model of CSD induced episodic headache. We also observed a significant increase in sumatriptan uptake into the brain. Clinically, sumatriptan has been shown to be most efficacious when given close to the onset of headache pain, corresponding to times where we observed increased CNS uptake in our rat model. These data suggest that altered BBB permeability occurs during CSD and may be taken advantage of during therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The chemical signal of light onset, a decrease in glutamate release from rod and cone photoreceptors, is processed by a postsynaptic G protein signaling cascade in ON-bipolar cells (BPCs). The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6, along with other cascade elements, is localized synaptically at the BPC dendritic tips. The effector ion channel protein transient receptor potential melastatin-1 (TRPM1), in contrast, is located not only at the dendritic tips but also in BPC bodies and axons. Little is known about the intracellular localization of TRPM1, or its trafficking route to the dendritic tip plasma membrane. Recombinant TRPM1 expressed in mammalian cells colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers, with little or none detected at the plasma membrane. In mouse retina, somatic TRPM1 was similarly intracellular, and not at the plasma membrane. Labeling of ER membranes by expression of a fluorescent marker showed that in BPCs the ER extends into axons and dendrites, but not dendritic tips. In cell bodies, TRPM1 colocalized with the ER, and not with the Golgi apparatus. Fluorescence protease protection (FPP) assays with TRPM1-GFP fusions in heterologous cells revealed that the N and C termini are both accessible to the cytoplasm, consistent with the transmembrane domain topology of related TRP channels. These results indicate that the majority of TRPM1 is present in the ER, from which it can potentially be transported to the dendritic tips as needed for ON light responses. The excess of ER-resident TRPM1 relative to the amount needed at the dendritic tips suggests a potential new function for TRPM1 in the ER.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01597"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;For utilization of robotic assistive devices in everyday life, means for
detection and processing of erroneous robot actions are a focal aspect in the
development of collaborative systems, especially when controlled via brain
signals. Though, the variety of possible scenarios and the diversity of used
robotic systems pose a challenge for error decoding from recordings of brain
signals such as via EEG. For example, it is unclear whether humanoid
appearances of robotic assistants have an influence on the performance. In this
paper, we designed a study in which two different robots executed the same task
both in an erroneous and a correct manner. We find error-related EEG signals of
human observers indicating that the performance of the error decoding was
independent of robot design. However, we can show that it was possible to
identify which robot performed the instructed task by means of the EEG signals.
In this case, deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) could reach
significantly higher ac curacies than both regularized Linear Discriminanat
Analysis (rLDA) and filter bank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) combined with
rLDA. Our findings indicate that decoding information about robot action
success from the EEG, particularly when using deep neural networks, may be an
applicable approach for a broad range of robot designs.

 Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, affecting 1 in 1,000 live births and representing up to 3% of all pediatric hospital charges. Using data from the largest CH exome sequencing study to date, Furey et al. identify four genes (TRIM71, SMARCC1, PTCH1, and SHH) not previously implicated in CH. Remarkably, all four genes regulate ventricular zone neural stem cell fate and, together, explain ∼10% of CH cases. These findings implicate impaired neurogenesis in pathogenesis of a significant number of CH patients, with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic ramifications.</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Familiarity of the environment changes the way we perceive and encode incoming information. However, the neural substrates underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here we describe a new form of experience-dependent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake adult male mice. The oscillations emerged in visually evoked potentials and single-unit activity following repeated visual stimulation. The oscillations were sensitive to the spatial frequency content of a visual stimulus and required the mAChRs for their induction and expression. Finally, ongoing visually evoked  (4–8 Hz) oscillations boost the visually evoked potential amplitude of incoming visual stimuli if the stimuli are presented at the high excitability phase of the oscillations. Our results demonstrate that an oscillatory code can be used to encode familiarity and serves as a gate for oncoming sensory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous experience can influence the processing of incoming sensory information by the brain and alter perception. However, the mechanistic understanding of how this process takes place is lacking. We have discovered that persistent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex encode information about familiarity and the spatial frequency of the stimulus. These familiarity evoked oscillations influence neuronal responses to the oncoming stimuli in a way that depends on the oscillation phase. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism of visual stimulus feature detection and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6207?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Periodic episodes of excessive alcohol consumption (&quot;binge drinking&quot;) occur frequently among adolescents, and early binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of alcohol use disorders later in life. The PFC undergoes significant development during adolescence and hence may be especially susceptible to the effects of binge drinking. In humans and in animal models, adolescent alcohol exposure is known to alter PFC neuronal activity and produce deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors, such as decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Using a voluntary intermittent access to alcohol (IA EtOH) procedure in male mice, we demonstrate that binge-level alcohol consumption during adolescence leads to altered drinking patterns and working memory deficits in young adulthood, two outcomes that suggest medial PFC dysfunction. We recorded from pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the prelimbic subregion of the medial PFC in slices obtained from mice that had IA EtOH and found that they display altered excitability, including a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and reductions in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) and in intrinsic persistent activity (a mode of neuronal firing that is dependent on I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). Many of these effects on intrinsic excitability were sustained following abstinence and observed in mice that showed working memory deficits. In addition, we found that resting membrane potential and the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent voltage &quot;sag&quot; in prelimbic PFC PNs are developmentally regulated during adolescence, suggesting that adolescent alcohol exposure may compromise PFC function by arresting the normal developmental trajectory of PN intrinsic excitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Binge alcohol drinking during adolescence has negative consequences for the function of the developing PFC. Using a mouse model of voluntary binge drinking during adolescence, we found that this behavior leads to working memory deficits and altered drinking behavior in adulthood. In addition, we found that adolescent drinking is associated with specific changes to the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC, reducing the ability of these neurons to generate intrinsic persistent activity, a phenomenon thought to be important for working memory. These findings may help explain why human adolescent binge drinkers show performance deficits on tasks mediated by the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The reticular formation is important in primate motor control, both in health and during recovery after brain damage. Little is known about the different neurons present in the reticular nuclei. Here we recorded extracellular spikes from the reticular formation in five healthy female awake behaving monkeys (193 cells), and in two female monkeys 1 year after recovery from a unilateral pyramidal tract lesion (125 cells). Analysis of spike shape and four measures derived from the interspike interval distribution identified four clusters of neurons in control animals. Cluster 1 cells had a slow firing rate. Cluster 2 cells had narrow spikes and irregular firing, which often included high-frequency bursts. Cluster 3 cells were highly rhythmic and fast firing. Cluster 4 cells showed negative spikes. A separate population of 42 cells was antidromically identified as reticulospinal neurons in five anesthetized female monkeys. The distribution of spike width in these cells closely overlaid the distribution for cluster 2, leading us tentatively to suggest that cluster 2 included neurons with reticulospinal projections. In animals after corticospinal lesion, cells could be identified in all four clusters. The firing rate of cells in clusters 1 and 2 was increased in lesioned animals relative to control animals (by 52% and 60%, respectively); cells in cluster 2 were also more regular and more bursting in the lesioned animals. We suggest that changes in both membrane properties and local circuits within the reticular formation occur following lesioning, potentially increasing reticulospinal output to help compensate for lost corticospinal descending drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work is the first to subclassify neurons in the reticular formation, providing insights into the local circuitry of this important but little understood structure. The approach developed can be applied to any extracellular recording from this region, allowing future studies to place their data within our current framework of four neural types. Changes in reticular neurons may be important to subserve functional recovery after damage in human patients, such as after stroke or spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

At excitatory synapses, activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate leads to calcium influx triggering intracellular pathways that promote the trafficking of AMPA receptors to the post-synaptic membrane and actin remodeling. New evidence shows that Wnt secreted proteins, known for their role in synapse development, are essential for early stages of long-term potentiation, a form of plasticity that increases synaptic strength. Here, we review recent progress in this area and the significance of Wnt signaling to synaptic plasticity in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Felix Brinkmann, Moritz Mercker, Thomas Richter, Anna Marciniak-Czochra&lt;/p&gt;

Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously arising from specific chemical interactions (such as “Turing-patterns”). Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories, and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development. On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development. On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TU2UMRsefhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, &lt;i&gt;Hirudo verbana&lt;/i&gt;, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion), and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3); an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bi-directional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependency on afferent information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In the field of motor control, a pressing issue to resolve is how the central and peripheral nervous system become retuned and work together to establish functional locomotor patterns after descending signals are chronically removed after injury. The work we have presented, in the medicinal leech, clarifies that central pattern generator (CPG) neural networks are highly plastic in their ability to incorporate different timing elements for their intersegmental coordination after descending-coordinating information is removed. Essentially, the crawl CPGs switch their dependence on descending-timing cues to those originating from proprioceptive neurons in the muscular body wall. Results from our experimentally tractable preparation may provide a platform to guide future studies of locomotor recovery in vertebrate animals after spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Addiction is characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model, based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning. These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by addictive rewards. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted U-shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Addiction is known to encompass heterogeneity in its development, maintenance, and treatment response. While previous work has mostly focused on the common mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities in addiction at a group level, the neurocomputational causes for such intersubject variability in addition are not well-understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we combine a neural and a reinforcement learning model to reveal that the balance between neural circuits or computational control modalities characterizes the presence of behavioral phenotypes in addiction. The presence of converging effects, validated across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, informs on a quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity, and potentially helps future development of precision treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The lateral amygdala (LA) plays a critical role in the formation of fear conditioned associative memories. Previous studies have used c-&lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt; regulated expression to identify a spatially restricted population of neurons within the LA that is specifically activated by fear learning. These neurons are likely to be a part of a memory engram but, to date, functional evidence for this has been lacking. We show that neurons within a spatially restricted region of the LA had an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSC) when compared to neurons recorded from home-cage control mice. We then more specifically addressed if this increased synaptic activity was limited to learning-activated neurons. Using a &lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tau-LacZ&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt;) transgenic mouse line, we developed a fluorescence-based method of identifying and recording from neurons activated by fear learning (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) in acute brain slices. An increase in frequency and amplitude of sPSCs was observed in &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons when compared to non-activated &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons in fear conditioned mice. No learning-induced changes were observed in the action potential input-output relationships. These findings support the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram through changes in synaptic connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The lateral amygdala (LA) is critical for the formation of associative fear memories, such as those formed by fear conditioning. A subset of neurons in LA are activated by fear conditioning suggesting that they may be part of a memory engram. However, there is no functional evidence to support this view. Electrophysiological characterisation of LA neurons shows that the frequency and amplitude of synaptic events increase following fear conditioning. A method based on β-galactosidase as a reporter was developed to locate activated neurons in acute slice. An increase in frequency and amplitude of synaptic events was observed in activated compared to non-activated neurons supporting the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Animals and humans rapidly detect specific features of sounds, but the time courses of the underlying neural response for different stimulus categories is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intricate functional organization of auditory information processing pathways is poorly understood. Here, we computed neuronal response latencies from simultaneously recorded spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) along the first two stages of cortical sound processing, primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt (LB), of awake, behaving macaques. Two types of response latencies were measured for spike trains as well as LFPs: (1) onset latency, time-locked to onset of external auditory stimuli; and (2) selection latency, time taken from stimulus onset to a selective response to a specific stimulus category. Trial-by-trial LFP onset latencies predominantly reflecting synaptic input arrival typically preceded spike onset latencies, assumed to be representative of neuronal output indicating that both areas may receive input environmental signals and relay the information to the next stage. In A1, simple sounds, such as pure tones (PTs), yielded shorter spike onset latencies compared to complex sounds, such as monkey vocalizations (&quot;Coos&quot;). This trend was reversed in LB, indicating a hierarchical functional organization of auditory cortex in the macaque. LFP selection latencies in A1 were always shorter than those in LB for both PT and Coo reflecting the serial arrival of stimulus-specific information in these areas. Thus, chronometry on spike-LFP signals revealed some of the effective neural circuitry underlying complex sound discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 A key component of current theories of brain structure and function is the layer-specific origin of structural connections of the cerebral cortex. This fundamental connectional feature pertains to different mammalian cortices, and recent neuroimaging advancements have started to pave the way for its function-based mapping in humans. Here, we propose a framework that systematically explains the characteristic layer-specific origin of structural connections and its graded variation across the cortical sheet and across mammalian species.</content>

It is challenging to decipher molecular mechanisms in biological systems from system-level input-output data, especially for complex processes that involve interactions among multiple components. We addressed this general problem for the bacterial histidine kinase CheA, the activity of which is regulated in chemotaxis signaling complexes by bacterial chemoreceptors. We developed a general network model to describe the dynamics of the system, treating the receptor complex with coupling protein CheW and the P3P4P5 domains of kinase CheA as a regulated enzyme with two substrates, ATP and P1, the phosphoryl-accepting domain of CheA. Our simple network model allowed us to search hypothesis space systematically. For different and progressively more complex regulation schemes, we fit our models to a large set of input-output data with the aim of identifying the simplest possible regulation mechanisms consistent with the data. Our modeling and analysis revealed novel dual regulation mechanisms in which receptor activity regulated ATP binding plus one other process, either P1 binding or phosphoryl transfer between P1 and ATP. Strikingly, in our models receptor control affected the kinetic rate constants of substrate association and dissociation equally and thus did not alter the respective equilibrium constants. We suggest experiments that could distinguish between the two dual-regulation mechanisms. This systems-biology approach of combining modeling and a large input-output dataset should be applicable for studying other complex biological processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/55xMZx8_bX8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine if maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mouse dams to fluoxetine during different periods of gestation and lactation, and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal fluoxetine treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Human epidemiological studies suggest that taking antidepressants during pregnancy may increase risk autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Since only women with a diagnosis take antidepressants, there is substantial debate on whether all increased ASD risk is contributed by the diagnosis, or if medication has an additional influence. We reasoned empirical studies in a reduced system might provide some indication if there was biological basis for such an influence. Our mouse studies show that, in the absence of other maternal manipulations or stressors, maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure alone can alter the behavioral circuits for sensory, social and repetitive behaviors, relevant to ASD, in a mammalian brain, and that some of these changes are reversible by SSRI re-exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human adolescence is a period of rapid changes in cognition and goal-directed behavior, and constitutes a major transitional phase towards adulthood. One of the mechanisms suggested to underlie the protracted maturation of functional brain networks, is the increased network integration and segregation enhancing neural efficiency. Importantly, the increasing coordinated network interplay throughout development is mediated through functional hubs, which are highly connected brain areas suggested to be pivotal nodes for the regulation of neural activity. To elucidate brain hub development during childhood and adolescence, we estimated voxel-wise eigenvector centrality (EC) using fMRI data from two different psychological contexts (resting state and a working memory task), in a large cross-sectional sample (n = 754) spanning the age from 8-22 years, and decomposed the maps using independent component analysis. Our results reveal significant age-related centrality differences in cingulo-opercular, visual and sensorimotor network nodes during both rest and task performance, suggesting that common neurodevelopmental processes manifest across different mental states. Supporting the functional significance of these developmental patterns, the centrality of the cingulo-opercular node was positively associated with task performance. These findings provide evidence for protracted maturation of hub properties in specific nodes of the brain connectome during the course of childhood and adolescence, and suggest that cingulo-opercular centrality is a key factor supporting neurocognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Adolescence is a sensitive period during ontogeny and a maturational gateway to adulthood. A better characterization of the brain changes underpinning cognitive and emotional development occurring during this period is key to inform models of normal and abnormal adaptation. Advanced brain imaging allows for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of the protracted maturation of brain network function and connectivity during childhood and adolescence. Here, we used functional brain imaging to identify neural hubs during two psychological contexts in 754 children and adolescents. Key regions of the brain network showed increasing importance through adolescence, and individual differences in working memory performance was associated with the centrality of cingulo-opercular network nodes, suggesting a hot-spot for neurocognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 How can blood rapidly and precisely reach active neurons at a given time and location has remained enigmatic for a long time. A 2003 paper by Zonta et al. suggested key roles for astrocytes in the signaling between neurons and blood vessels. While a consensus on the specific intermediary roles of astrocytes in this process is still evolving, research in the past 15 years has led to a deeper and more refined understanding of the neuro-glio-vascular unit.</content>

 In 1983 Libet et al. demonstrated that brain activity associated with a voluntary act precedes conscious experience of the intention to act by several hundred milliseconds. The implication that it is the brain, rather than ‘free will’, that initiates voluntary acts has been discussed ever since by philosophers and lawyers, as well as by scientists. We show here how Libet’s original study gave rise to an entire research field of experimental investigations of volition.</content>

 The past decade has yielded substantial evidence that the gut microbiome modulates brain function, including for instance behaviors relevant to anxiety and depression, pointing to a need to identify the biological pathways involved. In 2013 Clarke and colleagues reported that the early-life microbiome regulates the hippocampal serotonergic system in a sex-dependent manner, findings that opened up numerous lines of inquiry on the effects of the microbiome on neurodevelopment and behavior.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;By using AT8-immunocytochemistry that visualizes hyperphosphorylated tau protein, we examined neurofibrillary changes related to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 40 individuals at neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages I–IV. We report the presence of abnormal tau changes within solitary pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the neocortex. These pyramidal cells showed pathology in different cell compartments (dendritic, somatic, axonal) that appeared to occur sequentially: Tau pathology was seen in distal segments of the basal dendrites, then in proximal dendrites, the soma, and, finally, in the axon of affected neurons. These findings are remarkable in that they point to the existence of neurofibrillary changes in regions routinely associated with later NFT stages. In addition, they lend support to the idea that it may be the axons of cortico-cortical top-down neurons in neocortical fields involved in AD that carry and spread abnormal tau seeds in a focused manner (transsynaptically) into the distal dendritic segments of nerve cells following directly in the neuronal chain, thereby sustaining further tau-seeded templating.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Excessive excitation has been hypothesized to subsume a significant part of the acute damage occurring after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, reduced neuronal excitability, loss of neuronal firing, and a disturbed excitation/inhibition balance have been detected. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are major regulators of perisomatic inhibition, principal neurons firing, and overall cortical excitability. However, their role in acute TBI pathogenic cascades is unclear. We exploited the chemogenetic Pharmacologically Selective Activation Module and Pharmacologically Selective Effector Module control of PV-Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) control of principal neurons in a blunt model of TBI to explore the role of inhibition in shaping neuronal vulnerability to TBI. We demonstrated that inactivation of PV interneurons at the instance or soon after trauma enhances survival of principal neurons and reduces gliosis at 7 dpi whereas, activation of PV interneurons decreased neuronal survival. The protective effect of PV inactivation was suppressed by expressing the nuclear calcium buffer PV-nuclear localisation sequence in principal neurons, implying an activity-dependent neuroprotective signal. In fact, protective effects were obtained by increasing the excitability of principal neurons directly using DREADDs. Thus, we show that sustaining neuronal excitation in the early phases of TBI may reduce neuronal vulnerability by increasing activity-dependent survival, while excess activation of perisomatic inhibition is detrimental to neuronal integrity.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Distinct firing properties among touch receptors are influenced by multiple, interworking anatomical structures. Our understanding of the functions and crosstalk of Merkel cells and their associated neurites—the end organs of slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents—remains incomplete. Piezo2 mechanically activated channels are required both in Merkel cells and in sensory neurons for canonical SAI responses in rodents; however, a central unanswered question is how rapidly inactivating currents give rise to sustained action potential volleys in SAI afferents. The computational model herein synthesizes mechanotransduction currents originating from Merkel cells and neurites, in context of skin mechanics and neural dynamics. Its goal is to mimic distinct spike firing patterns from wildtype animals, as well as &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; knockout animals that completely lack Merkel cells. The developed generator function includes a Merkel cell mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents and downstream voltage-activated conductances (slower decay of current) and a neurite mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents (faster decay of current). To mimic sustained firing in wildtype animals, a longer time constant was needed than the 200 ms observed for mechanically activated membrane depolarizations in rodent Merkel cells. One mechanism that suffices is to introduce an ultra-slowly inactivating current, with a time constant on the order of 1.7 s. This mechanism may drive the slow adaptation of the sustained response, for which the skin’s viscoelastic relaxation cannot account. Positioned within the sensory neuron, this source of current reconciles the physiology and anatomical characteristics of &lt;i&gt;Atoh1&lt;/i&gt; knockout animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AN0hi7HylwE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A major goal of cancer genomics is to identify somatic mutations that play a role in tumor initiation or progression. Somatic mutations within transcription factors are of particular interest, as gene expression dysregulation is widespread in cancers. The substantial gene expression variation evident across tumors suggests that numerous regulatory factors are likely to be involved and that somatic mutations within them may not occur at high frequencies across patient cohorts, thereby complicating efforts to uncover which ones are cancer-relevant. Here we analyze somatic mutations within the largest family of human transcription factors, namely those that bind DNA via Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Specifically, to hone in on important mutations within these genes, we aggregated somatic mutations across all of them by their positions within Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Remarkably, we found that for three classes of cancers profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)—Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, Colon and Rectal Adenocarcinomas, and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma—two specific, functionally important positions within zinc finger domains are mutated significantly more often than expected by chance, with alterations in 18%, 10% and 43% of tumors, respectively. Numerous zinc finger genes are affected, with those containing Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor domains preferentially targeted by these mutations. Further, the genes with these mutations also have high overall missense mutation rates, are expressed at levels comparable to those of known cancer genes, and together have biological process annotations that are consistent with roles in cancers. Altogether, we introduce evidence broadly implicating mutations within a diverse set of zinc finger proteins as relevant for cancer, and propose that they contribute to the widespread transcriptional dysregulation observed in cancer cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei87dOiwXCQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Martha W Bagnall, David Schoppik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most animals orient their bodies with respect to gravity to facilitate locomotion and perception. The neural circuits responsible for these orienting movements have long served as a model to address fundamental questions in systems neuroscience. Though postural control is vital, we know little about development of either balance reflexes or the neural circuitry that produces them. Recent work in a genetically and optically accessible vertebrate, the larval zebrafish, has begun to reveal the mechanisms by which such vestibular behaviors and circuits come to function. Here we highlight recent work that leverages the particular advantages of the larval zebrafish to illuminate mechanisms of postural development, the role of sensation for balance circuit development, and the organization of developing vestibular circuits. Further, we frame open questions regarding the developmental mechanisms for functional circuit assembly and maturation where studying the zebrafish vestibular system is likely to open new frontiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The sympathetic system’s role in modulating vasculature and its influence on emotions and personality led us to test the hypothesis that interactions between brain resting-state networks (RSNs) and pulse amplitude (indexing sympathetic activity) would be associated with emotions and personality. In 203 participants, we characterized RSN spatiotemporal characteristics, and phase–amplitude associations of RSN fluctuations with pulse and respiratory recordings. We found that RSNs are spatially reproducible within participants and were temporally associated with low frequencies (LFs &amp;lt; 0.1 Hz) in physiological signals. LF fluctuations in pulse amplitude were not related to cardiac electrical activity and preceded LF fluctuations in RSNs, while LF respiratory amplitude fluctuations followed LF fluctuations in RSNs. LF phase dispersion (PD) (lack of synchrony) between RSNs and pulse (PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt;) (not respiratory) correlated with the common variability in measures of personality and emotions, with more synchrony being associated with more positive temperamental characteristics. Voxel-level PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt; mapping revealed an “autonomic brain network,” including sensory cortices and dorsal attention stream, with significant interactions with peripheral signals. Here, we uncover associations between pulse signal amplitude (presumably of sympathetic origin) and brain resting state, suggesting that interactions between central and autonomic nervous systems are important for characterizing personality and emotions.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 A reductively mechanistic approach to neuroscience suggests that low-level physical laws determine our actions and that mental states are epiphenomena. In this scheme there seems to be little room for free will or genuine agency. I argue here that physical indeterminacy provides room for the information entailed in patterns of neuronal firing – the mental content of beliefs, goals, and intentions – to have real causal power in decision-making.</content>

Sleep spindles are brief oscillatory events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here, using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, which projects to middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of intra- and inter-cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increased spindle density as has been observed during learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6XKqTbGe3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Studies of female specific behaviors have remained niche, but the focus is changing as illustrated by the recent progress in understanding the female courtship responses and egg-laying decisions. In this review, we will cover our current knowledge about female behaviors in these two specific contexts. Recent studies elucidate on how females process the courtship song. They also show that egg-laying decisions are extremely complex, requiring the assessment of food, microbial, predator and social cues. Study of female responses will improve our understanding of how a nervous system processes different challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Their morphology and density change throughout life, reflecting the maturation and reorganization of excitatory circuits. The development of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; two-photon microscopy has enabled the monitoring of the same dendritic spines over time during different developmental periods. In this review we focus on recent &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; imaging studies in rodents that have revealed cell type-specific and region-specific structural dynamics of dendritic spines. We also discuss how the contributions of local inhibitory neurons and long-distance excitatory and neuromodulatory inputs to the cortex influence dendritic spine development and dynamics. Such studies will facilitate our understanding of how environmental factors and experiences affect cortical synapse development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Neuronal proteostasis is maintained by the dynamic integration of different processes that regulate the synthesis, folding, quality control, and localization of proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a fundamental pillar of the proteostasis network, and is emerging as a key compartment to sustain normal brain function. The unfolded protein response (UPR), the main mechanism that copes with ER stress, plays a central role in the quality control of many ion channels and receptors, in addition to crosstalk with signaling pathways that regulate connectivity, synapse formation, and neuronal plasticity.</content>
