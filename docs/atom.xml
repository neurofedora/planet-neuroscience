 &lt;p&gt;A model of the columnar functional organization of neocortical association
areas is studied. The neuronal network is composed of many Hebbian
autoassociators, or modules, each of which interacts with a relatively small
number of the others. Every module encodes and stores a number of elementary
percepts, or features. Memory items, or patterns, are peculiar combinations of
features sparsely distributed over the multi-modular network. Any feature
stored in any module can be involved in several of the stored patterns;
feature-sharing is in fact source of local ambiguities and, consequently, a
potential cause of erroneous memory retrieval activity spreading through the
model network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory retrieval dynamics of the large multi-modular autoassociator is
investigated by means of quantitative analysis and numerical simulations. An
oscillatory retrieval process is found to be very efficient in overcoming
feature-sharing drawbacks; it requires a mechanism that modulates the
robustness of local attractors to noise, and neuronal activity sparseness such
that quiescent and active modules are about equally noisy. Correlated
activation of interconnected modules and extramodular neuronal contacts more
effective than the intramodular ones seem to be general requirements in order
to efficiently achieve satisfactory quality of memory retrieval. It is also
shown that, even in ideal conditions, some spots of the network cannot be
reached by retrieval activity spread. The locations of these activity isles
depend on the pattern to retrieve and on the cue, while their extension only
depends on architecture of the graph and statistics of the stored patterns. The
existence of these isles determines an upper-bound to retrieval quality that
does not depend on the specific retrieval dynamics adopted, nor on whether
feature-sharing is permitted. The oscillatory retrieval process nearly
saturates this bound.

 &lt;p&gt;Mathematically characterizing the implicit regularization induced by
gradient-based optimization is a longstanding pursuit in the theory of deep
learning. A widespread hope is that a characterization based on minimization of
norms may apply, and a standard test-bed for studying this prospect is matrix
factorization (matrix completion via linear neural networks). It is an open
question whether norms can explain the implicit regularization in matrix
factorization. The current paper resolves this open question in the negative,
by proving that there exist natural matrix factorization problems on which the
implicit regularization drives all norms (and quasi-norms) towards infinity.
Our results suggest that, rather than perceiving the implicit regularization
via norms, a potentially more useful interpretation is minimization of rank. We
demonstrate empirically that this interpretation extends to a certain class of
non-linear neural networks, and hypothesize that it may be key to explaining
generalization in deep learning.

 &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to follow biological information representation and
organization principles, the field of neuromorphic engineering is usually
approached bottom-up, from the biophysical models to large-scale integration in
silico. While ideal as experimentation platforms for cognitive computing and
neuroscience, bottom-up neuromorphic processors have yet to demonstrate an
efficiency advantage compared to specialized neural network accelerators for
real-world problems. Top-down approaches aim at answering this difficulty by
(i) starting from the applicative problem and (ii) investigating how to make
the associated algorithms hardware-efficient and biologically-plausible. In
order to leverage the data sparsity of spike-based neuromorphic retinas for
adaptive edge computing and vision applications, we follow a top-down approach
and propose SPOON, a 28-nm event-driven CNN (eCNN). It embeds online learning
with only 16.8-% power and 11.8-% area overheads with the
biologically-plausible direct random target projection (DRTP) algorithm. With
an energy per classification of 313nJ at 0.6V and a 0.32-mm$^2$ area for
accuracies of 95.3% (on-chip training) and 97.5% (off-chip training) on MNIST,
we demonstrate that SPOON reaches the efficiency of conventional machine
learning accelerators while embedding on-chip learning and being compatible
with event-based sensors, a point that we further emphasize with N-MNIST
benchmarking.

 &lt;p&gt;Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), known to be one among the effectively compact
network architectures, have achieved great outcomes in the visual tasks.
Designing efficient binary architectures is not trivial due to the binary
nature of the network. In this paper, we propose a use of evolutionary search
to facilitate the construction and training scheme when binarizing MobileNet, a
compact network with separable depth-wise convolution. Inspired by one-shot
architecture search frameworks, we manipulate the idea of group convolution to
design efficient 1-Bit Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), assuming an
approximately optimal trade-off between computational cost and model accuracy.
Our objective is to come up with a tiny yet efficient binary neural
architecture by exploring the best candidates of the group convolution while
optimizing the model performance in terms of complexity and latency. The
approach is threefold. First, we train strong baseline binary networks with a
wide range of random group combinations at each convolutional layer. This
set-up gives the binary neural networks a capability of preserving essential
information through layers. Second, to find a good set of hyperparameters for
group convolutions we make use of the evolutionary search which leverages the
exploration of efficient 1-bit models. Lastly, these binary models are trained
from scratch in a usual manner to achieve the final binary model. Various
experiments on ImageNet are conducted to show that following our construction
guideline, the final model achieves 60.09% Top-1 accuracy and outperforms the
state-of-the-art CI-BCNN with the same computational cost.

 &lt;p&gt;Artificial Neural Networks (NN) are widely used for solving complex problems
from medical diagnostics to face recognition. Despite notable successes, the
main disadvantages of NN are also well known: the risk of overfitting, lack of
explainability (inability to extract algorithms from trained NN), and high
consumption of computing resources. Determining the appropriate specific NN
structure for each problem can help overcome these difficulties: Too poor NN
cannot be successfully trained, but too rich NN gives unexplainable results and
may have a high chance of overfitting. Reducing precision of NN parameters
simplifies the implementation of these NN, saves computing resources, and makes
the NN skills more transparent. This paper lists the basic NN simplification
problems and controlled pruning procedures to solve these problems. All the
described pruning procedures can be implemented in one framework. The developed
procedures, in particular, find the optimal structure of NN for each task,
measure the influence of each input signal and NN parameter, and provide a
detailed verbal description of the algorithms and skills of NN. The described
methods are illustrated by a simple example: the generation of explicit
algorithms for predicting the results of the US presidential election.

 &lt;p&gt;Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control is a framework first introduced in
control theory that provides an optimal solution to linear problems of
regulation in the presence of uncertainty. This framework combines Kalman-Bucy
filters for the estimation of hidden states with Linear Quadratic Regulators
for the control of their dynamics. Nowadays, LQG is also a common paradigm in
neuroscience, where it is used to characterise different approaches to
sensorimotor control based on state estimators, forward and inverse models.
According to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian
inference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active
inference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational
approximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others,
perception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy
minimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to
LQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor
control in biological systems based on a process of biased perception. In this
note we compare the mathematical treatments of these two frameworks for linear
systems, focusing on their respective assumptions and highlighting their
commonalities and technical differences.

 &lt;p&gt;Evolvability is an important feature that impacts the ability of evolutionary
processes to find interesting novel solutions and to deal with changing
conditions of the problem to solve. The estimation of evolvability is not
straightforward and is generally too expensive to be directly used as selective
pressure in the evolutionary process. Indirectly promoting evolvability as a
side effect of other easier and faster to compute selection pressures would
thus be advantageous. In an unbounded behavior space, it has already been shown
that evolvable individuals naturally appear and tend to be selected as they are
more likely to invade empty behavior niches. Evolvability is thus a natural
byproduct of the search in this context. However, practical agents and
environments often impose limits on the reach-able behavior space. How do these
boundaries impact evolvability? In this context, can evolvability still be
promoted without explicitly rewarding it? We show that Novelty Search
implicitly creates a pressure for high evolvability even in bounded behavior
spaces, and explore the reasons for such a behavior. More precisely we show
that, throughout the search, the dynamic evaluation of novelty rewards
individuals which are very mobile in the behavior space, which in turn promotes
evolvability.

 &lt;p&gt;Robots are still limited to controlled conditions, that the robot designer
knows with enough details to endow the robot with the appropriate models or
behaviors. Learning algorithms add some flexibility with the ability to
discover the appropriate behavior given either some demonstrations or a reward
to guide its exploration with a reinforcement learning algorithm. Reinforcement
learning algorithms rely on the definition of state and action spaces that
define reachable behaviors. Their adaptation capability critically depends on
the representations of these spaces: small and discrete spaces result in fast
learning while large and continuous spaces are challenging and either require a
long training period or prevent the robot from converging to an appropriate
behavior. Beside the operational cycle of policy execution and the learning
cycle, which works at a slower time scale to acquire new policies, we introduce
the redescription cycle, a third cycle working at an even slower time scale to
generate or adapt the required representations to the robot, its environment
and the task. We introduce the challenges raised by this cycle and we present
DREAM (Deferred Restructuring of Experience in Autonomous Machines), a
developmental cognitive architecture to bootstrap this redescription process
stage by stage, build new state representations with appropriate motivations,
and transfer the acquired knowledge across domains or tasks or even across
robots. We describe results obtained so far with this approach and end up with
a discussion of the questions it raises in Neuroscience.

 &lt;p&gt;Applying latent variable evolution to game level design has become more and
more popular as little human expert knowledge is required. However, defective
levels with illegal patterns may be generated due to the violation of
constraints for level design. A traditional way of repairing the defective
levels is programming specific rule-based repairers to patch the flaw. However,
programming these constraints is sometimes complex and not straightforward. An
autonomous level repairer which is capable of learning the constraints is
needed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CNet, to learn the
probability distribution of tiles giving its surrounding tiles on a set of real
levels, and then detect the illegal tiles in generated new levels. Then, an
evolutionary repairer is designed to search for optimal replacement schemes
equipped with a novel search space being constructed with the help of CNet and
a novel heuristic function. The proposed approaches are proved to be effective
in our case study of repairing GAN-generated and artificially destroyed levels
of Super Mario Bros. game. Our CNet-assisted evolutionary repairer can also be
easily applied to other games of which the levels can be represented by a
matrix of objects or tiles.

 &lt;p&gt;Cellular automata are discrete and computational models thatcan be shown as
general models of complexity. They are used in varied applications to derive
the generalized behavior of the presented model. In this paper we have took one
such application. We have made an effort to perform edge detection on an image
using genetic algorithm. The purpose and the intention here is to analyze the
capability and performance of the suggested genetic algorithm. Genetic
algorithms are used to depict or obtain a general solution of given problem.
Using this feature of GA we have tried to evolve the cellular automata and
shown that how with time it converges to the desired results.

 &lt;p&gt;Choosing the right selection rate is a long standing issue in evolutionary
computation. In the continuous unconstrained case, we prove mathematically that
$\mu=1$ leads to a sub-optimal simple regret in the case of the sphere
function. We provide a theoretically-based selection rate $\mu/\lambda$ that
leads to better convergence rates. With our choice of selection rate, we get a
provable regret of order $O(\lambda^{-1})$ which has to be compared with
$O(\lambda^{-2/d})$ in the case where $\mu=1$. We complete our study with
experiments to confirm our theoretical claims.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06559"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The emerging research paradigm coined as multitasking optimization aims to
solve multiple optimization tasks concurrently by means of a single search
process. For this purpose, the exploitation of complementarities among the
tasks to be solved is crucial, which is often achieved via the transfer of
genetic material, thereby forging the Transfer Optimization field. In this
context, Evolutionary Multitasking addresses this paradigm by resorting to
concepts from Evolutionary Computation. Within this specific branch, approaches
such as the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has lately gained a
notable momentum when tackling multiple optimization tasks. This work
contributes to this trend by proposing the first adaptation of the recently
introduced Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm II (MFEA-II) to
permutation-based discrete optimization environments. For modeling this
adaptation, some concepts cannot be directly applied to discrete search spaces,
such as parent-centric interactions. In this paper we entirely reformulate such
concepts, making them suited to deal with permutation-based search spaces
without loosing the inherent benefits of MFEA-II. The performance of the
proposed solver has been assessed over 5 different multitasking setups,
composed by 8 datasets of the well-known Traveling Salesman (TSP) and
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP). The obtained results and their
comparison to those by the discrete version of the MFEA confirm the good
performance of the developed dMFEA-II, and concur with the insights drawn in
previous studies for continuous optimization.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Source identification is an important topic in image forensics, since it
allows to trace back the origin of an image. This represents a precious
information to claim intellectual property but also to reveal the authors of
illicit materials. In this paper we address the problem of device
identification based on sensor noise and propose a fast and accurate solution
using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we propose a
2-channel-based CNN that learns a way of comparing camera fingerprint and image
noise at patch level. The proposed solution turns out to be much faster than
the conventional approach and to ensure an increased accuracy. This makes the
approach particularly suitable in scenarios where large databases of images are
analyzed, like over social networks. In this vein, since images uploaded on
social media usually undergo at least two compression stages, we include
investigations on double JPEG compressed images, always reporting higher
accuracy than standard approaches.

 &lt;p&gt;We provide several new depth-based separation results for feed-forward neural
networks, proving that various types of simple and natural functions can be
better approximated using deeper networks than shallower ones, even if the
shallower networks are much larger. This includes indicators of balls and
ellipses; non-linear functions which are radial with respect to the $L_1$ norm;
and smooth non-linear functions. We also show that these gaps can be observed
experimentally: Increasing the depth indeed allows better learning than
increasing width, when training neural networks to learn an indicator of a unit
ball.

 &lt;p&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation has long been hypothesized to be involved in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) progression. Previous research suggests that both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory microglia ameliorate amyloid pathology, but the latter worsen tau pathology. In this study, we sought to determine whether induction of arginase-1 positive microglia with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 modulates pathology in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Our findings indicate that a single intracranial IL-4 injection positively modulated performance of 3xTg AD mice in a Novel Object Recognition task, and locally increased the levels of arginase-1 positive myeloid cells when assessed one-week post injection. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased tau phosphorylation in IL-4 injected animals; however, we were not able to detect significant changes in tau phosphorylation utilizing Western blot. Lastly, IL-4 injection did not appear to cause significant changes in amyloid β load. In conclusion, acute intracranial IL-4 led to some positive benefits in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Although more work remains, these results support therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying microglial activation states in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction/Purpose: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and in the United States alone, CVD causes nearly 840,000 deaths annually. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a tool to assess brain activity, researchers have identified some brain-behavior connections and predicted several self-management behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the sample characteristics of individuals with CVD who participated in fMRI studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus. No date or language restrictions were applied and research methodology filters were used. In October 2017, 1659 titles and abstracts were identified. Inclusion criteria were: (1) utilized an empirical study design, (2) used fMRI to assess brain activity, and (3) focused on patients with CVD-related chronic illness. Articles were excluded if they: were theory or opinion articles, focused on mental or neuropathic illness, included non-human samples, or were not written in English. After duplicates were removed (230), 1,429 titles and abstracts were reviewed based on inclusion criteria; 1,243 abstracts were then excluded. A total of 186 studies were reviewed in their entirety; after additional review, 142 were further excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Forty-four articles met criteria and were included in the final review. An evidence table was created to capture the demographics of each study sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ninety eight percent of the studies did not report the racial or ethnic composition of their sample. Most studies (66%) contained more men than women. Mean age ranged from 38 to 78 years; 77% reported mean age ≥50 years. The most frequently studied CVD was stroke (86%), while hypertension was studied the least (2%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Understanding brain-behavior relationships can help researchers and practitioners tailor interventions to meet specific patient needs. These findings suggest that additional studies are needed that focus on populations historically underrepresented in fMRI research. Researchers should thoughtfully consider diversity and purposefully sample groups by including individuals that are: women, from diverse backgrounds, younger, and diagnosed with a variety of CVD-related illnesses. Identifying and addressing these gaps by studying more representative samples will help healthcare providers reduce disparities and tailor interventions for all CVD populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mammalian retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the central nervous system (CNS) often die after optic nerve injury and surviving RGCs fail to regenerate their axons, eventually resulting in irreversible vision loss. Manipulation of a diverse group of genes can significantly boost optic nerve regeneration of mature RGCs by reactivating developmental-like growth programs or suppressing growth inhibitory pathways. By injury of the vision pathway near their brain targets, a few studies have shown that regenerated RGC axons could form functional synapses with targeted neurons but exhibited poor neural conduction or partial functional recovery. Therefore, the functional restoration of eye-to-brain pathways remains a greatly challenging issue. Here, we review recent advances in long-distance optic nerve regeneration and the subsequent reconnecting to central targets. By summarizing our current strategies for promoting functional recovery, we hope to provide potential insights into future exploration in vision reformation after neural injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The role of the WDFY1 protein has been studied as a TLR3/4 scaffold/recruiting protein in the immune system and in different oncogenic conditions. However, its function in brain remains poorly understood. We have found that in mice devoid of Helios (He&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice), a transcription factor specifically expressed during the development of the immune cells and the central nervous system, there is a permanent and sustained increase of Wdfy1 gene expression in the striatum and hippocampus. Interestingly, we observed that WDFY1 protein levels were also increased in the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients, but not in the hippocampus of Alzheimer’s disease patients with an associated psychotic disorder. Accordingly, young He&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice displayed several schizophrenic-like behaviors related to dysfunctions in the striatum and hippocampus. These changes were associated with an increase in spine density in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and with a decrease in the number and size of PSD-95-positive clusters in the stratum radiatum of the CA1. Moreover, these alterations in structural synaptic plasticity were associated with a strong reduction of neuronal NF-κB in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 in He&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Altogether, our data indicate that alterations involving the molecular axis Helios-WDFY1 in neurons during the development of core brain regions could be relevant for the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common hereditary small vessel disease, with reported frequencies of 2-5/100,000 individuals. Recently, it has been reported that some patients with NOTCH3 gene mutations show atypical clinical symptoms of CADASIL. Assuming that CADASIL is underdiagnosed in some cases of lacunar infarction, this study was designed to examine the prevalence of NOTCH3 gene mutations in the patients at highest risk who were admitted for lacunar infarctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: From January 2011 to April 2018, 1,094 patients with lacunar infarctions were admitted to our hospital, of whom 31 patients without hypertension but with white matter disease (Fazekas scale 2 or 3) were selected and genetically analyzed for NOTCH3 gene mutations (Phase 1). Furthermore, 54 patients, who were 60 years or younger, were analyzed for NOTCH3 mutations (Phase 2). NOTCH3 exons 2–24, which encode the epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain of the NOTCH3 receptor, were analyzed for mutations by direct sequencing of genomic DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Three patients presented NOTCH3 p.R75P mutations: two in the Phase 1 and one in the Phase 2 cohort. Among patients aged 60 years or younger and those without hypertension but with moderate-to-severe white matter lesions, the carrier frequency of p.R75P was 3.5% (3/85), which was significantly higher than that in the Japanese general population (4.7KJPN) (odds ratio [95% CI] = 58.2 [11.6–292.5]). All three patients with NOTCH3 mutations had family histories of stroke, and the average patient age was 51.3 years. All three patients also showed white matter lesions in the external capsule but not in the temporal pole. The CADASIL and CADASIL scale-J scores of the three patients were 6, 17, 7 (mean, 10.0) and 13, 20, 10 (mean, 14.3), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Among patients hospitalized for lacunar infarctions, the p.R75P prevalence may be higher than previously estimated. The NOTCH3 p.R75P mutation may be underdiagnosed in patients with early-onset lacunar infarctions due to the atypical clinical and neuroimaging features of CADASIL. Early-onset, presence of family history of stroke, external capsule lesions, and absence of hypertension may help predict underlying NOTCH3 mutations despite no temporal white matter lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with various underlying pathological processes. Until now, no fluid biomarkers have been established for PD. Given recent biochemical and neuroimaging evidence for the presence of white matter damage in PD, which may even precede neuronal loss, we investigated whether neurofilament light (NFL) was increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients in comparison to controls. NFL is located mainly in large myelinated axons, and increased CSF levels of this protein reflect axonal injury. CSF levels of NFL in 58 early PD patients and 28 controls were quantified by ELISA (Uman Diagnostics). Measures of PD severity included disease duration, UPDRS-III, and Hoehn-Yahr stage. Statistically significant differences in CSF NFL levels were found between PD patients and controls [median with interquartile range 524.82 (393.28–678.34) vs. 271.84 (198.09–335.24) ng/l; p &amp;lt; 0.05)]. In PD patients, there were no correlations between CSF NFL level and the measures of disease severity. The CSF NFL turned out to have a high discriminatory value (AUC 0.850) for differentiating between PD subjects and healthy controls, with 84% sensitivity and 85.2% specificity. The study indirectly demonstrates that axonal damage is present in early PD in addition to neuronal loss. Interestingly, white matter damage was observed in non-demented PD patients. In the light of the results of recent MRI studies which confirm early white matter damage in PD, our data may turn out to be potentially useful in the diagnosis of early, or even preclinical, stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Partitioning duplicated chromosomes equally between daughter cells is a microtubule-mediated process essential to eukaryotic life. A multi-protein machine, the kinetochore, drives chromosome segregation by coupling the chromosomes to dynamic microtubule tips, even as the tips grow and shrink through the gain and loss of subunits. The kinetochore must harness, transmit, and sense mitotic forces, as a lack of tension signals incorrect chromosome-microtubule attachment and precipitates error correction mechanisms. But though the field has arrived at a 'parts list' of dozens of kinetochore proteins organized into subcomplexes, the path of force transmission through these components has remained unclear. Here we report reconstitution of functional &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;kinetochore assemblies from recombinantly expressed proteins. The reconstituted kinetochores are capable of self-assembling &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, coupling centromeric nucleosomes to dynamic microtubules, and withstanding mitotically relevant forces. They reveal two distinct pathways of force transmission and Ndc80c recruitment.</content>

 The transcriptional activation and repression during NK cell ontology are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal a novel role for T-bet in suppressing the immature gene signature during murine NK cell development. Based on transcriptome, we identified five distinct NK cell clusters and define their relative developmental maturity in the bone marrow. Transcriptome-based machine-learning classifiers revealed that half of the mTORC2-deficient NK cells belongs to the least mature NK cluster. Mechanistically, loss of mTORC2 results in an increased expression of signature genes representing immature NK cells. Since mTORC2 regulates the expression of T-bet through AktS473-FoxO1 axis, we further characterized the T-bet-deficient NK cells and found an augmented immature transcriptomic signature. Moreover, deletion of &lt;i&gt;Foxo1&lt;/i&gt; restores the expression of T-bet and corrects the abnormal expression of immature NK genes. Collectively, our study reveals a novel role for mTORC2-Akt&lt;sup&gt;S473&lt;/sup&gt;-FoxO1-T-bet axis in suppressing the transcriptional signature of immature NK cells.</content>

 GPS navigation is commonplace in everyday life. While it has the capacity to make our lives easier, it is often used to automate functions that were once exclusively performed by our brain. Staying mentally active is key to healthy brain aging. Therefore, is GPS navigation causing more harm than good? Here we demonstrate that traditional turn-by-turn navigation promotes passive spatial navigation and ultimately, poor spatial learning of the surrounding environment. We propose an alternative form of GPS navigation based on sensory augmentation, that has the potential to fundamentally alter the way we navigate with GPS. By implementing a 3D spatial audio system similar to an auditory compass, users are directed towards their destination without explicit directions. Rather than being led passively through verbal directions, users are encouraged to take an active role in their own spatial navigation, leading to more accurate cognitive maps of space. Technology will always play a significant role in everyday life; however, it is important that we actively engage with the world around us. By simply rethinking the way we interact with GPS navigation, we can engage users in their own spatial navigation, leading to a better spatial understanding of the explored environment.</content>

 Emerging evidence indicates that a strong relationship exists between brain regenerative therapies and nutrition. Early life nutrition plays an important role during embryonic brain development, and there are clear consequences to an imbalance in nutritional factors on both the production and survival of mature neuronal populations and the infant's risk of diseases in later life.  Our research and that of others suggest that vitamins play a fundamental role in the formation of neurons and their survival.  There is a growing body of evidence that nicotinamide, the water-soluble amide form of vitamin B3, is implicated in the conversion of pluripotent stem cells to clinically relevant cells for regenerative therapies. This study investigated the ability of nicotinamide to promote the development of mature catecholaminergic neuronal populations (associated with Parkinson's disease) from mouse embryonic stem cells, as well as investigating the underlying mechanisms of nicotinamide's action. Nicotinamide selectively enhanced the production of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons and serotonergic neurons from mouse embryonic stem cell cultures (Sox1GFP knock-in 46C cell line). A 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay ascertained that nicotinamide, when added in the initial phase, reduced cell proliferation. Nicotinamide drove tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neuron differentiation as effectively as an established cocktail of signalling factors, reducing the proliferation of neural progenitors and accelerating neuronal maturation, neurite outgrowth and neurotransmitter expression. These novel findings show that nicotinamide enhanced and enriched catecholaminergic differentiation and inhibited cell proliferation by directing cell cycle arrest in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures, thus driving a critical neural proliferation-to-differentiation switch from neural progenitors to neurons. Further research into the role of vitamin metabolites in embryogenesis will significantly advance cell-based regenerative medicine, and help realize their role as crucial developmental signalling molecules in brain development.</content>

Cell culture remains as the golden standard for primary isolation of viruses in clinical specimens. In the current practice, researchers have to recognize the cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by virus infection and subsequently use virus-specific monoclonal antibody to confirm the presence of virus. Considering the broad applications of neural network in various fields, we aimed to utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN) to shorten the timing required for CPE identification and to improve the assay sensitivity. Based on the characteristics of influenza-induced CPE, a CNN model with larger sizes of filters and max-pooling kernels was constructed in the absence of transfer learning. A total of 601 images from mock-infected and influenza-infected MDCK cells were used to train the model. The performance of the model was tested by using extra 400 images and the percentage of correct recognition was 99.75%. To further examine the limit of our model in evaluating the changes of CPE overtime, additional 1190 images from a new experiment were used and the recognition rates at 16 hour (hr), 28 hr, and 40 hr post virus infection were 71.80%, 98.25%, and 87.46%, respectively. The specificity of our model, examined by images of MDCK cells infected by six other non-influenza viruses, was 100%. Hence, a simple CNN model was established to enhance the identification of influenza virus in clinical practice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cBEhyD75-t8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In this work, we aim to determine the main factors driving self-initiated behavioral changes during the seasonal flu. To this end, we designed and deployed a questionnaire via Influweb, a Web platform for participatory surveillance in Italy, during the 2017 − 18 and 2018 − 19 seasons. We collected 599 surveys completed by 434 users. The data provide socio-demographic information, level of concerns about the flu, past experience with illnesses, and the type of behavioral changes voluntarily implemented by each participant. We describe each response with a set of features and divide them in three target categories. These describe those that report i) no (26%), ii) only moderately (36%), iii) significant (38%) changes in behaviors. In these settings, we adopt machine learning algorithms to investigate the extent to which target variables can be predicted by looking only at the set of features. Notably, 66% of the samples in the category describing more significant changes in behaviors are correctly classified through Gradient Boosted Trees. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of each feature in the classification task and uncover complex relationships between individuals’ characteristics and their attitude towards behavioral change. We find that intensity, recency of past illnesses, perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of an infection are the most significant features in the classification task and are associated to significant changes in behaviors. Overall, the research contributes to the small set of empirical studies devoted to the data-driven characterization of behavioral changes induced by infectious diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DtRFIElbWMo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Experimental chemical shifts (CS) from solution and solid state magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra provide atomic level information for each amino acid within a protein or protein complex. However, structure determination of large complexes and assemblies based on NMR data alone remains challenging due to the complexity of the calculations. Here, we present a hardware accelerated strategy for the estimation of NMR chemical-shifts of large macromolecular complexes based on the previously published PPM_One software. The original code was not viable for computing large complexes, with our largest dataset taking approximately 14 hours to complete. Our results show that serial code refactoring and parallel acceleration brought down the time taken of the software running on an NVIDIA Volta 100 (V100) Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) to 46.71 seconds for our largest dataset of 11.3 million atoms. We use OpenACC, a directive-based programming model for porting the application to a heterogeneous system consisting of x86 processors and NVIDIA GPUs. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in systems of increasing complexity ranging from 100K to 11.3M atoms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MIaNd42F8p8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Modeling the processes of neuronal progenitor proliferation and differentiation to produce mature cortical neuron subtypes is essential for the study of human brain development and the search for potential cell therapies. We demonstrated a novel paradigm for the generation of vascularized organoids (vOrganoids) consisting of typical human cortical cell types and a vascular structure for over 200 days as a vascularized and functional brain organoid model. The observation of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs), and bidirectional electrical transmission indicated the presence of chemical and electrical synapses in vOrganoids. More importantly, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis illustrated that vOrganoids exhibited robust neurogenesis and that cells of vOrganoids differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to blood vessel morphogenesis. The transplantation of vOrganoids into the mouse S1 cortex resulted in the construction of functional human-mouse blood vessels in the grafts that promoted cell survival in the grafts. This vOrganoid culture method could not only serve as a model to study human cortical development and explore brain disease pathology but also provide potential prospects for new cell therapies for nervous system disorders and injury.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/p34CTtfe5as&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Variations on a theme: morphological variation in the secondary eye visual pathway across the order of Araneae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/58c685be-6a94-4f04-8ea5-b7c83a31adf3/cne24945-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagrams showing the four different groups of secondary eye morphology found by the study. For each group, neuropils of the secondary eye visual pathway and the connections between the secondary eye visual pathway and the protocerebrum are given.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiders possess a wide array of sensory‐driven behaviors and therefore provide rich models for studying evolutionary hypotheses about the relationship between brain morphology, sensory systems and behavior. Despite this, only a handful of studies have examined brain variation across the order of Araneae. In this study, I present descriptions of the gross brain morphology for 19 families of spiders that vary in eye morphology. Spiders showed the most variation in the secondary eye visual pathway. Based on this variation, spiders could be categorized into four groups. Group One spiders had small, underdeveloped laminae, no medullae and no mushroom bodies. Group Two spiders had large laminae, no medullae and large mushroom bodies. Group Three spiders had laminae and some evidence of reduced medullae and mushroom bodies. Group Four spiders had the most complex systems, with large laminae, medullae formed from optical glomeruli, and robust mushroom bodies. Within groups, there was large variation in the shape and size of individual regions, indicating possible variation in neuronal organization. The possible evolutionary implications of the loss of a dedicated olfactory organ in spiders and its effects on the mushroom body are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning allows solving complex tasks, however, the learning
tends to be task-specific and the sample efficiency remains a challenge. We
present Plan2Explore, a self-supervised reinforcement learning agent that
tackles both these challenges through a new approach to self-supervised
exploration and fast adaptation to new tasks, which need not be known during
exploration. During exploration, unlike prior methods which retrospectively
compute the novelty of observations after the agent has already reached them,
our agent acts efficiently by leveraging planning to seek out expected future
novelty. After exploration, the agent quickly adapts to multiple downstream
tasks in a zero or a few-shot manner. We evaluate on challenging control tasks
from high-dimensional image inputs. Without any training supervision or
task-specific interaction, Plan2Explore outperforms prior self-supervised
exploration methods, and in fact, almost matches the performances oracle which
has access to rewards. Videos and code at

 &lt;p&gt;Neurons in the brain communicate with each other through discrete action
spikes as opposed to continuous signal transmission in artificial neural
networks. Therefore, the traditional techniques for optimization of parameters
in neural networks which rely on the assumption of differentiability of
activation functions are no longer applicable to modeling the learning
processes in the brain. In this project, we propose biologically-plausible
alternatives to backpropagation to facilitate the training of spiking neural
networks. We primarily focus on investigating the candidacy of reinforcement
learning (RL) rules in solving the spatial and temporal credit assignment
problems to enable decision-making in complex tasks. In one approach, we
consider each neuron in a multi-layer neural network as an independent RL agent
forming a different representation of the feature space while the network as a
whole forms the representation of the complex policy to solve the task at hand.
In other approach, we apply the reparameterization trick to enable
differentiation through stochastic transformations in spiking neural networks.
We compare and contrast the two approaches by applying them to traditional RL
domains such as gridworld, cartpole and mountain car. Further we also suggest
variations and enhancements to enable future research in this area.

 &lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) possess many positive qualities when it
comes to spatial raster data. Translation invariance enables CNNs to detect
features regardless of their position in the scene. But in some domains, like
geospatial, not all locations are exactly equal. In this work we propose
localized convolutional neural networks that enable convolutional architectures
to learn local features in addition to the global ones. We investigate their
instantiations in the form of learnable inputs, local weights, and a more
general form. They can be added to any convolutional layers, easily end-to-end
trained, introduce minimal additional complexity, and let CNNs retain most of
their benefits to the extent that they are needed. In this work we address
spatio-temporal prediction: test the effectiveness of our methods on a
synthetic benchmark dataset and tackle three real-world wind prediction
datasets. For one of them we propose a method to spatially order the unordered
data. We compare against the recent state-of-the-art spatio-temporal prediction
models on the same data. Models that use convolutional layers can be and are
extended with our localizations. In all these cases our extensions improve the
results, and thus often the state-of-the-art. We share all the code at a public
repository.

 &lt;p&gt;Neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a promising avenue for
automatically designing task-specific neural networks. Most existing NAS
approaches require one complete search for each deployment specification of
hardware or objective. This is a computationally impractical endeavor given the
potentially large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we propose
Neural Architecture Transfer (NAT) to overcome this limitation. NAT is designed
to efficiently generate task-specific custom models that are competitive even
under multiple conflicting objectives. To realize this goal we learn
task-specific supernets from which specialized subnets can be sampled without
any additional training. The key to our approach is an integrated online
transfer learning and many-objective evolutionary search procedure. A
pre-trained supernet is iteratively adapted while simultaneously searching for
task-specific subnets. We demonstrate the efficacy of NAT on 11 benchmark image
classification tasks ranging from large-scale multi-class to small-scale
fine-grained datasets. In all cases, including ImageNet, NATNets improve upon
the state-of-the-art under mobile settings ($\leq$ 600M Multiply-Adds).
Surprisingly, small-scale fine-grained datasets benefit the most from NAT. At
the same time, the architecture search and transfer is orders of magnitude more
efficient than existing NAS methods. Overall, experimental evaluation indicates
that across diverse image classification tasks and computational objectives,
NAT is an appreciably more effective alternative to fine-tuning based transfer
learning. Code is available at

 &lt;p&gt;Recent events, such as the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, Brexit and the
COVID-19 &quot;infodemic&quot;, have brought into the spotlight the dangers of online
disinformation. There has been a lot of research focusing on fact-checking and
disinformation detection. However, little attention has been paid to the
specific rhetorical and psychological techniques used to convey propaganda
messages. Revealing the use of such techniques can help promote media literacy
and critical thinking, and eventually contribute to limiting the impact of
&quot;fake news&quot; and disinformation campaigns. Prta (Propaganda Persuasion
Techniques Analyzer) allows users to explore the articles crawled on a regular
basis by highlighting the spans in which propaganda techniques occur and to
compare them on the basis of their use of propaganda techniques. The system
further reports statistics about the use of such techniques, overall and over
time, or according to filtering criteria specified by the user based on time
interval, keywords, and/or political orientation of the media. Moreover, it
allows users to analyze any text or URL through a dedicated interface or via an
API. The system is available online: https://www.tanbih.org/prta

 &lt;p&gt;Functional development of affective and reward circuits, cognition and
response inhibition later in life exhibits vulnerability periods during
gestation and early childhood. Extensive evidence supports the model that
exposure to stressors in the gestational period and early postnatal life
increases an individual's susceptibility to future impairments of functional
development. Recent versions of this model integrate epigenetic mechanisms of
the developmental response. Their understanding will guide the future treatment
of the associated neuropsychiatric disorders. A combination of non-invasively
obtainable physiological signals and epigenetic biomarkers related to the
principal systems of the stress response, the Hypothalamic-Pituitary axis (HPA)
and the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), are emerging as the key predictors of
neurodevelopmental outcomes. Such electrophysiological and epigenetic
biomarkers can prove to timely identify children benefiting most from early
intervention programs. Such programs should ameliorate future disorders in
otherwise apparently healthy children. The recently developed Early
Family-Centered Intervention Programs aim to influence the care and stimuli
provided daily by the family and improving parent/child attachment, a key
element for healthy socio-emotional adult life. Although frequently
underestimated, such biomarker-guided early intervention strategy represents a
crucial first step in the prevention of future neuropsychiatric problems and in
reducing their personal and societal impact.

 &lt;p&gt;Characterizing the subtle changes of functional brain networks associated
with the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for
early diagnosis and prediction of disease progression prior to clinical
symptoms. We developed a new deep learning method, termed multiple graph
Gaussian embedding model (MG2G), which can learn highly informative network
features by mapping high-dimensional resting-state brain networks into a
low-dimensional latent space. These latent distribution-based embeddings enable
a quantitative characterization of subtle and heterogeneous brain connectivity
patterns at different regions and can be used as input to traditional
classifiers for various downstream graph analytic tasks, such as AD early stage
prediction, and statistical evaluation of between-group significant alterations
across brain regions. We used MG2G to detect the intrinsic latent
dimensionality of MEG brain networks, predict the progression of patients with
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, and identify brain regions with network
alterations related to MCI.

 &lt;p&gt;Our brain receives a dynamically changing stream of sensorimotor data. Yet,
we perceive a rather organized world, which we segment into and perceive as
events. Computational theories of cognitive science on event-predictive
cognition suggest that our brain forms generative, event-predictive models by
segmenting sensorimotor data into suitable chunks of contextual experiences.
Here, we introduce a hierarchical, surprise-gated recurrent neural network
architecture, which models this process and develops compact compressions of
distinct event-like contexts. The architecture contains a contextual LSTM
layer, which develops generative compressions of ongoing and subsequent
contexts. These compressions are passed into a GRU-like layer, which uses
surprise signals to update its recurrent latent state. The latent state is
passed forward into another LSTM layer, which processes actual dynamic sensory
flow in the light of the provided latent, contextual compression signals. Our
model shows to develop distinct event compressions and achieves the best
performance on multiple event processing tasks. The architecture may be very
useful for the further development of resource-efficient learning, hierarchical
model-based reinforcement learning, as well as the development of artificial
event-predictive cognition and intelligence.

 &lt;p&gt;We conduct an exhaustive survey of adaptive selection of operators (AOS) in
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). We simplified the AOS structure by adding more
components to the framework to built upon the existing categorisation of AOS
methods. In addition to simplifying, we looked at the commonality among AOS
methods from literature to generalise them. Each component is presented with a
number of alternative choices, each represented with a formula. We make three
sets of comparisons. First, the methods from literature are tested on the BBOB
test bed with their default hyper parameters. Second, the hyper parameters of
these methods are tuned using an offline configurator known as IRACE. Third,
for a given set of problems, we use IRACE to select the best combination of
components and tune their hyper parameters.

 &lt;p&gt;The brain is characterized by a strong heterogeneity of inhibitory neurons.
We report that spiking neural networks display a resonance to the heterogeneity
of inhibitory neurons, with optimal input/output responsiveness occurring for
levels of heterogeneity similar to that found experimentally in cerebral
cortex. A heterogeneous mean-field model predicts such optimal responsiveness.
Moreover, we show that new dynamical regimes emerge from heterogeneity that
were not present in the equivalent homogeneous system, such as sparsely
synchronous collective oscillations.

 &lt;p&gt;The characterization of neural responses to sensory stimuli is a central
problem in neuroscience. Spike-triggered average (STA), an influential
technique, has been used to extract optimal linear kernels in a variety of
animal subjects. However, when the model assumptions are not met, it can lead
to misleading and imprecise results. We introduce a technique, called
spike-triggered descent (STD), which can be used alone or in conjunction with
STA to increase precision and yield success in scenarios where STA fails. STD
works by simulating a model neuron that learns to reproduce the observed spike
train. Learning is achieved via parameter optimization that relies on a metric
induced on the space of spike trains modeled as a novel inner product space.
This technique can precisely learn higher order kernels using limited data.
Kernels extracted from a Locusta migratoria tympanal nerve dataset demonstrate
the strength of this approach.

 &lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable clinical tool for grading injury
caused by lack of blood and oxygen to the brain during birth. This study
presents a novel end-to-end architecture, using a deep convolutional neural
network, that learns hierarchical representations within raw EEG data. The
system classifies 4 grades of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and is evaluated
on a multi-channel EEG dataset of 63 hours from 54 newborns. The proposed
method achieves a testing accuracy of 79.6% with one-step voting and 81.5% with
two-step voting. These results show how a feature-free approach can be used to
classify different grades of injury in newborn EEG with comparable accuracy to
existing feature-based systems. Automated grading of newborn background EEG
could help with the early identification of those infants in need of
interventional therapies such as hypothermia.

 &lt;p&gt;Sleep disorder is one of many neurological diseases that can affect greatly
the quality of daily life. It is very burdensome to manually classify the sleep
stages to detect sleep disorders. Therefore, the automatic sleep stage
classification techniques are needed. However, the previous automatic sleep
scoring methods using raw signals are still low classification performance. In
this study, we proposed an end-to-end automatic sleep staging framework based
on optimal spectral-temporal sleep features using a sleep-edf dataset. The
input data were modified using a bandpass filter and then applied to a
convolutional neural network model. For five sleep stage classification, the
classification performance 85.6% and 91.1% using the raw input data and the
proposed input, respectively. This result also shows the highest performance
compared to conventional studies using the same dataset. The proposed framework
has shown high performance by using optimal features associated with each sleep
stage, which may help to find new features in the automatic sleep stage method.

 &lt;p&gt;This paper reviews the main perspectives of language acquisition and language
comprehension. In language acquisition, we have reviewed the different types of
language acquisitions like first language acquisition, second language
acquisition, sign language acquisition and skill acquisition. The experimental
techniques for neurolinguistic acquisition detection is also discussed. The
findings of experiments for acquisition detection is also discussed, it
includes the region of brain activated after acquisition. Findings shows that
the different types of acquisition involve different regions of the brain. In
language comprehension, native language comprehension and bilingual's
comprehension has been considered. Comprehension involve different brain
regions for different sentence or word comprehension depending upon their
semantic and syntax. The different fMRIEEG analysis techniques (statistical or
graph theoretical) are also discoursed in our review. Tools for
neurolinguistics computations are also discussed.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Machine learning applications that are implemented with spike-based
computation model, e.g., Spiking Neural Network (SNN), have a great potential
to lower the energy consumption when they are executed on a neuromorphic
hardware. However, compiling and mapping an SNN to the hardware is challenging,
especially when compute and storage resources of the hardware (viz. crossbar)
need to be shared among the neurons and synapses of the SNN. We propose an
approach to analyze and compile SNNs on a resource-constrained neuromorphic
hardware, providing guarantee on key performance metrics such as execution time
and throughput. Our approach makes the following three key contributions.
First, we propose a greedy technique to partition an SNN into clusters of
neurons and synapses such that each cluster can fit on to the resources of a
crossbar. Second, we exploit the rich semantics and expressiveness of
Synchronous Dataflow Graphs (SDFGs) to represent a clustered SNN and analyze
its performance using Max-Plus Algebra, considering the available compute and
storage capacities, buffer sizes, and communication bandwidth. Third, we
propose a self-timed execution-based fast technique to compile and admit
SNN-based applications to a neuromorphic hardware at run-time, adapting
dynamically to the available resources on the hardware. We evaluate our
approach with standard SNN-based applications and demonstrate a significant
performance improvement compared to current practices.

			<subtitle type="html">Nature Reviews Neuroscience is the leading review journal in the neurosciences. It publishes articles that review recent progress in brain and nervous system research. Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry. One of the unique features of Nature Reviews Neuroscience is its extraordinary breadth and depth of coverage. This very broad scope – from molecules to mind – captures the essence of modern neuroscience, and allows the journal to attract readers from all areas of this ever-expanding discipline.</subtitle>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00024"/>

 &lt;p&gt;The balance between neural excitation and inhibition has been shown to be crucial for normal brain function. However, it is unclear whether this balance is maintained through healthy aging. This study investigated the effect of aging on the temporal dynamics of the somatosensory evoked local field potential (LFP) in rats and tested the hypothesis that excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities remain balanced during the aging process. The LFP signal was obtained from the barrel cortex of three different age groups of anesthetized rats (pre-adolescence: 4–6 weeks, young adult: 2–3 months, middle-aged adult: 10–20 months) under whisker pad stimulation. To confirm our previous finding that the initial segment of the evoked LFP was solely associated with excitatory post-synaptic activity, we micro-injected gabazine into the barrel cortex to block inhibition while LFP was collected continuously under the same stimulus condition. As expected, the initial slope of the evoked LFP in the granular layer was unaffected by gabazine injection. We subsequently estimated the excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities through a balanced model of the LFP with delayed inhibition as an explicit constraint, and calculated the amplitude ratio of inhibition to excitation. We found an age-dependent slowing of the temporal dynamics in the somatosensory-evoked post-synaptic activity, as well as a significant age-related decrease in the amplitude of the excitatory component and a decreasing trend in the amplitude of the inhibitory component. Furthermore, the delay of inhibition with respect to excitation was significantly increased with age, but the amplitude ratio was maintained. Our findings suggest that aging reduces the amplitude of neural responses, but the balance between sensory evoked excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities is maintained to support normal brain function during healthy aging. Further whole cell patch clamp experiments will be needed to confirm or refute these findings by measuring sensory evoked synaptic excitatory and inhibitory activities in vivo during the normal aging process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00259"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00259</id>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Early detection is critical for effective management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common practice. Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject’s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In computational neuroscience, spiking neurons are often analyzed as computing devices that register bits of information, with each action potential carrying at most one bit of Shannon entropy. Here, I question this interpretation by using Landauer's principle to estimate an upper limit for the quantity of thermodynamic information that can be processed within a single action potential in a typical mammalian neuron. A straightforward calculation shows that an action potential in a typical mammalian cortical pyramidal cell can process up to approximately 3.4 · 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; bits of thermodynamic information, or about 4.9 · 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; bits of Shannon entropy. This result suggests that an action potential can, in principle, carry much more than a single bit of Shannon entropy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disease. Intervention in the early stage of AD is a new path for AD treatment that is being explored. The behavioral and pathological effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (AtDCS) at the early stage of AD in the mouse model, amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice, were investigated based on our previous studies. Thirty-three 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into the model group (AD group), model + sham stimulation group (ADST group) and stimulation group (ADT group). Eleven 6-month-old male C57 wild-type mice were randomly selected as a control group (CTL group). The ADT group received 10 AtDCS sessions. The Morris water maze (MWM) task and novel object recognition (NOR) task were used to test mouse memory. Nissl staining, Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of β-amyloid (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NF200 were conducted for pathological analysis. The ADT group and the CTL group had a shorter escape latency and more platform-region crossings than the AD group and ADST group in the MWM. There was no significant difference in the discrimination index among the groups in the NOR task. Pathological analysis showed visible differences between the AD group and ADT group. This study revealed that early-stage APP/PS1 transgenic mice did not show recognition memory impairment. AtDCS effectively improved spatial learning and memory in the early-stage APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD, alleviating Aβ burden and having a protective effect on neurons. AtDCS could improve AD-related symptoms by activating many glial cells to promote the degradation and clearance of Aβ or directly affecting production and degradation of Aβ to reduce glial activation. AtDCS is an effective means of early intervention in the early stage of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1s) are key elements in neuronal signaling. While their function is well documented in slices, requirements for their activation in vivo are poorly understood. We examine this question in adult mice in vivo using 2-photon imaging of cerebellar molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) expressing GCaMP. In anesthetized mice, parallel fiber activation evokes beam-like Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; rises in postsynaptic MLIs which depend on co-activation of mGluR1s and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). In awake mice, blocking mGluR1 decreases Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; rises associated with locomotion. In vitro studies and freeze-fracture electron microscopy show that the iGluR-mGluR1 interaction is synergistic and favored by close association of the two classes of receptors. Altogether our results suggest that mGluR1s, acting in synergy with iGluRs, potently contribute to processing cerebellar neuronal signaling under physiological conditions.</content>

 Antimicrobial-resistant &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb) causes over 200,000 deaths each year. Current assays of antimicrobial resistance need knowledge of mutations that confer drug resistance, or long periods of culture time to test growth under drug pressure. We present ODELAM (One-cell Doubling Evaluation of Living Arrays of Mycobacterium), a time-lapse microscopy-based method that observes individual cells growing into microcolonies. ODELAM enables rapid quantitative measures of growth kinetics in as little as 30 hours under a wide variety of environmental conditions. We demonstrate ODELAM's utility by identifying ofloxacin resistance in cultured clinical isolates of Mtb and benchmark its performance with standard minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. In Mtb isolate, ODELAM identified ofloxacin heteroresistance and identifies the presence of drug resistant colony forming units (CFUs) at 1 per 1000 CFUs in as little as 48 hours. ODELAM is a powerful new tool that can rapidly evaluate Mtb drug resistance in a laboratory setting.</content>

 Despite numerous studies, there is little agreement about what brain changes accompany motor sequence learning, partly because of a general publication bias that favors novel results. We therefore decided to systematically reinvestigate proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates of motor learning in a preregistered longitudinal study with four scanning sessions over 5 weeks of training. Activation decreased more for trained than untrained sequences in premotor and parietal areas, without any evidence of learning-related activation increases. Premotor and parietal regions also exhibited changes in the fine-grained, sequence-specific activation patterns early in learning, which stabilized later. No changes were observed in the primary motor cortex (M1). Overall, our study provides evidence that human motor sequence learning occurs outside of M1. Furthermore, it shows that we cannot expect to find activity increases as an indicator for learning, making subtle changes in activity patterns across weeks the most promising fMRI correlate of training-induced plasticity.</content>

 Calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)-evoked release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles requires mechanisms both to prevent un-initiated fusion of vesicles (clamping) and to trigger fusion following Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-influx. The principal components involved in these processes are the vesicular fusion machinery (SNARE proteins) and the regulatory proteins, Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin. Here, we use a reconstituted single-vesicle fusion assay under physiologically-relevant conditions to delineate a novel mechanism by which Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin act synergistically to establish Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-regulated fusion. We find that under each vesicle, Synaptotagmin-1 oligomers bind and clamp a limited number of ‘central’ SNARE complexes via the primary interface and introduce a kinetic delay in vesicle fusion mediated by the excess of free SNAREpins. This in turn enables Complexin to arrest the remaining free ‘peripheral’ SNAREpins to produce a stably clamped vesicle. Activation of the central SNAREpins associated with Synaptotagmin-1 by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is sufficient to trigger rapid (&amp;lt;100 msec) and synchronous fusion of the docked vesicles.</content>

 Bone destruction relies on interactions between bone and immune cells. Bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCLs) were recently identified as innate immune cells activating T cells toward tolerance or inflammation. Thus, pathological bone destruction not only relies on increased osteoclast differentiation, but also on the presence of inflammatory OCLs (i-OCLs), part of which express &lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we investigated the contribution of mouse Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs to bone loss. We showed that Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs differ considerably in transcriptional and functional aspects. Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs have a high ability to resorb bone and activate inflammatory CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Although Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs are associated with inflammation, they resorb less and have in vitro an immune-suppressive effect on Cx3cr1&lt;sup&gt;neg&lt;/sup&gt; i-OCLs, mediated by PD-L1. Our results provide new insights into i-OCL heterogeneity. They also reveal that different i-OCL subsets may interact to regulate inflammation. This contributes to a better understanding and prevention of inflammatory bone destruction.</content>

 Synaptic transmission is initiated via spontaneous or action-potential evoked fusion of synaptic vesicles. At excitatory synapses, glutamatergic receptors activated by spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission are segregated. Although inhibitory synapses also transmit signals spontaneously or in response to action potentials, they differ from excitatory synapses in both structure and function. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibitory synapses may have different organizing principles. We report picrotoxin, a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist, blocks neurotransmission in a use-dependent manner at rat hippocampal synapses and therefore can be used to interrogate synaptic properties. Using this tool, we uncovered partial segregation of inhibitory spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission. We found up to 40% of the evoked response is mediated through GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs which are only activated by evoked neurotransmission. These data indicate GABAergic spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission processes are partially non-overlapping, suggesting they may serve divergent roles in neuronal signaling.</content>

 Copy number alterations (CNAs) play an important role in molding the genomes of breast cancers and have been shown to be clinically useful for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. However, our knowledge of intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity of this important class of somatic alterations is limited. Here, using single-cell sequencing, we comprehensively map out the facets of copy number alteration heterogeneity in a cohort of breast cancer tumors. Ou/var/www/html/elife/12-05-2020/backup/r analyses reveal: genetic heterogeneity of non-tumor cells (i.e. stroma) within the tumor mass; the extent to which copy number heterogeneity impacts breast cancer genomes and the importance of both the genomic location and dosage of sub-clonal events; the pervasive nature of genetic heterogeneity of chromosomal amplifications; and the association of copy number heterogeneity with clinical and biological parameters such as polyploidy and estrogen receptor negative status. Our data highlight the power of single-cell genomics in dissecting, in its many forms, intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity of CNAs, the magnitude with which CNA heterogeneity affects the genomes of breast cancers, and the potential importance of CNA heterogeneity in phenomena such as therapeutic resistance and disease relapse.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Introduction: P300 auditory evoked potential is evoked by a long latency auditory stimulus, which provides information on neural mechanisms underlying central auditory processing, considered an objective and non-invasive technique to study the auditory central nervous system. Objective: To identify and gather scientific evidence regarding the P3 component in adult cochlear implant users.  Methods: Scoping review of scientific literature, in the search of original articles in Portuguese, Spanish and English, published between 1991 and May 2018, in the following database websites: PubMed / Medline, Embase, LILACS and Web of Science. Results: A total of 87 articles were identified and exported to the search software Rayyan for study selection - 58 were from Embase, 26 from PubMed and 3 from Web of Science. There were no articles found on LILACS. From those 87 articles, 16 were excluded for being duplicated. Then 71 articles were selected for title, authors, yeas and abstract scanning, from which 50 articles were excluded. From the 21 final articles for full reading, one was excluded for not performing P300, leaving us with 20 selected articles.   Conclusion: This review has contributed with evidence that indicates how important it is to include speech stimulation when measuring P300. Regardless of the stimulus being used for P300 elicitation, a pattern of results can be seen a higher latency and a lower amplitude in CI users.</content>

 The Golgi cells are the main inhibitory interneurons of the cerebellar granular layer. Although recent works have highlighted the complexity of their dendritic organization and synaptic inputs, the mechanisms through which these neurons integrate complex input patterns remained unknown. Here we have used 8 detailed morphological reconstructions to develop multicompartmental models of Golgi cells, in which Na, Ca, and K channels were distributed along dendrites, soma, axonal initial segment and axon. The models faithfully reproduced a rich pattern of electrophysiological and pharmacological properties and predicted the operating mechanisms of these neurons. Basal dendrites turned out to be more tightly electrically coupled to the axon initial segment than apical dendrites. During synaptic transmission, parallel fibers caused slow Ca-dependent depolarizations in apical dendrites that boosted the axon initial segment encoder and Na-spike backpropagation into basal dendrites, while inhibitory synapses effectively shunted backpropagating currents. This oriented dendritic processing set up a coincidence detector controlling voltage-dependent NMDA receptor unblock in basal dendrites, which, by regulating local calcium influx, may provide the basis for spike-timing dependent plasticity anticipated by theory.</content>

 Identifying the spinal circuits controlling locomotion is critical for unravelling the mechanisms controlling the production of gaits. Development of the circuits governing left-right coordination relies on axon guidance molecules such as ephrins and netrins. To date, no other class of proteins have been shown to play a role during this process. Here we have analyzed  hop  mice, which walk with a characteristic hopping gait using their hind legs in synchrony. Fictive locomotion experiments suggest that a local defect in the ventral spinal cord contributes to the aberrant locomotor phenotype.  Hop mutant spinal cords had severe morphological defects, including the absence of the ventral midline and a poorly defined border between white and grey matter. The  hop  mice represent the first model where the left and right central pattern generators (CPGs) are fused to form one central CPG, with a synchronous gait as a functional consequence. These defects were exclusively found in the lumbar domain and were associated with abnormal developmental processes, including a misplaced notochord and reduced induction of ventral progenitor domains. While the underlying mutation in  hop  mice has been suggested to lie within  Ttc26 , other genes in close vicinity have been associated with gait defects. By replicating the point mutation within  Ttc26 , employing CRISPR technology, we observed mice with an identical phenotype, thereby verifying the hop mutation. Thus, we show that the assembly of the lumbar CPG network is dependent on a fully functional TTC26 protein.</content>

 The mechanically activated Piezo channel plays a versatile role in conferring mechanosensitivity to various cell types. However, how it incorporates its intrinsic mechanosensitivity and cellular components to effectively sense long-range mechanical perturbation across a cell remains elusive. Here we show that Piezo1 is biochemically and functionally tethered to the actin cytoskeleton via the E-cadherin-{beta}-catenin mechanotransduction complex, whose perturbation significantly impairs Piezo1-mediated responses. Mechanistically, the adhesive extracellular domain of E-cadherin interacts with the cap domain of Piezo1 that controls the transmembrane gate, while its cytosolic tail might interact with the cytosolic domains of Piezo1 that are in close proximity to its intracellular gates, allowing a direct focus of adhesion-cytoskeleton-transmitted force for gating. Specific disruption of the intermolecular interactions prevents cytoskeleton-dependent gating of Piezo1. Thus, we propose a force-from-filament model to complement the previously suggested force-from-lipids model for mechanogating of Piezo channels, enabling them to serve as versatile and tunable mechanotransducers.</content>

 Neurophysiology studies require the use of inclusion criteria to identify neurons responsive to the experimental stimuli. Five recent studies used calcium imaging to measure the preferred tuning properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse visual areas. These five studies employed different inclusion criteria and report different, sometimes conflicting results. Here, we examine how different inclusion criteria can impact reported tuning properties, modifying inclusion criteria to select different sub-populations from the same dataset of almost 10,000 layer 2/3 neurons from the Allen Brain Observatory. The choice of inclusion criteria greatly affected the mean tuning properties of the resulting sub-populations; indeed, the differences in mean tuning due to inclusion criteria were often of comparable magnitude to the differences between studies. In particular, the mean preferred temporal frequencies of visual areas changed markedly with inclusion criteria, such that the rank ordering of visual areas based on their temporal frequency preferences changed with the percentage of neurons included. It has been suggested that differences in temporal frequency tuning support a hierarchy of mouse visual areas. These results demonstrate that our understanding of the functional organization of the mouse visual cortex obtained from previous experiments critically depends on the inclusion criteria used.</content>

 Loss of the exocytic Sec1/MUNC18 protein MUNC18-1 or its t-SNARE partners SNAP25 and syntaxin-1 results in rapid, cell-autonomous and unexplained neurodegeneration, which is independent of their known role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. cis-Golgi abnormalities are the earliest cellular phenotypes before degeneration occurs. Here, we investigated whether these Golgi abnormalities cause defects in the constitutive and regulated secretory pathway that may explain neurodegeneration. Electron microscopy confirmed that loss of MUNC18-1 expression results in a smaller cis-Golgi. In addition, we now show that medial-Golgi and the trans-Golgi Network are also affected. However, stacking and cisternae ultrastructure of the Golgi were normal. Overall ultrastructure of null mutant neurons was remarkably normal just hours before cell death occurred. Anterograde ER-to-Golgi and Golgi exit of endogenous and exogenous proteins were normal. In contrast, loss of MUNC18-1 caused reduced retrograde Cholera Toxin transport from the plasma membrane to the Golgi. In addition, MUNC18-1-deficiency resulted in abnormalities in retrograde TrkB trafficking. We conclude that MUNC18-1 deficient neurons have normal anterograde yet reduced retrograde transport to the Golgi. This imbalance in transport routes provides a plausible explanation for the observed Golgi abnormalities and cell death in MUNC18-1 deficient neurons.</content>

 Subplate neurons (SPNs) are a transient neuronal population shown to play a key role in nascent sensory processing relaying thalamic information to the developing cerebral cortex. However there is little understanding of how heterogeneity within this population relates to emergent function. To address this question we employed optical and electrophysiological technologies to investigate the synaptic connectivity of SPNs defined by expression of the Lpar1-EGFP transgene through the first postnatal week in primary whisker somatosensory cortex (S1BF). Our data identify that the Lpar1-EGFP SPNs represents two morphological subtypes: (1) transient, fusiform SPNs with axons largely restricted to the subplate zone; (2) pyramidal SPNs with axon collaterals that traverse the overlying cortex to extend through the marginal zone. Laser scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate was used to determine columnar glutamatergic and GABAergic input onto both of these SPN subtypes. These experiments revealed that the former receive translaminar input from more superficial cortical layers up until the emergence of the whisker barrels (~postnatal (P)5). In contrast, pyramidal SPNs only receive local input from the adjacent subplate network at early ages but then at later ages can acquire varied input from the overlying cortex. Combined electrical stimulation of the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus and optogenetic activation of thalamic afferents in thalamocortical slice preparations revealed that Lpar1-EGFP SPNs only receive sparse thalamic innervation during early postnatal development. Taken together, these data reveal two components of the postnatal network that interpret sparse thalamic input to direct the emergent columnar structure of neonatal somatosensory cortex.</content>

 Latent sensitization is a model of chronic pain in which a persistent state of pain hypersensitivity is suppressed by opioid receptors, as evidenced by the ability of opioid antagonists to induce a period of mechanical allodynia. Our objective was to determine if substance P and its neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) mediate the maintenance of latent sensitization. Latent sensitization was induced by injecting rats in the hindpaw with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), or by spared nerve injury (SNI). When responses to von Frey filaments returned to baseline (day 28), the rats were injected intrathecally with saline or the NK1R antagonist RP67580, followed 15 min later by intrathecal naltrexone. In both pain models, the saline-injected rats developed allodynia for 2 h after naltrexone, but not the RP67580-injected rats. Saline or RP67580 were injected daily for two more days. Five days later (day 35), naltrexone was injected intrathecally. Again, the saline-injected rats, but not the RP67580-injected rats, developed allodynia in response to naltrexone. To determine if there is sustained activation of NK1Rs during latent sensitization, NK1R internalization was measured in lamina I neurons in rats injected in the paw with saline or CFA, and then injected intrathecally with saline or naltrexone on day 28. The rats injected with CFA had a small amount of NK1R internalization that was significantly higher than in the saline-injected rats. Naltrexone increased NK1R internalization in the CFA-injected rats but nor in the saline-injected rats. Therefore, sustained activation of NK1Rs maintains pain hypersensitivity during latent sensitization.</content>

 Spatial inhibition of return (IOR) refers to the phenomenon by which individuals are slower to respond to stimuli appearing at a previously cued location compared to un-cued locations. Here we provide evidence supporting that spatial IOR is mildly impaired in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the impairment is readily detectable using a novel double cue paradigm. Furthermore, reduced spatial IOR in high-risk healthy older individuals is associated with reduced memory and other neurocognitive task performance, suggesting that the novel double cue spatial IOR paradigm may be useful in detecting MCI and early AD.</content>

 There is growing evidence that mechanical factors affect brain functioning. However, brain components responsible for regulating the physiological mechanical environment and causing mechanical alterations during maturation are not completely understood. To determine the relationship between structure and stiffness of the brain tissue, we performed high resolution viscoelastic mapping by dynamic indentation of hippocampus and cerebellum of juvenile brain, and quantified relative area covered by immunohistochemical staining of NeuN (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), Hoechst (nuclei), MBP (myelin), NN18 (axons) of juvenile and adult mouse brain slices. When compared the mechanical properties of juvenile mouse brain slices with previously obtained data on adult slices, the latter was ~20-150% stiffer, which correlates with an increase in the relative area covered by astrocytes. Heterogeneity within the slice, in terms of storage modulus, correlates negatively with the relative area of nuclei and neurons, as well as myelin and axons, while the relative area of astrocytes correlates positively. Several linear regression models are suggested to predict the mechanical properties of the brain tissue based on immunohistochemical stainings.</content>

 Learning effectively from errors requires using them in a context-dependent manner, for example adjusting to errors that result from unpredicted environmental changes but ignoring errors that result from environmental stochasticity. Where and how the brain represents errors in a context-dependent manner and uses them to guide behavior are not well understood. We imaged the brains of human participants performing a predictive-inference task with two conditions that had different sources of errors. Their performance was sensitive to this difference, including more choice switches after fundamental changes versus stochastic fluctuations in reward contingencies. Using multi-voxel pattern classification, we identified context-dependent representations of error magnitude and past errors in posterior parietal cortex. These representations were distinct from representations of the resulting context-dependent behavioral adjustments in dorsomedial frontal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex. The results provide new insights into human brain that represent and use errors in a context-dependent manner to support adaptive behavior.</content>

 Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra are selectively vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is hypothesized to be an early and fundamental pathogenic mechanism in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitochondrial function depends on the successful import of nuclear-encoded proteins, many of which are transported through the TOM20-TOM22 outer mitochondrial membrane import receptor machinery. Recent data suggests that post-translational modifications of -synuclein promote its interaction with TOM20 at the outer mitochondrial membrane and thereby inhibit normal protein import, which leads to dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons. As such, preservation of mitochondrial import in the face of -synuclein accumulation might be a strategy to prevent dopaminergic neurodegeneration, however, this is difficult to assess using current in vivo models of PD. To this end, we established an exogenous co-expression system, utilizing AAV2 vectors to overexpress human -synuclein and TOM20, individually or together, in the adult Lewis rat substantia nigra in order to assess whether TOM20 overexpression attenuates -synuclein-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Twelve weeks after viral injection, we observed that AAV2-TOM20 expression was sufficient to prevent loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons caused by AAV2-Syn overexpression. The observed TOM20-mediated dopaminergic neuron preservation appeared to be due, in part, to the rescued import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins that were inhibited by -synuclein overexpression. In addition, TOM20 overexpression rescued the import of the chaperone protein GRP75/mtHSP70/mortalin, a stress-response protein involved in -synuclein-induced injury. Collectively, these data indicate that TOM20 expression prevents -synuclein-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which is sufficient to rescue dopaminergic neurons in the adult rat brain.</content>

 To determine the function and mechanisms of action for hindbrain neurons that express GFRAL, the receptor for the anorexigenic peptide, GDF-15, we generated GfralCre and conditional GfralCreERT mice. While signals of infection or pathophysiologic states (rather than meal ingestion) stimulate GFRAL neurons, the artificial activation of GfralCre-expressing neurons inhibited feeding, decreased gastric emptying, and promoted a conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Additionally, activation of the smaller population of GFRAL neurons captured by the GfralCreERT allele decreased gastric emptying and produced a CTA without suppressing food intake, suggesting that GFRAL neurons primarily modulate gastric physiology and stimulate aversive responses. GFRAL neurons most strongly innervated the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), where they targeted CGRP-expressing (CGRPPBN) neurons. Silencing CGRPPBN neurons abrogated the aversive and anorexic effects of GDF-15. These findings suggest that GFRAL neurons link non-meal-associated, pathophysiologic signals to the aversive suppression of nutrient uptake and absorption.</content>

 Previous work suggests adolescent rats have deficient extinction consolidation relative to adults. Although the mechanisms underlying this age difference are currently unknown, studies in adult rats have implicated GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor function in extinction consolidation of drug-associated memory. Importantly, GluN2B neurotransmission emerges during adolescent development, and drugs of abuse during adolescence may delay the development of extinction consolidation by disrupting the ontogeny of GluN2B function. Here, we trained Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes to self-administer methamphetamine (METH, 0.1 mg/kg/infusion i.v.) beginning during adolescence [postnatal (P) day 41] or adulthood (P91). Rats were given short access (2 h) to self-administer METH in seven daily sessions followed by fourteen sessions with long access (6 h). Subsequently, rats underwent four daily 30-min extinction sessions with immediate post-session injections of either a GluN2B antagonist (Ro25-6981; 6 mg/kg, i.p.) or a vehicle solution. After four daily 2-h extinction sessions, a priming injection (1 mg/kg METH, i.p.) was given prior to a final 2-h reinstatement session. During LgA, adolescent-onset rats earn more METH than adult-onset rats and display greater drug-loading behavior. Rats reduced their drug-seeking behavior across extinction sessions, with no significant group differences. Rats reinstated drug-seeking following the METH priming injection, with females displaying greater reinstatement than males. These results do not support our a priori hypothesis that adolescent-onset METH use disrupts the ontogeny of GluN2B transmission and contributes to age-of-onset differences in extinction of METH-seeking. However, our findings suggest that age-of-onset contributes to compulsive METH-taking, while sex confers vulnerability to relapse to METH-seeking.</content>

 Aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is closely associated with neuronal death and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To define the signatures that distinguish between aggregation-prone and resistant cell states in AD, we developed a FACS-based method for the high-throughput isolation and transcriptome profiling of individual cells with cytoplasmic aggregates and profiled 63,110 somas from human AD brains. By comparing NFT-bearing and NFT-free somas within and across neuronal subtypes, we identified the cell-type-specific and shared states. NFT-bearing neurons shared a marked upregulation of genes associated with synaptic transmission, including a core set of 63 genes enriched for synaptic vesicle cycle and transsynaptic signaling, whereas glucose metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation changes were highly neuronal-subtype-specific. Apoptosis was modestly enriched in NFT-bearing neurons despite the strong link between tau and cell death. Our datasets provide a resource for investigating tau-mediated neurodegeneration and a platform for biomarker and drug target discovery.</content>

 The circadian clock has been shown to regulate various aspects of brain health including microglial and astrocyte activation. Here we report that deletion of the master clock protein BMAL1 induces robust increases in the expression of complement genes such as C3, C4b and C1q in the hippocampus. Loss of downstream REV-ERBalpha-mediated transcriptional repression led to increases in C4b in neurons and astrocytes as well as C3 protein in microglia and astrocytes. REV-ERBalpha deletion induced complement C3/C4b gene expression and increased microglial phagocytosis of synapses in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Finally, we observed diurnal variation in the degree of microglial synaptic phagocytosis in wild type mice which was abrogated by REV-ERBalpha deletion. This work uncovers the BMAL1-REV-ERBalpha axis as a regulator of complement expression and synaptic phagocytosis in the brain, thereby illuminating a novel mechanism of synaptic regulation by the circadian clock.</content>

 The entorhinal cortex (EC) is a brain region that has been shown to be essential for memory functions and spatial navigation. However, detailed 3D synaptic morphology analysis and identification of postsynaptic targets at the ultrastructural level have not been performed before in the human EC. In the present study, we used Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM) to perform a three-dimensional analysis of the synapses in the neuropil of medial EC in layers II and III from human brain autopsies. Specifically, we studied synaptic structural parameters of 3561 synapses, which were fully reconstructed in 3D. We analyzed the synaptic density, 3D spatial distribution, and type (excitatory and inhibitory), as well as the shape and size of each synaptic junction. Moreover, the postsynaptic targets of synapses could be clearly determined. The present work constitutes a detailed description of the synaptic organization of the human EC, which is a necessary step to better understand the functional organization of this region in both health and disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Chemical neurotransmission in the brain typically occurs through synapses, which are structurally and functionally defined as sites of close apposition between an axon terminal and a postsynaptic domain. Ultrastructural examinations of axon terminals established by monoamine neurons in the brain often failed to identify a similar tight pre- and postsynaptic coupling, giving rise to the concept of ''diffuse'' or ''volume'' transmission. Whether this results from intrinsic properties of such modulatory neurons remains undefined. Using an efficient co-culture model, we find that dopaminergic neurons establish an axonal arbor that is distinctive compared to glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons in both size and propensity of terminals to avoid direct contact with target neurons. Furthermore, while most dopaminergic varicosities express key proteins involved in exocytosis such as synaptotagmin 1, only {approx}20% of these are synaptic. The active zone protein bassoon was found to be enriched in a subset of dopaminergic terminals that are in proximity to a target cell. Irrespective of their structure, a majority of dopaminergic terminals were found to be active. Finally, we found that the presynaptic protein Nrxn-1SS4- and the postsynaptic protein NL-1AB, two major components involved in excitatory synapse formation, play a critical role in the formation of synapses by dopamine neurons. Taken together, our findings support the idea that DA neurons in the brain are endowed with a distinctive developmental program that leads them to adopt a fundamentally different mode of connectivity, compared to glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons involved in fast point-to-point signaling.</content>

 Innate defensive responses such as freezing or escape are essential for animal survival. Mice show defensive behaviour to stimuli sweeping overhead, like a bird cruising the sky. Here, we found that mice reduced their defensive freezing after sessions with a stimulus passing overhead repeatedly. This habituation is stimulus-specific, as mice freeze again to a novel shape. This allows us to investigate the invariances in the mouse visual system. The mice generalize over retinotopic location and over size and shape, but distinguish objects when they differ in both size and shape. Innate visual defensive responses are thus strongly influenced by previous experience as mice learn to ignore specific stimuli. This form of learning occurs at the level of a location-independent representation.</content>

Diverse algorithms can integrate transcriptomics with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to build context-specific metabolic models. These algorithms require identification of a list of high confidence (core) reactions from transcriptomics, but parameters related to identification of core reactions, such as thresholding of expression profiles, can significantly change model content. Importantly, current thresholding approaches are burdened with setting singular arbitrary thresholds for all genes; thus, resulting in removal of enzymes needed in small amounts and even many housekeeping genes. Here, we describe StanDep, a novel heuristic method for using transcriptomics to identify core reactions prior to building context-specific metabolic models. StanDep clusters gene expression data based on their expression pattern across different contexts and determines thresholds for each cluster using data-dependent statistics, specifically standard deviation and mean. To demonstrate the use of StanDep, we built hundreds of models for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. These models successfully increased the inclusion of housekeeping reactions, which are often lost in models built using standard thresholding approaches. Further, StanDep also provided a transcriptomic explanation for inclusion of lowly expressed reactions that were otherwise only supported by model extraction methods. Our study also provides novel insights into how cells may deal with context-specific and ubiquitous functions.

Animals use auditory cues generated by defensive responses of others to detect impending danger. Here we identify a neural circuit in rats involved in the detection of one such auditory cue, the cessation of movement-evoked sound resulting from freezing. This circuit comprises the dorsal subnucleus of the medial geniculate body (MGD) and downstream areas, the ventral area of the auditory cortex (VA), and the lateral amygdala (LA). This study suggests a role for the auditory offset pathway in processing a natural sound cue of threat.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CecMedAIA0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex hormone transition may trigger severe depressive episodes in some women. In order to map mechanisms related to such phenomena we developed a pharmacological preclinical human model using sex hormone manipulation with gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) in a placebo‐controlled design. Here the findings from this model is synthesized and discussed in the context of related literature on hormonal contributions to reproductive mental health disorders. The GnRHa model points to an estradiol‐dependent depressive response in healthy women undergoing short‐term sex hormone manipulation with GnRHa, which is linked to serotonin transporter changes (a key regulator of synaptic serotonin), a disengagement of hippocampus, and an overengagement of brain networks recruited when processing emotional salient information. Further, the GnRHa model suggest that key brain regions in the reward circuit are less engaged in positive stimuli when undergoing sex hormone manipulation, which may underlie anhedonia. Also, the work supports that enhanced sensitivity to estrogen signaling at the level of gene expression may drive increased risk for depressive symptoms when exposed to sex steroid hormone fluctuations. In conclusion, the GnRHa model work highlights brain signatures of rapid and profound changes in sex steroid hormone milieu, which reflect plausible mechanisms by which risk for mood disorders works. This model points to the role of estrogen dynamics and sensitivity, and offers a rationale for personalized prevention in hormonal transition phases, for example pregnancy to postpartum transition, perimenopause, and hormone treatments, which now can move into clinical translation and ideally pave the way for protecting mental and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced inhibitory GABA function, so‐called neural disinhibition, has been implicated in cognitive disorders, including schizophrenia and age‐related cognitive decline. We previously showed in rats that hippocampal disinhibition by local microinfusion of the GABA‐A receptor antagonist picrotoxin disrupted memory and attention and enhanced hippocampal multi‐unit burst firing recorded around the infusion site under isoflurane anesthesia. Here, we analyzed the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) recorded alongside the multi‐unit data. We predicted frequency‐specific LFP changes, based on previous studies implicating GABA in hippocampal oscillations, with the weight of evidence suggesting that disinhibition would facilitate theta and disrupt gamma oscillations. Using a new semi‐automated method based on the kurtosis of the LFP peak‐amplitude distribution as well as on amplitude envelope thresholding, we separated three distinct hippocampal LFP states under isoflurane anesthesia: “burst” and “suppression” states—high‐amplitude LFP spike bursts and the interspersed low‐amplitudeperiods—and a medium‐amplitude “continuous” state. The burst state showed greater overall power than suppression and continuous states and higher relative delta/theta power, but lower relative beta/gamma power. The burst state also showed reduced functional connectivity across the hippocampal recording area, especially around theta and beta frequencies. Overall neuronal firing was higher in the burst than the other two states, whereas the proportion of burst firing was higher in burst and continuous states than the suppression state. Disinhibition caused state‐ and frequency‐dependent LFP changes, tending to increase power at lower frequencies (&amp;lt;20 Hz), but to decrease power and connectivity at higher frequencies (&amp;gt;20 Hz) in burst and suppression states. The disinhibition‐induced enhancement of multi‐unit bursting was also state‐dependent, tending to be more pronounced in burst and suppression states than the continuous state. Overall, we characterized three distinct hippocampal LFP states in isoflurane‐anesthetized rats. Disinhibition changed hippocampal LFP oscillations in a state‐ and frequency‐dependent way. Moreover, the disinhibition‐induced enhancement of multi‐unit bursting was also LFP state‐dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We examined aging trajectories of cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area in &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; expansion adult carriers compared to healthy controls to characterize preclinical cerebral changes leading to symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to extract vertex‐wide CTh and cortical surface area (CSA). Symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects were compared to age‐matched controls using mixed‐effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories were compared between carriers and noncarriers by testing the “age by genetic status” interaction. False discovery rate corrections were applied to all vertex‐wide analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 symptomatic &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic carriers, and 249 controls (age range = 18–86 years). Symptomatic carriers showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in addition to large temporoparietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial frontoparietal lobes, in addition to scattered lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. These differences were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the ventrofrontal regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulty to control the own behavior. Neuroimaging studies have related ADHD with the interplay of fronto-parietal attention systems with the default mode network (DMN; Castellanos and Aoki, 2016). However, some results have been inconsistent, potentially due to methodological differences in the analytical strategies when defining the brain functional network, i.e., the functional connectivity threshold and/or the brain parcellation scheme. Here, we make use of topological data analysis (TDA) to explore the brain connectome as a function of the filtration value (i.e., the connectivity threshold), instead of using a static connectivity threshold. Specifically, we characterized the transition from all nodes being isolated to being connected into a single component as a function of the filtration value. We explored the utility of such a method to identify differences between 81 children with ADHD (45 male, age: 7.26–17.61 years old) and 96 typically developing children (TDC; 59 male, age: 7.17–17.96 years old), using a public dataset of resting state (rs)fMRI in human subjects. Results were highly congruent when using four different brain segmentations (atlases), and exhibited significant differences for the brain topology of children with ADHD, both at the whole-brain network and the functional subnetwork levels, particularly involving the frontal lobe and the DMN. Therefore, this is a solid approach that complements connectomics-related methods and may contribute to identify the neurophysio-pathology of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Video tracking is an essential tool in rodent research. Here, we demonstrate a machine vision rodent tracking camera based on a low-cost, open-source, machine vision camera, the OpenMV Cam M7. We call our device the rodent arena tracker (RAT), and it is a pocket-sized machine vision-based position tracker. The RAT does not require a tethered computer to operate and costs about $120 per device to build. These features make the RAT scalable to large installations and accessible to research institutions and educational settings where budgets may be limited. The RAT processes incoming video in real-time at 15 Hz and saves &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; positional information to an onboard microSD card. The RAT also provides a programmable multi-function input/output pin that can be used for controlling other equipment, transmitting tracking information in real time, or receiving data from other devices. Finally, the RAT includes a real-time clock (RTC) for accurate time stamping of data files. Real-time image processing averts the need to save video, greatly reducing storage, data handling, and communication requirements. To demonstrate the capabilities of the RAT, we performed three validation studies: (1) a 4-d experiment measuring circadian activity patterns; (2) logging of mouse positional information alongside status information from a pellet dispensing device; and (3) control of an optogenetic stimulation system for a real-time place preference (RTPP) brain stimulation reinforcement study. Our design files, build instructions, and code for the RAT implementation are open source and freely available online to facilitate dissemination and further development of the RAT.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Mild replication stress enhances appearance of dozens of robust recurrent genomic break clusters, termed RDCs, in cultured primary mouse neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Robust RDCs occur within genes (“RDC-genes”) that are long and have roles in neural cell communications and/or have been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases or cancer....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/AeB9rTKBdDU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25776?af=R</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaco‐refractory focal motor epileptic seizures pose a significant challenge. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is recently a recognized therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. To identify the specific target for focal motor seizures, we evaluate the modulatory effects of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation because of the critical role of STN in cortico‐subcortical motor processing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven epilepsy patients with refractory seizures who underwent chronic stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) monitoring were studied in presurgical evaluation. Seizure onset zone was hypothesized to be partially involved in the motor areas in six patients. For each patient, one electrode was temporally implanted into STN that was ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone. The cortical‐subcortical seizure propagation was systemically evaluated. The simultaneously electrophysiological responses over distributed cortical areas to STN stimulation at varied frequencies were quantitatively assessed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed the consistent downstream propagation of seizures from the motor cortex towards the ipsilateral STN and remarkable cortical responses on motor cortex to single‐pulse STN stimulation. Furthermore, we showed frequency‐dependent upstream modulatory effect of STN stimulation on motor cortex specifically. In contrast to the enhanced effects of low frequency stimulation, high‐frequency stimulation of STN can significantly reduce interictal spikes, high‐frequency oscillations over motor cortex disclosing effective connections to the STN.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result showed STN is not only engaged in as a propagation network of focal motor seizures but STN stimulation can profoundly modulate the epileptic activity of motor cortex in humans, suggesting a mechanism‐based alternative for patients suffering from refractory focal motor seizures.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, the scientific community has accelerated its process for knowledge synthesis and dissemination at multiple levels, from creating pathways for expedited journal peer review to establishing specialty task forces that curate information most relevant to individual fields of expertise. We describe our experience engaging with the latter to fill a gap in knowledge. At our institution, we established a group of fifteen neurologists from six subspecialties that created protocols on managing inpatients with concurrent neurological disorders and COVID‐19, using best available evidence and expert opinion. These protocols were disseminated online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://covidneurology.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;covidneurology.org&lt;/a&gt; on April 3, 2020, and have been updated continuously based on emerging literature and frontline clinical experience. We evaluated utility using data analytics, characterizing the number of unique visitors over a week of “normal” usage and the demographic data of visitors. We discuss here the limitations of this imperfect method of knowledge synthesis and dissemination, and acknowledge our peers nationwide who have provided feedback to greatly enhance the quality of these protocols. We believe that our experience highlights the need for exceptionally high levels of collaboration in these unprecedented times.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The auditory sensory organs appear to be less damaged by exposure to high-level noise that is presented after exposure to non-traumatizing low-level noise. This phenomenon is known as the toughening or conditioning effect. Functionally, it is manifested by a reduced threshold shift, and morphologically by a reduced hair cell loss. However, it remains unclear whether prior exposure to toughening noise can mitigate the synaptic loss induced by exposure to damaging noise. Since the cochlear afferent synapse between the inner hair cells and primary auditory neurons has been identified as a novel site involved in noise-induced cochlear damage, we were interested in assessing whether this synapse can be toughened. In the present study, the synaptic loss was induced by a damaging noise exposure (106 dB SPL) and compared across Guinea pigs who had and had not been previously exposed to a toughening noise (85 dB SPL). Results revealed that the toughening noise heavily reduced the synaptic loss observed 1 day after exposure to the damaging noise. Although it was significant, the protective effect of the toughening noise on permanent synaptic loss was much smaller. Compared with cases in the control group without noise exposure, coding deficits were seen in both toughened groups, as reflected in the compound action potential (CAP) by signals with amplitude modulation. In general, the pre-exposure to the toughening noise resulted in a significantly reduced synaptic loss by the high-level noise. However, this morphological protection was not accompanied by a robust functional benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The visualization of multiple gene expressions in well-preserved tissues is crucial for the elucidation of physiological and pathological processes. In situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a method to visualize specific mRNAs in diverse organisms by applying a HCR that is an isothermal enzyme-free nucleotide polymerization method using hairpin DNAs. Although in situ HCR is a versatile method, this method is not widely used by researchers because of their higher cost than conventional in situ hybridization (ISH). Here, we redesigned hairpin DNAs so that their lengths were half the length of commonly used hairpin DNAs. We also optimized the conjugated fluorophores and linkers. Modified in situ HCR showed sufficient fluorescent signals to detect various mRNAs such as Penk, Oxtr, Vglut2, Drd1, Drd2, and Moxd1 in mouse neural tissues with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The sensitivity of modified in situ HCR in detecting the Oxtr mRNA was better than that of fluorescent ISH using tyramide signal amplification. Notably, the modified in situ HCR does not require proteinase K treatment so that it enables the preservation of morphological structures and antigenicity. The modified in situ HCR simultaneously detected the distributions of c-Fos immunoreactivity and Vglut2 mRNA, and detected multiple mRNAs with a high signal-noise ratio at subcellular resolution in mouse brains. These results suggest that the modified in situ HCR using short hairpin DNAs is cost-effective and useful for the visualization of multiple mRNAs and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is critical for the development and survival of midbrain dopamine neurons that are predominantly affected and progressively degenerated in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The expression level of Nurr1 has been proposed to be modulated by α-synuclein (α-SYN), an important pathological hallmark of PD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of α-SYN-Nurr1 interaction are still rarely explored. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of α-SYN on the transcription level of Nurr1. Our results showed that overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) reduced Nurr1 and its downstream gene expressions. α-SYN neither affected the mRNA stability nor bound with the promoter of Nurr1, but modulated the transcription activity of Nurr1 promoter region ranging from −605 bp to −418 bp, which contains the binding site of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Moreover, overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) down-regulated NF-κB expression level, thereby inhibiting the transcription factor activity of NF-κB and decreasing the binding quantity of NF-κB with Nurr1 promoter. These findings may give us new insights to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the α-SYN-regulated Nurr1 function, which may fascinate the investigation of dopamine neuron degeneration in PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the question of the minimal amount of instructional time needed to still be effective by assessing the efficacy at mid-intervention of an early fundamental movement skill (FMS) intervention for preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Fourteen preschoolers participated in this randomized controlled trial daily over 10 weeks (10 h total at mid-intervention). A two-factor mixed MANOVA tested the significance of group*time interactions for two dependent variables: object control and locomotor raw scores on the Test of Gross Motor Development—III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Group*time interactions approached significance with large effect sizes on the vector of both dependent variables and in a univariate fashion on object control scores, but not locomotor scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These findings hold relevance for physical educators working with young children with ASD, indicating that 10 h of FMS instruction, at least in this form, is not adequate to improve FMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms of deep brain stimulation (DBS) remain controversial, and spatiotemporal control of brain-wide circuits remains elusive. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have emerged as vehicles for spatiotemporal expression of exogenous transgenes in several tissues, including specific nuclei in the brain. Coupling DBS with viral vectors to modulate exogenous transgene expression remains unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study examines whether DBS of the medial septal nucleus (MSN) can regulate gene expression of AAV-transduced neurons in a brain region anatomically remote from the stimulation target: the hippocampal dentate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Rats underwent unilateral hippocampal injection of an AAV vector with c-Fos promoter-driven expression of TdTomato (TdT), followed by MSN electrode implantation. Rodents received no stimulation, 7.7 Hz (theta), or 130 Hz (gamma) DBS for 1 h one week after surgery. In a repeat stimulation experiment, rodents received either no stimulation, or two 1 h MSN DBS over 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;No significant differences in hippocampal TdT expression between controls and acute MSN DBS were found. With repeat DBS we found c-Fos protein expression was induced and we could detect increased TdT with either gamma or theta stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that viral vector-mediated gene expression can be regulated spatially and temporally using DBS. Control of gene expression by DBS warrants further investigation into stimulation-responsive promoters for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The closed-loop brain stimulation technique plays a key role in neural network information processing and therapies of neurological diseases. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an established neuromodulation method for the neural oscillation in animals or human. All available TUS systems provide brain stimulation in an open-loop pattern. In this study, we developed a closed-loop transcranial ultrasound stimulation (CLTUS) system for real-time non-invasive neuromodulation in vivo. We used the CLTUS system to modulate the neural activities of the hippocampus of a wild-type mouse based on the phase of the theta rhythm recorded at the ultrasound-targeted location. In addition, we modulated the hippocampus of a temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) mouse. The ultrasound stimulation increased the absolute power and reduced the relative power of the theta rhythm, which were independent of the specific phase of the theta rhythm. Compared with those of a sham stimulation, the latency of epileptic seizures was significantly increased, while the epileptic seizure duration was significantly decreased under the CLTUS. The above results indicate that the CLTUS can be used to not only modulate the neural oscillation through the theta-phase-specific manipulation of the hippocampus but also effectively inhibit the seizure of a TLE mouse in time. CLTUS has large application potentials for the understanding of the causal relationship of neural circuits as well as for timely, effective, and non-invasive therapies of neurological diseases such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke (IS) is the leading cause of disability in the western world, assuming a high socio-economic cost. One of the most used strategies in the last decade has been biomaterials, which have been initially used with a structural support function. They have been perfected, different compounds have been combined, and they have been used together with cell therapy or controlled release chemical compounds. This double function has driven them as potential candidates for the chronic treatment of IS. In fact, the most developed are in different phases of clinical trial. In this review, we will show the ischemic scenario and address the most important criteria to achieve a successful neuroreparation from the point of view of biomaterials. The spontaneous processes that are activated and how to enhance them is one of the keys that contribute to the success of the therapeutic approach. In addition, the different routes of administration and how they affect the design of biomaterials are analyzed. Future perspectives show where this broad scientific field is heading, which advances every day with the help of technology and advanced therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The application of intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG) recording during functional magnetic resonance imaging (icEEG-fMRI) has allowed the study of the hemodynamic correlates of epileptic activity and of the neurophysiological basis of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. However, the applicability of this technique is affected by data quality issues such as signal drop out in the vicinity of the implanted electrodes. In our center we have limited the technique to a quadrature head transmit and receive RF coil following the results of a safety evaluation. The purpose of this study is to gather further safety-related evidence for performing icEEG-fMRI using a body RF-transmit coil, to allow the greater flexibility afforded by the use of modern, high-density receive arrays, and therefore parallel imaging with benefits such as reduced signal drop-out and distortion artifact. Specifically, we performed a set of empirical temperature measurements on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner with the body RF-transmit coil in a range of electrode and connector cable configurations. The observed RF-induced heating during a high-SAR sequence was maximum in the immediate vicinity of a depth electrode located along the scanner’s central axis (range: 0.2–2.4°C) and below 0.5°C at the other electrodes. Also for the high-SAR sequence, we observed excessive RF-related heating in connection cable configurations that deviate from our recommended setup. For the low-SAR sequence, the maximum observed temperature increase across all configurations was 0.3°C. This provides good evidence to allow simultaneous icEEG-fMRI to be performed utilizing the body transmit coil on the 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner at our center with acceptable additional risk by following a well-defined protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Metabolic brain network analysis based on graph theory using FDG PET imaging is potentially useful for investigating brain activity alternation due to metabolism changes in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Most studies on metabolic network construction have been based on group data. Here a novel approach in building an individual metabolic network was proposed to investigate individual metabolic network abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;First, a weighting matrix was calculated based on the interregional effect size difference of mean uptake between a single subject and average normal controls (NCs). Then the weighting matrix for a single subject was multiplied by a group-based connectivity matrix from an NC cohort. To study the performance of the proposed individual metabolic network, inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity patterns in the groups of NC, sMCI (stable mild cognitive impairment), pMCI (progressive mild cognitive impairment), and AD using the proposed individual metabolic network were constructed and compared with those from the group-based results. The network parameters of global efficiency and clustering coefficient and the network density score (NDS) in the default-mode network (DMN) of generated individual metabolic networks were estimated and compared among the disease groups in AD.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity patterns estimated from our individual metabolic network are similar to those from the group-based method. In particular, the key patterns of occipital-parietal and occipital-temporal inter-regional connectivity deficits detected in the groupwise network study for differentiating different disease groups in AD were also found in the individual network. A reduction trend was observed for network parameters of global efficiency and clustering coefficient, and also for the NDS from NC, sMCI, pMCI, and AD. There was no significant difference between NC and sMCI for all network parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We proposed a novel method in constructing the individual metabolic network using a single-subject FDG PET image and a group-based NC connectivity matrix. The result has shown the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed individual metabolic network in differentiating disease groups in AD. Future studies should include investigation of inter-individual variability and the correlation of individual network features to disease severities and clinical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human habenula studies are gradually advancing, primarily through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis of passive (Pavlovian) conditioning tasks as well as probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks. However, no studies have particularly targeted aversive prediction errors, despite the essential importance for the habenula in the field. Complicated learned strategies including contextual contents are involved in making aversive prediction errors during the learning process. Therefore, we examined habenula activation during a contextual learning task. We performed fMRI on a group of 19 healthy controls. We assessed the manually traced habenula during negative outcomes during the contextual learning task. The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were also administered. The left and right habenula were activated during aversive outcomes and the activation was associated with aversive prediction errors. There was also a positive correlation between TCI reward dependence scores and habenula activation. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses demonstrated the left and right habenula to the left and right hippocampus connections during the presentation of contextual stimuli. These findings serve to highlight the neural mechanisms that may be relevant to understanding the broader relationship between the habenula and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Research on how humans perceive sensory inputs from their bodies (“interoception”) has been rapidly gaining momentum, with interest across a host of disciplines from physiology through to psychiatry. However, studying interoceptive processes is not without significant challenges, and many methods utilized to access internal states have been largely devoted to capturing and relating naturally occurring variations in interoceptive signals (such as heartbeats) to measures of how the brain processes these signals. An alternative procedure involves the controlled perturbation of specific interoceptive axes. This is challenging because it requires non-invasive interventions that can be repeated many times within a subject and that are potent but safe. Here we present an effective methodology for instigating these perturbations within the breathing domain. We describe a custom-built circuitry that is capable of delivering inspiratory resistive loads automatically and precisely. Importantly, our approach is compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environments, allowing for the administration of complicated experimental designs in neuroimaging as increasingly required within developing fields such as computational psychiatry/psychosomatics. We describe the experimental setup for both the control and monitoring of the inspiratory resistive loads, and demonstrate its possible utilities within different study designs. This methodology represents an important step forward from the previously utilized, manually controlled resistive loading setups, which present significant experimental burdens with prolonged and/or complicated sequences of breathing stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Systems of coupled dynamical units (e.g., oscillators or neurons) are known to exhibit complex, emergent behaviors that may be simplified through coarse-graining: a process in which one discovers coarse variables and derives equations for their evolution. Such coarse-graining procedures often require extensive experience and/or a deep understanding of the system dynamics. In this paper we present a systematic, data-driven approach to discovering “bespoke” coarse variables based on manifold learning algorithms. We illustrate this methodology with the classic Kuramoto phase oscillator model, and demonstrate how our manifold learning technique can successfully identify a coarse variable that is one-to-one with the established Kuramoto order parameter. We then introduce an extension of our coarse-graining methodology which enables us to learn evolution equations for the discovered coarse variables via an artificial neural network architecture templated on numerical time integrators (initial value solvers). This approach allows us to learn accurate approximations of time derivatives of state variables from sparse flow data, and hence discover useful approximate differential equation descriptions of their dynamic behavior. We demonstrate this capability by learning ODEs that agree with the known analytical expression for the Kuramoto order parameter dynamics at the continuum limit. We then show how this approach can also be used to learn the dynamics of coarse variables discovered through our manifold learning methodology. In both of these examples, we compare the results of our neural network based method to typical finite differences complemented with geometric harmonics. Finally, we present a series of computational examples illustrating how a variation of our manifold learning methodology can be used to discover sets of “effective” parameters, reduced parameter combinations, for multi-parameter models with complex coupling. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of this approach, including the possibility of obtaining data-driven effective partial differential equations for coarse-grained neuronal network behavior, as illustrated by the synchronization dynamics of Hodgkin–Huxley type neurons with a Chung-Lu network. Thus, we build an integrated suite of tools for obtaining data-driven coarse variables, data-driven effective parameters, and data-driven coarse-grained equations from detailed observations of networks of oscillators.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In this work, we show that some inherent non-uniqueness problem exists in the DCNN-based modeling of image object representations. This non-uniqueness phenomenon reveals to some extent the theoretical limitation of this general modeling approach, and invites due attention to be taken in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Songbirds are useful vertebrate study models for vocal learning and memory. The robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) receives synaptic inputs from both the posterior and anterior pathways of the song control system in songbirds. Hence, RA plays an important role in the control of singing. RA receives dopaminergic (DArgic) inputs that increase the excitability of RA projection neurons (PNs). However, the effects of DA on excitatory synaptic transmission are yet to be deciphered. In this study, the effects of DA on the excitatory synaptic transmission of the PNs in the RA of adult male zebra finches were investigated using a whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We observed that DA decreased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). The effects of DA were mimicked by the D1-like DA receptor (D1R) agonist, SKF-38393, but not the D2-like DA receptor (D2R) agonist, Quinpirole. Also, the effects of DA were blocked by D1R antagonist, SCH-23390, but not the D2R antagonist, Sulpiride. These results demonstrate that DA modulates excitatory synaptic transmission by acting on D1R in the RA of adult male zebra finches.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal, and incurable neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in ALS pathogenesis. The reversible nature of this dysregulation makes miRNAs attractive pharmacological targets and a potential therapeutic avenue. Under physiological conditions, miRNA biogenesis, which begins in the nucleus and includes further maturation in the cytoplasm, involves trans-activation response element DNA/RNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP43). However, TDP43 mutations or stress trigger TDP43 mislocalization and inclusion formation, a hallmark of most ALS cases, that may lead to aberrant protein/miRNA interactions in the cytoplasm. Herein, we demonstrated that TDP43 exhibits differential binding affinity for select miRNAs, which prompted us to profile miRNAs that preferentially bind cytoplasmic TDP43. Using cellular models expressing TDP43 variants and miRNA profiling analyses, we identified differential levels of 65 cytoplasmic TDP43-associated miRNAs. Of these, approximately 30% exhibited levels that differed by more than 3-fold in the cytoplasmic TDP43 models relative to our control model. The hits included both novel miRNAs and miRNAs previously associated with ALS that potentially regulate several predicted genes and pathways that may be important for pathogenesis. Accordingly, these findings highlight specific miRNAs that may shed light on relevant disease pathways and could represent potential biomarkers and reversible treatment targets for ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-induced murine neuroinflammation serves as a model to study acute meningoencephalomyelitis, hepatitis, and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination; which mimics certain pathologies of the human neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation occurs due to direct glial cell dystrophy instigated by central nervous system (CNS)-resident microglia and astrocytes, in contrast to peripheral CD4+T cell-mediated myelin damage prevalent in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Viral envelope Spike glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion is an essential mechanistic step for MHV-induced CNS pathogenicity. Although Azadirachta indica (Neem), a traditional phytomedicine, is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and spermicidal activities, not much is known about anti-neuroinflammatory properties of its bark (NBE) in MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation and chronic demyelination. Recombinant demyelinating MHV strain (RSA59) was preincubated with NBE to arrest the infection-initiation event, and its effect on viral replication, viral transcription, cytokine expression, and successive pathogenicity were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Virus-free Luciferase assay explained NBE’s anti-virus-to-cell fusion activity in vitro. Intracranial inoculation of RSA59 preincubated with NBE into the mouse brain significantly reduces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalomyelitis, and chronic progressive demyelination. Additionally, NBE effectively restricts viral entry, dissemination in CNS, viral replication, viral transcription, and expression of the viral nucleocapsid and inflammatory cytokines. From mechanistic standpoints, RSA59 preincubated with NBE reduced viral entry, viral replication and cell-to-cell fusion, as a mode of viral dissemination. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection with NBE (25 mg/kg B.W.) into mice revealed a significant reduction in viral Nucleocapsid protein expression in vivo. Conclusively, A. indica bark extract may directly bind to the virus-host attachment Spike glycoprotein and suppresses MHV-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathogenesis by inhibiting cell-to-cell fusion and viral replication. Further studies will focus on combining bioanalytical assays to isolate potential NBE bioactive compound(s) that contribute towards the anti-viral activity of NBE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A fundamental interest in circuit analysis is to parse out the synaptic inputs underlying a behavioral experience. Toward this aim, we have devised an unbiased strategy that specifically labels the afferent inputs that are activated by a defined stimulus in an activity-dependent manner. We validated this strategy in four brain circuits receiving known sensory inputs. This strategy, as demonstrated here, accurately identifies these inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;During brain development, the design of primary neural networks is primarily determined by environmental stimuli after their formation. In particular, the juvenile period is critical, during which neuronal circuits that consist of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are remodeled by experience. Social isolation during the juvenile period profoundly affects brain development and contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders. We previously reported that 2 weeks of social isolation after weaning reduced excitatory synaptic inputs and intrinsic excitability in a subtype of layer 5 pyramidal cells, which we defined as prominent h-current (PH) cells, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice. However, it remains unclear how juvenile social isolation affects inhibitory neuronal circuits that consist of pyramidal cells and interneurons. We found that 2 weeks of social isolation after weaning increased inhibitory synaptic inputs exclusively onto PH cells with a concomitant deterioration of action potential properties. Although social isolation did not alter the inhibitory synaptic release mechanisms or the number of inhibitory functional synapses on PH cells, we found that it increased the intrinsic excitability of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons with less excitatory synaptic inputs and more h-current.

 &lt;p&gt;Homeostatic plasticity refers to the ability of neuronal networks to stabilize their activity in the face of external perturbations. Most forms of homeostatic plasticity ultimately depend on changes in the expression or activity of ion channels and synaptic proteins, which may occur at the gene, transcript, or protein level. The most extensively investigated homeostatic mechanisms entail adaptations in protein function or localization following activity-dependent posttranslational modifications. Numerous studies have also highlighted how homeostatic plasticity can be achieved by adjusting local protein translation at synapses or transcription of specific genes in the nucleus. In comparison, little attention has been devoted to whether and how alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs underlies some forms of homeostatic plasticity. AS not only expands proteome diversity but also contributes to the spatiotemporal dynamics of mRNA transcripts. Prominent in the brain where it can be regulated by neuronal activity, it is a flexible process, tightly controlled by a multitude of factors. Given its extensive use and versatility in optimizing the function of ion channels and synaptic proteins, we argue that AS is ideally suited to achieve homeostatic control of neuronal output. We support this thesis by reviewing emerging evidence linking AS to various forms of homeostatic plasticity: homeostatic intrinsic plasticity, synaptic scaling, and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Further, we highlight the relevance of this connection for brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that diabetes can cause cognitive dysfunction, and cognitive dysfunction in patients with diabetes combined with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more severe. LncRNAs are known to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with OSA. This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of the lncRNA MALAT1/miR-224-5p/NLRP3 axis in T2DM with OSA. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of MALAT1, miR-224-5p, and NLRP3 in brain tissues. NLRP3 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescent labeling. The interaction involving MALAT1, miR-224-5p, and NLRP3 was evaluated by transfection. Western blotting was utilized to evaluate the expression levels of the pathway-related proteins NLRP3, caspase 1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) both in vitro and in vivo. qRT-PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α and IL-1β both in vitro and in vivo. In brain tissues of T2DM with OSA, MALAT1 and NLRP3 were overexpressed, while miR-224-5p was downregulated, which was consistent with subsequent cell experiments. We screened the miRNAs that could bind to MALAT1 and NLRP3 by the StarBase database and the TargetScanMouse7.2 website. Our research showed that among these miRNAs, the level of miR-224-5p was most significantly negatively correlated with the levels of MALAT1 and NLRP3. Also, a firefly luciferase assay showed that miR-224-5p, which is a target of MALAT1, directly reduced the expression of the downstream protein NLRP3. Overexpression of miR-224-5p significantly inhibited the expression levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α and IL-1β in vitro. MALAT1 promoted NLRP3 expression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA and sponging miR-224-5p. MiR-224-5p reduces microglial inflammation activation through the regulation of NLRP3 expression, which ultimately affected the NLRP3/IL-1β pathway in the hippocampus. This suggests that miR-224-5p may serve as a potential target for T2DM and OSA therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Therapeutic applications of auricular vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have drawn recent attention. Since the targeted stimulation process and parameters depend on the electrode–tissue interaction, the lack of structural anatomical information on innervation and vascularization of the auricle restrain the current optimization of stimulation paradigms. For the first time, we employed high-resolution episcopic imaging (HREM) to generate histologic volume data from donated human cadaver ears. Optimal parameters for specimen preparation were evaluated. Anatomical 3D vascular and nerve structures were reconstructed in one sample of an auricular cymba conchae (CC). The feasibility of HREM to visualize anatomical structures was assessed in that diameters, occupied areas, volumes, and mutual distances between auricular arteries, nerves, and veins were registered. The selected region of CC (3 × 5.5 mm) showed in its cross-sections 21.7 ± 2.7 (mean ± standard deviation) arteries and 14.66 ± 2.74 nerve fibers. Identified nerve diameters were 33.66 ± 21.71 μm, and arteries had diameters in the range of 71.58 ± 80.70 μm. The respective occupied area showed a share of, on average, 2.71% and 0.3% for arteries and nerves, respectively, and similar volume occupancy for arteries and nerves. Inter-centroid minimum distance between arteries and nerves was 274 ± 222 μm. The density of vessels and nerves around a point within CC on a given grid was assessed, showing that 50% of all vessels and nerves were found in a radial distance of 1.6–1.8 mm from any of these points, which is strategically relevant when using stimulation needles in the auricle for excitation of nerves. HREM seems suitable for anatomical studies of the human ear. A 3D model of CC was established in the micrometer scale, which forms the basis for future optimization of the auricular VNS. Obviously, the presented single cadaver study needs to be validated by additional anatomical data on the innervation and vascularization of the auricle.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Progressive accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain is a characteristic pathological change in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We previously found the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was increased in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to low-dose Aβ and decreased in cells with high-dose Aβ exposure, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Based on previous studies, the opposite regulation of histone deacetylase2 (HDAC2) and HDAC3 on LPL expression probably explain the above molecular mechanism, in which microRNA-29a and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) may be involved. This study further revealed the mechanism of HDAC2 and HDAC3 on conversely regulating LPL expression. The results showed that HDAC2 down-regulated microRNA-29a by decreasing histone acetylation (Ace-H3K9) level in its promoter region, subsequently increasing LPL expression directly or through PPARγ/LPL pathway; HDAC3 decreased LPL expression through inhibiting Ace-H3K9 levels in LPL and PPARγ promoter regions and up-regulating microRNA-29a. This study also found that with increasing concentrations of Aβ in cells, HDAC2 and HDAC3 expression were gradually increased, and Ace-H3K9 levels in LPL and PPARγ promoter region regulated by HDAC3 were decreased correspondingly, while Ace-H3K9 levels in microRNA-29a promoter region modulated by HDAC2 were not decreased gradually but presented a U-shaped trend. These may lead to the results that a U-shaped alteration in microRNA-29a expression, subsequently leading to an inverse U-shaped alteration in PPARγ or LPL expression. In conclusion, HDAC2 and HDAC3 at least partly mediate LPL expression variations in different concentrations of Aβ exposed SH-SY5Y cells, in which microRNA-29a and PPARγ are involved, and the histone acetylation level in microRNA-29a promoter region plays a key role.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The underlying premise of current theories of cognitive decline with age tend to be primarily cognitive or biological explanations, with relatively few theories adequately integrating both aspects. Though literature has also emphasized the importance of several factors that contribute to cognitive aging including: (a) decline in sensory abilities; (b) the effect of motor speed on paper-pencil measures of cognitive speed; (c) the impact of level of education and physical activity; and (d) molecular biological changes that occur with age, these factors have seldom been implicated into any single theoretical model of cognitive aging. Indeed, such an integrated bio-cognitive model of aging has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of attention, perception, learning, and memory across the lifespan. Thus, the aim of this review was to critically evaluate common theories of age-related cognitive decline and highlight the need for a more comprehensive systems neuroscience approach to cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by global deterioration in multiple cognitive domains. In addition to cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms are common issues that trouble AD patients. The neuroanatomical basis of depressive symptoms in AD patients has yet to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Twenty AD patients and 22 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for the present study. Depressive symptoms in AD patients and HCs were assessed according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Anatomical structural differences were assessed between AD patients and HCs using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM). Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate relationships between depressive symptoms and structural altered regions. Multiple pattern analysis using linear support vector machine (SVM) was performed in another independent cohort, which was collected from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data and contained 20 AD patients and 20 HCs, to distinguish AD patients from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with HCs, AD patients exhibited global cerebral atrophy in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness, including frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and insular lobes. In addition, insular GMV was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Moreover, SVM-based classification achieved an accuracy of 77.5%, a sensitivity of 70%, and a specificity of 85% by leave-one-out cross-validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: GMV of the insula displayed atrophy among AD patients, which is associated with depressive symptoms. Our observations provide a potential neural substrate for analysis to examine the co-occurrence of AD with depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are hallmark lesions of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) related to β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and intraneuronal phosphorylated tau (pTau) accumulation. Sortilin C-terminal fragments (shortened as “sorfra”) can deposit as senile plaque-like lesions within AD brains. The course and pattern of sorfra plaque formation relative to Aβ and pTau pathogenesis remain unknown. In the present study, cerebral and subcortical sections in postmortem human brains (n = 46) from aged and AD subjects were stained using multiple markers (6E10, β-secretase 1, pTau, and sortilin antibodies, as well as Bielschowsky silver stain). The course and pattern of sorfra plaque formation relative to Thal Aβ and Braak NFT pathogenic stages were determined. Sorfra plaques occurred in the temporal, inferior frontal and occipital neocortices in cases with Thal 1 and Braak III stages. They were also found additionally in the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and associative neocortex in cases with Thal 2–4 and Braak IV–V. Lastly, they were also found in the primary motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices in cases with Thal 4–5 and Braak VI. Unlike Aβ and pTau pathologies, sorfra plaques did not occur in subcortical structures in cases with Aβ/pTau lesions in Thal 3–5/Braak IV–VI stages. We establish here that sorfra plaques are essentially a cerebral proteopathy. We believe that the development of sorfra plaques in both cortical and hippocampal regions proceeds in a typical spatiotemporal pattern, and the stages of cerebral sorfra plaque formation partially overlap with that of Aβ and pTau pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Maintenance of connective tissue integrity is fundamental to sustain function, requiring protein turnover to repair damaged tissue. However, connective tissue proteome dynamics remain largely undefined, as do differences in turnover rates of individual proteins in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we investigate proteome dynamics in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissues by exploiting the spatially distinct fascicular (collagen-rich) and interfascicular (glycoprotein-rich) ECM phases of tendon. Using isotope labelling, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, we calculate turnover rates of individual proteins within rat Achilles tendon and its ECM phases. Our results demonstrate complex proteome dynamics in tendon, with ~1000 fold differences in protein turnover rates, and overall faster protein turnover within the glycoprotein-rich interfascicular matrix compared to the collagen-rich fascicular matrix. These data provide insights into the complexity of proteome dynamics in tendon, likely required to maintain tissue homeostasis.</content>

 The cognitive abilities of biological organisms only make sense in the context of their environment. Here, we study longhorn crazy ant collective navigation skills within the context of a semi-natural, randomized environment. Mapping this biological setting into the 'Ant-in-a-Labyrinth' framework which studies physical transport through disordered media allows us to formulate precise links between the statistics of environmental challenges and the ants' collective navigation abilities. We show that, in this environment, the ants use their numbers to collectively extend their sensing range. Although this extension is moderate, it nevertheless allows for extremely fast traversal times that overshadow known physical solutions to the 'Ant-in-a-Labyrinth' problem. To explain this large payoff, we use percolation theory and prove that whenever the labyrinth is solvable, a logarithmically small sensing range suffices for extreme speedup. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential advantages of group living and collective cognition in increasing a species' habitable range.</content>

 Neuronal degeneration in the zebrafish retina stimulates Müller glia (MG) to proliferate and generate multipotent progenitors for retinal repair. Controlling this proliferation is critical to successful regeneration. Previous studies reported that retinal injury stimulates pSmad3 signaling in injury-responsive MG. Contrary to these findings, we report pSmad3 expression is restricted to quiescent MG and suppressed in injury-responsive MG. Our data indicates that Tgfb3 is the ligand responsible for regulating pSmad3 expression. Remarkably, although overexpression of either Tgfb1b or Tgfb3 can stimulate pSmad3 expression in the injured retina, only Tgfb3 inhibits injury-dependent MG proliferation; suggesting the involvement of a non-canonical Tgfb signaling pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of Alk5, PP2A or Notch signaling rescues MG proliferation in Tgfb3 overexpressing zebrafish. Finally, we report that this Tgfb3 signaling pathway is active in zebrafish MG, but not those in mice, which may contribute to the different regenerative capabilities of MG from fish and mammals.</content>

 The 'building-block' model of inositol trisphosphate (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; liberation posits that cell-wide cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals arise through coordinated activation of localized Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; puffs generated by stationary clusters of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). Here, we revise this hypothesis, applying fluctuation analysis to resolve Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals otherwise obscured during large Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations. We find the rising phase of global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals is punctuated by a flurry of puffs, which terminate before the peak by a mechanism involving partial ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; depletion. The continuing rise in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and persistence of global signals even when puffs are absent, reveal a second mode of spatiotemporally diffuse Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. Puffs make only small, transient contributions to global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals, which are sustained by diffuse release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through a functionally distinct process. These two modes of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; liberation have important implications for downstream signaling, imparting spatial and kinetic specificity to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent effector functions and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport.</content>

 &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; blood cells, called hemocytes, are classified into plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes based on the expression of a few marker genes and cell morphologies, which are inadequate to classify the complete hemocyte repertoire. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions in larvae. We resolved plasmatocytes into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the identification of intermediate states. Further, we discovered rare subsets within crystal cells and lamellocytes that express fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand &lt;i&gt;branchless&lt;/i&gt; and receptor &lt;i&gt;breathless&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. We demonstrate that these FGF components are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals the diversity of hemocytes and provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles for a systems-level understanding of their functions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Metabolic pathways and inflammatory processes are under circadian regulation. While rhythmic immune cell recruitment is known to impact infection outcomes, whether the circadian clock modulates immunometabolism remains unclear. We find the molecular clock Bmal1 is induced by inflammatory stimulants, including Ifn-g/lipopolysaccharide (M1) and tumor-conditioned medium, to maintain mitochondrial metabolism under these metabolically stressed conditions in mouse macrophages. Upon M1 stimulation, myeloid-specific &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt; knockout (M-BKO) renders macrophages unable to sustain mitochondrial function, enhancing succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated mitochondrial ROS production and Hif-1a-dependent metabolic reprogramming and inflammatory damage. In tumor-associated macrophages, the aberrant Hif-1a activation and metabolic dysregulation by M-BKO contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Consequently, M-BKO increases melanoma tumor burden, while administrating an SDH inhibitor dimethyl malonate suppresses tumor growth. Therefore, Bmal1 functions as a metabolic checkpoint integrating macrophage mitochondrial metabolism, redox homeostasis and effector functions. This Bmal1-Hif-1a regulatory loop may provide therapeutic opportunities for inflammatory diseases and immunotherapy.</content>

		<link href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53885"/>

		<content type="html">
 Loop extrusion by structural maintenance of chromosomes complexes (SMCs) has been proposed as a mechanism to organize chromatin in interphase and metaphase. However, the requirements for chromatin organization in these cell cycle phases are different, and it is unknown whether loop extrusion dynamics and the complexes that extrude DNA also differ. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; egg extracts to reconstitute and image loop extrusion of single DNA molecules during the cell cycle. We show that loops form in both metaphase and interphase, but with distinct dynamic properties. Condensin extrudes DNA loops non-symmetrically in metaphase, whereas cohesin extrudes loops symmetrically in interphase. Our data show that loop extrusion is a general mechanism underlying DNA organization, with dynamic and structural properties that are biochemically regulated during the cell cycle.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Alveolar formation increases the surface area for gas-exchange and is key to the physiological function of the lung. Alveolar epithelial cells, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells undergo coordinated morphogenesis to generate epithelial folds (secondary septa) to form alveoli. A mechanistic understanding of alveologenesis remains incomplete. We found that the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is required in alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts for alveologenesis in mammals. Our studies uncovered a &lt;i&gt;Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2&lt;/i&gt; cascade that endows cellular properties and novel mechanisms of alveologenesis. This includes PDGF secretion from alveolar type I and type II cells, cell shape changes of type I cells and migration of myofibroblasts. All these cellular properties are conferred by changes in the cytoskeleton and represent a new facet of PCP function. These results extend our current model of PCP signaling from polarizing a field of epithelial cells to conferring new properties at subcellular levels to regulate collective cell behavior.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Mammalian articular cartilage is an avascular tissue with poor capacity for spontaneous repair. Here, we show that embryonic development of cartilage in the skate (&lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;) mirrors that of mammals, with developing chondrocytes co-expressing genes encoding the transcription factors Sox5, Sox6 and Sox9. However, in skate, transcriptional features of developing cartilage persist into adulthood, both in peripheral chondrocytes and in cells of the fibrous perichondrium that ensheaths the skeleton. Using pulse-chase label retention experiments and multiplexed in situ hybridization, we identify a population of cycling &lt;i&gt;Sox5/6/9&lt;/i&gt;+ perichondral progenitor cells that generate new cartilage during adult growth, and we show that persistence of chondrogenesis in adult skates correlates with ability to spontaneously repair cartilage injuries. Skates therefore offer a unique model for adult chondrogenesis and cartilage repair and may serve as inspiration for novel cell-based therapies for skeletal pathologies, such as osteoarthritis.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Platelets are anucleate cells in blood whose principal function is to stop bleeding by forming aggregates for hemostatic reactions. In addition to their participation in physiological hemostasis, platelet aggregates are also involved in pathological thrombosis and play an important role in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis. The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify. Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type. It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists. The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Antimalarial drug resistance has historically arisen through convergent &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; parasite populations in Southeast Asia and South America. For the past decade in Southeast Asia, artemisinins, the core component of first-line antimalarial therapies, have experienced delayed parasite clearance associated with several &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; mutations, primarily C580Y. We report that mutant &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; has emerged independently in Guyana, with genome analysis indicating an evolutionary origin distinct from Southeast Asia. &lt;i&gt;Pfk13&lt;/i&gt; C580Y parasites were observed in 1.6% (14/854) of samples collected in Guyana in 2016–2017. Introducing &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; C580Y or R539T mutations by gene editing into local parasites conferred high levels of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; artemisinin resistance. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth competition assays revealed a fitness cost associated with these &lt;i&gt;pfk13&lt;/i&gt; variants, potentially explaining why these resistance alleles have not increased in frequency more quickly in South America. These data place local malaria control efforts at risk in the Guiana Shield.</content>

 Whalen et al. establish the mechanism by which collapsed forks caused by expanded CAG repeats relocate to the nuclear pore complex to maintain genome stability. This mechanism relies on sumoylation of repair proteins that bind the collapsed fork to facilitate relocation and constrain recombination until at the nuclear pore complex.</content>

 Na et al. show that stress induces proliferation, DNA damage response (DDR), and O-GlcNAc levels in stem/progenitor cells. Higher O-GlcNAc levels directly induce proliferation and DDR. These data reveal an unexpected conserved autoregulatory loop, wherein the downstream DDR kinases CHK1/2 stabilize OGT, augmenting O-GlcNAcylation and further promoting the DDR pathway.</content>

 Understanding the molecular basis of dengue virus (DENV) attenuation is important for designing more effective vaccines. Choy et al. identify the non-structural 1 (NS1) G53D substitution as a key single attenuating mutation of a clinically tested vaccine strain. Substitution of NS1 G53D impairs RPN1-dependent proper glycosylation of NS1 to induce ER stress and downstream antiviral responses.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-R) have been identified as key bio-markers of important brain functions such as memory consolidation and decision making. SPW-R detection typically relies on hand-crafted feature extraction, and laborious manual curation is often required. In this multidisciplinary study, we propose a novel, self-improving artificial intelligence (AI) method in the form of deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) layers that can learn features of SPW-R events from raw, labeled input data. The algorithm is trained using supervised learning on hand-curated data sets with SPW-R events. The input to the algorithm is the local field potential (LFP), the low- frequency part of extracellularly recorded electric potentials from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The output prediction can be interpreted as the time-varying probability of SPW-R events for the duration of the input. A simple thresholding applied to the output probabilities is found to identify times of events with high precision. The reference implementation of the algorithm, named 'RippleNet', is open source, freely available, and implemented using a common open-source framework for neural networks (tensorflow.keras) and can be easily incorporated into existing data analysis workflows for processing experimental data.</content>

 Learning-related plasticity in the cerebral cortex is linked to the action of disinhibitory circuits of interneurons. Pavlovian conditioning, in which stimulation of the vibrissae is used as conditioned stimulus, induces plastic enlargement of the cortical functional representation of vibrissae activated during conditioning, visualized with [14C]-2-deoxyglucose (2DG). Using layer-specific, cell-selective DREADD transductions, we examined the involvement of somatostatin- (SOM-INs) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP-INs)-containing interneurons in the development of learning-related plastic changes. We injected DREADD-expressing vectors into layer IV (L4) barrels or layer II/III (L2/3) areas corresponding to activated vibrissae. The activity of interneurons was modulated during training, and 2DG maps were obtained 24 h later. In mice with L4 but not L2/3 SOM-INs suppressed during conditioning, the plastic change of whisker representation and the conditioned reaction were absent. No effect of inhibiting VIP-INs was found. We report that the activity of L4 SOM-INs is indispensable for learning-induced plastic change.</content>

 The non-invasive study of cortical oscillations provides a window onto neuronal processing. Temporal correlation of these oscillations between distinct anatomical regions is considered a marker of functional connectedness. As the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is thought to play a crucial role in shaping the frequency and amplitude of oscillations, which thereby suggests a further role for GABA in shaping the topography of functional connectivity. This study explored the effects of pharmacologically blocking the reuptake of GABA (increasing local concentrations and availability) through oral administration of the GAT1-blocker tiagabine (15 mg). We show that the spatial distribution of connectivity effects corresponds to template maps of flumazenil PET maps of GABAA receptor distribution. In a placebo-controlled crossover design, we collected resting MEG recordings from 15 healthy male individuals prior to, and at 1-, 3- and 5- hours post, administration of tiagabine and placebo pill. Using amplitude envelope correlations (AECs) we quantified the functional connectivity in discrete frequency bands across the whole brain, using the 90-region Automatic Anatomical Labelling atlas (AAL90), as well as quantifying the average oscillatory activity at each region. Analysis of variance in connectivity using a drug-by-time (2x4) design revealed interaction effects, accompanied by main effects of drug and time. Post-hoc permutation testing of each post-drug recording against the respective pre-drug baseline revealed consistent reductions of a bilateral occipital network spanning theta, alpha and beta frequencies, and across 1- 3- and 5- hour recordings following tiagabine, but not placebo. The same analysis applied to the activity of each region also revealed a significant interaction, with post-hoc permutation testing signalling significant reductions in activity in middle occipital regions across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. Crucially, we show that the spatial distribution of both connectivity and activity changes with tiagabine overlaps significantly with template quantitative GABAA maps derived from flumazenil volume-of-distribution (FMZ-VT) PET, clearly demonstrating a mechanistic link between GABA availability, GABAA receptor distribution and low-frequency network oscillations. We therefore propose a utility for functional connectivity and activity measures as receptor-mapping tools in pharmacological imaging.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Deregulated alternative splicing has been implicated in a wide range of pathologies. Deep RNA-sequencing has revealed global mis-splicing signatures in multiple human diseases; however, for neurodegenerative diseases, these analyses are intrinsically hampered by neuronal loss and neuroinflammation in post-mortem brains. To infer splicing alterations relevant to Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis, here we performed intersect-RNA-seq analyses of human post-mortem striatal tissue and of an early symptomatic mouse model in which neuronal loss and gliosis are not yet present. Together with a human/mouse parallel motif scan analysis, this approach allowed us to identify the shared mis-splicing signature triggered by the HD-causing mutation in both species and to infer upstream deregulated splicing factors. Moreover, we identified a plethora of downstream neurodegeneration-linked effector genes, whose aberrant splicing is associated with decreased protein levels in HD patients and mice. In summary, our intersect-RNA-seq approach unveiled the pathogenic contribution of mis-splicing to HD and could be readily applied to other neurodegenerative diseases for which bona fide animal models are available.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The relative contributions of metric and chronological time in the encoding of episodic memories are unknown. One hundred one healthy young adults viewed 48 unique episodes of visual events and were later tested on recall of the order of events (chronological time) and the precise timing of events (metric time). The behavioral results show that metric recall accuracy correlates with chronological accuracy for events within episodes, but does not play a role on larger time-scales across episodes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging during encoding and recall showed that metric time was represented in the posterior medial entorhinal cortex, as well as the temporal pole and the cerebellum, whereas chronological time was represented in a widespread brain network including the anterior lateral entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. We conclude that metric time has a role in episodic memory on short time-scales and is mainly subserved by medial temporal lobe structures.</content>

 Using neuroimaging, we studied influence of family cultural background on processing of an audiobook in human brain. The audiobook depicted life of two young Finnish men, one with the Finnish and the other with the Russian family background. Shared family cultural background enhanced similarity of narrative processing in the brain at prelexical, word, sentence, and narrative levels. Similarity was also enhanced in brain areas supporting imagery. The cultural background was further reflected as semantic differences in word lists by which the subjects described what had been on their minds when they heard the audiobook during neuroimaging. Strength of social identity shaped word, sentence, and narrative level processing in the brain. These effects might enhance mutual understanding between persons who share family cultural background and social identity and, conversely, deteriorate between-group mutual understanding in modern multicultural societies wherein native speakers of a language may assume highly similar understanding.</content>

 Brains are able to integrate memory from the recent past into their current computations, seemingly without effort. This ability is critical for cognitive tasks such as speech understanding or working with sequences of symbols according to dynamically changing rules. But it has remained unknown how networks of spiking neurons in the brain can achieve that. We show that the presence of neurons with spike frequency adaptation makes a significant difference: Their inclusion in a network moves its performance for such computing tasks from a very low level close to the level of human performance. While artificial neural networks with special long short-term memory (LSTM) units had already reached such high performance levels, they lack biological plausibility. We find that neurons with spike-frequency adaptation, which occur especially frequently in higher cortical areas of the human brain, provide to brains a functional equivalent to LSTM units.</content>

 Recognition memory, often compromised in psychiatric disorders, is a major component of declarative memory, which permits the realization that an event, object or social subject has been previously encountered. The CA2 region of the dorsal hippocampus (dCA2) is involved in social memory and responds to novel objects, in time and space. However, it remains unclear how these neurons encode either social or inanimate object recognition. Here, we show that in dCA2, encoding of social recognition memory entails suppression of pyramidal neurons activity leading to a sparse representation of the familiar conspecific. We discuss the neural coding scheme by which dCA2 pyramidal neurons contribute to social memory.</content>

 Decoding the levels of consciousness from cortical activity recording is a major challenge in neuroscience. Using clustering algorithms, we previously demonstrated that resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) data can be split into several clusters also called &quot;brain states&quot; corresponding to &quot;functional configurations&quot; of the brain. Here, we propose to use a supervised machine learning method based on artificial neural networks to predict functional brain states across levels of consciousness from rsfMRI. Because it is key to consider the topology of brain regions used to build the dynamical functional connectivity matrices describing the brain state at a given time, we applied BrainNetCNN, a graph-convolutional neural network (CNN), to predict the brain states in awake and anesthetized non-human primate rsfMRI data. BrainNetCNN achieved a high prediction accuracy that lies in [0.674, 0.765] depending on the experimental settings. We propose to derive the set of connections found to be important for predicting a brain state, reflecting the level of consciousness. The results demonstrate that deep learning methods can be used not only to predict brain states but also to provide additional insight on cortical signatures of consciousness with potential clinical consequences for the monitoring of anesthesia and the diagnosis of disorders of consciousness.</content>

The microbiome is a new frontier for building predictors of human phenotypes. However, machine learning in the microbiome is fraught with issues of reproducibility, driven in large part by the wide range of analytic models and metagenomic data types available. We aimed to build robust metagenomic predictors of host phenotype by comparing prediction performances and biological interpretation across 8 machine learning methods and 4 different types of metagenomic data. Using 1,570 samples from 300 infants, we fit 7,865 models for 6 host phenotypes. We demonstrate the dependence of accuracy on algorithm choice and feature definition in microbiome data and propose a framework for building microbiome-derived indicators of host phenotype. We additionally identify biological features predictive of age, sex, breastfeeding status, historical antibiotic usage, country of origin, and delivery type.

Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy–either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/M4Jh9Js-NLQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Multiscale Entropy (MSE) is used to characterize the temporal irregularity of neural time series patterns. Due to its’ presumed sensitivity to non-linear signal characteristics, MSE is typically considered a complementary measure of brain dynamics to signal variance and spectral power. However, the divergence between these measures is often unclear in application. Furthermore, it is commonly assumed (yet sparingly verified) that entropy estimated at specific time scales reflects signal irregularity at those precise time scales of brain function. We argue that such assumptions are not tenable. Using simulated and empirical electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 47 younger and 52 older adults, we indicate strong and previously underappreciated associations between MSE and spectral power, and highlight how these links preclude traditional interpretations of MSE time scales. Specifically, we show that the typical definition of temporal patterns via “similarity bounds” biases coarse MSE scales–that are thought to reflect slow dynamics–by high-frequency dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that entropy at fine time scales–presumed to indicate fast dynamics–is highly sensitive to broadband spectral power, a measure dominated by low-frequency contributions. Jointly, these issues produce counterintuitive reflections of frequency-specific content on MSE time scales. We emphasize the resulting inferential problems in a conceptual replication of cross-sectional age differences at rest, in which scale-specific entropy age effects could be explained by spectral power differences at mismatched temporal scales. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such problems may be alleviated, resulting in the indication of scale-specific age differences in rhythmic irregularity. By controlling for narrowband contributions, we indicate that spontaneous alpha rhythms during eyes open rest transiently reduce broadband signal irregularity. Finally, we recommend best practices that may better permit a valid estimation and interpretation of neural signal irregularity at time scales of interest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gzt1qa0Qd-8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The hopes of precision medicine rely on our capacity to measure various high-throughput genomic information of a patient and to integrate them for personalized diagnosis and adapted treatment. Reaching these ambitious objectives will require the development of efficient tools for the detection of molecular defects at the individual level. Here, we propose a novel method, PenDA, to perform Personalized Differential Analysis at the scale of a single sample. PenDA is based on the local ordering of gene expressions within individual cases and infers the deregulation status of genes in a sample of interest compared to a reference dataset. Based on realistic simulations of RNA-seq data of tumors, we showed that PenDA outcompetes existing approaches with very high specificity and sensitivity and is robust to normalization effects. Applying the method to lung cancer cohorts, we observed that deregulated genes in tumors exhibit a cancer-type-specific commitment towards up- or down-regulation. Based on the individual information of deregulation given by PenDA, we were able to define two new molecular histologies for lung adenocarcinoma cancers strongly correlated to survival. In particular, we identified 37 biomarkers whose up-regulation lead to bad prognosis and that we validated on two independent cohorts. PenDA provides a robust, generic tool to extract personalized deregulation patterns that can then be used for the discovery of therapeutic targets and for personalized diagnosis. An open-access, user-friendly R package is available at https://github.com/bcm-uga/penda.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JD2Xxse9oQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Biological networks are often heterogeneous in their connectivity pattern, with degree distributions featuring a heavy tail of highly connected hubs. The implications of this heterogeneity on dynamical properties are a topic of much interest. Here we show that interpreting topology as a feedback circuit can provide novel insights on dynamics. Based on the observation that in finite networks a small number of hubs have a disproportionate effect on the entire system, we construct an approximation by lumping these nodes into a single effective hub, which acts as a feedback loop with the rest of the nodes. We use this approximation to study dynamics of networks with scale-free degree distributions, focusing on their probability of convergence to fixed points. We find that the approximation preserves convergence statistics over a wide range of settings. Our mapping provides a parametrization of scale free topology which is predictive at the ensemble level and also retains properties of individual realizations. Specifically, outgoing hubs have an organizing role that can drive the network to convergence, in analogy to suppression of chaos by an external drive. In contrast, incoming hubs have no such property, resulting in a marked difference between the behavior of networks with outgoing vs. incoming scale free degree distribution. Combining feedback analysis with mean field theory predicts a transition between convergent and divergent dynamics which is corroborated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, they highlight the effect of a handful of outlying hubs, rather than of the connectivity distribution law as a whole, on network dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KxHqjuTd_Lk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Cellular transplantation is in clinical testing for a number of central nervous system disorders, including spinal cord injury (SCI). One challenge is acute transplanted cell death. To prevent this death, there is a need to both establish when the death occurs and develop approaches to mitigate its effects. Here, using luciferase (luc) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing Schwann cell (SC) transplants in the contused thoracic rat spinal cord 7 d postinjury, we establish via &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; bioluminescent (IVIS) imaging and stereology that cell death occurs prior to 2–3 d postimplantation. We then test an alternative approach to the current paradigm of enhancing transplant survival by including multiple factors along with the cells. To stimulate multiple cellular adaptive pathways concurrently, we activate the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) transcriptional pathway. Retroviral expression of VP16-HIF-1α in SCs increased HIF-α by 5.9-fold and its target genes implicated in oxygen transport and delivery (VEGF, 2.2-fold) and cellular metabolism (enolase, 1.7-fold). In cell death assays &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, HIF-1α protected cells from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative damage. It also provided some protection against camptothecin-induced DNA damage, but not thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress or tunicamycin-induced unfolded protein response. Following transplantation, VP16-HIF-1α increased SC survival by 34.3%. The increase in cell survival was detectable by stereology, but not by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; luciferase or &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; GFP IVIS imaging. The results support the hypothesis that activating adaptive cellular pathways enhances transplant survival and identifies an alternative pro-survival approach that, with optimization, could be amenable to clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A software tool for synchronization of video with signals would be of broad general use to behavioral neuroscientists. A new program, called &lt;i&gt;neurotic&lt;/i&gt; (NEUROscience Tool for Interactive Characterization), allows users to review and annotate signal data synchronized with video, performs simple initial analyses including signal filtering and spike detection, is easy to use, and supports a variety of file formats. The program also facilitates collaborations by using a portable specification for loading and processing data and retrieving data files from online sources. Two examples are shown in which the software is used to explore experimental datasets with extracellular nerve or muscle recordings and simultaneous video of behavior. The configuration specification for controlling how data are located, loaded, processed, and plotted is also summarized. Algorithms for spike detection and burst detection are demonstrated. This new program could be used in many applications in which behavior and signals need to be analyzed together.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans have a large capacity of recognition memory (Dudai, 1997), a fundamental property of higher-order brain functions such as abstraction and generalization (Vogt and Magnussen, 2007). Familiarity is the first step towards recognition memory. We have previously demonstrated using unsupervised neural network simulations that familiarity detection of complex patterns emerges in generic cortical microcircuits with bidirectional synaptic plasticity. It is therefore meaningful to conduct similar experiments on biological neuronal networks to validate these results. Studies of learning and memory in dissociated rodent neuronal cultures remain inconclusive to date. Synchronized network bursts (SNBs) that occur spontaneously and periodically have been speculated to be an intervening factor. By optogenetically stimulating cultured cortical networks with random dot movies (RDMs), we were able to reduce the occurrence of SNBs, after which an ability for familiarity detection emerged: previously seen patterns elicited higher firing rates than novel ones. Differences in firing rate were distributed over the entire network, suggesting that familiarity detection is a system level property. We also studied the change in SNB patterns following familiarity encoding. Support vector machine (SVM) classification results indicate that SNBs may be facilitating memory consolidation of the learned pattern. In addition, using a novel network connectivity probing method, we were able to trace the change in synaptic efficacy induced by familiarity encoding, providing insights on the long-term impact of having SNBs in the cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<subtitle type="html">Nature Reviews Neuroscience is the leading review journal in the neurosciences. It publishes articles that review recent progress in brain and nervous system research. Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry. One of the unique features of Nature Reviews Neuroscience is its extraordinary breadth and depth of coverage. This very broad scope – from molecules to mind – captures the essence of modern neuroscience, and allows the journal to attract readers from all areas of this ever-expanding discipline.</subtitle>

 &lt;p&gt;Genes that establish the circadian clock have differential expression with respect to solar time in central and peripheral tissues. Here, we find circadian-time-induced differential expression in a large number of genes not associated with circadian rhythms in two brain regions lacking overt circadian function: the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). These regions primarily engage in autonomic, homeostatic, and emotional regulation. However, we find striking diurnal shifts in gene expression in these regions of male Sprague Dawley rats with no obvious patterns that could be attributed to function or region. These findings have implications for the design of gene expression studies as well as for the potential effects of xenobiotics on these regions that regulate autonomic and emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Significant differences exist in the availability of healthcare worker (HCW) SARS-CoV-2 testing between countries, and existing programmes focus on screening symptomatic rather than asymptomatic staff. Over a 3-week period (April 2020), 1,032 asymptomatic HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2 in a large UK teaching hospital. Symptomatic staff and symptomatic household contacts were additionally tested. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect viral RNA from a throat+nose self-swab. 3% of HCWs in the &lt;i&gt;asymptomatic screening group&lt;/i&gt; tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 17/30 (57%) were truly asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic. 12/30 (40%) had experienced symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) &amp;gt;7 days prior to testing, most self-isolating, returning well. Clusters of HCW infection were discovered on two independent wards. Viral genome sequencing showed that the majority of HCWs had the dominant lineage B∙1. Our data demonstrates the utility of comprehensive screening of HCWs with minimal or no symptoms. This approach will be critical for protecting patients and hospital staff.</content>

 How circuit wiring is specified is a key question in developmental neurobiology. Previously, using the Drosophila motor system as a model, we found the classic temporal transcription factor, Hunchback acts in NB7-1 neuronal stem cells to control how many NB7-1 neuronal progeny form functional synapses on dorsal muscles (Meng et al., 2019). However, it is unknown to what extent control of motor neuron-to-muscle synaptic partnerships is a general feature of temporal transcription factors. Here, we perform additional temporal transcription factor manipulations—prolonging expression of Hunchback in NB3-1, as well as precociously expressing Pdm and Castor in NB7-1. We use confocal microscopy, calcium imaging, and electrophysiology to show that in every manipulation there are permanent alterations in neuromuscular synaptic partnerships. Our data show temporal transcription factors, as a group of molecules, are potent determinants of synaptic partner choice and therefore ultimately control circuit membership.</content>

 Endosomes and lysosomes harbor Rab5 and Rab7 on their surface as key proteins involved in their identity, biogenesis, and fusion. Rab activation requires a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which is Mon1-Ccz1 for Rab7. During endosome maturation, Rab5 is replaced by Rab7, though the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the molecular determinants for Rab conversion &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and reconstitute Rab7 activation with yeast and metazoan proteins. We show (i) that Mon1-Ccz1 is an effector of Rab5, (ii) that membrane-bound Rab5 is the key factor to directly promote Mon1-Ccz1 dependent Rab7 activation and Rab7-dependent membrane fusion, and (iii) that this process is regulated in yeast by the casein kinase Yck3, which phosphorylates Mon1 and blocks Rab5 binding. Our study thus uncovers the minimal feed-forward machinery of the endosomal Rab cascade and a novel regulatory mechanism controlling this pathway.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Cell migration entails networks and bundles of actin filaments termed lamellipodia and microspikes or filopodia, respectively, as well as focal adhesions, all of which recruit Ena/VASP family members hitherto thought to antagonize efficient cell motility. However, we find these proteins to act as positive regulators of migration in different murine cell lines. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of Ena/VASP proteins reduced lamellipodial actin assembly and perturbed lamellipodial architecture, as evidenced by changed network geometry as well as reduction of filament length and number that was accompanied by abnormal Arp2/3 complex and heterodimeric capping protein accumulation. Loss of Ena/VASP function also abolished the formation of microspikes normally embedded in lamellipodia, but not of filopodia capable of emanating without lamellipodia. Ena/VASP-deficiency also impaired integrin-mediated adhesion accompanied by reduced traction forces exerted through these structures. Our data thus uncover novel Ena/VASP functions of these actin polymerases that are fully consistent with their promotion of cell migration.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Vesicle fusion is mediated by assembly of SNARE proteins between opposing membranes. While previous work suggested an active role of SNARE transmembrane domains (TMDs) in promoting membrane merger (Dhara et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism remained elusive. Here, we show that naturally-occurring v-SNARE TMD variants differentially regulate fusion pore dynamics in mouse chromaffin cells, indicating TMD flexibility as a mechanistic determinant that facilitates transmitter release from differentially-sized vesicles. Membrane curvature-promoting phospholipids like lysophosphatidylcholine or oleic acid profoundly alter pore expansion and fully rescue the decelerated fusion kinetics of TMD-rigidifying VAMP2 mutants. Thus, v-SNARE TMDs and phospholipids cooperate in supporting membrane curvature at the fusion pore neck. Oppositely, slowing of pore kinetics by the SNARE-regulator complexin-2 withstands the curvature-driven speeding of fusion, indicating that pore evolution is tightly coupled to progressive SNARE complex formation. Collectively, TMD-mediated support of membrane curvature and SNARE force-generated membrane bending promote fusion pore formation and expansion.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Proximity biotinylation based on &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; BirA enzymes like BioID (BirA*) and TurboID is a key technology for identifying proteins interacting with a target protein in a cell or organism. However, there have been some improvements in the enzymes for that purpose. Here, we demonstrate a novel BirA enzyme, AirID (ancestral BirA for proximity-dependent biotin identification), which was designed &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; using an ancestral enzyme reconstruction algorithm and metagenome data. AirID-fusion proteins like AirID-p53 or AirID-IκBα indicated biotinylation of MDM2 or RelA, respectively, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in cells, respectively. AirID-CRBN showed the pomalidomide-dependent biotinylation of IKZF1 and SALL4 &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. AirID-IκBα biotinylated the endogenous CUL4 and RBX1 in the CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt; complex based on the streptavidin pull-down assay. LC-MS/MS analysis of cells stably expressing AirID-IκBα showed top-level biotinylation of RelA proteins. These results indicate that AirID is a novel enzyme for analysing protein–protein interactions.</content>

 Weight loss and anorexia are common symptoms in cancer patients that occur prior to initiation of cancer therapy. Inflammation in the brain is a driver of these symptoms, yet cellular sources of neuroinflammation during malignancy are unknown. In a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we observed early and robust myeloid cell infiltration into the brain. Infiltrating immune cells were predominately neutrophils, which accumulated at a unique central nervous system entry portal called the velum interpositum, where they expressed CCR2. Pharmacologic CCR2 blockade and genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ccr2&lt;/i&gt; both resulted in significantly decreased brain-infiltrating myeloid cells as well as attenuated cachexia during PDAC. Lastly, intracerebroventricular blockade of the purinergic receptor P2RX7 during PDAC abolished immune cell recruitment to the brain and attenuated anorexia. Our data demonstrate a novel function for the CCR2/CCL2 axis in recruiting neutrophils to the brain, which drives anorexia and muscle catabolism.</content>

 During dynamic instability, self-assembling microtubules (MTs) stochastically alternate between phases of growth and shrinkage. This process is driven by the presence of two distinct states of MT subunits, GTP- and GDP-bound tubulin dimers, that have different structural properties. Here, we use a combination of analysis and computer simulations to study the mechanical and kinetic regulation of dynamic instability in three-dimensional (3D) self-assembling MTs. Our model quantifies how the 3D structure and kinetics of the distinct states of tubulin dimers determine the mechanical stability of MTs. We further show that dynamic instability is influenced by the presence of quenched disorder in the state of the tubulin subunit as reflected in the fraction of non-hydrolysed tubulin. Our results connect the 3D geometry, kinetics and statistical mechanics of these tubular assemblies within a single framework, and may be applicable to other self-assembled systems where these same processes are at play.</content>

 Herpesviruses acquire their membrane envelopes in the cytoplasm of infected cells via a molecular mechanism that remains unclear. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 proteins pUL7 and pUL51 form a complex required for efficient virus envelopment. We show that interaction between homologues of pUL7 and pUL51 is conserved across human herpesviruses, as is their association with &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi membranes. We characterized the HSV-1 pUL7:pUL51 complex by solution scattering and chemical crosslinking, revealing a 1:2 complex that can form higher-order oligomers in solution, and we solved the crystal structure of the core pUL7:pUL51 heterodimer. While pUL7 adopts a previously-unseen compact fold, the helix-turn-helix conformation of pUL51 resembles the cellular endosomal complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III component CHMP4B and pUL51 forms ESCRT-III–like filaments, suggesting a direct role for pUL51 in promoting membrane scission during virus assembly. Our results provide a structural framework for understanding the role of the conserved pUL7:pUL51 complex in herpesvirus assembly.</content>

 Exercise has been shown to benefit brain structure and function, particularly in aging populations. However, the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its effects, especially in humans, are not fully understood. This review argues that one reason for this knowledge gap is that exercise likely operates through multiple levels of mechanisms. Furthermore, the mechanisms of exercise may vary depending on factors such as age and health state. We discuss the state of evidence at each of three levels of analysis (molecular/cellular, brain structure/function, and mental states and higher-order behaviors) and highlight consistencies across these levels, inconsistencies within them, and knowledge gaps.</content>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucine rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are synaptic adhesion molecules with roles in synapse formation and signaling. LRRTM4 transcripts were previously shown to be enriched in rod bipolar cells (BCs), secondary neurons of the retina that form synapses with rod photoreceptors. Using two different antibodies, LRRTM4 was found to reside primarily at rod BC dendritic tips, where it colocalized with the transduction channel protein, TRPM1. LRRTM4 was not detected at dendritic tips of ON‐cone BCs. Following somatic knockout of LRRTM4 in BCs by subretinal injection and electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9, LRRTM4 was abolished or reduced in the dendritic tips of transfected cells. Knockout cells had a normal complement of TRPM1 at their dendritic tips, while GPR179 accumulation was partially reduced. In experiments with heterologously expressed protein, the extracellular domain of LRRTM4 was found to engage in heparan‐sulfate dependent binding with pikachurin. These results implicate LRRTM4 in the GPR179‐pikachurin‐dystroglycan transsynaptic complex at rod synapses.&lt;/p&gt;

 Changes in the actin cytoskeleton are a primary mechanism mediating the morphological and functional plasticity that underlies learning and memory. The synaptic RhoGEFs Kalirin and Trio have emerged as central regulators of actin dynamics at the synapse. The increased attention surrounding Kalirin and Trio stems from the growing evidence for their roles in the etiology of a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we discuss recent findings revealing the unique and diverse functions of these paralog proteins in neurodevelopment, excitatory synaptic transmission, and plasticity.</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are severe human disorders resulting from abnormal glucose metabolism, and all previously described GSDs segregate as autosomal recessive or X‐linked traits. Here we aimed to molecularly characterize the first family with a dominant GSD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a dominant GSD family with 13 affected members presenting with adult‐onset muscle weakness, and we provide clinical, metabolic, histological, and ultrastructural data. We performed exome sequencing to uncover the causative gene, and functional experiments in the cell model and on recombinant proteins to investigate the pathogenic effect of the identified mutation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a heterozygous missense mutation in &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; segregating with the disease in the family. &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; codes for myophosphorylase, the enzyme catalyzing the initial step of glycogen breakdown. Enzymatic tests revealed that the &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; mutation impairs the AMP‐independent myophosphorylase activity, while the AMP‐dependent activity was preserved. Further functional investigations demonstrated an altered conformation and aggregation of mutant myophosphorylase, and the concurrent accumulation of the intermediate filament desmin in the myofibers of the patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study describes the first example of a dominant glycogen storage disease in humans, and elucidates the underlying pathomechanisms by deciphering the sequence of events from the &lt;i&gt;PYGM&lt;/i&gt; mutation to the accumulation of glycogen in the muscle fibers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional connectivity of the hippocampus with its primary cortical input, the entorhinal cortex, is organized topographically. In area CA1 of the hippocampus, this leads to different functional gradients along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of spatial/sensory responsivity and spatial resolution respectively. CA1 ripples, a network phenomenon, allow us to test whether the hippocampal neural network shows corresponding gradients in functional connectivity along the two axes. We studied the occurrence and propagation of ripples across the entire proximodistal axis along with a comparable spatial range of the septotemporal axis of dorsal CA1. We observed that ripples could occur at any location, and their amplitudes were independent of the tetrode location along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes. When a ripple was detected on a particular tetrode (“reference tetrode”), however, the probability of cooccurrence of ripples and ripple amplitude observed on the other tetrodes decreased as a function of distance from the reference tetrode. This reduction was greater along the proximodistal axis than the septotemporal axis. Furthermore, we found that ripples propagate primarily along the proximodistal axis. Thus, over a spatial scale of ∼1.5 mm, the network is anisotropic along the two axes, complementing the topographically organized cortico‐hippocampal connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Light is one of the factors that can play a role in bacterial infiltration into leafy greens by keeping stomata open and providing photosynthetic products for microorganisms. We model chemotactic transport of bacteria within a leaf tissue in response to photosynthesis occurring within plant mesophyll. The model includes transport of carbon dioxide, oxygen, bicarbonate, sucrose/glucose, bacteria, and autoinducer-2 within the leaf tissue. Biological processes of carbon fixation in chloroplasts, and respiration in mitochondria of the plant cells, as well as motility, chemotaxis, nutrient consumption and communication in the bacterial community are considered. We show that presence of light is enough to boost bacterial chemotaxis through the stomatal opening and toward photosynthetic products within the leaf tissue. Bacterial chemotactic ability is a major player in infiltration, and plant stomatal defense in closing the stomata as a perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns is an effective way to inhibit the infiltration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TYKo3FA9LpI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Non-random connectivity can emerge without structured external input driven by activity-dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity based on precise spiking patterns. Here we analyze the emergence of global structures in recurrent networks based on a triplet model of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) which depends on the interactions of three precisely-timed spikes and can describe plasticity experiments with varying spike frequency better than the classical pair-based STDP rule. We derive synaptic changes arising from correlations up to third-order and describe them as the sum of structural motifs which determine how any spike in the network influences a given synaptic connection through possible connectivity paths. This motif expansion framework reveals novel structural motifs under the triplet STDP rule, which support the formation of bidirectional connections and ultimately the spontaneous emergence of global network structure in the form of self-connected groups of neurons, or assemblies. We propose that under triplet STDP assembly structure can emerge without the need for externally patterned inputs or assuming a symmetric pair-based STDP rule common in previous studies. The emergence of non-random network structure under triplet STDP occurs through internally-generated higher-order correlations, which are ubiquitous in natural stimuli and neuronal spiking activity, and important for coding. We further demonstrate how neuromodulatory mechanisms that modulate the shape of the triplet STDP rule or the synaptic transmission function differentially promote structural motifs underlying the emergence of assemblies, and quantify the differences using graph theoretic measures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kXUhjNXvt2A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in inhibitory circuits of the primary auditory cortex (pAC) have been shown to be an aspect of aging and age-related hearing loss (AHL). Several studies reported a decline in parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in aged rodent pAC of animals displaying AHL and conclude a relationship between reduced sensitivity and declined PV immunoreactivity. However, it remains elusive whether AHL or a general molecular aging is causative for decreased PV immunoreactivity. In this study, we aimed to disentangle the effects of AHL and general aging on PV immunoreactivity patterns in inhibitory interneurons of mouse pAC. We compared young and old animals of a mouse line with AHL (C57BL/6) and a mutant (C57B6.CAST-&lt;i&gt;Cdh23&lt;sup&gt;Ahl+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) that is not vulnerable to AHL according to their hearing status by measuring auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and by an immunohistochemical evaluation of the PV immunoreactivity patterns in two dimensions (rostro-caudal and layer) in the pAC. Although AHL could be confirmed by ABR measurements for the C57BL/6 mice, both aged strains showed a similar reduction of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; positive interneurons in both, number and density. The pattern of reduction across the rostro-caudal axis and across cortical layers was similar for both aged lines. Our results demonstrate that a reduced PV immunoreactivity is a sign of general, molecular aging and not related to AHL.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;All-to-all homogeneous networks of inhibitory neurons synchronize completely under the right conditions; however, many modeling studies have shown that biological levels of heterogeneity disrupt synchrony. Our fundamental scientific question is &quot;how can neurons maintain partial synchrony in the presence of heterogeneity and noise?&quot; A particular subset of strongly interconnected interneurons, the PV+ fast-spiking (FS) basket neurons, are strongly implicated in  oscillations and in phase locking of nested  oscillations to theta. Their excitability type apparently varies between brain regions: in CA1 and the dentate gyrus they have type 1 excitability, meaning that they can fire arbitrarily slowly, whereas in the striatum and cortex they have type 2 excitability, meaning that there is a frequency thresh old below which they cannot sustain repetitive firing. We constrained the models to study the effect of excitability type (more precisely bifurcation type) in isolation from all other factors. We use sparsely connected, heterogeneous, noisy networks with synaptic delays to show that synchronization properties, namely the resistance to suppression and the strength of theta phase to  amplitude coupling, are strongly dependent on the pairing of excitability type with the type of inhibition. Shunting inhibition performs better for type 1 and hyperpolarizing inhibition for type 2.  Oscillations and their nesting within theta oscillations are thought to subserve cognitive functions like memory encoding and recall; therefore, it is important to understand the contribution of intrinsic properties to these rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurobiological changes that occur with aging include a reduction in function and volume of the hippocampus. These changes were associated with corresponding memory deficits in navigation tasks. However, navigation can involve different strategies that are dependent on the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. The proportion of people using hippocampus‐dependent spatial strategies decreases across the lifespan. As such, the decrease in spatial strategies, and corresponding increase in caudate nucleus‐dependent response strategies with age, may play a role in the observed neurobiological changes in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we previously showed a negative correlation between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus/striatum in mice, young adults, and in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. As such, we hypothesized that this negative relationship between the two structures would be present during normal aging. The aim of the current study was to investigate this gap in the literature by studying the relationship between grey matter in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus of the striatum, in relation to each other and to navigation strategies, during healthy aging. Healthy older adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 39) were tested on the Concurrent Spatial Discrimination Learning Task (CSDLT), a virtual radial task that dissociates between spatial and response strategies. A regression of strategies against structural MRIs showed for the first time in older adults that the response strategy was associated with higher amounts of grey matter in the caudate nucleus. As expected, the spatial strategy correlated with grey matter in the hippocampus, which was negatively correlated with grey matter in the caudate nucleus. Interestingly, a sex difference emerged showing that among older adult response learners, women have the least amount of grey matter in the hippocampus, which is a known risk for Alzheimer's disease. This difference was absent among spatial learners. These results are discussed in the context of the putative protective role of spatial memory against grey matter loss in the hippocampus, especially in women.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A major concern during the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) pandemic&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the use of immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) due to an increased risk of contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 and more severe disease. The Society of Italian Neurologists (SIN) and the Association of British Neurologists (ABN) MS and Neuroimmunology Advisory Group published guidance for the use of current disease modifying treatments (DMTs) in MS (Table 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, taking into account, less conservative viewpoints&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the emerging knowledge of the biology of SARS‐CoV‐2, and in particular the role of the immune mechanisms contributing to the disease, we propose modification of these guidelines since it is not clear that immunosuppression is indeed detrimental in people with MS infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. We are thus proposing a more nuanced approach and that the categories of DMTs should be modified based on scientific principles and the biology of severe COVID‐19 (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

			<subtitle type="html">Nature Reviews Neuroscience is the leading review journal in the neurosciences. It publishes articles that review recent progress in brain and nervous system research. Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry. One of the unique features of Nature Reviews Neuroscience is its extraordinary breadth and depth of coverage. This very broad scope – from molecules to mind – captures the essence of modern neuroscience, and allows the journal to attract readers from all areas of this ever-expanding discipline.</subtitle>

 &lt;p&gt;In this review article, we highlight several disparate ideas that are linked to changes in brain state (i.e., sleep to arousal, Down to Up, synchronized to de-synchronized). In any discussion of the brain state, we propose that the cortical pyramidal neuron has a central position. EEG recordings, which typically assess brain state, predominantly reflect the activity of cortical pyramidal neurons. This means that the dominant rhythmic activity that characterizes a particular brain state ultimately has to manifest globally across the pyramidal neuron population. During state transitions, it is the long-range connectivity of these neurons that broadcast the resultant changes in activity to many subcortical targets. Structures like the thalamus, brainstem/hypothalamic neuromodulatory systems, and respiratory systems can also strongly influence brain state, and for many decades we have been uncovering bidirectional pathways that link these structures to state changes in the cerebral cortex. More recently, movement and active behaviors have emerged as powerful drivers of state changes. Each of these systems involve different circuits distributed across the brain. Yet, for a system-wide change in brain state, there must be a collaboration between these circuits that reflects and perhaps triggers the transition between brain states. As we expand our understanding of how brain state changes, our current challenge is to understand how these diverse sets of circuits and pathways interact to produce the changes observed in cortical pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the course of a day, brain states fluctuate, from conscious awake information-acquiring states to sleep states, during which previously acquired information is further processed and stored as memories. One hypothesis is that memories are consolidated and stored during “offline” states such as sleep, a process thought to involve transfer of information from the hippocampus to other cortical areas. Up and Down states (UDS), patterns of activity that occur under anesthesia and sleep states, are likely to play a role in this process, although the nature of this role remains unclear. Here we review what is currently known about these mechanisms in three anatomically distinct but interconnected cortical areas: somatosensory cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampus. In doing so, we consider the role of this activity in the coordination of “replay” during sleep states, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. We conclude that understanding the generation and propagation of UDS may provide key insights into the cortico-hippocampal dialogue linking archi- and neocortical areas during memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) is associated with pain in the joint (temporomandibular joint, TMJ) and muscles involved in mastication. TMD pain dissipates following menopause but returns in some women undergoing estrogen replacement therapy. Progesterone has both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties, while estrogen’s effects on nociception are variable and highly dependent on both natural hormone fluctuations and estrogen dosage during pharmacological treatments, with high doses increasing pain. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite and positive allosteric modulator of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, also has antinociceptive properties. While progesterone and allopregnanolone are antinociceptive, their effect on estrogen-exacerbated TMD pain has not been determined. We hypothesized that removing the source of endogenous ovarian hormones would reduce inflammatory allodynia in the TMJ of rats and both progesterone and allopregnanolone would attenuate the estrogen-provoked return of allodynia. Baseline mechanical sensitivity was measured in female Sprague–Dawley rats (150–175 g) using the von Frey filament method followed by a unilateral injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the TMJ. Mechanical allodynia was confirmed 24 h later; then rats were ovariectomized or received sham surgery. Two weeks later, allodynia was reassessed and rats received one of the following subcutaneous hormone treatments over 5 days: a daily pharmacological dose of estradiol benzoate (E2; 50 μg/kg), daily E2 and pharmacological to sub-physiological doses of progesterone (P4; 16 mg/kg, 16 μg/kg, or 16 ng/kg), E2 daily and interrupted P4 given every other day, daily P4, or daily vehicle control. A separate group of animals received allopregnanolone (0.16 mg/kg) instead of P4. Allodynia was reassessed 1 h following injections. Here, we report that CFA-evoked mechanical allodynia was attenuated following ovariectomy and daily high E2 treatment triggered the return of allodynia, which was rapidly attenuated when P4 was also administered either daily or every other day. Allopregnanolone treatment, whether daily or every other day, also attenuated estrogen-exacerbated allodynia within 1 h of treatment, but only on the first treatment day. These data indicate that when gonadal hormone levels have diminished, treatment with a lower dose of progesterone may be effective at rapidly reducing the estrogen-evoked recurrence of inflammatory mechanical allodynia in the TMJ.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes exhibit a region-dependent molecular and functional heterogeneity in the CNS. Although cortical astrocytes proliferate robustly during the first postnatal week and become proliferation quiescent, the temporal proliferation dynamics of astrocytes in subcortical regions during postnatal development remain essentially unknown. Whether subcortical astrocytes mature similarly to cortical astrocytes is also unexplored. In this current study, we examined proliferation of subcortical, especially hypothalamic, astrocytes during postnatal development using genetic labeling of astrocytes and pulse-chase EdU labeling of proliferating cells. While a lower number of proliferating astrocytes was found in the hypothalamus compared to cortex during the first postnatal week, astrocyte proliferation is much more active in hypothalamus than in cortex from P15 to P30 in both proliferating astrocyte density and percentage, indicating a persistent and distinct proliferation pattern of astrocytes in hypothalamus. This observation is further confirmed by Ki67 immunostaining with genetically or immunolabeled astrocytes in hypothalamus and cortex during P15–30. In addition, astrocytes in representative subcortical regions have a modest growth of their domain size and exhibit a significantly smaller domain size compared to cortical astrocytes at P30 when astrocytes have generally completed postnatal maturation. However, the expression of astrocyte-derived Sparc, an important synaptogenic inhibitor, is consistently higher in hypothalamic astrocytes than in cortical astrocytes throughout postnatal development. In summary, our study unveiled a distinct proliferation and maturation pattern of subcortical, especially hypothalamic, astrocytes during postnatal development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The primary claim of the Richiardi et al. (2015) Science article is that a measure of correlated gene expression, significant strength fraction (SSF), is related to resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks. However, there is still debate about this claim and whether spatial proximity, in the form of contiguous clusters, accounts entirely, or only partially, for SSF (Pantazatos and Li, 2017; Richiardi et al., 2017). Here, 13 distributed networks were simulated by combining 34 contiguous clusters randomly placed throughout cortex, with resulting edge distance distributions similar to rsfMRI networks. Cluster size was modulated (6–15 mm radius) to test its influence on SSF false positive rate (SSF-FPR) among the simulated “noise” networks. The contribution of rsfMRI networks on SSF-FPR was examined by comparing simulated networks whose clusters were sampled from: (1) all 1,777 cortical tissue samples, (2) all samples, but with non-rsfMRI cluster centers, and (3) only 1,276 non-rsfMRI samples. Results show that SSF-FPR is influenced only by cluster size (r &amp;gt; 0.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001), not by rsfMRI samples. Simulations using 14 mm radius clusters most resembled rsfMRI networks. When thresholding at p &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;, the SSF-FPR was 0.47. Genes that maximize SF have high global spatial autocorrelation. In conclusion, SSF is unrelated to rsfMRI networks. The main conclusion of Richiardi et al. (2015) is based on a finding that is ∼50% likely to be a false positive, not &amp;lt;0.01% as originally reported in the article (Richiardi et al., 2015). We discuss why distance corrections alone and external face validity are insufficient to establish a trustworthy relationship between correlated gene expression measures and rsfMRI networks, and propose more rigorous approaches to preclude common pitfalls in related studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Visual attention-related processes include three functional sub-processes: alerting, orienting, and inhibition. We examined these sub-processes using reaction times, event-related potentials (ERPs), and their neuronal source activations during the Attention Network Test (ANT) in control children, attentional problems (AP) children, and reading difficulties (RD) children. During the ANT, electroencephalography was measured using 128 electrodes on three groups of Finnish sixth-graders aged 12–13 years (control = 77; AP = 15; RD = 23). Participants were asked to detect the direction of a middle target fish within a group of five fish. The target stimulus was either preceded by a cue (center, double, or spatial), or without a cue, to manipulate the alerting and orienting sub-processes of attention. The direction of the target fish was either congruent or incongruent in relation to the flanker fish, thereby manipulating the inhibition sub-processes of attention. Reaction time performance showed no differences between groups in alerting, orienting, and inhibition effects. The group differences in ERPs were only found at the source level. Neuronal source analysis in the AP children revealed a larger alerting effect (double-cued vs. non-cued target stimuli) than control and RD children in the left occipital lobe. Control children showed a smaller orienting effect (spatially cued vs. center-cued target stimuli) in the left occipital lobe than AP and RD children. No group differences were found for the neuronal sources related to the inhibition effect. The neuronal activity differences related to sub-processes of attention in the AP and RD groups suggest different underlying mechanisms for attentional and reading problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the advent of intelligent robotic tools for physically assisting humans, user experience, and intuitiveness in particular have become important features for control designs. However, existing works predominantly focus on performance-related measures for evaluating control systems as the subjective experience of a user by large cannot be directly observed. In this study, we therefore focus on agency-related interactions between control and embodiment in the context of physical human-machine interaction. By applying an intentional binding paradigm in a virtual, machine-assisted reaching task, we evaluate how the sense of agency of able-bodied humans is modulated by assistive force characteristics of a physically coupled device. In addition to measuring how assistive force profiles influence the sense of agency with intentional binding, we analyzed the sense of agency using a questionnaire. Remarkably, our participants reported to experience stronger agency when being appropriately assisted, although they contributed less to the control task. This is substantiated by the overall consistency of intentional binding results and the self-reported sense of agency. Our results confirm the fundamental feasibility of the sense of agency to objectively evaluate the quality of human-in-the-loop control for assistive technologies. While the underlying mechanisms causing the perceptual bias observed in the intentional binding paradigm are still to be understood, we believe that this study distinctly contributes to demonstrating how the sense of agency characterizes intuitiveness of assistance in physical human-machine interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The exponential time differencing (ETD) method allows using a large time step to efficiently evolve stiff systems such as Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neural networks. For pulse-coupled HH networks, the synaptic spike times cannot be predetermined and are convoluted with neuron's trajectory itself. This presents a challenging issue for the design of an efficient numerical simulation algorithm. The stiffness in the HH equations are quite different, for example, between the spike and non-spike regions. Here, we design a second-order adaptive exponential time differencing algorithm (AETD2) for the numerical evolution of HH neural networks. Compared with the regular second-order Runge-Kutta method (RK2), our AETD2 method can use time steps one order of magnitude larger and improve computational efficiency more than ten times while excellently capturing accurate traces of membrane potentials of HH neurons. This high accuracy and efficiency can be robustly obtained and do not depend on the dynamical regimes, connectivity structure or the network size.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Linking neural circuitry to behavior by mapping active neurons in vivo is a challenge. Both genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and intermediate early genes (IEGs) have been used to pinpoint active neurons during a stimulus or behavior but have drawbacks such as limiting the movement of the organism, requiring a priori knowledge of the active region or having poor temporal resolution. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) was engineered to overcome these spatial-temporal challenges. CaMPARI is a photoconvertible protein that only converts from green to red fluorescence in the presence of high calcium concentration and 405 nm light. This allows the experimenter to precisely mark active neurons within defined temporal windows. The photoconversion can then be quantified by taking the ratio of the red fluorescence to the green. CaMPARI promises the ability to trace active neurons during a specific stimulus; however, CaMPARI’s uses in adult Drosophila have been limited to photoconversion during fly immobilization. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows photoconversion of multiple freely-moving intact adult flies during a stimulus. Flies were placed in a dish with filter paper wet with acetic acid (pH = 2) or neutralized acetic acid (pH = 7) and exposed to photoconvertible light (60 mW) for 30 min (500 ms on, 200 ms off). Immediately following photoconversion, whole flies were fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy. The red:green ratio was quantified for the DC4 glomerulus, a bundle of neurons expressing Ir64a, an ionotropic receptor that senses acids in the Drosophila antennal lobe. Flies exposed to acetic acid showed 1.3-fold greater photoconversion than flies exposed to neutralized acetic acid. This finding was recapitulated using a more physiological stimulus of apple cider vinegar. These results indicate that CaMPARI can be used to label neurons in intact, freely-moving adult flies and will be useful for identifying the circuitry underlying complex behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;mTORopathies are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders characterized by malformations of cortical development (MCD), enhanced cellular mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and epilepsy that results from mutations in mTOR pathway regulatory genes. Homozygous mutations (del exon 9–13) in the pseudokinase STE20-related kinase adaptor alpha (STRAD-α; STRADA), an mTOR modulator, are associated with Pretzel Syndrome (PS), a neurodevelopmental disorder within the Old Order Mennonite Community characterized by megalencephaly, intellectual disability, and intractable epilepsy. To study the cellular mechanisms of STRADA loss, we generated CRISPR-edited Strada mouse N2a cells, a germline mouse Strada knockout (KO−/−) strain, and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from PS individuals harboring the STRADA founder mutation. Strada KO in vitro leads to enhanced mTOR signaling and iPSC-derived neurons from PS individuals exhibit enhanced cell size and mTOR signaling activation, as well as subtle alterations in electrical firing properties e.g., increased input resistance, a more depolarized resting membrane potential, and decreased threshold for action potential (AP) generation. Strada−/− mice exhibit high rates of perinatal mortality and out of more than 100 litters yielding both WT and heterozygous pups, only eight Strada−/− animals survived past P5. Strada−/− mice are hypotonic and tremulous. Histopathological examination (n = 5 mice) revealed normal gross brain organization and lamination but all had ventriculomegaly. Ectopic neurons were seen in all five Strada−/− brains within the subcortical white matter mirroring what is observed in human PS brain tissue. These distinct experimental platforms demonstrate that STRADA modulates mTOR signaling and is a key regulator of cell size, neuronal excitability, and cortical lamination.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain organoids are stem cell-based self-assembling 3D structures that recapitulate early events of human brain development. Recent improvements with patient-specific 3D brain organoids have begun to elucidate unprecedented details of the defective mechanisms that cause neurodevelopmental disorders of congenital and acquired microcephaly. In particular, brain organoids derived from primary microcephaly patients have uncovered mechanisms that deregulate neural stem cell proliferation, maintenance, and differentiation. Not only did brain organoids reveal unknown aspects of neurogenesis but also have illuminated surprising roles of cellular structures of centrosomes and primary cilia in regulating neurogenesis during brain development. Here, we discuss how brain organoids have started contributing to decoding the complexities of microcephaly, which are unlikely to be identified in the existing non-human models. Finally, we discuss the yet unresolved questions and challenges that can be addressed with the use of brain organoids as in vitro models of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The risk of breast cancer increases with age, with the majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer being postmenopausal. It has been estimated that 25–75% of women with breast cancer experience changes in cognitive function (CF) related to disease and treatment, which compromises psychological well-being, decision making, ability to perform daily activities, and adherence to cancer therapy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that underlie neurocognitive changes in women with breast cancer remain poorly understood, which in turn limits the development of effective treatments and prevention strategies. Exercise has great potential as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to mitigate the decline in CF in women with breast cancer. Evidence suggests that DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism for gene regulation, impacts CF and brain health (BH), that exercise influences DNA methylation, and that exercise impacts CF and BH. Although investigating DNA methylation has the potential to uncover the biologic foundations for understanding neurocognitive changes within the context of breast cancer and its treatment as well as the ability to understand how exercise mitigates these changes, there is a dearth of research on this topic. The purpose of this review article is to compile the research in these areas and to recommend potential areas of opportunity for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affect a high proportion of the elderly population with an increasing prevalence. Sleep disturbances are frequent in those with MCI and AD. This review summarizes existing research on sleep disturbances and neuroinflammation in MCI and AD. Although strong evidence supports various pathways linking sleep and AD pathology, the temporal direction of this central relationship is not yet known. Improved understanding of sleep disturbance and neuroinflammation in MCI and AD may aid in the identification of targets for their prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Microbes are capable of physiologically adapting to diverse environmental conditions by differentially varying the rates at which they uptake different nutrients. In particular, microbes can switch hierarchically between different energy sources, consuming first those that ensure the highest growth rate. Experimentally, this can result in bi-phasic growth curves called “diauxic shifts” that typically arise when microbes are grown in media containing several nutrients. Despite these observations are well-known in microbiology and molecular biology, the mathematical models generally used to describe the population dynamics of microbial communities do not account for dynamic metabolic adaptation, thus implicitly assuming that microbes cannot switch dynamically from one resource to another. Here, we introduce dynamic metabolic adaptation in the framework of consumer-resource models, which are commonly used to describe competitive microbial communities, allowing each species to temporally change its preferred energy source to maximize its own relative fitness. We show that dynamic metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing several species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment, thus showing that dynamic metabolic adaptation could be an important mechanism for maintaining high levels of diversity even in environments with few energy sources. We show that introducing dynamic metabolic strategies in consumer-resource models is necessary for reproducing experimental growth curves of the baker’s yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; growing in the presence of two carbon sources. Even though diauxic shifts emerge naturally from the model when two resources are qualitatively very different, the model predicts that the existence of such shifts is not a prerequisite for species coexistence in competitive communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XmDLglyfd1Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Modern recording methods enable sampling of thousands of neurons during the performance of behavioral tasks, raising the question of how recorded activity relates to theoretical models. In the context of decision making, functional connectivity between choice-selective cortical neurons was recently reported. The straightforward interpretation of these data suggests the existence of selective pools of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Computationally investigating an alternative mechanism for these experimental observations, we find that a randomly connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons generates single-cell selectivity, patterns of pairwise correlations, and the same ability of excitatory and inhibitory populations to predict choice, as in experimental observations. Further, we predict that, for this task, there are no anatomically defined subpopulations of neurons representing choice, and that choice preference of a particular neuron changes with the details of the task. We suggest that distributed stimulus selectivity and functional organization in population codes could be emergent properties of randomly connected networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TXO2XX1UZlM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Single nucleotide polymorphisms are widely associated with disease, but the ways in which they cause altered phenotypes are often unclear, especially when they appear in non-coding regions. One way in which non-coding polymorphisms could cause disease is by affecting crucial RNA-protein interactions. While it is clear that changing a protein binding motif will alter protein binding, it has been shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms can affect RNA secondary structure, and here we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms can affect RNA-protein interactions from outside binding motifs through altered RNA secondary structure. By using a modified version of the Vienna Package and PAR-CLIP data for HuR (ELAVL1) in humans we characterize the genome-wide effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms on HuR binding and show that they can have a many-fold effect on the affinity of HuR binding to RNA transcripts from tens of bases away. We also find some evidence that the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms on protein binding might be under selection, with the non-reference alleles tending to make it harder for a protein to bind.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7KPWm87FGE4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Author summary: Postdocs are a critical transition for early-career researchers. This transient period, between finishing a PhD and finding a permanent position, is when early-career researchers develop independent research programs and establish collaborative relationships that can make a successful career. Traditionally, postdocs physically relocate—sometimes multiple times—for these short-term appointments, which creates challenges that can disproportionately affect members of traditionally underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, many research activities involving analytical and quantitative work do not require a physical presence in a lab and can be accomplished remotely. Other fields have embraced remote work, yet many academics have been hesitant to hire remote postdocs. In this article, we present advice to both principal investigators (PIs) and postdocs for successfully navigating a remote position. Using the combined experience of the authors (as either remote postdocs or employers of remote postdocs), we provide a road map to overcome the real (and perceived) obstacles associated with remote work. With planning, communication, and creativity, remote postdocs can be a fully functioning and productive member of a research lab. Further, our rules can be useful for research labs generally and can help foster a more flexible and inclusive environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y6RvQlKqVc8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The current academic culture facing women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in the United States has sparked the formation of grassroots advocacy groups to empower female scientists in training. However, the impact of these initiatives often goes unmeasured and underappreciated. Our Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) organization serves postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and research technicians (trainees) at a private research institute for biological sciences. Here we propose the following guidelines for cultivating a successful women-in-STEM-focused group based upon survey results from our own scientific community as well as the experience of our WiSE group leaders. We hope these recommendations can provide guidance to advocacy groups at other research and academic organizations that wish to strengthen their efforts. Whereas our own group specifically focuses on the underrepresented state of women in science, we hope these guidelines may be adapted and applied to groups that advocate for any minority group within the greater scientific community (i.e., those of gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, etc.).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AvXtUUFG44Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

With increasing demand for training in data science, extracurricular or “ad hoc” education efforts have emerged to help individuals acquire relevant skills and expertise. Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone—including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FGHwcxZsHCE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Modeling cancer cells is essential to better understand the dynamic nature of brain tumors and glioma cells, including their invasion of normal brain. Our goal is to study how the morphology of the glioma cell influences the formation of patterns of collective behavior such as flocks (cells moving in the same direction) or streams (cells moving in opposite direction) referred to as &lt;i&gt;oncostream&lt;/i&gt;. We have observed experimentally that the presence of oncostreams correlates with tumor progression. We propose an original agent-based model that considers each cell as an ellipsoid. We show that stretching cells from round to ellipsoid increases stream formation. A systematic numerical investigation of the model was implemented in R 2. We deduce a phase diagram identifying key regimes for the dynamics (e.g. formation of flocks, streams, scattering). Moreover, we study the effect of cellular density and show that, in contrast to classical models of flocking, increasing cellular density reduces the formation of flocks. We observe similar patterns in R 3 with the noticeable difference that stream formation is more ubiquitous compared to flock formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yjgIFp7h1B0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Path integration is thought to rely on vestibular and proprioceptive cues yet most studies in humans involve primarily visual input, providing limited insight into their respective contributions. We developed a paradigm involving walking in an omnidirectional treadmill in which participants were guided on two sides of a triangle and then found their back way to origin. In Experiment 1, we tested a range of different triangle types while keeping the distance of the unguided side constant to determine the influence of spatial geometry. Participants overshot the angle they needed to turn and undershot the distance they needed to walk, with no consistent effect of triangle type. In Experiment 2, we manipulated distance while keeping angle constant to determine how path integration operated over both shorter and longer distances. Participants underestimated the distance they needed to walk to the origin, with error increasing as a function of the walked distance. To attempt to account for our findings, we developed configural-based computational models involving vector addition, the second of which included terms for the influence of past trials on the current one. We compared against a previously developed configural model of human path integration, the Encoding-Error model. We found that the vector addition models captured the tendency of participants to under-encode guided sides of the triangles and an influence of past trials on current trials. Together, our findings expand our understanding of body-based contributions to human path integration, further suggesting the value of vector addition models in understanding these important components of human navigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IlBS8UmnS-w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Identification of spinal afferent nerve endings in the colonic mucosa and submucosa that communicate directly with the spinal cord: The gut–brain axis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4b559b07-b91b-4f8b-8f07-6ae815eed91d/cne24854-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal afferent nerve endings in the submucosa of mouse distal colon that arise from a single nonpeptidergic spinal afferent neuron whose cell body originated in lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The nerve endings identified from this single sensory neuron were labeled after injection of neuronal tracer into DRG.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major sensory nerve pathway between the colon and central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) that underlies the gut–brain axis, is via spinal afferent neurons, with cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Our aim was to identify the sensory nerve endings in the colon that arise from single colorectal‐projecting DRG neurons. C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized and lumbosacral L6‐S1 DRG injected with dextran biotin. Mice recovered for 7 days. The whole colon was then removed and stained to visualize single axons and nerve endings immunoreactive to calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP). Single axons arising from DRG were identified in the distal colon and their morphological features and CGRP immunoreactivity characterized. After entering the colon, single axons ramified rostrally or caudally along many rows of myenteric ganglia with little circumferential displacement, giving off varicose endings in multiple ganglia. Nerve endings arising from two classes of colorectal‐projecting DRG neuron were identified. One class was peptidergic neurons that had nerve endings in circular muscle, myenteric ganglia, and submucosa. Another class of nonpeptidergic neurons innervated mucosal crypts, myenteric ganglia, and submucosa. Different morphological types of nerve endings which innervate different anatomical layers of colon can arise from the same axon and sensory neuron in DRG. These findings suggest single peptidergic and nonpeptidergic sensory neurons in DRG are potentially capable of detecting sensory stimuli from different anatomical layers of the colon, via different types of nerve endings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Here, we report the morphology of single vestibulocerebellar axons originating from the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) in mice. Three identified groups (red, blue, and green) of axons which projected differently to the vestibular nuclei and to the nodulus (X) and flocculus (Fl) indicated functionally distinct heterogeneous populations of vestibulocerebellar neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant population of neurons in the vestibular nuclei projects to the cerebellum as mossy fibers (MFs) which are involved in the control and adaptation of posture, eye‐head movements, and autonomic function. However, little is known about their axonal projection patterns. We studied the morphology of single axons of medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons as well as those originating from primary afferents, by labeling with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). MVN axons (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 35) were classified into three types based on their major predominant termination patterns. The Cbm‐type terminated only in the cerebellum (15 axons), whereas others terminated in the cerebellum and contralateral vestibular nuclei (cVN/Cbm‐type, 13 axons), or in the cerebellum and ipsilateral vestibular nuclei (iVN/Cbm‐type, 7 axons). Cbm‐ and cVN/Cbm‐types mostly projected to the nodulus and uvula without any clear relationship with longitudinal stripes in these lobules. They were often bilateral, and sometimes sent branches to the flocculus and to other vermal lobules. Also, the iVN/Cbm‐type projected mainly to the ipsilateral nodulus. Neurons of these types of axons showed different distribution within the MVN. The number of MF terminals of some vestibulocerebellar axons, iVN/Cbm‐type axons in particular, and primary afferent axons were much smaller than observed in previously studied MF axons originating from major precerebellar nuclei and the spinal cord. The results demonstrated that a heterogeneous population of MVN neurons provided divergent MF inputs to the cerebellum. The cVN/Cbm‐ and iVN/Cbm‐types indicate that some excitatory neuronal circuits within the vestibular nuclei supply their collaterals to the vestibulocerebellum as MFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The astrocyte network in the ventral nerve cord neuropil of the Drosophila third‐instar larva&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/911271db-26b1-4d82-b1ea-0b7891a52fff/cne24852-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have provided a detailed analysis of astrocyte morphology and territory in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third‐instar ventral nerve cord where there already exists considerable understanding of the neuronal network. Astrocyte shape varies from globular to multi‐arbored; their arbors can extend across segments and into different neuronal domains. Our data are consistent with a model of a developmental growth process dominated by competitive or repulsive interactions between astrocytes, but should also include cell‐autonomous aspects, as well as use of structural features for growth. This study provides the foundation for a robust, functionally oriented connectome needed to understand neuron–glia interactions in this neuropil.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding neuronal function at the local and circuit level requires understanding astrocyte function. We have provided a detailed analysis of astrocyte morphology and territory in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third‐instar ventral nerve cord where there already exists considerable understanding of the neuronal network. Astrocyte shape varies more than previously reported; many have bilaterally symmetrical partners, many have a high percentage of their arborization in adjacent segments, and many have branches that follow structural features. Taken together, our data are consistent with, but not fully explained by, a model of a developmental growth process dominated by competitive or repulsive interactions between astrocytes. Our data suggest that the model should also include cell‐autonomous aspects, as well as the use of structural features for growth. Variation in location of arborization territory for identified astrocytes was great enough that a standardized scheme of neuropil division among the six astrocytes that populate each hemi‐segment is not possible at the third instar. The arborizations of the astrocytes can extend across neuronal functional domains. The ventral astrocyte in particular, whose territory can extend well into the proprioceptive region of the neuropil, has no obvious branching pattern that correlates with domains of particular sensory modalities, suggesting that the astrocyte would respond to neuronal activity in any of the sensory modalities, perhaps integrating across them. This study sets the stage for future studies that will generate a robust, functionally oriented connectome that includes both partners in neuronal circuits—the neurons and the glial cells, providing the foundation necessary for studies to elucidate neuron–glia interactions in this neuropil.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Mild occlusion affects behavior, brain, and eyes morphology. Diffusion‐tensor imaging revealed brain abnormalities in both groups, but only bilateral rats show effects in the optic nerve. Histology revealed for those areas changes in astrocytes, microglia, and number of apoptotic cells. Bilateral occlusion produced a severe damage to both eyes while in unilateral the damage was only in the occluded side.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, carotid stenosis of 70% and above might be the cause of clinical symptoms such as transient ischemic attack and stroke. No clinical or animal studies have evaluated mild carotid occlusion, and few examined unilateral occlusion. Here, Westar rats underwent bilateral or unilateral carotid occlusion of 28–45%. Long‐term effects were evaluated 9–11 months later. We conducted cognitive evaluation using spatial learning in a water maze and exploration behavior in an open field. Morphology of the brain was examined by MRI using diffusion‐tensor imaging (DTI) and immunohistochemistry staining of the brain and eyes. Cognitive deficit was found in spatial memory and exploration behavior in both occluded groups. Brain and eyes histology presented severe damage in the bilateral group, compared to the unilateral one. DTI revealed an increase in mean diffusivity (MD) in the ventral thalamus and a decrease in fractional anisotropy in optic nerve and optic tract in bilateral rats, while unilateral rats showed only an increase in MD in the ventral pons. In those areas, a significant change in astrocytes, microglia, and number of apoptotic cells were found. Bilateral occlusion produced severe damage to both retinas, while unilateral occlusion produced damage mainly in the occluded side. We found that mild carotid stenosis, even in a unilateral occlusion, creates behavioral abnormalities presented by brain and eye histopathology. The results support our hypothesis that gradual formation of mild carotid stenosis along the life course leads to progressive damage that may create different degenerative diseases at a later age.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Expression and distribution of trophoblast glycoprotein in the mouse retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/24d2bc5e-3809-408b-81b2-a71d1b01fa42/cne24850-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG) is a leucine‐rich repeat glycoprotein with an intracellular PDZ‐binding motif that is localized to the dendrites and axon terminals of retinal rod bipolar cells and in the cell body and dendrites of an uncharacterized amacrine cell. Immunofluorescent labeling of TPBG in rod bipolar cells is significantly reduced in the TRPM1 knockout retina, yet total retinal TPBG is constant. This suggests that antibody access may be blocked in certain activity states, possibly by TPBG binding to a PDZ protein in a light‐ or phosphorylation‐dependent manner.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently identified the leucine‐rich repeat (LRR) adhesion protein, trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG), as a novel PKCα‐dependent phosphoprotein in retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Since TPBG has not been thoroughly examined in the retina, this study characterizes the localization and expression patterns of TPBG in the developing and adult mouse retina using two antibodies, one against the N‐terminal LRR domain and the other against the C‐terminal PDZ‐interacting motif. Both antibodies labeled RBC dendrites in the outer plexiform layer and axon terminals in the IPL, as well as a putative amacrine cell with their cell bodies in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and a dense layer in the middle of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). In live transfected HEK293 cells, TPBG was localized to the plasma membrane with the N‐terminal LRR domain facing the extracellular space. TPBG immunofluorescence in RBCs was strongly altered by the loss of TRPM1 in the adult retina, with significantly less dendritic and axon terminal labeling in TRPM1 knockout compared to wild type, despite no change in total TPBG detected by immunoblotting. During retinal development, TPBG expression increases dramatically just prior to eye opening with a time course closely correlated with that of TRPM1 expression. In the retina, LRR proteins have been implicated in the development and maintenance of functional bipolar cell synapses, and TPBG may play a similar role in RBCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Reorganization of longitudinal compartments in the laterally protruding paraflocculus of the postnatal mouse cerebellum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/75da3991-2bd1-4d49-ad7a-b00e4770c44c/cne24849-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paraflocculus (PFl), neighbored by the flocculus (Fl) and copula pyramidis (Cop), forms remarkable protrusion between postnatal Days 1 and 7 (P1, P7) in the mouse cerebellum. The paravermal compartment of &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ Purkinje cells (arrowheads) migrate laterally to become accommodated within the laterally oriented striped compartmentalization in the bulb‐shaped paraflocculus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paraflocculus and the neighboring smaller flocculus form a remarkable protrusion in the ventrolateral aspect of the mouse cerebellum, in which the longitudinal compartments are conspicuously oriented perpendicularly to the sagittal plane. The developmental process of such anatomical arrangements in these lobules has not been fully clarified. Here, we used the genetic tractability of &lt;i&gt;pcdh10‐lacZ&lt;/i&gt; knock‐in (OL‐KO), &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;R1‐nls‐lacZ&lt;/i&gt; transgenic (1NM13) and Gpr26cre‐Ai9‐AldocV mice to track the development of compartments and examined local longitudinal orientation of Purkinje cells within the paraflocculus and flocculus. We observed a distinct &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;‐positive (&lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+) compartment in the flocculus, whereas the paraflocculus and other lobules had a continuous paravermal &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment, in the embryonic OL‐KO cerebellum. During the first postnatal week, the parafloccular &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment shifted laterally to the most lateral edge in the caudal part of the protruding paraflocculus. Although the most medial edge of the parafloccular &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment remained in the nonprotruding part of the paraflocculus, it was disrupted from the originally continuous &lt;i&gt;pcdh10&lt;/i&gt;+ compartment in the copula pyramidis. The local longitudinal orientation changed gradually along with the mediolateral extent of the copula pyramidis, almost becoming perpendicular to the sagittal plane in the laterally connected paraflocculus in the adult cerebellum. This rotational change in orientation was derived from the short U‐shaped embryonic cerebellum, in which the surfaces of the flocculus and paraflocculus were oriented laterally. These results indicated that the peculiar compartmental organization of the paraflocculus originates from the embryonic common hemispheric compartmental organization and shaped by the significant reorganization process in the first postnatal week.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Spatial models of cell distribution in human lumbar dorsal root ganglia&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f4667d4-6dde-4d84-adcc-b61710495e1a/cne24848-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are novel targets for neural interface technologies that treat neurological disorders, such as chronic pain and spinal cord injury. The three‐dimensional cellular anatomy of DRG are not well‐mapped, particularly in humans, limiting the effectiveness of neurotechnology. We developed a semi‐automated algorithm to quantify the three‐dimensional distribution of neural elements in histologically‐processed tissue. We applied this algorithm to sequential NF200‐stained histology slices obtained from human lumbar DRG and demonstrated that cell bodies typically congregate around the dorsal edge of the ganglia. These results are crucial to the development of safe and effective clinical neural interface technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which contain the somata of primary sensory neurons, have increasingly been considered as novel targets for clinical neural interfaces, both for neuroprosthetic and pain applications. Effective use of either neural recording or stimulation technologies requires an appropriate spatial position relative to the target neural element, whether axon or cell body. However, the internal three‐dimensional spatial organization of human DRG neural fibers and somata has not been quantitatively described. In this study, we analyzed 202 cross‐sectional images across the length of 31 human L4 and L5 DRG from 10 donors. We used a custom semi‐automated graphical user interface to identify the locations of neural elements in the images and normalize the output to a consistent spatial reference for direct comparison by spinal level. By applying a recursive partitioning algorithm, we found that the highest density of cell bodies at both spinal levels could be found in the inner 85% of DRG length, the outer‐most 25–30% radially, and the dorsal‐most 69–76%. While axonal density was fairly homogeneous across the DRG length, there was a distinct low density region in the outer 7–11% radially. These findings are consistent with previous qualitative reports of neural distribution in DRG. The quantitative measurements we provide will enable improved targeting of future neural interface technologies and DRG‐focused pharmaceutical therapies, and provide a rigorous anatomical description of the bridge between the central and peripheral nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogens underlie, at least in part, the greater pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence that women experience compared to men. Previous studies revealed populations of estrogen receptor‐expressing neurons in primary afferents and in superficial dorsal horn neurons, but there is limited information as to the contribution of these neurons to the generation of acute and chronic pain. Here we molecularly characterized neurons in the mouse superficial spinal cord dorsal horn that express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and explored the behavioral consequences of their ablation. The great majority of spinal ERα‐positive neurons are excitatory interneurons and many co‐express the neuropeptide, substance P. After viral, caspase‐mediated ablation of spinal ERα‐expressing cells, we did not observe changes in acute mechanical or heat pain processing, but recorded significant changes in the response to chemically‐evoked persistent pain behavior as well as pruritogen‐evoked itch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estrogens are presumed to underlie, at least in part, the greater pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence that women experience compared to men. Although previous studies revealed populations of estrogen receptor‐expressing neurons in primary afferents and in superficial dorsal horn neurons, there is little to no information as to the contribution of these neurons to the generation of acute and chronic pain. Here we molecularly characterized neurons in the mouse superficial spinal cord dorsal horn that express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and explored the behavioral consequences of their ablation. We found that spinal ERα‐positive neurons are largely excitatory interneurons and many coexpress substance P, a marker for a discrete subset of nociceptive, excitatory interneurons. After viral, caspase‐mediated ablation of spinal ERα‐expressing cells, we observed a significant decrease in the first phase of the formalin test, but in male mice only. ERα‐expressing neuron‐ablation also reduced pruritogen‐induced scratching in both male and female mice. There were no ablation‐related changes in mechanical or heat withdrawal thresholds or in capsaicin‐induced nocifensive behavior. In chronic pain models, we found no change in Complete Freund's adjuvant‐induced thermal or mechanical hypersensitivity, or in partial sciatic nerve injury‐induced mechanical allodynia. We conclude that ERα labels a subpopulation of excitatory interneurons that are specifically involved in chemically evoked persistent pain and pruritogen‐induced itch.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Antibodies to the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 contribute to neuronal cell loss in an animal model of multiple sclerosis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e1ebeb42-0341-416e-9652-453bc8908692/cne24845-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in contrast to healthy controls make autoantibodies to the RNA binding protein heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1). Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, injections of anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies lead to increased neurodegeneration as shown by a loss of neuronal cell bodies in the ventral spinal cord (graph). We demonstrate that anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies localized within and surrounding neuronal cell bodies of the ventral spinal cord. In these areas we demonstrate that neurons display increased hnRNP A1 mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, increased stress granule formation while also expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Additionally, anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were localized to CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells leading to an increase in iNOS in the surrounding tissue and subsequent neurodegeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration, including loss of neurons and axons, is a feature of progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration are mostly unknown. Research implicates autoimmunity to nonmyelin self‐antigens as important contributors to disease pathogenesis. Data from our lab implicate autoimmunity to the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) as a possible mechanism of neurodegeneration in MS. MS patients make antibodies to hnRNP A1, which have been shown to lead to neuronal dysfunction in vitro. Using an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we show here that injection of anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies, in contrast to control antibodies, resulted in worsened disease and increased neurodegeneration. We found a reduction of NeuN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuronal cell bodies in areas of the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord where anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies localized. Neurons displayed increased levels of hnRNP A1 nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization and stress granule formation, both markers of neuronal injury. Anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were found to surround neuronal cell bodies and interact with CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells via Fc receptors. Additionally, anti‐hnRNP A1 antibodies were found within neuronal cell bodies including those of the ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSCT), a tract previously shown to undergo neurodegeneration in anti‐hnRNP A1 antibody injected EAE mice. Finally, both immune cells and neurons showed increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, another indicator of cell damage. These findings suggest that autoimmunity to RBPs, such as hnRNP A1, play a role in neurodegeneration in EAE with important implications for the pathogenesis of MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Candidates for photic entrainment pathways to the circadian clock via optic lobe neuropils in the Madeira cockroach&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ebf9b454-6a80-484a-9ced-5a9659241f56/cne24844-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the nocturnal Madeira cockroach, parallel photic entrainment pathways from the compound eye to the circadian clock in the accessory medulla (AME) control circadian rest‐activity rhythms. We hypothesize that UV light promotes sleep via activation of ipsilateral pigment‐dispersing factor‐releasing morning clock cells (aPDFMEs/pPDFMEs) mediated via interneurons (CRZ MNe) between medulla layers 2 and 4. In contrast, green light directly activates contralateral PDF evening clock cells in the lamina, promoting activity at night. In addition, rest‐activity rhythms may be entrained via extraocular photoreceptors terminating in the accessory laminae (ALA).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compound eye of cockroaches is obligatory for entrainment of the Madeira cockroach's circadian clock, but the cellular nature of its entrainment pathways is enigmatic. Employing multiple‐label immunocytochemistry, histochemistry, and backfills, we searched for photic entrainment pathways to the accessory medulla (AME), the circadian clock of the Madeira cockroach. We wanted to know whether photoreceptor terminals could directly contact pigment‐dispersing factor‐immunoreactive (PDF‐ir) circadian pacemaker neurons with somata in the lamina (PDFLAs) or somata next to the AME (PDFMEs). Short green‐sensitive photoreceptor neurons of the compound eye terminated in lamina layers LA1 and LA2, adjacent to PDFLAs and PDFMEs that branched in LA3. Long UV‐sensitive compound eye photoreceptor neurons terminated in medulla layer ME2 without direct contact to ipsilateral PDFMEs that arborized in ME4. Multiple neuropeptide‐ir interneurons branched in ME4, connecting the AME to ME2. Before, extraocular photoreceptors of the lamina organ were suggested to send terminals to accessory laminae. There, they overlapped with PDFLAs that mostly colocalized PDF, FMRFamide, and 5‐HT immunoreactivities, and with terminals of ipsi‐ and contralateral PDFMEs. We hypothesize that during the day cholinergic activation of the largest PDFME via lamina organ photoreceptors maintains PDF release orchestrating phases of sleep–wake cycles. As ipsilateral PDFMEs express excitatory and contralateral PDFMEs inhibitory PDF autoreceptors, diurnal PDF release keeps both PDF‐dependent clock circuits in antiphase. Future experiments will test whether ipsilateral PDFMEs are sleep‐promoting morning cells, while contralateral PDFMEs are activity‐promoting evening cells, maintaining stable antiphase via the largest PDFME entrained by extraocular photoreceptors of the lamina organ.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive problems, especially disturbances in episodic memory, and hippocampal sclerosis are common in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) but little is known about the relationship of hippocampal morphology with memory. We aimed to relate hippocampal surface‐shape patterns to verbal and visual learning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed hippocampal surface shapes on high‐resolution MRI images and the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery in 145 unilateral refractory TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, a validation set of 55 unilateral refractory TLE patients and 39 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both left (LTLE) and right (RTLE) TLE patients had lower verbal (LTLE 44 ± 11; RTLE 45 ± 10) and visual learning (LTLE 34 ± 8; RTLE 30 ± 8) scores than healthy controls (verbal 58 ± 8; visual 39 ± 6; p&amp;lt;0.001). Verbal learning was more impaired the greater the atrophy of the left superolateral hippocampal head. In contrast, visual memory was worse with greater bilateral inferiomedial hippocampal atrophy. Postsurgical verbal memory decline was more common in LTLE than in RTLE (reliable change index in LTLE 27% vs. RTLE 7%, p=0.006), whereas there were no differences in postsurgical visual memory decline between those groups. Preoperative atrophy of the left hippocampal tail predicted postsurgical verbal memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory deficits in TLE are associated with specific morphological alterations of the hippocampus, which could help stratify TLE patients into those at high vs. low risk of presurgical or postsurgical memory deficits. This knowledge could improve planning and prognosis of selective epilepsy surgery and neuropsychological counselling in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies point to an inverse correlation between low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it remains unclear whether this association is causal. We tested the hypothesis that genetically elevated LDL is associated with reduced risk of ICH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constructed one polygenic risk score (PRS) per lipid trait (total cholesterol, LDL, high‐density lipoprotein [HDL], and triglycerides) using independent genomewide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each trait. We used data from 316,428 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank to estimate the effect of each PRS on its corresponding trait, and data from 1,286 ICH cases and 1,261 matched controls to estimate the effect of each PRS on ICH risk. We used these estimates to conduct Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 410, 339, 393, and 317 lipid‐related SNPs for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides, respectively. All four PRSs were strongly associated with their corresponding trait (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;‐100&lt;/sup&gt;). While one SD increase in the PRSs for total cholesterol (odds ratio [OR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85–0.99; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) and LDL cholesterol (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.81–0.95; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) were inversely associated with ICH risk, no significant associations were found for HDL and triglycerides (both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). MR analyses indicated that 1mmol/L (38.67mg/dL) increase of genetically instrumented total and LDL cholesterol were associated with 23% (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.65–0.98; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) and 41% lower risks of ICH (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.42–0.82; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically elevated LDL levels were associated with lower risk of ICH, providing support for a potential causal role of LDL cholesterol in ICH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a wide variety of pathological conditions caused by a loss of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and are severely debilitating. Exosome contains bio-signatures of great diagnostic and therapeutic value. There is proof that exosomal proteins can be biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). MicroRNAs in exosome has potential to be an important source of biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report exosomal microRNA performance of human plasma in neurodegenerative diseases by small RNA sequencing. A wide range of altered exo-miRNA expression levels were detected in both AD and PD patients. Down-regulated miRNAs in AD samples were enriched in ECM-receptor interaction pathway and both up-/down-regulated miRNAs in PD samples were enriched in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Compared to the control, 8 miRNAs were found to be significantly elevated/declined in AD and PD samples, of which 4 miRNAs were newly identified. Additionally, two exosome isolating methods were compared and the reproducibility of plasma exo-miRNA expression was confirmed, suggesting the feasibility of large-scale clinical application of this method. This study revealed exo-miRNA expression levels in neurodegenerative diseases, proposed new biomarkers and their potential functional pathway for AD and PD, confirmed the reproductivity of exo-miRNA profiles by using a different exosome isolating method, and compared the results with plasma miRNA expression. Therefore, this study also provides a precedent for identifying exosomal biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases in plasma by high-throughput sequencing and it could extend the therapeutic repertoire of exosomal biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and paralysis of the lower limbs. Autosomal dominant mutations in SPAST gene account for ∼40% of adult-onset patients. We have previously shown that SPAST patient cells have reduced organelle transport and are therefore more sensitive to oxidative stress. To test whether these effects are present in neuronal cells, we first generated 11 induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines from fibroblasts of three healthy controls and three HSP patients with different SPAST mutations. These cells were differentiated into FOXG1-positive forebrain neurons and then evaluated for multiple aspects of axonal transport and fragmentation. Patient neurons exhibited reduced levels of SPAST encoded spastin, as well as a range of axonal deficits, including reduced levels of stabilized microtubules, lower peroxisome transport speed as a consequence of reduced microtubule-dependent transport, reduced number of peroxisomes, and higher density of axon swellings. Patient axons fragmented significantly more than controls following hydrogen peroxide exposure, suggesting for the first time that the SPAST patient axons are more sensitive than controls to the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. Treatment of patient neurons with tubulin-binding drugs epothilone D and noscapine rescued axon peroxisome transport and protected them against axon fragmentation induced by oxidative stress, showing that SPAST patient axons are vulnerable to oxidative stress-induced degeneration as a consequence of reduced axonal transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Embodiment is the percept that something not originally belonging to the self becomes part of the body. Feeling embodiment for a prosthesis may counteract amputees’ altered image of the body and increase prosthesis acceptability. Prosthesis embodiment has been studied longitudinally in an amputee receiving feedback through intraneural and perineural multichannel electrodes implanted in her stump. Three factors—invasive (vs non-invasive) stimulation, training, and anthropomorphism—have been tested through two multisensory integration tasks: visuo-tactile integration (VTI) and crossing-hand effect in temporal order judgment (TOJ), the former more sensible to an extension of a safe margin around the body and the latter to action-oriented remapping. Results from the amputee participant were compared with the ones from healthy controls. Testing the participant with intraneural stimulation produced an extension of peripersonal space, a sign of prosthesis embodiment. One-month training extended the peripersonal space selectively on the side wearing the prostheses. More and less-anthropomorphic prostheses benefited of intraneural feedback and extended the peripersonal space. However, the worsening of TOJ performance following arm crossing was present only wearing the more trained, despite less anthropomorphic, prosthesis, suggesting that training was critical for our participant to achieve operative tool-like embodiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In recent years, traditional methods such as power spectrum and amplitude analysis have been used to research the emotional electroencephalogram (EEG). The brain network method is also used in emotional EEG research, which can better reflect the activity of brains. A minimum spanning tree (MST) represents the key information flow in the weighted brain network, and it provides a sensitive method to capture subtle information in network organization while effectively avoiding the shortcomings of traditional brain networks. The DEAP dataset provides electroencephalogram (EEG) data for four categories of emotions: high arousal and high valence (HAHV), high arousal and low valence (HALV), low arousal and high valence (LAHV), and low arousal and low valence (LALV). Phase lag index (PLI) weighted matrices were calculated in five frequency bands. On this basis, the minimum spanning trees were constructed. At the same valence level in the gamma (γ) band, HAHV and HALV showed significant higher mean PLI (MPLI), maximum degree (Degree&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and leaf fraction and significant lower diameter and eccentricity than LAHV and LALV. At the same arousal level in the γ band, HALV showed significant higher MPLI, Degree&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and leaf fraction and significant lower diameter and eccentricity than HAHV. These results indicate that the low-arousal showed more line-shaped configurations than the high-arousal. Additionally, in the high-arousal condition, a shift toward more star-shaped trees from high-valence to low-valence supports the trend toward randomness of the brain network with negative emotions and that the brain is more activated when faced with negative emotions. From a brain network perspective, this phenomenon provides a theoretical basis for negative bias.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Exercise has been shown to alter brain plasticity and is explored as a therapeutic intervention in a wide variety of neurological diseases. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers an inexpensive method of studying brain electrocortical activity shortly after exercise and thus offers a way of exploring the influence of exercise on the brain. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the current body of evidence regarding methods of EEG analysis and the reported effects of exercise interventions on EEG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched for studies investigating resting state EEG in exercise intervention studies carried out in participants &amp;gt;17 years of age and with no history of epilepsy. Further, studies solely investigating event-related potentials as an outcome measure were excluded. Relevant data were extracted, and a risk-of-bias assessment was carried out using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A qualitative synthesis of results was carried out. A protocol for the systematic review was uploaded to https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (ID: CRD42019134570) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) statement was followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Out of 1,993 records screened, 54 studies were included in a final qualitative synthesis with a total of 1,445 participants. Our synthesis showed that studies were mainly carried out using frequency analysis as an analytical method. Generally, findings across studies were inconsistent and few were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Studies were mainly of low quality and usually carried out in small populations, lowering the significance of results reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Changes in the EEG as a result of an exercise intervention are elusive and difficult to replicate. Future studies should provide biologically sound hypotheses underlying assumptions, include larger populations and use standardized EEG methods to increase replicability. EEG remains an interesting methodology to examine the effects of exercise on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Functional neurological disorders are characterized by neurological symptoms that have no identifiable pathology and little is known about their underlying pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;To analyze motor cortex excitability and intracortical inhibitory and excitatory circuits’ imbalance in patients with flaccid functional weakness.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one consecutive patients with acute onset of flaccid functional weakness were recruited. Single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols were used to analyze resting motor thresholds (RMT) and intracortical inhibitory (short interval intracortical inhibition – SICI) and excitatory (intracortical facilitation – ICF) circuits’ imbalance between the affected and non-affected motor cortices.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We observed a significant increase in RMT and SICI in the affected motor cortex (p &amp;lt; 0.001), but not for ICF, compared to the contralateral unaffected side.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study extends current knowledge of functional weakness, arguing for a specific central nervous system abnormality which may be involved in the symptoms’ pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stimulus information is maintained in working memory by action potentials that persist after the stimulus is no longer physically present. The prefrontal cortex is a critical brain area that maintains such persistent activity due to an intrinsic network with unique synaptic connectivity, NMDA receptors, and interneuron types. Persistent activity can be highly plastic depending on task demands but it also appears in naïve subjects, not trained or required to perform a task at all. Here, we review what aspects of persistent activity remain constant and what factors can modify it, focusing primarily on neurophysiological results from non-human primate studies. Changes in persistent activity are constrained by anatomical location, with more ventral and more anterior prefrontal areas exhibiting the greatest capacity for plasticity, as opposed to posterior and dorsal areas, which change relatively little with training. Learning to perform a cognitive task for the first time, further practicing the task, and switching between learned tasks can modify persistent activity. The ability of the prefrontal cortex to generate persistent activity also depends on age, with changes noted between adolescence, adulthood, and old age. Mean firing rates, variability and correlation of persistent discharges, but also time-varying firing rate dynamics are altered by these factors. Plastic changes in the strength of intrinsic network connections can be revealed by the analysis of synchronous spiking between neurons. These results are essential for understanding how the prefrontal cortex mediates working memory and intelligent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown multiple mechanisms and pathophysiological changes after anesthesia, and genome-wide studies have been implemented in the studies of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the genome-wide gene expression patterns and modulation networks after general anesthesia remains to be elucidated. Therefore, whole transcriptome microarray analysis was used to explore the coding gene expression patterns in the hippocampus of aged rats after sevoflurane anesthesia. Six hundred and thirty one upregulated and 183 downregulated genes were screened out, then 44 enriched terms of biological process, 16 of molecular function and 18 of the cellular components were identified by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis. Among them, oxidative stress, metabolism, aging, and neurodegeneration were the most enriched biological processes and changed functions. Thus, involved genes of these processes were selected for qPCR verification and a good consistency was confirmed. The potential signaling pathways were further constructed including mitochondrion and oxidative stress-related Hifs-Prkcd-Akt-Nfe2l2-Sod1 signaling, multiple metabolism signaling (Scd2, Scap-Hmgcs2, Aldh18a1-Glul and Igf1r), as well as aging and neurodegeneration related signaling (Spidr-Ercc4-Cdkn1a-Pmaip1 and Map1lc3b). These results provide potential therapeutic gene targets for brain function modulation and memory formation process after inhaled anesthesia in the elderly, which could be valuable for preventing postoperative brain disorders and diseases, such as perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), from the genetic level in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Twelve-month-old male mice expressing the human A53T variant of α-synuclein (A53T) develop dopamine neuron degeneration, neuroinflammation, and motor deficits, along with dysfunctions of the mitochondrial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger (NCX) isoforms 1 (NCX1) and 3 (NCX3) in the nigrostriatal system. Since gender is thought to play a role in the etiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), we characterized neurochemical and behavioral alterations in 12-month-old female A53T transgenic mice. We investigated the presence of dopaminergic degeneration, astrogliosis and microgliosis using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA-1) in both the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum. In the same regions, we also evaluated the co-localization of NCX1 in cells positive for IBA-1 and the co-localization of NCX3 in TH-positive neurons and fibers. Furthermore, in both male and female mice, we performed motor (beam walking and pole tests) and memory [novel object recognition (NOR) and spontaneous alternation] tasks, together with tests to evaluate peripheral deficits (olfactory and stool collection tests). Female A53T transgenic mice displayed degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, but neither microgliosis nor astrogliosis in the SNc and striatum. Moreover, female A53T transgenic mice displayed co-localization between NCX1 and IBA-1 positive cells in the striatum but not SNc, whereas NCX3 did not co-localize with either TH-positive terminals or neuronal bodies in the nigrostriatal system. Furthermore, female A53T transgenic mice showed increased crossing time in the beam walking test, but no impairments in the pole or memory tests, and in tests that evaluated peripheral deficits, whereas male A53T transgenic mice displayed motor, memory and peripheral deficits. Immunohistochemical and behavioral results obtained here in the female mice differ from those previously observed in males, and suggest a dissimilar influence of NCX1 and NCX3 on dopaminergic function in female and male A53T transgenic mice, strengthening the validity of these mice as a model for studying the etiological factors of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aging affects pain experience and brain functioning. However, how aging leads to changes in pain perception and brain functional connectivity has not yet been completely understood. To investigate resting-state and pain perception changes in old and young participants, this study employed region of interest (ROI) to ROI resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis of imaging data by using regions implicated in sensory and affective dimensions of pain, descending pain modulation, and the default-mode networks (DMNs). Thirty-seven older (66.86 ± 4.04 years; 16 males) and 38 younger healthy participants (20.74 ± 4.15 years; 19 males) underwent 10 min’ eyes-closed resting-state scanning. We examined the relationship between rsFC parameters with pressure pain thresholds. Older participants showed higher pain thresholds than younger. Regarding rsFC, older adults displayed increased connectivity of pain-related sensory brain regions in comparison to younger participants: increased rsFC between bilateral primary somatosensory area (SI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and between SI(L) and secondary somatosensory area (SII)-(R) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, decreased connectivity in the older compared to the younger group was found among descending pain modulatory regions: between the amygdala(R) and bilateral insula(R), thalamus(R), ACC, and amygdala(L); between the amygdala(L) and insula(R) and bilateral thalamus; between ACC and bilateral insula, and between periaqueductal gray (PAG) and bilateral thalamus. Regarding the DMN, the posterior parietal cortex and lateral parietal (LP; R) were more strongly connected in the older group than in the younger group. Correlational analyses also showed that SI(L)-SII(R) rsFC was positively associated with pressure pain thresholds in older participants. In conclusion, these findings suggest a compensatory mechanism for the sensory changes that typically accompanies aging. Furthermore, older participants showed reduced functional connectivity between key nodes of the descending pain inhibitory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a hereditary cerebral small vessel disease caused by mutations in NOTCH3, is characterized by recurrent stroke without vascular risk factors, mood disturbances, and dementia. MRI imaging shows cerebral white matter (WM) hyperintensity, particularly in the external capsule and temporal pole. Missense mutations related to a cysteine residue in the 34 EGFr on the NOTCH3 extracellular domain (N3ECD) are a typical mutation of CADASIL. On the other hand, atypical mutations including cysteine sparing mutation, null mutation, homozygous mutation, and other associate genes are also reported. From the viewpoint of gain of function apart from Notch signaling or loss of function of Notch signaling, we review the research article about CADASIL and summarized the pathogenesis of small vessel, stroke, and dementia in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations in specific frequency bands coordinates anatomically distributed neuronal processing and communication. Typically, oscillations and synchronization take place concurrently in many distinct frequencies, which serve separate computational roles in cognitive functions. While within-frequency phase synchronization has been studied extensively, less is known about the mechanisms that govern neuronal processing distributed across frequencies and brain regions. Such integration of processing between frequencies could be achieved via cross-frequency coupling (CFC), either by phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) or by &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-cross–frequency phase synchrony (CFS). So far, studies have mostly focused on local CFC in individual brain regions, whereas the presence and functional organization of CFC between brain areas have remained largely unknown. We posit that interareal CFC may be essential for large-scale coordination of neuronal activity and investigate here whether genuine CFC networks are present in human resting-state (RS) brain activity. To assess the functional organization of CFC networks, we identified brain-wide CFC networks at mesoscale resolution from stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and at macroscale resolution from source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We developed a novel, to our knowledge, graph-theoretical method to distinguish genuine CFC from spurious CFC that may arise from nonsinusoidal signals ubiquitous in neuronal activity. We show that genuine interareal CFC is present in human RS activity in both SEEG and MEG data. Both CFS and PAC networks coupled theta and alpha oscillations with higher frequencies in large-scale networks connecting anterior and posterior brain regions. CFS and PAC networks had distinct spectral patterns and opposing distribution of low- and high-frequency network hubs, implying that they constitute distinct CFC mechanisms. The strength of CFS networks was also predictive of cognitive performance in a separate neuropsychological assessment. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for interareal CFS and PAC being 2 distinct mechanisms for coupling oscillations across frequencies in large-scale brain networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iApG8yeSIYU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9d019221-95c1-430d-b14e-455e63f242d6/cne24922-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/Layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/Layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of Layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of gray matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra‐ and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of &lt;i&gt;Nurr1/Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt;, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not advanced beyond steroid use, which reduces acute loss of function, but has little effect on residual disability. Acute loss of function in an MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [EAE]) is partly due to central nervous system (CNS) hypoxia, and function can promptly improve upon breathing oxygen. Here, we investigate the cause of the hypoxia and whether it is due to a deficit in oxygen supply arising from impaired vascular perfusion. We also explore whether the CNS‐selective vasodilating agent, nimodipine, may provide a therapy to restore function, and protect from demyelination in 2 MS models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods have been used to measure basic cardiovascular physiology, spinal oxygenation, mitochondrial function, and tissue perfusion in EAE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report that the tissue hypoxia in EAE is associated with a profound hypoperfusion of the inflamed spinal cord. Treatment with nimodipine restores spinal oxygenation and can rapidly improve function. Nimodipine therapy also reduces demyelination in both EAE and a model of the early MS lesion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of function in EAE, and demyelination in EAE, and the model of the early MS lesion, seem to be due, at least in part, to tissue hypoxia due to local spinal hypoperfusion. Therapy to improve blood flow not only protects neurological function but also reduces demyelination. We conclude that nimodipine could be repurposed to offer substantial clinical benefit in MS.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the natural course of multiple sclerosis (MS), the brain is exposed to aging as well as disease effects. Brain aging can be modeled statistically; the so‐called “brain‐age” paradigm. Here, we evaluated whether brain‐predicted age difference (brain‐PAD) was sensitive to the presence of MS, clinical progression, and future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a longitudinal, multicenter sample of 3,565 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, in 1,204 patients with MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and 150 healthy controls (mean follow‐up time: patients 3.41 years, healthy controls 1.97 years), we measured “brain‐predicted age” using T1‐weighted MRI. We compared brain‐PAD among patients with MS and patients with CIS and healthy controls, and between disease subtypes. Relationships between brain‐PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were explored.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with MS had markedly higher brain‐PAD than healthy controls (mean brain‐PAD +10.3 years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.5–12.1] versus 4.3 years; 95% CI = 2.1 to 6.4; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The highest brain‐PADs were in secondary‐progressive MS (+13.3 years; 95% CI = 11.3–15.3). Brain‐PAD at study entry predicted time‐to‐disability progression (hazard ratio 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01–1.03; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); although normalized brain volume was a stronger predictor. Greater annualized brain‐PAD increases were associated with greater annualized EDSS score (r = 0.26; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain‐age paradigm is sensitive to MS‐related atrophy and clinical progression. A higher brain‐PAD at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression and the rate of change in brain‐PAD related to worsening disability. Potentially, “brain‐age” could be used as a prognostic biomarker in early‐stage MS, to track disease progression or stratify patients for clinical trial enrollment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and medicine aim to identify verifiable and replicable truths. However, the paths to such truths are frequently characterised by swinging pendulums of opposing perspectives. This is especially so in human neuroscience and the brain‐based clinical sciences, where the target of investigation is the most complex of all biological systems. This paper overviews a set of interrelated neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses, models, experiments and predictions with which I have been involved for the last two decades. Traversing visual neuroscience, consciousness science, genetics, chronobiology, and biological and clinical psychiatry, the work illustrates how developments in science and medicine can occur through a combination of synthesis, serendipity and experimentation. The paper also reflects on doing science with the inimitable John ‘Jack’ Pettigrew, and outlines how Pettigrew and I conceived, proposed, tested and developed two new scientific models — one on neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry, the other on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. I also provide an update on various aspects of our models and data, and describe lessons learned from Pettigrew on how perspectives in science exhibit their own fluctuations, ironically like the very phenomena on which we worked.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Functional organisation and connectivity of the dorsal column nuclei complex reveals a sensorimotor integration and distribution hub&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ac2bc1f8-5b10-4b15-8f15-72b1b0d33827/cne24942-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal column nuclei complex (DCN‐complex) includes the dorsal column nuclei (DCN, referring to the gracile and cuneate nuclei collectively), external cuneate, X, and Z nuclei, and the median accessory nucleus. The DCN are organised by both somatotopy and modality, and have a diverse range of afferent inputs and projection targets. The functional organisation and connectivity of the DCN implicate them in a variety of sensorimotor functions, beyond their commonly accepted role in processing and transmitting somatosensory information to the thalamus, yet this is largely underappreciated in the literature. To consolidate insights into their sensorimotor functions, this review examines the morphology, organisation, and connectivity of the DCN and their associated nuclei. First, we briefly discuss the receptors, afferent fibres, and pathways involved in conveying tactile and proprioceptive information to the DCN. Next, we review the modality and somatotopic arrangements of the remaining constituents of the DCN‐complex. Finally, we examine and discuss the functional implications of the myriad of DCN‐complex projection targets throughout the diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain, in addition to their modulatory inputs from the cortex. The organisation and connectivity of the DCN‐complex suggest that these nuclei should be considered a complex integration and distribution hub for sensorimotor information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex (CX) in the insect brain is a higher order integration center that controls a number of behaviors, most prominently goal directed locomotion. The CX comprises the protocerebral bridge (PB), the upper division of the central body (CBU), the lower division of the central body (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). Although spatial orientation has been extensively studied in honeybees at the behavioral level, most electrophysiological and anatomical analyses have been carried out in other insect species, leaving the morphology and physiology of neurons that constitute the CX in the honeybee mostly enigmatic. The goal of this study was to morphologically identify neuronal cell types of the CX in the honeybee &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;. By performing iontophoretic dye injections into the CX, we traced 16 subtypes of neuron that connect a subdivision of the CX with other regions in the bee`s central brain, and eight subtypes that mainly interconnect different subdivisions of the CX. They establish extensive connections between the CX and the lateral complex, the superior protocerebrum and the posterior protocerebrum. Characterized neuron classes and subtypes are morphologically similar to those described in other insects, suggesting considerable conservation in the neural network relevant for orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The past decade has witnessed an explosion in applications for neural recording and stimulation in the treatment of clinical disorders. Neuromodulatory approaches are now a mainstay of care for essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, and are expanding rapidly into a wide range of other neurological and psychiatric diseases. In parallel, advancements in endovascular approaches to cerebrovascular diseases have resulted in minimally invasive techniques that deliver devices to neural tissue in the central and peripheral nervous systems, with significantly improved safety and efficacy. In this review, we discuss the history of endovascular neural recording and stimulation, its current progress, and applications for neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The success of surgical resection in epilepsy patients depends on preserving functionally critical brain regions, while removing pathological tissues. Being the gold standard, electro-cortical stimulation mapping (ESM) helps surgeons in localizing the function of eloquent cortex through electrical stimulation of electrodes placed directly on the cortical brain surface. Due to the potential hazards of ESM, including increased risk of provoked seizures, electrocorticography based functional mapping (ECoG-FM) was introduced as a safer alternative approach. However, ECoG-FM has a low success rate when compared to the ESM. In this study, we address this critical limitation by developing a new algorithm based on deep learning for ECoG-FM and thereby we achieve an accuracy comparable to ESM in identifying eloquent language cortex. In our experiments, with 11 epilepsy patients who underwent presurgical evaluation (through deep learning-based signal analysis on 637 electrodes), our proposed algorithm obtained an accuracy of 83.05% in identifying language regions, an exceptional 23% improvement with respect to the conventional ECoG-FM analysis (∼60%). Our findings have demonstrated, for the first time, that deep learning powered ECoG-FM can serve as a stand-alone modality and avoid likely hazards of the ESM in epilepsy surgery. Hence, reducing the potential for developing post-surgical morbidity in the language function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;MRI diffusion data suffers from significant inter- and intra-site variability, which hinders multi-site and/or longitudinal diffusion studies. This variability may arise from a range of factors, such as hardware, reconstruction algorithms and acquisition settings. To allow a reliable comparison and joint analysis of diffusion data across sites and over time, there is a clear need for robust data harmonization methods. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of diffusion data harmonization concepts and methods, and their limitations. Overall, the methods for the harmonization of multi-site diffusion images can be categorized in two main groups: diffusion parametric map harmonization (DPMH) and diffusion weighted image harmonization (DWIH). Whereas DPMH harmonizes the diffusion parametric maps (e.g., FA, MD, and MK), DWIH harmonizes the diffusion-weighted images. Defining a gold standard harmonization technique for dMRI data is still an ongoing challenge. Nevertheless, in this paper we provide two classification tools, namely a feature table and a flowchart, which aim to guide the readers in selecting an appropriate harmonization method for their study.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tvrm4 mice, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), carry a mutation of Rhodopsin gene that can be activated by brief exposure to very intense light. Here, we test the possibility of an anatomical, metabolic, and functional recovery by delivering to degenerating Tvrm4 animals, Myriocin, an inhibitor of ceramide de novo synthesis previously shown to effectively slow down retinal degeneration in rd10 mutants (Strettoi et al., 2010; Piano et al., 2013). Different routes and durations of Myriocin administration were attempted by using either single intravitreal (i.v.) or long-term, repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. The retinal function of treated and control animals was tested by ERG recordings. Retinas from ERG-recorded animals were studied histologically to reveal the extent of photoreceptor death. A correlation was observed between Myriocin administration, lowering of retinal ceramides, and preservation of ERG responses in i.v. injected cases. Noticeably, the i.p. treatment with Myriocin decreased the extension of the retinal-degenerating area, preserved the ERG response, and correlated with decreased levels of biochemical indicators of retinal oxidative damage. The results obtained in this study confirm the efficacy of Myriocin in slowing down retinal degeneration in genetic models of RP independently of the underlying mutation responsible for the disease, likely targeting ceramide-dependent, downstream pathways. Alleviation of retinal oxidative stress upon Myriocin treatment suggests that this molecule, or yet unidentified metabolites, act on cellular detoxification systems supporting cell survival. Altogether, the pharmacological approach chosen here meets the necessary pre-requisites for translation into human therapy to slow down RP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Body language and movement are important media of emotional expression. There is an interactive physiological relationship between emotion and movement. Thus, we hypothesize that the emotional cortex interacts with the motor cortex during the mutual regulation of emotion and movement. And this interaction can be revealed by brain connectivity analysis based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing. We proposed a brain connectivity analysis method: bidirectional long short-term memory Granger causality (bi-LSTM-GC). The theoretical basis of the proposed method was Granger causality estimation using a bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) for solving nonlinear parameters. Then, we compared the accuracy of the bi-LSTM-GC with other unidirectional connectivity methods. The results demonstrated that the information interaction existed among multiple brain regions (EEG 10-20 system) in the paradigm of emotion–movement regulation. The detected directional dependencies in EEG signals were mainly distributed from the frontal to the central region and from the prefrontal to the central–parietal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Historically, neuroscience principles have heavily influenced artificial intelligence (AI), for example the influence of the perceptron model, essentially a simple model of a biological neuron, on artificial neural networks. More recently, notable recent AI advances, for example the growing popularity of reinforcement learning, often appear more aligned with cognitive neuroscience or psychology, focusing on function at a relatively abstract level. At the same time, neuroscience stands poised to enter a new era of large-scale high-resolution data and appears more focused on underlying neural mechanisms or architectures that can, at times, seem rather removed from functional descriptions. While this might seem to foretell a new generation of AI approaches arising from a deeper exploration of neuroscience specifically for AI, the most direct path for achieving this is unclear. Here we discuss cultural differences between the two fields, including divergent priorities that should be considered when leveraging modern-day neuroscience for AI. For example, the two fields feed two very different applications that at times require potentially conflicting perspectives. We highlight small but significant cultural shifts that we feel would greatly facilitate increased synergy between the two fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The perinatal period represents a time of great vulnerability for the developing brain. A variety of injuries can result in death or devastating injury causing profound neurocognitive deficits. Hypoxic-ischemic neonatal encephalopathy (HIE) remains the leading cause of brain injury in term infants during the perinatal period with limited options available to aid in recovery. It can result in long-term devastating consequences with neurologic complications varying from mild behavioral deficits to severe seizure, intellectual disability, and/or cerebral palsy in the newborn. Despite medical advances, the only viable option is therapeutic hypothermia which is classified as the gold standard but is not used, or may not be as effective in preterm cases, infection-associated cases or low resource settings. Therefore, alternatives or adjunct therapies are urgently needed. Ongoing research continues to advance our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to perinatal brain injury and identify new targets and treatments. Drugs used for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have demonstrated neuroprotective properties and therapeutic efficacy from neurological sequelae following HIE insults in preclinical models, both alone, or in combination with induced hypothermia. In this short review, we have focused on recent findings on the use of diabetes drugs that provide a neuroprotective effect using in vitro and in vivo models of HIE that could be considered for clinical translation as a promising treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: The effects of acupuncture on Alzheimer's disease (AD) outcomes remain controversial. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials from inception to January 19, 2019. Data were extracted and evaluated by two authors independently. The data analysis was conducted using R (version 3.6.0) and RStudio (version 1.2.1335) software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirty trials involving 2,045 patients were included. Acupuncture plus drug therapy may have been more beneficial for general cognitive function in AD patients than drug therapy alone (short-term treatment: MD, mean difference = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.77; p &amp;lt; 0.01; medium-term treatment: MD = 4.41, 95% CI: 1.83, 7.00; p &amp;lt; 0.01). People who received acupuncture plus drug therapy attained higher ADL (Activities of Daily Living) scores than patients who received drug therapy alone for medium-term treatment duration (MD = −2.14; 95% CI: −3.69, −0.59; p &amp;lt; 0.01). However, there is no statistically significant difference in subgroup effect on MMSE (Mini-mental Status Examination) and ADLs (p &amp;gt; 0.05) when comparing acupuncture treatment with drug therapy (such as Donepezil hydrochloride, Nimodipine, or Yizhijiannao), or acupuncture plus drug therapy (such as Donepezil hydrochloride, Dangguishaoyaosan, or Jiannaosan) with drug therapy alone. There was also no significant difference in general cognitive function, ADLs, or incidence of adverse events between acupuncture treatment and drug therapy (p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This review indicates that acupuncture plus drug therapy may have a more beneficial effect for AD patients than drug therapy alone on general cognitive function in the short and medium term and on ADLs in the medium term. Acupuncture alone may not have superior effects compared with drug therapy on global cognitive function, ADLs, and incidence of adverse events. Duration of treatment may not modify the effect of acupuncture in comparison with drug therapy. Additional large-scale and high-quality clinical trials are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the brain parenchyma is facilitated by the astrocytic water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Homeostatically regulated electroencephalographic (EEG) slow waves are a hallmark of deep non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and have been implicated in the regulation of parenchymal CSF flow and brain clearance. The human &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt; gene harbors several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AQP4 expression, brain-water homeostasis, and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, their role in sleep-wake regulation is unknown. To investigate whether functional variants in &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt; modulate human sleep, nocturnal EEG recordings and cognitive performance were investigated in 123 healthy participants genotyped for a common eight-SNP &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt;-haplotype. We show that this &lt;i&gt;AQP4&lt;/i&gt;-haplotype is associated with distinct modulations of NREM slow wave energy, strongest in early sleep and mirrored by changes in sleepiness and reaction times during extended wakefulness. The study provides the first human evidence for a link between AQP4, deep NREM sleep, and cognitive consequences of prolonged wakefulness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/l_UpAu5nDhA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Precuneus (PreC) layer III projection neurons, which contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD) are dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Expression profiling of PreC CatD‐ positive layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in tissue from subjects with mild cognitive impairment and AD that was not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the default mode memory network.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precuneus (PreC; Brodmann area 7), a key hub within the default mode network (DMN) displays amyloid and tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PreC layer III projection neurons contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD), a marker of neurons vulnerable to NFT pathology. Here we applied single population laser capture microdissection coupled with custom‐designed microarray profiling to determine the genetic signature of PreC CatD‐positive‐layer III neurons accrued from postmortem tissue obtained from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Expression profiling revealed significant differential expression of key transcripts in MCI and AD compared to NCI that underlie signaling defects, including dysregulation of genes within the endosomal‐lysosomal and autophagy pathways, cytoskeletal elements, AD‐related genes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cholinergic enzymes and receptors, markers of monoamine neurotransmission as well as steroid‐related transcripts. Pervasive defects in both MCI and AD were found in select transcripts within these key gene ontology categories, underscoring the vulnerability of these corticocortical projection neurons during the onset and progression of dementia. Select PreC dysregulated genes detected via custom‐designed microarray analysis were validated using qPCR. In summary, expression profiling of PreC CatD ‐positive layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in MCI and AD that were not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by primary or secondary impairment of the peripheral or central nervous systems. Its etiology is complex and involves abnormal patterns of gene expression and pathway activation. Using bioinformatics analysis, we aimed to identify NP-associated changes in genes and pathways in L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a rat model of NP induced by chronic compression of the DRG (CCD). Genome-wide transcriptional analyses were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying NP. We screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 7 days after CCD in comparison with sham-operated controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were used to confirm the presence of key DEGs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-pathway analysis of DEGs and global signal transduction network analysis of DEGs were also conducted. The CCD group developed clear mechanical and thermal allodynia in the ipsilateral hind paw compared with the sham group. This comparison identified 1,887 DEGs, with 1156 upregulated and 731 downregulated DEGs, and 123 DEG-enriched pathways. We identified the key candidate genes that might play a role in the development of NP, namely syndecan 1 (Sdc1), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit gamma (Pi3k), Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (Jun), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) by analyzing the global signal transduction network. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis confirmed the microarray results. The DEGs Sdc1, Pi3k, Jak2, Jun, and IL-6, and the cytokine signaling pathway, the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may have decisive modulatory roles in both nerve regeneration and NP. These results provide deeper insight into the mechanism underlying NP and promising therapeutic targets for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The RNA-binding protein RBFOX1 is an important regulator of neuron development and neuronal excitability. Rbfox1 is a dosage-sensitive gene and in both mice and humans, decreased expression of Rbfox1 has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Alternative promoters drive expression of Rbfox1 transcript isoforms that encode an identical protein. The tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of these isoforms, as well as the underlying regulatory mechanisms, are, however, unclear. Here, we set out to capture all of the Rbfox1 transcript isoforms and identify transcriptional mechanisms that regulate brain-specific Rbfox1 expression. Isoform sequencing identified multiple alternative Rbfox1 transcript variants in the mouse cerebral cortex, including transcripts with novel first exons, alternatively spliced exons and 3′-truncations. Quantitative RT-PCR determined the expression of the alternative first exons in the developing cerebral cortex and different subregions of the juvenile brain. Alternative first exons were found to be highly stage- and subregion specific in their expression patterns suggesting that they fulfill specific functions during cortex development and in different brain regions. Using reporter assays we found that the promoter regions of the two first exons E1B and E1C/E1C.1 contain several functional E-boxes. Together, we provide an extensive picture of Rbfox1 isoform expression. We further identified important regulatory mechanisms that drive neuron-specific Rbfox1 expression. Thus, our study forms the basis for further research into the mechanisms that ensure physiological Rbfox1 expression in the brain. It also helps to understand why, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders deletion of individual RBFOX1 transcript isoforms could affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nowadays, pain represents one of the most important societal burdens. Current treatments are, however, too often ineffective and/or accompanied by debilitating unwanted effects for patients dealing with chronic pain. Indeed, the prototypical opioid morphine, as many other strong analgesics, shows harmful unwanted effects including respiratory depression and constipation, and also produces tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction. The urgency to develop novel treatments against pain while minimizing adverse effects is therefore crucial. Over the years, the delta-opioid receptor (DOP) has emerged as a promising target for the development of new pain therapies. Indeed, targeting DOP to treat chronic pain represents a timely alternative to existing drugs, given the weak unwanted effects spectrum of DOP agonists. Here, we review the current knowledge supporting a role for DOP and its agonists for the treatment of pain. More specifically, we will focus on the cellular and subcellular localization of DOP in the nervous system. We will also discuss in further detail the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in controlling the cellular trafficking of DOP, known to differ significantly from most G protein-coupled receptors. This review article will allow a better understanding of how DOP represents a promising target to develop new treatments for pain management as well as where we stand as of our ability to control its cellular trafficking and cell surface expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurons located in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are crucial for transmitting peripheral sensations such as proprioception, touch, temperature, and nociception to the spinal cord before propagating these signals to higher brain structures. To date, difficulty in identifying modality-specific DRG neurons has limited our ability to study specific populations in detail. As the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) is a neurochemical marker for proprioceptive DRG cells we used a transgenic mouse line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in PV positive DRGs, to study the functional and molecular properties of putative proprioceptive neurons. Immunolabeled DRGs showed a 100% overlap between GFP positive (GFP+) and PV positive cells, confirming the PVeGFP mouse accurately labeled PV neurons. Targeted patch-clamp recording from isolated GFP+ and GFP negative (GFP−) neurons showed the passive membrane properties of the two groups were similar, however, their active properties differed markedly. All GFP+ neurons fired a single spike in response to sustained current injection and their action potentials (APs) had faster rise times, lower thresholds and shorter half widths. A hyperpolarization-activated current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) was observed in all GFP+ neurons but was infrequently noted in the GFP− population (100% vs. 11%). For GFP+ neurons, I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; activation rates varied markedly, suggesting differences in the underlying hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) subunit expression responsible for the current kinetics. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed the HCN subunits 2, 1, and 4 mRNA (in that order) was more abundant in GFP+ neurons, while HCN 3 was more highly expressed in GFP− neurons. Likewise, immunolabeling confirmed HCN 1, 2, and 4 protein expression in GFP+ neurons. In summary, certain functional properties of GFP+ and GFP− cells differ markedly, providing evidence for modality-specific signaling between the two groups. However, the GFP+ DRG population demonstrates considerable internal heterogeneity when hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN channel) properties and subunit expression are considered. We propose this heterogeneity reflects the existence of different peripheral receptors such as tendon organs, muscle spindles or mechanoreceptors in the putative proprioceptive neuron population.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study explores the differences in the profile of relationships between sensory processing and attention abilities among children with sensory processing disorder (SPD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typically developing (TD) children. The Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch), a performance-based measure of attention, was administered to 69 children (TD: n = 24; SPD: n = 21; ASD: n = 24), ages 6–10 years. All participants’ parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP), a standardized parent-report measure of sensory-related behaviors. Discriminant analyses using the TEA-Ch and the SSP domains revealed two classification functions; the first revealed that both clinical groups significantly differed from the TD group with greater sensory processing challenges in the categories of auditory filtering, under-responsive/seeks sensation, low energy/weak, and taste/smell sensitivity subscales of the SSP. The second function discriminated between the two clinical groups, indicating that children with ASD had significantly greater control and sustained attention deficits and less sensory issues than did children with SPD. Together, the two functions correctly classified 76.8% of the participants as to their group membership. The different profiles of sensory processing and attention abilities in children with SPD and ASD may provide guidance in identifying appropriate individualized therapeutic strategies for these children.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural responses of oddball tasks can be used as a physiological biomarker to evaluate the brain potential of information processing under the assumption that the differential contribution of deviant stimuli can be assessed accurately. Nevertheless, the non-stationarity of neural activity causes the brain networks to fluctuate hugely in time, deteriorating the estimation of pairwise synergies. To deal with the time variability of neural responses, we have developed a piecewise multi-subject analysis that is applied over a set of time intervals within the stationary assumption holds. To segment the whole stimulus-locked epoch into multiple temporal windows, we experimented with two approaches for piecewise segmentation of EEG recordings: a fixed time-window, at which the estimates of FC measures fulfill a given confidence level, and variable time-window, which is segmented at the change points of the time-varying classifier performance. Employing the weighted Phase Lock Index as a functional connectivity metric, we have presented the validation in a real-world EEG data, proving the effectiveness of variable time segmentation for connectivity extraction when combined with a supervised thresholding approach. Consequently, we performed a piecewise group-level analysis of electroencephalographic data that deals with non-stationary functional connectivity measures, evaluating more carefully the contribution of a link node-set in discriminating between the labeled oddball responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Phase contrast MRI (pcMRI) has been used to investigate flow pulsatility in cerebral arteries, larger cerebral veins, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Such measurements of intracranial pulsatility and compliance are beginning to inform understanding of the pathophysiology of conditions including normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis, and dementias. We demonstrate the presence of flow pulsatility in small cerebral cortical veins, for the first time using pcMRI at 7 T, with the aim of improving our understanding of the hemodynamics of this little-studied vascular compartment. A method for establishing where venous flow is pulsatile is introduced, revealing significant pulsatility in 116 out of 146 veins, across eight healthy participants, assessed in parietal and frontal regions. Distributions of pulsatility index (PI) and pulse waveform delay were characterized, indicating a small, but statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05), delay of 59 ± 41 ms in cortical veins with respect to the superior sagittal sinus, but no differences between veins draining different arterial supply territories. Measurements of pulsatility in smaller cortical veins, a hitherto unstudied compartment closer to the capillary bed, could lead to a better understanding of intracranial compliance and cerebrovascular (patho)physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells-based therapies have shown great potential for central nervous system regeneration, with three-dimensional (3D) culture systems representing a key technique for tissue engineering applications, as well as disease modeling and drug screenings. Self-assembling peptides (SAPs), providing biomimetic synthetic micro-environments regulating cellular functionality and tissue repair, constitute a suitable tool for the production of complex tissue-like structures in vitro. However, one of the most important drawbacks in 3D cultures, obtained via animal-derived substrates and serum-rich media, is the reproducibility and tunability of a standardized methodology capable to coax neural differentiation of different human cell lines. In this work we cultured four distinct human neural stem cell (hNSC) lines in 3D synthetic multifunctionalized hydrogel (named HYDROSAP) for up to 6 weeks. Three-dimensional cultures of differentiating hNSCs exhibited a progressive differentiation and maturation over time. All hNSCs-derived neurons in 3D culture system exhibited randomly organized entangled networks with increasing expression of GABAergic and glutamatergic phenotypes and presence of cholinergic ones. Oligodendrocytes formed insulating myelin sheaths positive for myelin basic protein (MBP). In summary, results demonstrated a successfully standardized and reproducible 3D cell culture system for hNSC differentiation and maturation in serum-free conditions useful for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Investigating the dynamics and function of large-scale spiking neuronal networks with realistic numbers of synapses is made possible today by state-of-the-art simulation code that scales to the largest contemporary supercomputers. However, simulations that involve electrical interactions, also called gap junctions, besides chemical synapses scale only poorly due to a communication scheme that collects global data on each compute node. In comparison to chemical synapses, gap junctions are far less abundant. To improve scalability we exploit this sparsity by integrating an existing framework for continuous interactions with a recently proposed directed communication scheme for spikes. Using a reference implementation in the NEST simulator we demonstrate excellent scalability of the integrated framework, accelerating large-scale simulations with gap junctions by more than an order of magnitude. This allows, for the first time, the efficient exploration of the interactions of chemical and electrical coupling in large-scale neuronal networks models with natural synapse density distributed across thousands of compute nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The choroid plexus (CP) plays a major role in controlling the entry of substances and immune cells into the brain as it forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) in the brain ventricles. Dysregulated immune cell trafficking through the epithelial cell (EC) layer of CP is central for the pathogenesis of infectious diseases in the brain and many neurodegenerative disorders. In vitro studies elucidating the function of the CP have so far been limited to the monolayer culture of CP ECs. To mimic immune cell migration across the CP barrier, a three-dimensional model would be advantageous. Here, we present an in vitro platform for studies of the immune cell trafficking based on CP explants/organoids. The explants were generated from fragments of mouse CPs in Matrigel, where the cells formed luminal spaces and could be maintained in culture for at least 8 weeks. We demonstrate expression of the major CP markers in the explants, including transthyretin and aquaporin 1 as well as ZO1 and ICAM-1, indicating a capacity for secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and presence of tight junctions. CP explants displayed CP-like cell polarization and formed an intact EC barrier. We also show that the expression of transthyretin, transferrin, occludin and other genes associated with various functions of CP was maintained in the explants at similar levels as in native CP. By using dendritic cells and neutrophils, we show that the migration activity of immune cells and their interactions with CP epithelium can be monitored by microscopy. Thereby, the three-dimensional CP explant model can be used to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating immune cell migration through CP epithelium and other functions of choroid EC. We propose this platform can potentially be used in the search for therapeutic targets and intervention strategies to improve control of (drug) substances and (immune) cell entry into the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Interacting receptors at the neuronal plasma membrane represent an additional regulatory mode for intracellular transduction pathways. P2X4 receptor triggers fast neurotransmission responses via a transient increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. It has been proposed that the P2X4 receptor interacts with the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor in hippocampal neurons, but their binding stoichiometry and the role of P2X4 receptor activation by ATP on this crosstalking system remains unknown. Via pull-down assays, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy measurements of the receptors colocalization and expression at the plasma membrane, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, we have demonstrated that P2X4/5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor complexes can interact with each other in a 1:1 stoichiometric manner that is preserved after ATP binding. Also, macromolecular docking followed by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that the interaction energy of the P2X4 receptor with 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor is similar at the holo and the apo state of the P2X4 receptor, and the interacting 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor decreased the ATP binding energy of P2X4 receptor. Finally, the P2X4 receptor-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mobilization is inhibited by the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A interacting receptor. Altogether, these findings provide novel molecular insights into the allosteric regulation of P2X4/5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor complex in lipid bilayers of living cells via stoichiometric association, rather than accumulation or unspecific clustering of complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Mutation of the disc1 gene underlies a broad range of developmental neuropsychiatric defects, including schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. The pathophysiological phenotypes linked with disc1 mutation are due to the truncation of the DISC1 primary protein structure. This leads to a defective post-synaptic scaffolding and kinase—GSK3β and Erk1/2—signaling. As a result, synaptic function and maintenance are significantly impaired in the disc1 mutant brain. Among several other pathways, GSK3β and Erk1/2 are involved in insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1Rβ) kinase signaling. Although disc1 mutation alters these kinases, it is unclear if the mutation impacts IGF-1R expression and activity in the brain. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of active IGF-1Rβ (pIGF-1Rβ) is altered in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of disc1 mutant mice and vary with the dose of the mutation (homozygous and heterozygous). The expression of pIGF-1Rβ decreased significantly in 129S (hom, disc1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) brains. In contrast, 129S:B6 (het, disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) brains were characterized by an increase in pIGF-1Rβ when compared with the C57BL/6 (disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) level. The decrease in pIGF-1Rβ level for the 129S brains was accompanied by the loss of Akt activity (S473 pAkt) and decreased Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β (increased basal GSK3β). Additionally, hippocampal and cortical pErk1/2 activity increased in the 129S hippocampus and cortex. Although 129S:B6 recorded alterations in pIGF-1Rβ-pAkt-GSK3β (like 129S), there was no observable change in pErk1/2 activity for the heterozygote (disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) mutant. In addition to GSK3β inhibition, we conclude that pIGF-1R, pAkt, and pErk1/2 are potential targets in disc1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mutant brain. On the other hand, pIGF-1R and pAkt can be further explored in disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increased by several risk factors, including midlife obesity, female sex, and the depletion of estrogens in women as a consequence of menopause. Conversely, estrogen-based hormone therapies have been linked with protection from age-related increases in adiposity and dementia risk, although treatment efficacy appears to be affected by the age of initiation. Potential interactions between obesity, AD, aging, and estrogen treatment are likely to have significant impact on optimizing the use of hormone therapies in postmenopausal women. In the current study, we compared how treatment with the primary estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2), affects levels of AD-like neuropathology, behavioral impairment, and other neural and systemic effects of preexisting diet-induced obesity in female 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, experiments were conducted at chronological ages associated with both the early and late stages of reproductive senescence. We observed that E2 treatment was generally associated with significantly improved metabolic outcomes, including reductions in body weight, adiposity, and leptin, across both age groups. Conversely, neural benefits of E2 in obese mice, including decreased β-amyloid burden, improved behavioral performance, and reduced microglial activation, were observed only in the early aging group. These results are consistent with the perspective that neural benefits of estrogen-based therapies require initiation of treatment during early rather than later phases of reproductive aging. Further, the discordance between E2 protection against systemic versus neural effects of obesity across age groups suggests that pathways other than general metabolic function, perhaps including reduced microglial activation, contribute to the mechanism(s) of the observed E2 actions. These findings reinforce the potential systemic and neural benefits of estrogen therapies against obesity, while also highlighting the critical role of aging as a mediator of estrogens’ protective actions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reasoning requires initial encoding of the semantic association between premises or assumptions, retrieval of these semantic associations from memory, and recombination of information to draw a logical conclusion. Currently-held beliefs can interfere with the content of the assumptions if not congruent and inhibited. This study aimed to investigate the role of the hippocampus and hippocampal networks during logical reasoning tasks in which the congruence between currently-held beliefs and assumptions varies. Participants of younger and older age completed a series of syllogistic reasoning tasks in which two premises and one conclusion were presented and they were required to decide if the conclusion logically followed the premises. The belief load of premises was manipulated to be either congruent or incongruent with currently-held beliefs. Our whole-brain results showed that older adults recruited the hippocampus during the premise integration stage more than their younger counterparts. Functional connectivity using a hippocampal seed revealed that older, but not younger, adults recruited a hippocampal network that included anterior cingulate and inferior frontal regions when premises were believable. Importantly, this network contributed to better performance in believable inferences, only in older adults group. Further analyses suggested that, in older adults group, the integrity of the left cingulum bundle was associated with the higher rejection of believable premises more than unbelievable ones. Using multimodal imaging, this study highlights the importance of the hippocampus during premise integration and supports compensatory role of the hippocampal network during a logical reasoning task among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) refers to a group of disease conditions affecting the cerebral small vessels, which include the small arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and postcapillary venules in the brain. SVD is the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment and gait disturbances in aged people. There are several types of SVD, though arteriolosclerosis, which is mainly associated with hypertension, aging, and diabetes mellitus, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) comprise most SVD cases. The pathology of arteriolosclerosis-induced SVD is characterized by fibrinoid necrosis and lipohyalinosis, while CAA-associated SVD is characterized by progressive deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein in the cerebral vessels. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used for examination of SVD lesions; typical lesions are characterized by white matter hyperintensity, lacunar infarcts, enlargement of perivascular spaces (EPVS), microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), and cortical microinfarcts. The microvascular changes that occur in the small vessels are difficult to identify clearly; however, these consequent image findings can represent the SVD. There are two main strategies for prevention and treatment of SVD, i.e., pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification. In this review, we discuss clinical features of SVD, experimental models replicating SVD, and treatments to further understand the pathological and clinical features of SVD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;With recent technology, multivariate time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has played an important role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, discovering the association of wide range aging disease and chronic habit with ECG analysis still has room to be explored. This article mainly analyzes the possible relationship between common aging diseases or chorionic habits of medical record and ECG, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, or the habit of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In the research, we first conducted different ECG features, such as those of reduced binary pattern, waveform, and wavelet and then performed a k-means clustering analysis on the correlation between ECGs and the aforementioned diseases and habits, from which it is expected to find a firm association between them and the best characteristics that can be used for future research.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In summary, we discovered a weak and strong evidence between ECG and medical records. For strong evidence, most patients with diabetes are always assigned into a specified group no matter the number of classes in the k-means clustering, which means we can find their association between them. For weak evidence, smokers, obesity, and hypertension have less unique ECG feature vector, enabling clustering them into specific groups, so the ECGs might be used to identify smokers, obesity, and hypertension. It is also interesting that we found obesity and hypertension, which are thought to be related to cardiovascular system. However, they are not highly correlated in our clustering analysis, which might indirectly tell us that the impact of obesity and hypertension to our body is various. In addition, the clustering effect of waveform feature is better than the other two methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 In 1982, John Hopfield published a neural network model for memory retrieval, a model that became a cornerstone in theoretical neuroscience. In a recent paper, Krotov and Hopfield built on these early studies and showed how a network that incorporates a biologically plausible learning rule governed by a Lyapunov function can effectively perform classification tasks.</content>

 c9FTD/ALS and SCA36 are distinct diseases associated with similar hexanucleotide repeat expansions: G4C2 versus TG3C2. Todd et al. show that expressing these repeats in mice is sufficient to recapitulate each disease. The pathology and selective neurodegeneration characteristic of each disorder are therefore due to pathomechanisms intrinsic to each repeat sequence.</content>

In contrast to the symmetries of translation in space, rotation in space, and translation in time, the known laws of physics are not universally invariant under transformation of scale. However, a special case exists in which the action is scale invariant if it satisfies the following two constraints: 1) it must depend upon a scale-free Lagrangian, and 2) the Lagrangian must change under scale in the same way as the inverse time, 1t. Our contribution lies in the derivation of a generalised Lagrangian, in the form of a power series expansion, that satisfies these constraints. This generalised Lagrangian furnishes a normal form for dynamic causal models–state space models based upon differential equations–that can be used to distinguish scale symmetry from scale freeness in empirical data. We establish face validity with an analysis of simulated data, in which we show how scale symmetry can be identified and how the associated conserved quantities can be estimated in neuronal time series.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YizQiAJ3cF0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Microbiomes are complex ecological systems that play crucial roles in understanding natural phenomena from human disease to climate change. Especially in human gut microbiome studies, where collecting clinical samples can be arduous, the number of taxa considered in any one study often exceeds the number of samples ten to one hundred-fold. This discrepancy decreases the power of studies to identify meaningful differences between samples, increases the likelihood of false positive results, and subsequently limits reproducibility. Despite the vast collections of microbiome data already available, biome-specific patterns of microbial structure are not currently leveraged to inform studies. Here, we derive microbiome-level properties by applying an embedding algorithm to quantify taxon co-occurrence patterns in over 18,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) microbiome crowdsourcing effort. We then compare the predictive power of models trained using properties, normalized taxonomic count data, and another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, Principal Component Analysis in categorizing samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We show that predictive models trained using property data are the most accurate, robust, and generalizable, and that property-based models can be trained on one dataset and deployed on another with positive results. Furthermore, we find that properties correlate significantly with known metabolic pathways. Using these properties, we are able to extract known and new bacterial metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease across two completely independent studies. By providing a set of pre-trained embeddings, we allow any V4 16S amplicon study to apply the publicly informed properties to increase the statistical power, reproducibility, and generalizability of analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a2nNMPsolNE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We present a flexible, open source R package designed to obtain biological and epidemiological insights from serological datasets. Characterising past exposures for multi-strain pathogens poses a specific statistical challenge: observed antibody responses measured in serological assays depend on multiple unobserved prior infections that produce cross-reactive antibody responses. We provide a general modelling framework to jointly infer infection histories and describe immune responses generated by these infections using antibody titres against current and historical strains. We do this by linking latent infection dynamics with a mechanistic model of antibody kinetics that generates expected antibody titres over time. Our aim is to provide a flexible package to identify infection histories that can be applied to a range of pathogens. We present two case studies to illustrate how our model can infer key immunological parameters, such as antibody titre boosting, waning and cross-reaction, as well as latent epidemiological processes such as attack rates and age-stratified infection risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fu5dew9vVUk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

It is difficult to predict how antibodies will behave when mixed together, even after each has been independently characterized. Here, we present a statistical mechanical model for the activity of antibody mixtures that accounts for whether pairs of antibodies bind to distinct or overlapping epitopes. This model requires measuring &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; individual antibodies and their n ( n - 1 ) 2 pairwise interactions to predict the 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; potential combinations. We apply this model to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies and find that the activity of antibody mixtures can be predicted without positing synergy at the molecular level. In addition, we demonstrate how the model can be used in reverse, where straightforward experiments measuring the activity of antibody mixtures can be used to infer the molecular interactions between antibodies. Lastly, we generalize this model to analyze engineered multidomain antibodies, where components of different antibodies are tethered together to form novel amalgams, and characterize how well it predicts recently designed influenza antibodies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kbknkvVoGHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>
