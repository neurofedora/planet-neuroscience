 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous evidence has shown a link between neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and melatonin. The data in the literature about the impact of the hormone under different experimental PD conditions are quite controversial, and its effect on memory impairment in the disease is very poorly explored. The current research was aimed at investigating the role of melatonin pretreatment on memory and motor behavior in healthy rats and those with the partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD. All rodents were pretreated with melatonin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for 5 days. At 24 h and 7 days after the first treatment for healthy rats, and at the second and third week post-lesion for those with PD, the animals were tested behaviorally (apomorphine-induced rotations, rotarod, and passive avoidance tests). The neurochemical levels of dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin (Sero) in the brain were also determined. The results showed that in healthy animals, melatonin pretreatment had amnestic and motor-suppressive effects and did not change the levels of measured brain neurotransmitters. In animals with PD, melatonin pretreatment exerted a neuroprotective effect, manifested as a significantly decreased number of apomorphine-induced rotations, reduced number of falls in the rotarod test, and improved memory performance. The brain DA and ACh concentrations in the same animals were restored to the control levels, and those of NA and Sero did not change. Our results demonstrate a beneficial effect of melatonin on memory and motor disturbance in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using potential biomarkers may help with implementing early therapeutic interventions, monitoring, and ultimately disease treatment. The current study aimed to evaluate serum levels of DKK-1, TNC, and oxidative stress markers, as well as analyzing the expression of LRP6, GSK3A, and GSK3B genes in patients with AD. Serum levels of DKK-1, TNC, TOS, TAC, and MDA were measured in 40 AD patients and 40 healthy individuals. Additionally, the relative expressions of LRP6, GSK3A, and GSK3B genes in whole blood were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to investigate the incremental diagnostic value of each factor in the study groups. Mean serum levels of DKK-1, TNC, TOS, TAC, and MDA were significantly higher in the AD group compared to the healthy group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, a significant difference was observed in the expression of LRP6 and GSK3A genes (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) between patients and healthy groups. However, the expression of GSK3B did not significantly differ between the two groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). With considerable sensitivity and specificity, ROC analysis demonstrated the diagnostic efficacy of DKK-1 and TNC serum levels in AD within an area under the ROC curve of ≥ 0.98 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ˂ 0.001). The results showed that evaluating serum levels of DKK-1 and TNC, as well as assessing the expression of LRP6, could be utilized for diagnosis and monitoring of AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dietary zinc deficiency may lead to olfactory deficits, whose mechanism remains largely elusive. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), a type of glial cells that support the function and neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (OB), may play a pivotal role in the maintenance of the olfactory system. In the present study, we established a rat model of dietary zinc deficiency and found that severe zinc deficiency, but not marginal zinc deficiency, caused significantly reduced food intake, growth retardation, and apparent olfactory deficit in growing rats. We showed that severe zinc deficiency resulted in the loss of OECs in the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) of the olfactory bulb. In addition, we revealed that the number of TUNEL-positive cells increased markedly in the region, suggesting an involvement of apoptotic cell death in zinc deficiency-induced loss of OECs. Moreover, we found that treatment with zinc chelator &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;′&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;′,-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) triggered the apoptosis of in vitro-cultured primary OECs. The apoptosis of OECs was correlated with significantly elevated expression of p53. Importantly, TUNEL and CCK-8 assays both demonstrated that treatment with p53 antagonist pifithrin-α (PFT-α) markedly attenuated TPEN-induced OEC apoptosis. These findings implicated that p53-triggered apoptosis of OECs might play an integral role in zinc deficiency-induced olfactory malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Astrocyte activation is characterized by hypertrophy with increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), whose expression may involve pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, the effects of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 on nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signalling, intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and GFAP expression were investigated. In human glioblastoma astrocytoma U-373 MG cells, IL-6 and TNF-α, but not IL-4 or IL-10, increased iNOS, cGMP, [Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and GFAP expression. The inhibitors of iNOS (1400 W), soluble guanylyl cyclase (ODQ) and IP3 receptors (ryanodine and 2-APB) reversed the increase in cGMP or [Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, and prevented GFAP expression. In rat striatal slices, IL-6 and TNF-α, at variance with IL-4 and IL-10, promoted a concentration-dependent increase in Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux, an effect prevented by 1400 W, ODQ and RY/2APB. These data were confirmed by in vivo studies, where IL-6, TNF-α or the NO donor DETA/NO injected in the striatum of anaesthetised rats increased cGMP levels and increased GFAP expression. The present findings point to NO/cGMP-dependent calcium signalling as part of the mechanism mediating IL-6- and TNF-α-induced GFAP expression. As this process plays a fundamental role in driving neurotoxicity, targeting NO/cGMP-dependent calcium signalling may constitute a new approach for therapeutic interventions in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Serum miRNAs (miRs) have gained consideration as encouraging molecular markers for cancer diagnosis and prediction of prognosis. The authors aimed to identify the exact role of miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 among glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients before and after standard treatment, and correlate their expression with survival pattern. The study included 25 GBM patients and 20 healthy controls. Serum miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 expression were analyzed before and after treatment using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The diagnostic efficacy for the tested miRs was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the relation of miRs expression versus clinical criteria for GBM was assessed. Patients’ survival patterns were examined versus miRs expression levels. A significant difference was reported between miRs expression among the enrolled individuals. Both miR-17-5p and miR-221 reported significant elevations in GBM patients who: are above 60 years old, underwent biopsy resection, have a non-frontal lesion, with tumor size above 5 cm, and with performance status equals 2 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status. With regard to miR-125b, a significant difference was detected according to surgery strategy, primary lesion of the tumor, and ECOG status. MiRs levels were significantly decreased for GBM patients after treatment. Survival patterns demonstrated an increase in miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 in GBM patients with worse progression-free survival and among those with worse overall survival. Detection of serum miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 aids in the prediction of prognosis and response to treatment strategy for GBM patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurotrauma is among the main causes of human disability and mortality. Nerve injury impairs not only neurons but also causes death of satellite glial cells remote from the injury site. We studied the dynamics of expression of different proapoptotic proteins (E2F1, p53, caspase 3) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of a rat after sciatic nerve transection. TUNEL staining and immunoblotting were used for analysis of cell apoptosis and axotomy-induced biochemical changes. Apoptosis of glial cells was observed at 24 h after sciatic nerve transection and increased on day 7, when apoptosis of some neurons only started. The earliest proapoptotic event in the injured DRG was overexpression of transcription factor E2F1 at 4 h after sciatic nerve transection. This preceded the induction of p53 and cleavage of caspase 3 at 24-h post-axotomy. The nerve injury marker amyloid precursor protein and the nerve regeneration marker GAP-43 were overexpressed in DRG on day 7 after sciatic nerve transection. We also developed a novel fluorescence method for differential visualization of the rat DRG and nerves by means of double staining with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 that impart red and blue-green fluorescence, respectively. The present experiments showed that glial cells remote from the nerve transection site were more vulnerable to axotomy than DRG neurons. E2F1 and p53 may be considered promising molecular targets for development of potential neuroprotective agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects male and female patients differently. Several studies have been performed to explain the gender differences in MS susceptibility, but the genetic causes underlying gender differences remain unknown. The association between multiple sclerosis and the HLA-DRB1*15:01 haplotype has been confirmed to be female-specific. We hypothesized other immunological components such as lnc-DC may be gender-specific among multiple sclerosis patients, especially when MS patients are negative for the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele. Therefore, the current study, considering the results of previous studies, aimed to evaluate the expression level of the lnc-DC gene in HLA-DRB1*15:01-negative female patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). A total of 50 MS female patients and 50 female healthy controls were enrolled in this observational case-control study. HLA-DRB1*15:01, as a critical risk factor for MS, was ruled out in all patients. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from all patients and total RNA was isolated and cDNA synthesis was carried out. The gene expression of lnc-DC was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. Our results have shown that lnc-DC expression level was significantly higher in total MS female patients compared with female controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0044). In addition, the correlation between lnc-DC with disease duration, EDSS, and age at onset did not reach a statistical significance in our study (r = 0.0336, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.817; r = 0.0914, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5278 and r = 0.0743, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.6083, respectively). Our results give further evidence that lnc-DC may play a gender-dependent role in MS pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this study, we explored the effects of propofol on oxidative stress response, cytokine secretion, and autophagy in rats with ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury and oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-stimulated primary microglia and analyzed the role of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway in this process. Rat models of I/R injury and OGD models of primary microglia were established. Neurobehavioral scores were evaluated 24 h after reperfusion, and oxidative stress indicators, cytokine levels, and autophagy-related markers of rats and OGD-activated primary microglia were evaluated. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was also assessed. The results showed that propofol pretreatment can improve nerve function in rats with I/R injury, inhibit oxidative stress response and inflammatory cytokine secretion, and promote autophagy in rats with I/R injury and OGD-activated primary microglia, and that the PI3K-Akt pathway was activated in this process. Following the addition of a PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, the effects of propofol on autophagy in rats with I/R injury and primary microglia were inhibited significantly. The results indicate that propofol promotes autophagy via the PI3K/Akt pathway in cerebral I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Stress is considered as an important risk factor in the progression and the onset of many disorders such as multiple sclerosis. However, metabolite changes as a result of demyelination under the detrimental effects of stress are not well understood. Thus, 36 female Wistar rats (i.e., groups (1) no-cuprizone (Cont), (2) no-stress + cuprizone-treated (Cup), (3) physical stress + cuprizone-treated (P-Cup), (4) psychological stress + cuprizone-treated (Psy-Cup), (5) physical stress + no-cuprizone-treated (P), (6) psychological stress + no-cuprizone-treated (Psy)) were used in this study. Following induction of repetitive stress, cuprizone treatment was carried out for 6 weeks to instigate demyelination in all groups except the control animal. Relative metabolite concentrations of the brain were investigated by single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (reporting &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glycerophosphocholine with phosphocholine (tCho) relative to total creatine (tCr)). According to &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS, rats in the Cup group indicated a reduction in NAA/ tCr (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) as well as tCho/ tCr (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) compared with that in the Cont group. In contrast, in both stress + cuprizone-treated groups, NAA/tCr and tCho/tCr ratios remarkably increased versus the Cup group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and the Cont group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for the Psy-Cup group and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 for the P-Cup group). Both P and Psy groups revealed normal metabolite concentrations similar to the Cont group 6 weeks post stress. Seemingly, in the case of cuprizone alone, decreased level of metabolites is mainly relevant to neuronal cell impairments. Meanwhile, as a result of oxidative stress enhancement due to stress exposure, oligodendrocyte becomes the main victim indicating the increased level of metabolite ratios.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Exosomes are cell-derived membrane vesicles with cargo that can be transported into receiver cells to exert their biological roles. Exosomal RNA signature profiles and exosome-derived proteomics are often used to explore the molecular regulation of diseases, and can mirror the conditional state of their tissue of origin, thus serving as biomarkers. The onset of meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) is concealed, and early diagnosis is difficult. To enable early diagnosis of MC, it is essential to identify new biomarkers. Few studies have investigated the function of exosomes in MC. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to examine the mRNA profiles of exosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MC. We further analyzed the functions and signaling pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes in exosomes to reveal the putative mechanisms by which the exosomal mRNAs function in MC. In summary, this study identified biomarker candidates for MC, and provided new insights into the significant role of exosomal mRNA regulation in MC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Stroke is one of the highest incidence neurological disorder with great morbidity and mortality rate. The secondary neuroinflammation contributed by microglial activation is a consequential response observed in the pathogenesis of stroke. High-mobility group box 1, a non-histone nuclear protein, interacts with immune cells, such as microglia, and leads to a cascade amplification of the secondary neuroinflammatory responses, which are related to neuronal damage later. Melatonin is a neurohormone, well-known as its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. However, until now, more findings are required for better understanding about anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin on HMGB1 and HMGB1-triggered pathway in LPS-induced microglial activation. Melatonin effect on the viability of BV2 microglial cells was measured by CCK-8 assay; mRNA levels of HMGB1 and other inflammatory cytokines were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; the protein expression levels of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and SIRT1 were detected by Western blot, and HMGB1 translocation and release from BV2 microglial cells were examined by immunofluorescence assay. The results of this study demonstrated that melatonin suppressed LPS-triggered BV2 microglial activation-mediated inflammation by inhibiting high expression and release of HMGB1 and moderating the activation of subsequent TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which was activated by SIRT1 elevation. Furthermore, LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) was notably reversed by melatonin pre-treatment. In summary, our findings suggest that melatonin may act as a promising therapeutic agent for reducing post-stroke neuroinflammation by targeting HMGB1 and the subsequent signaling axis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of circRNA cerebellar degeneration–related protein 1 antisense RNA(CDR1as)/miR-671/GSK3β signaling pathway on PC12 cell injury and the mechanism of Exendin-4 (Ex-4) in PC12 cell injury protection. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of circular RNA CDR1as and miR-671 in PC12 cells. By overexpressing or knocking out CDR1as, miR-671, and GSK3β, the role of CDR1as, miR-671, and GSK3β in PC12 cell injury was analyzed. The binding of CDR1as to miR-671 and GSK3β to miR-671 was verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. PC12 cells were treated with 1-methyl-4 phenyl-pyridine ion (MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to construct a PC12 cell damage model. PC12 cell transfection experiments were used to confirm the role of CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β signal axis in PC12 cell damage, and the role of Ex-4 in the association of circRNA CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β signaling axis and PC12 cell damage. PC12 cell damage was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Ex-4 reversed the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and GSK-3β in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-treated PC12 cells, and reduced MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced PC12 cell damage. CircRNA CDR1as upregulated the expression of GSK3β by sponge miR-671. Ex-4 downregulated CDR1as expression and upregulated miR-671 expression in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced PC12 cell. Silencing of CDR1as reduced MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced PC12 cell damage. CDR1as transfection downregulated the expression of miR-671 in PC12 cells, promoted the expression and phosphorylated of GSK3β, and induced PC12 cell damage. GSK3β silencing reversed CDR1as-induced PC12 cell damage. CDR1as promoted the phosphorylation level of GSK3β in PC12 cells to cause cell damage; Ex-4 reversed the phosphorylation of GSK3β caused by CDR1as in PC12 cells and reduced the PC12 cell damage caused by CDR1as. Ex-4 reverses the damage of PC12 cells induced by CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ischemic stroke is the primary cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced microcirculatory dysfunction and organ injury generally occur after ischemic stroke. Several studies have shown that intermedin (IMD) has a regulating function on cerebral microcirculation and blood-brain barrier via relaxing cerebral vessels and improving the local blood supply after cerebral ischemia. However, a unified conclusion has not been reached, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To observe and analyze the changes of cerebral microcirculation perfusion of cerebral IRI by IMD post-treatment in the rats and further explore the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of IMD on cerebral IRI. Thirty-nine rats were divided into three groups: sham, I/R, and I/R + IMD groups. After IMD ischemia post-treatment, the rat cerebral infarction rate and the degree of neurological deficit were evaluated by TTC staining and neurological function score; the changes in the amount of cerebral microcirculation implantation on the injured side of the rats were observed by laser Doppler; the pathological changes and cell ultrastructure of rat cortex and hippocampus were observed by HE staining and transmission electron microscopy; the neuron apoptosis in the rat cortex and hippocampus was detected by TUNEL staining and immunohistochemical staining. Impaired neurological function, abnormal cortical/hippocampal neuron morphology, and the proportion of cerebral infarction were significantly improved in the IMD group compared with the I/R group, which suggested a possible neuroprotective role of IMD. IMD treatment also increased the average perfusion of cerebral surface microcirculation in rats by astonished 42.7 times. Finally, IMD administration decreased the caspase-3- and Bax-positive cell numbers and apoptotic cell ratio. IMD has a significant protective effect on neuronal damage caused by cerebral I/R in rats by improving cerebral microcirculation and inhibiting apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a destructive neuropsychiatric illness affecting millions of people worldwide. The correlation between RELN gene polymorphisms and SCZ was investigated by previous researches, though the results remained conflicting. Based on the available studies, we conducted this meta-analysis to provide a more comprehensive outcome on whether the RELN gene polymorphisms (rs7341475 and rs262355) are associated with SCZ. A total of 15 studies with 25,403 subjects (9047 cases and 16,356 controls) retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, Wiley, BMC, Cochrane, Springer, MDPI, SAGE, and Google Scholar up to June 2020 were included. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. The heterogeneity was checked using &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistics and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;-test, whereas publication bias was also measured. The rs7341475 polymorphism showed a significantly lower risk for SCZ for the allele (A vs. G: OR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.87–0.99), codominant 1 (AG vs. GG: OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.85–0.99), dominant model (AA+AG vs. GG: OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.86–0.98), and over dominant model (AG vs. AA+GG: OR = 0.92, 95%Cl = 0.86–0.99). The allele, codominant model 1, and dominant models remained statistically significant after the correction of the Bonferroni (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.025). Subgroup analysis confirmed the association of allele and dominant models in the Caucasian after Bonferroni correction. For rs262355 polymorphism, a significantly increased risk of SCZ was found only in Caucasians for codominant 2, dominant, and allele models, but significance exists only for the allele model after Bonferroni correction. Publication bias was found in the case of codominant 2 and recessive models for rs7341475 in the overall population, but this publication was not found after performing the Bonferroni correction or after performing the subgroup analysis. No such publication was found for rs262355. The results suggest that RELN rs7341475 is associated with a lower risk of SCZ in the overall population and Caucasian population, but rs262355 is associated with an increased risk of SCZ only in the Caucasian population.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Implantation of a nerve guidance conduit (NGC) carrying neuroprotective factors is promising for repairing peripheral nerve injury. Here, we developed a novel strategy for repairing peripheral nerve injury by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–encapsulated chitosan in laminin-coated nanofiber of Poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) conduit and transplantation of rat adipose–derived stem cells (r-ADSCs) suspended in alginate. Then, the beneficial effect of AuNPs, BDNF, and r-ADSCs on nerve regeneration was evaluated in rat sciatic nerve transection model. In vivo experiments showed that the combination of AuNPs- and BDNF-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles in laminin-coated nanofiber of PLGA conduit with r-ADSCs could synergistically facilitate nerve regeneration. Furthermore, the in vivo histology, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral results demonstrated that the AuNPs- and BDNF-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles in NGC could significantly reinforce the repair performance of r-ADSCs, which may also contribute to the therapeutic outcome of the AuNPs, BDNF, and r-ADSCs strategies. In this study, we found that the combination of AuNPs and BDNF releases in NGC with r-ADSCs may represent a new potential strategy for peripheral nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common devastating injuries, with little possibility of recovery in humans. However, zebrafish efficiently regenerate functional nervous system tissue after SCI. Therefore, the spinal cord transection model of adult zebrafish was applied to explore the role of ATF6 in neuro-recovery. Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is a type-II transmembrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ATF6 target genes could improve ER homeostasis, which contributes to cytoprotection. Herein, we found that the ATF6 level increased at 12 h and 3 days post SCI, and returned to sham levels at 7 days post SCI. ATF6-expressing motor neurons were present in the central canal of the spinal cord and increased at 12 h post SCI. ATF6 morpholino treatment showed that inhibition of ATF6 delayed locomotor recovery and hindered neuron axon regrowth in SCI zebrafish. Furthermore, we investigated the role of both binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip) and C/EBP homologous transcription factor protein (CHOP), the two target genes of ATF6. We found that Bip expression significantly increased in the spinal cord at 7 days after SCI, which served as a pro-survival chaperone. Our results also showed that CHOP expression significantly decreased in the spinal cord at 7 days after SCI, which was identified as a protein involved in apoptosis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ATF6 may contribute to the functional recovery after SCI in adult zebrafish, via up-regulation of Bip and down-regulation of CHOP to restore the homeostasis of ER.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Malignant astrocytomas presenting in humans of any age group are a challenge to diagnose and treat. Hence, there is a quest for new markers to ascertain their grades and predict disease outcomes. Proline, glutamic acid, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), a nuclear receptor co-regulator, is an oncogene found in various cancers. We postulate that by screening for PELP1, its correlation with survival outcomes of patients across various grades can indicate a plausible novel diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in gliomas. Immunostaining of 100 cases of astrocytomas for PELP1 was performed on paraffin-embedded sections. Results showed that PELP1 expression increases with higher grades; the mean H-score of PELP1 in grade-I astrocytomas was determined to be 112.3, whereas in grade-IV it was 235.1 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0001). Survival analysis of patients with H-score of 200–300 was only 8.8% and 68.8% in patients with scores of 0–100. PELP1 expression in high-grade astrocytomas is an important factor in determining the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Nerve demyelination or axonal lesions are characteristic of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN). Previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA-338 can regulate the differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells and promote injured peripheral nerves in rats. In this study, we used microRNA-338 coded lentivirus vector (miR-338-LV) in a Lewis rat EAN model, in with the conjunction P0 peptide 180–199 which was injected into the footpads of animals to induce immunization. The clinical scores of miR-338-LV and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (positive drug) groups were significantly superior to those of untreated group at disease peak and disease plateau (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The nerve conduction velocity and the compound nerve action potential amplitude of miR-338-LV and IVIg groups increased significantly compared to those of the untreated group at disease peak (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). At disease peak, myelin swelling, cavity formation, and lamellae separation showed improvement in miR-338-LV and IVIg groups compared to untreated group. S100 and NF200 expression in miR-338-LV and IVIg groups increased compared to that in untreated group. Iba1 and S100 co-expression in Schwann cells in miR-338-LV and IVIg groups decreased compared to that in untreated group, which was indicative of the reduced conversion of Schwann cells into inflammatory cells. Overall, miR-338-LV in sciatic nerves might improve neuromuscular function in EAN by inhibiting the conversion of Schwann cells into inflammatory cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system is a rare intractable disease induced by chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Neurological deficits, such as cerebellar ataxia and hearing difficulties, gradually progress if left undiagnosed. Hemosiderin deposition is irreversible because standard medical treatment has not yet been established. Interventions at the source of bleeding may be the key to a preferable outcome of treatment for chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, the source is not clear in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Among the consecutive cases diagnosed with a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, cases of superficial siderosis associated with a CSF leak due to a ventral dural defect were retrospectively analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Among 77 cases of a CSF leak, 7 cases (9%) of superficial siderosis were identified (median age of 59 years, male, 4 cases). Defects were diagnosed on 1-mm sliced fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition MRI (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 5), conventional myelographic CT (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), or dynamic myelographic CT (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1) at high thoracic levels (T1–T4). All defects were repaired by direct neurosurgery. During surgery, continuous bleeding from the epidural veins of the internal vertebral venous plexus was identified as the source of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Epidural CSF pulsations through the defect prevented clot formation by the epidural veins. Dural repair stopped free communication between the subarachnoid and epidural spaces, leading to the disappearance of chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bleeding from the epidural venous plexus may be the cause of superficial siderosis associated with ventral dural defects. Neurosurgical repair may stop the progression of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Persistent dizziness without a clear cause is common in older adults. We explored whether an anxiety-driven preoccupation with consciously processing balance may underpin the distorted perceptions of unsteadiness that characterises ‘unexplained’ dizziness in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We experimentally induced anxiety about losing one’s balance (through a postural threat manipulation) in a cohort of asymptomatic older adults and evaluated associated changes in perceived stability, conscious movement processing and postural control. These outcomes were also assessed when performing a distracting cognitive task designed to prevent anxiety-related conscious movement processing, in addition to during baseline conditions (ground level).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Despite a lack of increase in postural sway amplitude (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.316), participants reported reductions in perceived stability during postural threat compared to baseline (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). A multiple linear regression revealed that anxiety-related conscious movement processing independently predicted perceptions of instability during this condition (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006). These changes were accompanied by alterations in postural control previously associated with functional dizziness, namely high-frequency postural sway and disrupted interaction between open- and closed-loop postural control (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;s &amp;lt; 0.014). While the distraction task successfully reduced conscious processing (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012), leading to greater perceived stability (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.010), further increases in both postural sway frequency (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002) and dominance of closed-loop control (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.029) were observed.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;These findings implicate the role of conscious movement processing in the formation of distorted perceptions of unsteadiness, suggesting that such perceptions may be modifiable by reducing an over-reliance on conscious processes to regulate balance.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulating evidence shows that SQSTM1 plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which represent a neurodegenerative disease continuum. Here, we report a novel SQSTM1 variant in a patient presenting with progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and progressive bulbar palsy (PBP). Relevant literature about FTD and FTD-ALS caused by SQSTM1 mutation was reviewed to better understand its clinical features.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We collected data from a 66-year-old male patient with a novel heterozygous variant (c.995C &amp;gt; G, p.S332X) in the SQSTM1 gene who was diagnosed with PNFA and PBP and performed a PubMed literature search using the advanced research criteria: [(“frontotemporal lobar degeneration”) OR (“frontotemporal dementia”) OR (“amyotrophic lateral sclerosis”) OR (“motor neuron disease”)] AND (“SQSTM1”). The clinical features of FTD and FTD-ALS related to SQSTM1 mutation were summarized based on previous cases and our new case.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The initial symptom of the current patient was progressive verb finding difficulties and effortful speech output, which developed into dysarthria and dysphagia in subsequent months. The results, including tongue atrophy, fasciculations, neurogenic changes, and mild left dominant hypometabolism of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the frontal cortex, suggest the possibility of PNFA and PBP. A novel likely pathogenic heterozygous variant (c.995C &amp;gt; G, p.S332X) in the SQSTM1 gene was identified. The literature search revealed a total of 33 FTD and FTD-ALS cases related to the SQSTM1 mutation with detailed clinical information. The mean age of onset (including our patient) was 63.5 ± 9.7 years. bvFTD was the most common clinical phenotype.

Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences (syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods. Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently. Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o0EKUVEIM4M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Amber Kunkel, Michael White, Patrice Piola&lt;/p&gt;

Emergence of resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs in the Greater Mekong Subregion has made elimination of malaria from this region a global priority; it also complicates its achievement. Novel drug strategies such as triple artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) and chemoprophylaxis have been proposed to help limit resistance and accelerate elimination. The objective of this study was to better understand the potential impacts of triple ACTs and chemoprophylaxis, using a mathematical model parameterized using data from Cambodia. We used a simple compartmental model to predict trends in malaria incidence and resistance in Cambodia from 2020–2025 assuming no changes in transmission since 2018. We assessed three scenarios: a status quo scenario with artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) as treatment; a triple ACT scenario with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) plus mefloquine (MQ) as treatment; and a chemoprophylaxis scenario with ASMQ as treatment plus DP as chemoprophylaxis. We predicted MQ resistance to increase under the status quo scenario. Triple ACT treatment reversed the spread of MQ resistance, but had no impact on overall malaria incidence. Joint MQ-PPQ resistance declined under the status quo scenario for the baseline parameter set and most sensitivity analyses. Compared to the status quo, triple ACT treatment limited spread of MQ resistance but also slowed declines in PPQ resistance in some sensitivity analyses. The chemoprophylaxis scenario decreased malaria incidence, but increased the spread of strains resistant to both MQ and PPQ; both effects began to reverse after the intervention was removed. We conclude that triple ACTs may limit spread of MQ resistance in the Cambodia, but would have limited impact on malaria incidence and might slow declines in PPQ resistance. Chemoprophylaxis could have greater impact on incidence but also carries higher risks of resistance. Aggressive strategies to limit transmission the GMS are needed to achieve elimination goals, but any intervention should be accompanied by monitoring for drug resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YoyRNaYW9uk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The activity of a border ownership selective (BOS) neuron indicates where a foreground object is located relative to its (classical) receptive field (RF). A population of BOS neurons thus provides an important component of perceptual grouping, the organization of the visual scene into objects. In previous theoretical work, it has been suggested that this grouping mechanism is implemented by a population of dedicated grouping (“&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;”) cells that integrate the activity of the distributed feature cells representing an object and, by feedback, modulate the same cells, thus making them border ownership selective. The feedback modulation by &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; cells is thought to also provide the mechanism for object-based attention. A recent modeling study showed that modulatory common feedback, implemented by synapses with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors, accounts for the experimentally observed synchrony in spike trains of BOS neurons and the shape of cross-correlations between them, including its dependence on the attentional state. However, that study was limited to pairs of BOS neurons with consistent border ownership preferences, defined as two neurons tuned to respond to the same visual object, in which attention decreases synchrony. But attention has also been shown to increase synchrony in neurons with inconsistent border ownership selectivity. Here we extend the computational model from the previous study to fully understand these effects of attention. We postulate the existence of a second type of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;-cell that represents spatial attention by modulating the activity of all BOS cells in a spatially defined area. Simulations of this model show that a combination of spatial and object-based mechanisms fully accounts for the observed pattern of synchrony between BOS neurons. Our results suggest that modulatory feedback from &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;-cells may underlie both spatial and object-based attention.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CgXngfJWR94&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Adaptive immune system uses T cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize pathogens and to consequently initiate immune responses. TCRs can be sequenced from individuals and methods analyzing the specificity of the TCRs can help us better understand individuals’ immune status in different disorders. For this task, we have developed TCRGP, a novel Gaussian process method that predicts if TCRs recognize specified epitopes. TCRGP can utilize the amino acid sequences of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from TCR&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; and TCR&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; chains and learn which CDRs are important in recognizing different epitopes. Our comprehensive evaluation with epitope-specific TCR sequencing data shows that TCRGP achieves on average higher prediction accuracy in terms of AUROC score than existing state-of-the-art methods in epitope-specificity predictions. We also propose a novel analysis approach for combined single-cell RNA and TCR&lt;i&gt;αβ&lt;/i&gt; (scRNA+TCR&lt;i&gt;αβ&lt;/i&gt;) sequencing data by quantifying epitope-specific TCRs with TCRGP and identify HBV-epitope specific T cells and their transcriptomic states in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8iIAurtMVdo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This paper reports a comprehensive study on the applicability of ultra-scaled
ferroelectric FinFETs with 6 nm thick hafnium zirconium oxide layer for
neuromorphic computing in the presence of process variation, flicker noise, and
device aging. An intricate study has been conducted about the impact of such
variations on the inference accuracy of pre-trained neural networks consisting
of analog, quaternary (2-bit/cell) and binary synapse. A pre-trained neural
network with 97.5% inference accuracy on the MNIST dataset has been adopted as
the baseline. Process variation, flicker noise, and device aging
characterization have been performed and a statistical model has been developed
to capture all these effects during neural network simulation. Extrapolated
retention above 10 years have been achieved for binary read-out procedure. We
have demonstrated that the impact of (1) retention degradation due to the oxide
thickness scaling, (2) process variation, and (3) flicker noise can be abated
in ferroelectric FinFET based binary neural networks, which exhibits superior
performance over quaternary and analog neural network, amidst all variations.
The performance of a neural network is the result of coalesced performance of
device, architecture and algorithm. This research corroborates the
applicability of deeply scaled ferroelectric FinFETs for non-von Neumann
computing with proper combination of architecture and algorithm.

 &lt;p&gt;Attention is an effective mechanism to improve the deep model capability.
Squeeze-and-Excite (SE) introduces a light-weight attention branch to enhance
the network's representational power. The attention branch is gated using the
Sigmoid function and multiplied by the feature map's trunk branch. It is too
sensitive to coordinate and balance the trunk and attention branches'
contributions. To control the attention branch's influence, we propose a new
attention method, called Shift-and-Balance (SB). Different from
Squeeze-and-Excite, the attention branch is regulated by the learned control
factor to control the balance, then added into the feature map's trunk branch.
Experiments show that Shift-and-Balance attention significantly improves the
accuracy compared to Squeeze-and-Excite when applied in more layers, increasing
more size and capacity of a network. Moreover, Shift-and-Balance attention
achieves better or close accuracy compared to the state-of-art Dynamic
Convolution.

 &lt;p&gt;Background: The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation method mainly refers to the division of brain tissue, which can be divided into tissue parts such as white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The segmentation results can provide a basis for medical image registration, 3D reconstruction, and visualization. Generally, MRI images have defects such as partial volume effects, uneven grayscale, and noise. Therefore, in practical applications, the segmentation of brain MRI images has difficulty obtaining high accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: The fuzzy clustering algorithm establishes the expression of the uncertainty of the sample category and can describe the ambiguity brought by the partial volume effect to the brain MRI image, so it is very suitable for brain MRI image segmentation (B-MRI-IS). The classic fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is extremely sensitive to noise and offset fields. If the algorithm is used directly to segment the brain MRI image, the ideal segmentation result cannot be obtained. Accordingly, considering the defects of MRI medical images, this study uses an improved multiview FCM clustering algorithm (IMV-FCM) to improve the algorithm’s segmentation accuracy of brain images. IMV-FCM uses a view weight adaptive learning mechanism so that each view obtains the optimal weight according to its cluster contribution. The final division result is obtained through the view ensemble method. Under the view weight adaptive learning mechanism, the coordination between various views is more flexible, and each view can be adaptively learned to achieve better clustering effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The segmentation results of a large number of brain MRI images show that IMV-FCM has better segmentation performance and can accurately segment brain tissue. Compared with several related clustering algorithms, the IMV-FCM algorithm has better adaptability and better clustering performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain computer interaction (BCI) based on EEG can help patients with limb dyskinesia to carry out daily life and rehabilitation training. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and large individual differences, EEG feature extraction and classification have the problems of low accuracy and efficiency. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a recognition method of motor imagery EEG signal based on deep convolution network. This method firstly aims at the problem of low quality of EEG signal characteristic data, and uses short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and continuous Morlet wavelet transform (CMWT) to preprocess the collected experimental data sets based on time series characteristics. So as to obtain EEG signals that are distinct and have time-frequency characteristics. And based on the improved CNN network model to efficiently recognize EEG signals, to achieve high-quality EEG feature extraction and classification. Further improve the quality of EEG signal feature acquisition, and ensure the high accuracy and precision of EEG signal recognition. Finally, the proposed method is validated based on the BCI competiton dataset and laboratory measured data. Experimental results show that the accuracy of this method for EEG signal recognition is 0.9324, the precision is 0.9653, and the AUC is 0.9464. It shows good practicality and applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Measurement of serum neurofilament light chain concentration (sNfL) promises to become a convenient, cost effective and meaningful adjunct for multiple sclerosis (MS) prognostication as well as monitoring disease activity in response to treatment. Despite the remarkable progress and an ever-increasing literature supporting the potential role of sNfL in MS over the last 5 years, a number of hurdles remain before this test can be integrated into routine clinical practice. In this review we highlight these hurdles, broadly classified by concerns relating to clinical validity and analytical validity. After setting out an aspirational roadmap as to how many of these issues can be overcome, we conclude by sharing our vision of the current and future role of sNfL assays in MS clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To investigate whether different forms of α-synuclein (α-syn) proteins can induce inflammation and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, we stimulated with monomeric or aggregated α-syn peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Parkinson disease (PD) patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). ASC-speck formation, i.e., the intracellular generation of functionally active inflammasome complexes, as well as the production of inflammasome-related [caspase-1, interleukin 1β (IL-18), and IL-1β], and pro–IL-6, or anti–IL-10 inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Gastrointestinal permeability, suggested to be altered in PD, was also investigated by measuring plasma concentration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and I-FABP (fatty acid–binding protein). ASC-speck expression, as well as IL-18 and caspase-1 production and LPS and I-FABP plasma concentration, was comparable in PD and HC, indicating that α-syn does not stimulate the NLRP3 inflammasome and that PD does not associate with alterations of intestinal permeability. Interestingly, though, IL-1β and IL-6 production was increased, whereas that of IL-10 was reduced in α-syn–stimulated cells of PD compared to HC, suggesting that PD-associated neuroinflammation is not the consequence of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome but rather of an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In a Mental Imagery Brain-Computer Interface the user has to perform a specific mental task that generates electroencephalography (EEG) components, which can be translated in commands to control a BCI system. The development of a high-performance MI-BCI requires a long training, lasting several weeks or months, in order to improve the ability of the user to manage his/her mental tasks. This works aims to present the design of a MI-BCI combining mental imaginary and cognitive tasks for a severely motor impaired user, involved in the BCI race of the Cybathlon event, a competition of people with severe motor disability. In the BCI-race, the user becomes a pilot in a virtual race game against up to three other pilots, in which each pilot has to control his/her virtual car by his/her mental tasks. We present all the procedures followed to realize an effective MI-BCI, from the user's first contact with a BCI technology to actually controlling a video-game through her EEG. We defined a multi-stage user-centered training protocol in order to successfully control a BCI, even in a stressful situation, such as that of a competition. We put a specific focus on the human aspects that influenced the long training phase of the system and the participation to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The global signal (GS), which was once regarded as a nuisance of functional magnetic resonance imaging, has been proven to convey valuable neural information. This raised the following question: what is a GS represented in local brain regions? In order to answer this question, the GS topography was developed to measure the correlation between global and local signals. It was observed that the GS topography has an intrinsic structure characterized by higher GS correlation in sensory cortices and lower GS correlation in higher-order cortices. The GS topography could be modulated by individual factors, attention-demanding tasks, and conscious states. Furthermore, abnormal GS topography has been uncovered in patients with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy. These findings provide a novel insight into understanding how the GS and local brain signals coactivate to organize information in the human brain under various brain states. Future directions were further discussed, including the local-global confusion embedded in the GS correlation, the integration of spatial information conveyed by the GS, and temporal information recruited by the connection analysis. Overall, a unified psychopathological framework is needed for understanding the GS topography.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The vestibular system encodes motion and orientation of the head in space and is essential for negotiating in and interacting with the world. Recently, random waveform electric vestibular stimulation has become an increasingly common means of probing the vestibular system. However, many of the methods used to analyze the behavioral response to this type of stimulation assume a linear relationship between frequencies in the stimulus and its associated response. Here we examine this stimulus-response frequency linearity to determine the validity of this assumption. Forty-five university-aged subjects stood on a force-plate for 4 min while receiving vestibular stimulation. To determine the linearity of the stimulus-response relationship we calculated the cross-frequency power coupling between a 0 and 25 Hz bandwidth limited white noise stimulus and induced postural responses, as measured using the horizontal forces acting at the feet. Ultimately, we found that, on average, the postural response to a random stimulus is linear across stimulation frequencies. This result supports the use of analysis methods that depend on the assumption of stimulus-response frequency linearity, such as coherence and gain, which are commonly used to analyze the body’s response to random waveform electric stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Our senses receive a manifold of sensory signals at any given moment in our daily lives. For a coherent and unified representation of information and precise motor control, our brain needs to temporally bind the signals emanating from a common causal event and segregate others. Traditionally, different mechanisms were proposed for the temporal binding phenomenon in multisensory and motor-sensory contexts. This paper reviews the literature on the temporal binding phenomenon in both multisensory and motor-sensory contexts and suggests future research directions for advancing the field. Moreover, by critically evaluating the recent literature, this paper suggests that common computational principles are responsible for the temporal binding in multisensory and motor-sensory contexts. These computational principles are grounded in the Bayesian framework of uncertainty reduction rooted in the Helmholtzian idea of unconscious causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Neurotoxicity induced by the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide is one of the most important pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of the adaptive IRE1α-XBP1 pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, making it a potential target for AD therapeutics. However, the mechanism of IRE1α-XBP1 pathway involvement in AD is unclear. We, therefore, investigated the effect of the IRE1α-XBP1 axis in an in vitro AD model and explored its potential mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, was used. Cells were treated with Aβ25–35, with or without 4μ8c, an inhibitor of IRE1α. Cells were collected and analyzed by Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, calcium imaging, and other biochemical assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Aβ-exposed SH-SY5Y cells showed an increased expression of XBP1s and p-IRE1α. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and calcium imaging analysis showed that the IRE1α inhibitor, 4μ8c, reduced Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. Increased levels of ATP, restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species after Aβ treatment in the presence of 4μ8c showed that inhibiting the IRE1α-XBP1 axis effectively mitigated Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, Aβ treatment increased the expression and interaction of IP3R, Grp75, and vdac1 and led to an increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondria association, malfunction of mitochondria-associated ER-membranes (MAMs), and mitochondrial dysfunction. These deficits were rescued by inhibiting the IRE1α-XBP1 axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that Aβ peptide induces the activation of the IRE1α-XBP1 axis, which may aggravate cytotoxicity and mitochondrial impairment in SH-SY5Y cells by targeting MAMs. Inhibition of the IRE1α-XBP1 axis provides the protection against Aβ-induced injury in SH-SY5Y cells and may, therefore, be a new treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a pleiotropic extracellular lipid mediator with many physiological functions that signal through six known G protein-coupled receptors (LPA&lt;sub&gt;1–6&lt;/sub&gt;). In the central nervous system (CNS), LPA mediates a wide range of effects including neural progenitor cell physiology, neuronal cell death, axonal retraction, and inflammation. Since inflammation is a hallmark of most neurological conditions, we hypothesized that LPA could be involved in the physiopathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found that LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; RNA was upregulated in post-mortem spinal cord samples of ALS patients and in the sciatic nerve and skeletal muscle of SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse, the most widely used ALS mouse model. To assess the contribution of LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ALS, we generated a SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse that was deficient in Lpar2. This animal revealed that LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling accelerates disease onset and neurological decline but, unexpectedly, extended the lifespan. To gain insights into the early harmful actions of LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ALS, we studied the effects of this receptor in the spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and skeletal muscle of ALS mice. We found that LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gene deletion increased microglial activation but did not contribute to motoneuron death, astrogliosis, degeneration, and demyelination of motor axons. However, we observed that Lpar2 deficiency protected against muscle atrophy. Moreover, we also found the deletion of Lpar2 reduced the invasion of macrophages into the skeletal muscle of SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice, linking LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling with muscle inflammation and atrophy in ALS. Overall, these results suggest for the first time that LPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributes to ALS, and its genetic deletion results in protective actions at the early stages of the disease but shortens survival thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy are types of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders named synucleinopathies, which are characterized by prominent intracellular α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates. We have previously found that αSyn aggregates and the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in the mouse brain are partly associated with the expression of fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3, heart FABP). However, it remains to be elucidated whether FABP3 accumulation is associated with αSyn aggregates in human tissues. Here, we histologically studied FABP3 expression in human tissues obtained from patients with synucleinopathies, patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and controls. We found that (1) a variety of neurons expressed the FABP3 protein in human brain tissues, (2) FABP3 was colocalized with αSyn aggregates in the brains of individuals with synucleinopathies but not with amyloid β or p-tau aggregates in the brains of individuals with AD, and (3) FABP3 was not present in p-αSyn deposits in biopsied skin tissues from individuals with PD. These findings suggest that FABP3 expression is associated with αSyn aggregation in synucleinopathies and provide new insights into the involvement of FABP3 in synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are a common cause of cognitive decline, yet limited therapies exist. This cerebrovascular disease results in neurodegeneration via acute, chronic, local, and systemic mechanisms. The etiology of VCID is complex, with a significant impact from atherosclerosis. Risk factors including hypercholesterolemia and hypertension promote intracranial atherosclerotic disease and carotid artery stenosis (CAS), which disrupt cerebral blood flow and trigger ischemic strokes and VCID. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a cholesterol and phospholipid carrier present in plasma and various tissues. APOE is implicated in dyslipidemia and Alzheimer disease (AD); however, its connection with VCID is less understood. Few experimental models for VCID exist, so much of the present information has been drawn from clinical studies. Here, we review the literature with a focus on the clinical aspects of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and build a working model for the pathogenesis of VCID. We describe potential intermediate steps in this model, linking cholesterol, atherosclerosis, and APOE with VCID. APOE4 is a minor isoform of APOE that promotes lipid dyshomeostasis in astrocytes and microglia, leading to chronic neuroinflammation. APOE4 disturbs lipid homeostasis in macrophages and smooth muscle cells, thus exacerbating systemic inflammation and promoting atherosclerotic plaque formation. Additionally, APOE4 may contribute to stromal activation of endothelial cells and pericytes that disturb the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These and other risk factors together lead to chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, VCID, and neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss potential cholesterol metabolism based approaches for future VCID treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Strategies have not been available until recently to uncover interacting protein networks specific to key cell types, their subcellular compartments, and their major regulators during complex &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; events. Here we apply BioID2 proximity labeling to capture protein networks acting within cardiomyocytes during a key model of innate heart regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish expressing a promiscuous BirA2 localized to the entire myocardial cell or membrane compartment were generated, each identifying distinct proteomes in adult cardiomyocytes that became altered during regeneration. BioID2 profiling for interactors with ErbB2, a co-receptor for the cardiomyocyte mitogen Nrg1, implicated Rho A as a target of ErbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes. Blockade of Rho A during heart regeneration, or during cardiogenic stimulation by the mitogenic influences Nrg1, Vegfaa or Vitamin D, disrupted muscle creation. Our findings reveal proximity labeling as a useful resource to interrogate cell proteomes and signaling networks during tissue regeneration in zebrafish.</content>

 Antibiotics from few culturable microorganisms have saved millions of lives since the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. But with resistance formation, these compounds become increasingly ineffective, while the majority of microbial and with that chemical compound diversity remains inaccessible for cultivation and exploration. Culturing recalcitrant bacteria is a stochastic process. But conventional methods are limited to low throughput. By increasing (i) throughput and (ii) sensitivity by miniaturization, we innovate microbiological cultivation to comply with biological stochasticity. Here, we introduce a droplet-based microscale-cultivation system, which is directly coupled to a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation. We demonstrate that highly parallelized in-droplet cultivation starting from single cells results in the cultivation of yet uncultured species and a significantly higher bacterial diversity than standard agar plate cultivation. Strains able to inhibit intact reporter strains were isolated from the system. A variety of antimicrobial compounds were detected for a selected potent antibiotic producer.</content>

 In eukaryotes, 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) formation is a rate-determining step of translation. Ribosome recycling following translation termination produces free 40S subunits for re-assembly of 43S PICs. Yeast mutants lacking orthologs of mammalian eIF2D (Tma64), and either MCT-1 (Tma20) or DENR (Tma22), are broadly impaired for 40S recycling; however, it was unknown whether this defect alters the translational efficiencies (TEs) of particular mRNAs. Here, we conducted ribosome profiling of a yeast &lt;i&gt;tma64∆/tma20∆&lt;/i&gt; double mutant and observed a marked reprogramming of translation, wherein the TEs of the most efficiently translated (‘strong’) mRNAs increase, while those of ‘weak’ mRNAs generally decline. Remarkably, similar reprogramming was seen on reducing 43S PIC assembly by inducing phosphorylation of eIF2α or by decreasing total 40S subunit levels by depleting Rps26. Our findings suggest that strong mRNAs outcompete weak mRNAs in response to 43S PIC limitation achieved in various ways, in accordance with previous mathematical modeling.</content>

 Reorganization of the maternal brain upon childbirth triggers species-typical maternal social behavior. These brief social moments carry profound effects on the infant's brain and likely have distinct signature in the maternal brain. Utilizing a double-blind, within-subject oxytocin/placebo administration crossover design, mothers' brain was imaged twice using fMRI while observing three naturalistic maternal-infant contexts in the home ecology; 'unavailable', 'unresponsive', and 'social', when mothers engaged in synchronous peek-a-boo play. The social condition elicited greater neural response across the human caregiving network, including amygdala, VTA, hippocampus, insula, ACC, and temporal cortex. Oxytocin impacted neural response primarily to the social condition and attenuated differences between social and non-social stimuli. Greater temporal consistency emerged in the 'social' condition across the two imaging sessions, particularly in insula, amygdala, and TP. Findings describe how mother's brain varies by caregiving experiences and gives salience to moments of social synchrony that support infant social development and brain maturation.</content>

 Oxytocin is a neuropeptide important for maternal physiology and childcare, including parturition and milk ejection during nursing. Suckling triggers oxytocin release, but other sensory cues- specifically infant cries- can elevate oxytocin levels in new human mothers, indicating that cries can activate hypothalamic oxytocin neurons. Here we describe a neural circuit routing auditory information about infant vocalizations to the oxytocin system of the mouse brain. We performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings and photometry from identified oxytocin neurons in awake maternal mice presented with pup calls. We found that oxytocin neurons responded to pup vocalizations via input from the posterior intralaminar thalamus, and repetitive thalamic stimulation induced lasting disinhibition of oxytocin neurons. Suppression of this pathway impaired maternal behavior and playing pup calls led to central oxytocin release in vivo. This circuit provides a mechanism for transforming acoustic input into hormonal output to ensure modulation of brain state required for successful parenting.</content>

 Zebrafish are an important model in systems neuroscience but a key limitation is the lack of viral tools to interrogate the structure and function of neuronal circuitry. We developed methods for efficient gene transfer and retrograde tracing by herpes simplex viruses (HSV1), for conditional HSV1-mediated gene expression using the Gal4/UAS system, and for transneuronal tracing by rabies viruses. This toolbox creates new opportunities to visualize and manipulate specific sets of neurons through the combination of genetic and viral approaches in zebrafish.</content>

 Neural processing of objects with action associations is thought to recruit dorsal visual regions more than objects without such associations. We hypothesized that because the dorsal and ventral visual pathways have differing proportions of magno-and parvo-cellular input, there should be behavioral differences in perceptual tasks between manipulable and non-manipulable objects. This hypothesis was tested using gap detection task, suited to the spatial resolution of the ventral parvocellular processing, and object flicker discrimination task, suited to the temporal resolution of the dorsal magnocellular processing. Directly predicted from the cellular composition of each pathway, a non-manipulable object advantage was observed in tasks relying on spatial resolution, and a manipulable object advantage in temporal discrimination. We also show that these relative advantages are modulated by either reducing object recognition through inversion or by suppressing magnocellular processing using red light. These results establish perceptual differences between objects dependent on prior knowledge and experience.</content>

 White-matter injury leads to severe functional loss in many neurological diseases. Myelin staining on histological samples is the most common technique to investigate white-matter fibers. However, tissue processing and sectioning may affect the reliability of 3D volumetric assessments. The purpose of this study was to propose an approach that enables myelin fibers to be mapped in the whole rodent brain with microscopic resolution and without the need for strenuous staining. With this aim, we coupled in-line (propagation-based) X-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) to ethanol-induced brain sample dehydration. We here provide the proof-of-concept that this approach enhances myelinated axons in rodent and human brain tissue. In addition, we demonstrated that white-matter injuries could be detected and quantified with this approach, using three animal models: ischemic stroke, premature birth and multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, in analogy to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we retrieved fiber directions and DTI-like diffusion metrics from our XPCT data to quantitatively characterize white-matter microstructure. Finally, we showed that this non-destructive approach was compatible with subsequent complementary brain sample analysis by conventional histology. In-line XPCT might thus become a novel gold-standard for investigating white-matter injury in the intact brain. This is Part I of a series of two articles reporting the value of in-line XPCT for virtual histology of the brain; Part II shows how in-line XPCT enables the whole-brain 3D morphometric analysis of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques.</content>

 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) drives pituitary secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone, which in turn regulate gonadal functions including steroidogenesis. The pattern of GnRH release and thus fertility depend on gonadal steroid feedback. Under homeostatic (negative) feedback conditions, removal of the gonads from either females or males increases the amplitude and frequency of GnRH release and alters the long-term firing pattern of these neurons in brain slices. The neurobiological mechanisms intrinsic to GnRH neurons that are altered by homeostatic feedback are not well studied and have not been compared between sexes. During estradiol positive feedback, which is unique to females, there are correlated changes in voltage-gated potassium currents and neuronal excitability. We thus hypothesized these same mechanisms would be engaged in homeostatic negative feedback. Voltage-gated potassium channels play a direct role in setting excitability and action potential properties. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of GFP-identified GnRH neurons in brain slices from sham-operated and castrated adult female and male mice were made to assess fast (IA) and slow (IK) inactivating potassium currents as well as action potential properties. Surprisingly, no changes were observed in most potassium current properties, input resistance or capacitance and this was reflected in a lack of differences in excitability and specific action potential properties. These results support the concept that, in contrast to positive feedback, steroid negative feedback regulation of GnRH neurons in both sexes is likely conveyed to GnRH neurons via mechanisms that do not induce major changes in the biophysical properties of these cells.</content>

 The complete understanding of the mammalian brain requires exact knowledge of the function of each of the neurons composing its parts. To achieve this goal, an exhaustive, precise, reproducible, and robust neuronal taxonomy should be defined. In this paper, a new circular taxonomy based on transcriptomic features and novel electrophysiological features is proposed. The approach is validated by analysing more than 1850 electrophysiological signals of different mouse visual cortex neurons proceeding from the Allen Cell Types Database. The study is conducted on two different levels: neurons and their cell-type aggregation into Cre Lines. At the neuronal level, electrophysiological features have been extracted with a promising model that has already proved its worth in neuronal dynamics. At the Cre Line level, electrophysiological and transcriptomic features are joined on cell types with available genetic information. A taxonomy with a circular order is revealed by a simple transformation of the first two principal components that allow the characterization of the different Cre Lines. Moreover, the proposed methodology locates other Cre Lines in the taxonomy that do not have transcriptomic features available. Finally, the taxonomy is validated by Machine Learning methods which are able to discriminate the different neuron types with the proposed electrophysiological features.</content>

 An open question in the working memory (WM) field is how information is kept online during the WM delay period. Maintenance of simple stimuli in WM is supported by connectivity between frontal and parietal brain regions. How does delay period activity and connectivity support WM of complex stimuli? Twenty-two participants completed a modified Sternberg WM task with complex stimuli and were told to remember either 2 (low-load) or 5 (high-load) scenes while 32-channel scalp EEG was recorded. During the 6-sec delay period 6 phase-scrambled scenes were presented, which served as interference. While increasing the WM load, particularly with complex stimuli, places a greater demand on attentional resources, interfering stimuli may hijack the available resources. This was confirmed in the examination of theta and alpha amplitude, as amplitude was reduced for the high WM load as compared with the low WM load across frontal, central, and parietal regions. Delay period connectivity was assessed with phase-locking value (PLV). We identified 3 supporting networks that facilitated performance for the low-load condition: 1) increased PLV between left frontal and right posterior temporal in the theta and alpha bands; 2) increased PLV between right anterior temporal and left central in the alpha and lower beta bands; and 3) increased PLV between left anterior temporal and left posterior temporal in theta, alpha, and lower beta bands for the low-load condition. These results suggest that these brain networks facilitated the low-load WM by filtering of interference and the use of verbal rehearsal during the delay period.</content>

 We recently developed a rat model of incubation of oxycodone craving where opioid seeking progressively increases after voluntary suppression of drug self-administration by adverse consequences of drug seeking. Here, we studied the role of ventral subiculum (vSub) neuronal ensembles in this incubation, using the activity marker Fos, muscimol-baclofen (GABAergic agonists) inactivation, and Daun02 chemogenetic inactivation. We trained Sprague-Dawley or Fos-lacZ transgenic male and female rats to self-administer oxycodone (0.1 mg/kg/infusion, 6-h/d) for 14 days. The rats were then exposed for 14 days to an electric barrier of increasing intensity (0.1 to 0.4 mA) near the drug-paired lever that caused voluntary abstinence or were exposed to 14 days of forced abstinence. We tested Sprague-Dawley rats for relapse to oxycodone seeking without shock and drug on abstinence day 15 and extracted their brains for Fos-immunohistochemistry, or tested them after vSub vehicle or muscimol-baclofen injections on abstinence days 1 and 15. We performed Daun02 inactivation of relapse-activated vSub Fos neurons in Fos-lacZ transgenic rats on abstinence day 15 and then tested them for relapse on abstinence day 18. Relapse after electric barrier-induced abstinence increased Fos expression in vSub. Muscimol-baclofen inactivation or Daun02 selective inactivation of vSub Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles decreased 'incubated' oxycodone seeking after voluntary abstinence. Muscimol-baclofen vSub inactivation had no effect on non-incubated opioid seeking on abstinence day 1 or incubation after forced abstinence. Our results demonstrate a selective role of vSub neuronal ensembles in incubation of opioid craving after cessation of drug self-administration by adverse consequences of drug seeking.</content>

		<content type="html">
 When analyzing eye tracking data, one of the central tasks is the detection of saccades. Although many automatic saccade detection algorithms exist, the field still debates how to deal with brief periods of instability around saccade offset, so-called post-saccadic oscillations (PSOs), which are especially prominent in today's widely used video-based eye tracking techniques. There is good evidence that PSOs are caused by inertial forces that act on the elastic components of the eye, such as the iris or the lens. As this relative movement can greatly distort estimates of saccade metrics, especially saccade duration and peak velocity, video-based eye tracking has recurrently been considered unsuitable for measuring saccade kinematics. In this chapter, we review recent biophysical models that describe the relationship between pupil motion and eyeball motion. We found that these models were well capable of accurately reproducing saccade trajectories and implemented a framework for the simulation of saccades, PSOs, and fixations, which can be used - just like datasets hand-labelled by human experts - to evaluate detection algorithms and train statistical models. Moreover, as only pupil and corneal-reflection signals are observable in video-based eye tracking, one may also be able to use these models to predict the unobservable motion of the eyeball. Testing these predictions by analyzing saccade data that was registered with video-based and search-coil eye tracking techniques revealed strong relationships between the two types of measurements, especially when saccade offset is defined as the onset of the PSO. To enable eye tracking researchers to make use of this definition, we present and evaluate two novel algorithms - one based on eye-movement direction inversion, one based on linear classifiers previously trained on simulation data. These algorithms allow for the detection of PSO onset with high fidelity. Even though PSOs may still pose problems for a range of eye tracking applications, the techniques described here may help to alleviate these.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Population receptive field (pRF) mapping is a popular tool in computational neuroimaging that allows for the investigation of receptive field properties, their topography and interrelations in health and disease. Furthermore, the possibility to invert population receptive fields provides a decoding model for constructing stimuli from observed cortical activation patterns. This has been suggested to pave the road towards pRF-based brain-computer interface (BCI) communication systems, which would be able to directly decode internally visualized letters from topographically organized brain activity. A major stumbling block for such an application is, however, that the pRF mapping procedure is computationally heavy and time consuming. To address this, we propose a novel and fast pRF mapping procedure that is suitable for real-time applications. The method is build upon hashed-Gaussian encoding of the stimulus, which significantly reduces computational resources. After the stimulus is encoded, mapping can be performed using either ridge regression for fast offline analyses or gradient descent for real-time applications. We validate our model-agnostic approach in silico, as well as on empirical fMRI data obtained from 3T and 7T MRI scanners. Our approach is capable of estimating receptive fields and their parameters for millions of voxels in mere seconds. This method thus facilitates real-time applications of population receptive field mapping.</content>

		<title type="html">Anisotropy Measure from Three Diffusion-Encoding Gradient Directions</title>
		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.436786v1?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 Purpose: We propose a method that can provide information about the anisotropy and orientation of diffusion in the brain from only 3 orthogonal gradient directions without imposing additional assumptions. Methods: The method is based on the Diffusion Anisotropy (DiA) that measures the distance from a diffusion signal to its isotropic equivalent. The original formulation based on a Spherical Harmonics basis allows to go down to only 3 orthogonal directions in order to estimate the measure. In addition, an alternative simplification and a color-coding representation are also proposed. Results: Acquisitions from a publicly available database are used to test the viability of the proposal. The DiA succeeded in providing anisotropy information from the white matter using only 3 diffusion-encoding directions. The price to pay for such reduced acquisition is an increment in the variability of the data and a subestimation of the metric. Conclusions: The calculation of anisotropy information from DMRI is feasible using fewer than 6 gradient directions by using DiA. The method is totally compatible with existing acquisition protocols and it may provide complementary information about orientation in fast diffusion acquisitions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Chronic pain is a highly debilitating and poorly understood condition. Here, we attempt to advance our understanding of the brain mechanisms driving chronic pain by investigating alterations in morphometric similarity (MS) and corresponding transcriptomic and cellular signatures, in three cohorts of patients with distinct chronic pain syndromes (knee osteoarthritis, low back pain and fibromyalgia). We uncover a novel pattern of cortical MS remodelling involving mostly MS increases in the insula and limbic cortex, which cuts across the boundaries of specific pain syndromes. We show that cortical MS remodelling in chronic pain spatially correlates with the brain-wide expression of genes involved in the glial immune response and neuronal plasticity. Cortical remodelling in chronic pain might involve a disruption of multiple elements of the cellular architecture of the brain. Therefore, multi-target therapeutic approaches tackling both glial activation and neuronal hyperexcitability might better encompass the full neurobiology of chronic pain.</content>

 Modern well-performing approaches to neural decoding are based on machine learning models such as decision tree ensembles and deep neural networks. The wide range of algorithms that can be utilized to learn from neural spike trains, which are essentially time-series data, results in the need for diverse and challenging benchmarks for neural decoding, similar to the ones in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we propose a spike train classification benchmark, based on open-access neural activity datasets and consisting of several learning tasks such as stimulus type classification, animal's behavioral state prediction and neuron type identification. We demonstrate that an approach based on hand-crafted time-series feature engineering establishes a strong baseline performing on par with state-of-the-art deep learning based models for neural decoding. We release the code allowing to reproduce the reported results.</content>

 Transthyretin (TTR), a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid protein, increases axon growth and organelle transport in sensory neurons. These TTR functions were suggested to underlie its activity in promoting nerve regeneration. While neurons extend their axons, the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton is crucial for the segregation of functional compartments and axonal outgrowth. Herein, we investigated the hypothesis that TTR promotes axon elongation and regeneration by modulating MT dynamics. Indeed, we found that TTR KO mice have an intrinsic increase in dynamic MTs and reduced levels of acetylated -tubulin in uninjured peripheral axons, and fail to modulate microtubule dynamics in response to sciatic nerve injury. Importantly, restoring acetylated -tubulin levels of TTR KO DRG neurons using an HDAC6 inhibitor was sufficient to completely revert defective MT dynamics and neurite outgrowth. In summary, our results revealed a new role for TTR in the modulation of MT dynamics by regulating -tubulin acetylation and support that this activity underlies TTR neuritogenic function.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Huntingtons disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (poly Q) repeat (&amp;gt;36Q) in the N-terminal domain of the huntingtin protein (Htt), which renders the protein or fragments thereof more prone to aggregate and form inclusions. Although several Htt N-terminal fragments of different lengths have been identified within Htt inclusions, most studies on the mechanisms, sequence, and structural determinants of Htt aggregation have focused on the Htt exon1 (Httex1). Herein, we investigated the aggregation properties of mutant N-terminal Htt fragments of various lengths (Htt171, Htt140, and Htt104) in comparison to mutant Httex1. We also present a new chemoenzymatic semisynthetic strategy that enables site-specific phosphorylation of Htt beyond Httex1. These advances yielded novel insights into how PTMs and structured domains beyond Httex1 influence aggregation mechanisms, kinetics, and fibril morphology of longer N-terminal Htt fragments. We demonstrate that phosphorylation at T107 significantly slowed its aggregation, whereases phosphorylation at T107 and S116 accelerated the aggregation of Htt171, underscoring the importance of crosstalk between different PTMs. We demonstrate that mutant Htt171 proteins aggregate via a different mechanism and form oligomers and fibrillar aggregates with morphological properties that are distinct from that of mutant Httex1. These observations suggest that different N-terminal fragments could have distinct mechanisms of aggregation and that a single polyQ-targeting anti-aggregation strategy may not effectively inhibit the aggregation of all N-terminal Htt fragments. Finally, our results underscore the importance of further studies to investigate the aggregation mechanisms of Htt fragments and how the various fragments interact with each other and influence Htt toxicity, pathology formation, and disease progression.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Dragonflies are highly skilled and successful aerial predators that are even capable of selectively attending to one target within a swarm. Detection and tracking prey is likely to be driven by small target motion detector (STMD) neurons identified from several insect groups. Prior work has shown that dragonfly STMD responses are facilitated by targets moving on a continuous path, enhancing the response gain at the present and predicted future location of targets. In this study, we combined detailed morphological data with computational modelling to test whether a combination of dendritic morphology combined with the nonlinear properties of NMDA receptors could explain these observations. We developed a hybrid neuronal model of neurons within the dragonfly optic lobe, which integrates numerical and morphological components. The model was able to generate potent facilitation for targets moving on continuous trajectories, including a localized spotlight of maximal sensitivity close to the last seen target location, as also measured during in vivo recordings. The model did not, however, include a mechanism capable of producing a traveling or spreading wave of facilitation. Our data support a strong role for the high dendritic density seen in the dragonfly neuron in enhancing non-linear facilitation. An alternative model based on morphology of an unrelated type of motion processing neuron from a dipteran fly required more than 3 times higher synaptic gain in order to elicit similar levels of facilitation, despite having only 20% fewer synapses. Our data supports a potential role for NMDA receptors in target tracking and also demonstrates the feasibility of combining biologically plausible dendritic computations with more abstract computational models for basic processing as used in earlier studies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Despite ample behavioral evidence of atypical facial emotion processing in individuals with autism (IwA), the neural underpinnings of such behavioral heterogeneities remain unclear. Here, I have used brain-tissue mapped artificial neural network (ANN) models of primate vision to probe candidate neural and behavior markers of atypical facial emotion recognition in IwA at an image-by-image level. Interestingly, the ANNs' image-level behavioral patterns better matched the neurotypical subjects' behavior than those measured in IwA. This behavioral mismatch was most remarkable when the ANN behavior was decoded from units that correspond to the primate inferior temporal (IT) cortex. ANN-IT responses also explained a significant fraction of the image-level behavioral predictivity associated with neural activity in the human amygdala, strongly suggesting that the previously reported facial emotion intensity encodes in the human amygdala could be primarily driven by projections from the IT cortex. Furthermore, in silico experiments revealed how learning under noisy sensory representations could lead to atypical facial emotion processing that better matches the image-level behavior observed in IwA. In sum, these results identify primate IT activity as a candidate neural marker and demonstrate how ANN models of vision can be used to generate neural circuit-level hypotheses and guide future human and non-human primate studies in autism.</content>

 Hyperekplexia is a rare sensorimotor syndrome characterized by pathological startle reflex in response to unexpected trivial stimuli for which there is no specific treatment. Neonates suffer from hypertonia and are at high risk of sudden death due to apnea episodes. Mutations in the human SLC6A5 gene encoding the neuronal glycine transporter GlyT2 may disrupt the inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission and cause a presynaptic form of the disease. The phenotype of missense mutations giving rise to protein misfolding but maintaining residual activity could be rescued by facilitating folding or intracellular trafficking. In this report, we characterized the trafficking properties of two mutants associated with hyperekplexia (A277T and Y707C, rat numbering). Transporter molecules were partially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum showing increased interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin. One transporter variant had export difficulties and increased ubiquitination levels, suggestive of enhanced endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. However, the two mutant transporters were amenable to correction by calnexin overexpression. Within the search for compounds capable of rescuing mutant phenotypes, we found that the arachidonic acid derivative N-arachidonoyl glycine can rescue the trafficking defects of the two variants in heterologous cells and rat brain cortical neurons. N-arachidonoyl glycine improves the endoplasmic reticulum output by reducing the interaction transporter/calnexin, increasing membrane expression and improving transport activity in a comparable way as the well-established chemical chaperone 4-phenyl-butyrate. This work identifies N-arachidonoyl glycine as a promising compound with potential for hyperekplexia therapy.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Human decisions can be reflexive or planned, being governed respectively by model-free and model-based learning systems. These two systems might differ in their responsiveness to our needs. Hunger drives us to specifically seek food rewards, but here we ask whether it might have more general effects on these two decision systems. On one hand, the model-based system is often considered flexible and context-sensitive, and might therefore be modulated by metabolic needs. On the other hand, the model-free system's primitive reinforcement mechanisms may have closer ties to biological drives. Here, we tested participants on a well-established two-stage sequential decision-making task that dissociates the contribution of model-based and model-free control. Hunger enhanced overall performance by increasing model-free control, without affecting model-based control. These results demonstrate a generalised effect of hunger on decision-making that enhances reliance on primitive reinforcement learning, which in some situations translates into adaptive benefits.</content>

		<content type="html">
 State-of-the-art calcium imaging studies that monitor large-scale neural dynamics can produce video datasets ~10 terabytes or more in total size, roughly comparable to ~10,000 Hollywood films. Processing such data volumes requires automated, general-purpose and fast computational methods for cell identification that are robust to a wide variety of noise sources. We introduce EXTRACT, an algorithm that is based on robust estimation theory and uses graphical processing units (GPUs) to extract neural dynamics in computing times up to 10-times faster than imaging durations. We validated EXTRACT on simulated and experimental data and processed 94 public datasets from the Allen Institute Brain Observatory in one day. Showcasing its superiority over past cell-sorting methods at removing noise contaminants, neural activity traces from EXTRACT allow more accurate decoding of animal behavior. Overall, EXTRACT provides neuroscientists with a powerful computational tool matched to the present challenges of neural calcium imaging studies in behaving animals.</content>

 DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis), such as azacitidine and decitabine, are used clinically to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine activates the transcription of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which can induce immune response by acting as cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Yet, the posttranscriptional regulation of ERV dsRNAs remains uninvestigated....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/9NR1P8_KyII&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
Theta oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) appear during translational movement and arousal, modulate the activity of principal cells, and are associated with spatial cognition and episodic memory function. All known anxiolytics slightly but consistently reduce hippocampal theta frequency. However, whether this electrophysiological effect is mechanistically related to the decreased behavioral expression of anxiety is currently unclear. Here, we propose that a reduction in theta frequency affects synaptic plasticity and mnemonic function and that this can explain the reduction in anxiety behavior. We test this hypothesis in a biophysical model of contextual fear conditioning. First, we confirm that our model reproduces previous empirical results regarding the dependence of synaptic plasticity on presynaptic firing rate. Next, we investigate how theta frequency during contextual conditioning impacts learning. These simulations demonstrate that learned associations between threat and context are attenuated when learning takes place under reduced theta frequency. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that learned associations result in increased theta activity in the amygdala, consistent with empirical data. In summary, we propose a mechanism that can account for the behavioral effect of anxiolytics by impairing the integration of threat attributes of an environment into the cognitive map due to reduced synaptic potentiation.</content>

 Abstract
The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a molecular sensor to help maintain cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex and its enzymatic catalytic subunit includes two isoforms: α1 and α2. Dysregulation of AMPK signaling is linked to neuronal diseases characterized with cognitive impairments. Emerging evidence also suggest isoform‐specific roles of AMPK in the brain. AMPK regulates protein synthesis, which is critical for memory formation and neuronal plasticity. However, the consequence of altering AMPK activity on the translation of specific proteins in the brain is unknown. Here, we use unbiased mass spectrometry‐based proteomics approach to analyze protein profile alterations in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of transgenic mice in which the genes for the two AMPKα isoforms are conditionally deleted. The study revealed identities of proteins whose expression is sensitive to suppression of AMPKα1 and/or α2 isoform. These data may serve as a basis for future in‐depth study. Elucidation of the functional relevance of the alteration of specific proteins could provide insights into identification of novel therapeutic targets for neuronal disorders characterized with AMPK signaling dysregulation and impaired cellular energy metabolism.</content>

 Abstract
Down syndrome (DS), a genetic condition caused by triplication of chromosome 21, is characterized by alterations in various cognitive domains, including hippocampus‐dependent memory functions, starting from early life stages. The major causes of intellectual disability in DS are prenatal neurogenesis alterations followed by impairment of dendritic development in early infancy. While there is evidence that the Ts65Dn mouse, the most widely used model of DS, exhibits dendritic alterations in adulthood, no studies are available regarding the onset of dendritic pathology. The goal of the current study was to establish whether this model exhibits early dendritic alterations in the hippocampus, a region whose function is severely damaged in DS. To this purpose, in Golgi‐stained brains, we evaluated the dendritic arborization and dendritic spines of the granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in Ts65Dn mice aged 8 (P8) and 15 (P15) days. While P15 Ts65Dn mice exhibited a notably hypotrophic dendritic arbor and a reduced spine density, P8 mice exhibited a moderate reduction in the number of dendritic ramifications and no differences in spine density in comparison with their euploid counterparts. Both in P8 and P15 mice, spines were longer and had a longer neck, suggesting possible alterations in synaptic function. Moreover, P8 and P15 Ts65Dn mice had more thin spines and fewer stubby spines in comparison with euploid mice. Our study provides novel evidence on the onset of dendritic pathology, one of the causes of intellectual disability in DS, showing that it is already detectable in the dentate gyrus of Ts65Dn pups. This evidence strengthens the suitability of this model of DS as a tool to study dendritic pathology in DS and to test the efficacy of early therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating hippocampal development and, therefore, memory functions in children with DS.</content>

 Abstract
We investigated synaptic mechanisms in the hippocampus that could explain how loss of circadian timing leads to impairments in spatial and recognition memory. Experiments were performed in hippocampal slices from Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) because, unlike mice and rats, their circadian rhythms are easily eliminated without modifications to their genome and without surgical manipulations, thereby leaving neuronal circuits intact. Recordings of excitatory postsynaptic field potentials and population spikes in area CA1 and dentate gyrus granule cells revealed no effect of circadian arrhythmia on basic functions of synaptic circuitry, including long‐term potentiation. However, dentate granule cells from circadian‐arrhythmic animals maintained a more depolarized resting membrane potential than cells from circadian‐intact animals; a significantly greater proportion of these cells depolarized in response to the cholinergic agonist carbachol (10 μM), and did so by increasing their membrane potential three‐fold greater than cells from the control (entrained) group. Dentate granule cells from arrhythmic animals also exhibited higher levels of tonic inhibition, as measured by the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Carbachol also decreased stimulus‐evoked synaptic excitation in dentate granule cells from both intact and arrhythmic animals as expected, but reduced stimulus‐evoked synaptic inhibition only in cells from control hamsters. These findings show that loss of circadian timing is accompanied by greater tonic inhibition, and increased synaptic inhibition in response to muscarinic receptor activation in dentate granule cells. Increased inhibition would likely attenuate excitation in dentate‐CA3 microcircuits, which in turn might explain the spatial memory deficits previously observed in circadian‐arrhythmic hamsters.</content>

 Abstract
Episodic memory depends on the computational process of pattern separation in order to establish distinct memory representations of similar episodes. Studies of pattern separation in humans rely on mnemonic discrimination tasks, which have been shown to tax hippocampal‐dependent pattern separation. Although previous neuroimaging research has focused on hippocampal processing, little is known about how other brain regions, known to be involved in recognition memory performance, are involved in mnemonic discrimination tasks. Conversely, neuroimaging studies of pattern separation with whole‐brain coverage lack spatial resolution to localize activation to hippocampal subfields. In this study, 48 healthy young adult participants underwent whole‐brain high‐resolution functional MRI (fMRI) scanning while completing a mnemonic discrimination task. A priori region‐of‐interest analyses revealed activation patterns consistent with pattern separation in distinct hippocampal subregions, particularly in the subiculum. Connectivity analyses revealed a network of cortical regions consistent with the memory retrieval network where fMRI activation was correlated with hippocampal activation. An exploratory whole‐brain analysis revealed widespread activation differentially associated with performance of the mnemonic discrimination task. Taken together, these results suggest that a network of brain regions contribute to mnemonic discrimination performance, with the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex as a hub in the network displaying clear signals consistent with pattern separation and regions such as the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex particularly important for successful lure discrimination.</content>

 Abstract
Long‐term potentiation (LTP) is a synaptic plasticity mechanism critical to long‐term memory. LTP induced in vivo is characterized by altered transcriptional activity, including a period of upregulation of gene expression which is followed by a later dominant downregulation. This temporal shift to downregulated gene expression is predicted to be partly mediated by epigenetic inhibitors of gene expression, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Further, pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC activity have previously been shown to enhance LTP persistence in vitro. To explore the contribution of HDACs to the persistence of LTP in vivo, we examined HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity over a 24 hr period following unilateral LTP induction in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats. Surprisingly, we found significant changes in HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity in both the stimulated as well as the unstimulated hemispheres, with the largest increase in activity occurring bilaterally, 20 min after LTP stimulation. During this time point of heightened activity, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that both HDAC1 and HDAC2 were enriched at distinct sets of genes within each hemispheres. Further, the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A enhanced an intermediate phase of LTP lasting days, which has not previously been associated with altered transcription. The inhibitor had no effect on the persistence of LTP lasting weeks. Together, these data suggest that HDAC activity early after the induction of LTP may negatively regulate plasticity‐related gene expression that is involved in the initial stabilization of LTP, but not its long‐term maintenance.</content>

 Abstract
Adult‐born granule cells (abGCs) integrate into the hippocampus and form connections with dentate gyrus parvalbumin‐positive (PV+) interneurons, a circuit important for modulating plasticity. Many of these interneurons are surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures known to participate in plasticity. We compared abGC projections to PV+ interneurons with negative‐to‐low intensity PNNs to those with high intensity PNNs using retroviral and 3R‐Tau labeling in adult mice, and found that abGC mossy fibers and boutons are more frequently located near PV+ interneurons with high intensity PNNs. These results suggest that axons of new neurons preferentially stabilize near target cells with intense PNNs. Next, we asked whether the number of abGCs influences PNN formation around PV+ interneurons, and found that near complete ablation of abGCs produced a decrease in the intensity and number of PV+ neurons with PNNs, suggesting that new neuron innervation may enhance PNN formation. Experience‐driven changes in adult neurogenesis did not produce consistent effects, perhaps due to widespread effects on plasticity. Our study identifies abGC projections to PV+ interneurons with PNNs, with more presumed abGC mossy fiber boutons found near the cell body of PV+ interneurons with strong PNNs.</content>

 Abstract
Structural integrity of the human hippocampus is widely acknowledged to be necessary for the successful encoding and retrieval of autobiographical memories. However, evidence for an association between hippocampal volume and the ability to recall such memories in healthy individuals is mixed. Here we examined this issue further by combining two approaches. First, we focused on the anatomically distinct subregions of the hippocampus where more nuanced associations may be expressed compared to considering the whole hippocampal volume. A manual segmentation protocol of hippocampal subregions allowed us to separately calculate the volumes of the dentate gyrus/CA4, CA3/2, CA1, subiculum, pre/parasubiculum and uncus. Second, a critical feature of autobiographical memories is that they can span long time periods, and so we sought to consider how memory details persist over time by conducting a longitudinal study whereby participants had to recall the same autobiographical memories on two visits spaced 8 months apart. Overall, we found that there was no difference in the total number of internal (episodic) details produced at Visits 1 and 2. However, further probing of detail subcategories revealed that specifically the amount of subjective thoughts and emotions included during recall had declined significantly by the second visit. We also observed a strong correlation between left pre/parasubiculum volume and the amount of autobiographical memory internal details produced over time. This positive relationship was evident for particular facets of the memories, with remembered events, perceptual observations and thoughts and emotions benefitting from greater volume of the left pre/parasubiculum. These preliminary findings expand upon existing functional neuroimaging evidence by highlighting a potential link between left pre/parasubiculum volume and autobiographical memory. A larger pre/parasubiculum appears not only to protect against memory decay, but may possibly enhance memory persistence, inviting further scrutiny of the role of this brain region in remote autobiographical memory retrieval.</content>

Wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum spp&lt;/i&gt;.) gluten consists mainly of intrinsincally disordered storage proteins (glutenins and gliadins) that can form megadalton-sized networks. These networks are responsible for the unique viscoelastic properties of wheat dough and affect the quality of bread. These properties have not yet been studied by molecular level simulations. Here, we use a newly developed &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-C-based coarse-grained model to study ∼ 4000-residue systems. The corresponding time-dependent properties are studied through shear and axial deformations. We measure the response force to the deformation, the number of entanglements and cavities, the mobility of residues, the number of the inter-chain bonds, etc. Glutenins are shown to influence the mechanics of gluten much more than gliadins. Our simulations are consistent with the existing ideas about gluten elasticity and emphasize the role of entanglements and hydrogen bonding. We also demonstrate that the storage proteins in maize and rice lead to weaker elasticity which points to the unique properties of wheat gluten.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2QU1j3aIz-Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

While vision evokes a dense network of feedforward and feedback neural processes in the brain, visual processes are primarily modeled with feedforward hierarchical neural networks, leaving the computational role of feedback processes poorly understood. Here, we developed a generative autoencoder neural network model and adversarially trained it on a categorically diverse data set of images. We hypothesized that the feedback processes in the ventral visual pathway can be represented by reconstruction of the visual information performed by the generative model. We compared representational similarity of the activity patterns in the proposed model with temporal (magnetoencephalography) and spatial (functional magnetic resonance imaging) visual brain responses. The proposed generative model identified two segregated neural dynamics in the visual brain. A temporal hierarchy of processes transforming low level visual information into high level semantics in the feedforward sweep, and a temporally later dynamics of inverse processes reconstructing low level visual information from a high level latent representation in the feedback sweep. Our results append to previous studies on neural feedback processes by presenting a new insight into the algorithmic function and the information carried by the feedback processes in the ventral visual pathway.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ttyKML2aYSk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Slow-timescale (tonic) changes in dopamine (DA) contribute to a wide variety of processes in reinforcement learning, interval timing, and other domains. Furthermore, changes in tonic DA exert distinct effects depending on when they occur (e.g., during learning vs. performance) and what task the subject is performing (e.g., operant vs. classical conditioning). Two influential theories of tonic DA—the average reward theory and the Bayesian theory in which DA controls precision—have each been successful at explaining a subset of empirical findings. But how the same DA signal performs two seemingly distinct functions without creating crosstalk is not well understood. Here we reconcile the two theories under the unifying framework of ‘rational inattention,’ which (1) conceptually links average reward and precision, (2) outlines how DA manipulations affect this relationship, and in so doing, (3) captures new empirical phenomena. In brief, rational inattention asserts that agents can increase their precision in a task (and thus improve their performance) by paying a cognitive cost. Crucially, whether this cost is worth paying depends on average reward availability, reported by DA. The monotonic relationship between average reward and precision means that the DA signal contains the information necessary to retrieve the precision. When this information is needed after the task is performed, as presumed by Bayesian inference, acute manipulations of DA will bias behavior in predictable ways. We show how this framework reconciles a remarkably large collection of experimental findings. In reinforcement learning, the rational inattention framework predicts that learning from positive and negative feedback should be enhanced in high and low DA states, respectively, and that DA should tip the exploration-exploitation balance toward exploitation. In interval timing, this framework predicts that DA should increase the speed of the internal clock and decrease the extent of interference by other temporal stimuli during temporal reproduction (the central tendency effect). Finally, rational inattention makes the new predictions that these effects should be critically dependent on the controllability of rewards, that post-reward delays in intertemporal choice tasks should be underestimated, and that average reward manipulations should affect the speed of the clock—thus capturing empirical findings that are unexplained by either theory alone. Our results suggest that a common computational repertoire may underlie the seemingly heterogeneous roles of DA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZZRPUcE1FN4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Since entering the human population, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID-19]) has spread worldwide, causing &amp;gt;100 million infections and &amp;gt;2 million deaths. While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether many of these changes impact adaptation, replication, or transmission of the virus. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, virus stocks, and passaging experiments, together with kinetic virus replication data from nonhuman Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells. Overall, our study uncovers sequence features in SARS-CoV-2 variants that determine cell-specific replication and highlights the need to monitor SARS-CoV-2 stocks carefully when phenotyping newly emerging variants or potential variants of concern.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EslNuuOqSnQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Faithful replication of the entire genome requires replication forks to copy large contiguous tracts of DNA, and sites of persistent replication fork stalling present a major threat to genome stability. Understanding the distribution of sites at which replication forks stall, and the ensuing fork processing events, requires genome-wide methods that profile replication fork position and the formation of recombinogenic DNA ends. Here, we describe Transferase-Activated End Ligation sequencing (TrAEL-seq), a method that captures single-stranded DNA 3′ ends genome-wide and with base pair resolution. TrAEL-seq labels both DNA breaks and replication forks, providing genome-wide maps of replication fork progression and fork stalling sites in yeast and mammalian cells. Replication maps are similar to those obtained by Okazaki fragment sequencing; however, TrAEL-seq is performed on asynchronous populations of wild-type cells without incorporation of labels, cell sorting, or biochemical purification of replication intermediates, rendering TrAEL-seq far simpler and more widely applicable than existing replication fork direction profiling methods. The specificity of TrAEL-seq for DNA 3′ ends also allows accurate detection of double-strand break sites after the initiation of DNA end resection, which we demonstrate by genome-wide mapping of meiotic double-strand break hotspots in a &lt;i&gt;dmc1&lt;/i&gt;Δ mutant that is competent for end resection but not strand invasion. Overall, TrAEL-seq provides a flexible and robust methodology with high sensitivity and resolution for studying DNA replication and repair, which will be of significant use in determining mechanisms of genome instability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Dpw5R798O7Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
A new theory is proposed of mechanisms of navigation in primates including humans in which spatial view cells found in the primate hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus are used to guide the individual from landmark to landmark. The navigation involves approach to each landmark in turn (taxis), using spatial view cells to identify the next landmark in the sequence, and does not require a topological map. Two other cell types found in primates, whole body motion cells, and head direction cells, can be utilized in the spatial view cell navigational mechanism, but are not essential. If the landmarks become obscured, then the spatial view representations can be updated by self‐motion (idiothetic) path integration using spatial coordinate transform mechanisms in the primate dorsal visual system to transform from egocentric to allocentric spatial view coordinates. A continuous attractor network or time cells or working memory is used in this approach to navigation to encode and recall the spatial view sequences involved. I also propose how navigation can be performed using a further type of neuron found in primates, allocentric‐bearing‐to‐a‐landmark neurons, in which changes of direction are made when a landmark reaches a particular allocentric bearing. This is useful if a landmark cannot be approached. The theories are made explicit in models of navigation, which are then illustrated by computer simulations. These types of navigation are contrasted with triangulation, which requires a topological map. It is proposed that the first strategy utilizing spatial view cells is used frequently in humans, and is relatively simple because primates have spatial view neurons that respond allocentrically to locations in spatial scenes. An advantage of this approach to navigation is that hippocampal spatial view neurons are also useful for episodic memory, and for imagery.</content>

 Although Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is hypothesized to be a prerequisite for multiple sclerosis (MS), up to 15% of children with a diagnosis of MS were reported to be EBV‐seronegative. When re‐evaluating 25 EBV‐seronegative children out of 189 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome/MS, we found anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody in 11 of 25 (44%) EBV‐seronegative but only 9 of 164 (5.5%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) EBV‐seropositive patients. After critical review, MS remained a plausible diagnosis in only 4 of 14 EBV‐seronegative/MOG antibody–negative patients. In children with an MS‐like presentation, EBV seronegativity should alert clinicians to consider diagnoses other than MS, especially MOG‐antibody disease. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Objective
Many multiple sclerosis (MS) genetic susceptibility variants have been identified, but understanding disease heterogeneity remains a key challenge. Relapses are a core feature of MS and a common primary outcome of clinical trials, with prevention of relapses benefiting patients immediately and potentially limiting long‐term disability accrual. We aim to identify genetic variation associated with relapse hazard in MS by analyzing the largest study population to date.


Methods
We performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort and investigated the genomewide significant variants in a replication cohort. Combining both cohorts, we captured a total of 2,231 relapses occurring before the start of any immunomodulatory treatment in 991 patients. For assessing time to relapse, we applied a survival analysis utilizing Cox proportional hazards models. We also investigated the association between MS genetic risk scores and relapse hazard and performed a gene ontology pathway analysis.


Results
The low‐frequency genetic variant rs11871306 within WNT9B reached genomewide significance in predicting relapse hazard and replicated (meta‐analysis hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.70–2.78, p = 2.07 × 10−10). A pathway analysis identified an association of the pathway “response to vitamin D” with relapse hazard (p = 4.33 × 10−6). The MS genetic risk scores, however, were not associated with relapse hazard.


Interpretation
Genetic factors underlying disease heterogeneity differ from variants associated with MS susceptibility. Our findings imply that genetic variation within the Wnt signaling and vitamin D pathways contributes to differences in relapse occurrence. The present study highlights these cross‐talking pathways as potential modulators of MS disease activity. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Objective
The aim was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for electrographic seizures and other electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring and to assess whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes.


Methods
We identified 197 patients with COVID‐19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes.


Results
Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A pre‐existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44–11.51], p &amp;lt; 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03–0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36–0.49]).


Interpretation
This multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrates that seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with COVID‐19 undergoing clinically indicated cEEG and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Objective
Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) studies show that interictal ripples propagate across the brain of children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), and the onset of this propagation (ripple onset zone [ROZ]) estimates the epileptogenic zone. It is still unknown whether we can map this propagation noninvasively. The goal of this study is to map ripples (ripple zone [RZ]) and their propagation onset (ROZ) using high‐density EEG (HD‐EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and to estimate their prognostic value in pediatric epilepsy surgery.


Methods
We retrospectively analyzed simultaneous HD‐EEG and MEG data from 28 children with MRE who underwent icEEG and epilepsy surgery. Using electric and magnetic source imaging, we estimated virtual sensors (VSs) at brain locations that matched the icEEG implantation. We detected ripples on VSs, defined the virtual RZ and virtual ROZ, and estimated their distance from icEEG. We assessed the predictive value of resecting virtual RZ and virtual ROZ for postsurgical outcome. Interictal spike localization on HD‐EEG and MEG was also performed and compared with ripples.


Results
We mapped ripple propagation in all patients with HD‐EEG and in 27 (96%) patients with MEG. The distance from icEEG did not differ between HD‐EEG and MEG when mapping the RZ (26–27mm, p = 0.6) or ROZ (22–24mm, p = 0.4). Resecting the virtual ROZ, but not virtual RZ or the sources of spikes, was associated with good outcome for HD‐EEG (p = 0.016) and MEG (p = 0.047).


Interpretation
HD‐EEG and MEG can map interictal ripples and their propagation onset (virtual ROZ). Noninvasively mapping the ripple onset may augment epilepsy surgery planning and improve surgical outcome of children with MRE. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The free energy principle (FEP) is a mathematical framework that describes
how biological systems self-organize and survive in their environment. This
principle provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral and
cognitive functions such as attention or foraging, down to the dynamics of
specialized cortical microcircuits, suggesting that the FEP manifests on
several levels of brain function. Here, we apply the FEP to one of the smallest
functional units of the brain: single excitatory synaptic connections. By
focusing on an experimentally well understood biological system we are able to
derive learning rules from first principles while keeping assumptions minimal.
This synapse-centric account of the FEP predicts that synapses interact with
the soma of the post-synaptic neuron through stochastic synaptic releases to
probe their behavior and use back-propagating action potentials as feedback to
update the synaptic weights. The emergent learning rules are regulated triplet
STDP rules that depend only on the timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes
and the internal states of the synapse. The parameters of the learning rules
are fully determined by the parameters of the post-synaptic neuron model,
suggesting a close interplay between the synaptic and somatic compartment and
making precise predictions about the synaptic dynamics. The synapse-level
uncertainties automatically lead to representations of uncertainty on the
network level that manifest in ambiguous situations. We show that the FEP
learning rules can be applied to spiking neural networks for supervised and
unsupervised learning and for a closed loop learning task where a behaving
agent interacts with an environment.

 &lt;p&gt;A novel representationalist theory of consciousness is presented that is
grounded in neuroscience and provides a path to artificially conscious
computing. Central to the theory are representational affordances of the
conscious experience based on the generation of qualia, the fundamental unit of
the conscious representation. The current approach is focused on understanding
the balance of simulation, situatedness, and structural coherence of artificial
conscious representations through converging evidence from neuroscientific and

situated and structurally coherent simulation-based qualia are hypothesized to

 &lt;p&gt;There were over 70,000 drug overdose deaths in the USA in 2017. Almost half
of those involved the use of Opioids such as Heroin. This research supports
efforts to combat the Opioid Epidemic by further understanding factors that
lead to Heroin consumption. Previous research has debated the cause of Heroin
addiction, with some explaining the phenomenon as a transition from
prescription Opioids, and others pointing to various psycho-social factors.
This research used self-reported information about personality, demographics
and drug consumption behavior to predict Heroin consumption. By applying a
Support Vector Machine algorithm optimized with a Genetic Algorithm (GA-SVM
Hybrid) to simultaneously identify predictive features and model parameters,
this research produced several models that were more accurate in predicting
Heroin use than those produced in previous studies. Although all factors had
predictive power, these results showed that consumption of other drugs (both
prescription and illicit) were stronger predictors of Heroin use than
psycho-social factors. The use of prescription drugs as a strong predictor of
Heroin use is an important though disturbing discovery but that can help combat
Heroin use.

 &lt;p&gt;Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) became popular due to their successful
application difficult problems such image and speech recognition. However, when
practitioners want to design an ANN they need to undergo laborious process of
selecting a set of parameters and topology. Currently, there are several
state-of-the art methods that allow for the automatic selection of some of
these aspects. Learning Rate optimizers are a set of such techniques that
search for good values of learning rates. Whilst these techniques are effective
and have yielded good results over the years, they are general solution i.e.
they do not consider the characteristics of a specific network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a framework called AutoLR to automatically design Learning Rate
Optimizers. Two versions of the system are detailed. The first one, Dynamic
AutoLR, evolves static and dynamic learning rate optimizers based on the
current epoch and the previous learning rate. The second version, Adaptive
AutoLR, evolves adaptive optimizers that can fine tune the learning rate for
each network eeight which makes them generally more effective. The results are
competitive with the best state of the art methods, even outperforming them in
some scenarios. Furthermore, the system evolved a classifier, ADES, that
appears to be novel and innovative since, to the best of our knowledge, it has
a structure that differs from state of the art methods.

 &lt;p&gt;Inspired by more detailed modeling of biological neurons, Spiking neural
networks (SNNs) have been investigated both as more biologically plausible and
potentially more powerful models of neural computation, and also with the aim
of extracting biological neurons' energy efficiency; the performance of such
networks however has remained lacking compared to classical artificial neural
networks (ANNs). Here, we demonstrate how a novel surrogate gradient combined
with recurrent networks of tunable and adaptive spiking neurons yields
state-of-the-art for SNNs on challenging benchmarks in the time-domain, like
speech and gesture recognition. This also exceeds the performance of standard
classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and approaches that of the best
modern ANNs. As these SNNs exhibit sparse spiking, we show that they
theoretically are one to three orders of magnitude more computationally
efficient compared to RNNs with comparable performance. Together, this
positions SNNs as an attractive solution for AI hardware implementations.

 &lt;p&gt;Encoding information with precise spike timings using spike-coded neurons has
been shown to be more computationally powerful than rate-coded approaches.
However, most existing supervised learning algorithms for spiking neurons are
complicated and offer poor time complexity. To address these limitations, we
propose a supervised multi-spike learning algorithm which reduces the required
number of training iterations. We achieve this by formulating a large number of
weight updates as a linear constraint satisfaction problem, which can be solved
efficiently. Experimental results show this method offers better efficiency
compared to existing algorithms on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, we provide
experimental results on the classification capacity of the LIF neuron model,
relative to several parameters of the system.

 &lt;p&gt;Malicious URL detection is an emerging research area due to continuous
modernization of various systems, for instance, Edge Computing. In this
article, we present a novel malicious URL detection technique, called deepBF
(deep learning and Bloom Filter). deepBF is presented in two-fold. Firstly, we
propose a learned Bloom Filter using 2-dimensional Bloom Filter. We
experimentally decide the best non-cryptography string hash function. Then, we
derive a modified non-cryptography string hash function from the selected hash
function for deepBF by introducing biases in the hashing method and compared
among the string hash functions. The modified string hash function is compared
to other variants of diverse non-cryptography string hash functions. It is also
compared with various filters, particularly, counting Bloom Filter, Kirsch
\textit{et al.}, and Cuckoo Filter using various use cases. The use cases
unearth weakness and strength of the filters. Secondly, we propose a malicious
URL detection mechanism using deepBF. We apply the evolutionary convolutional
neural network to identify the malicious URLs. The evolutionary convolutional
neural network is trained and tested with malicious URL datasets. The output is
tested in deepBF for accuracy. We have achieved many conclusions from our
experimental evaluation and results and are able to reach various conclusive
decisions which are presented in the article.

 &lt;p&gt;Simulation-based optimization using agent-based models is typically carried
out under the assumption that the gradient describing the sensitivity of the
simulation output to the input cannot be evaluated directly. To still apply
gradient-based optimization methods, which efficiently steer the optimization
towards a local optimum, gradient estimation methods can be employed. However,
many simulation runs are needed to obtain accurate estimates if the input
dimension is large. Automatic differentiation (AD) is a family of techniques to
compute gradients of general programs directly. Here, we explore the use of AD
in the context of time-driven agent-based simulations. By substituting common
discrete model elements such as conditional branching with smooth
approximations, we obtain gradient information across discontinuities in the
model logic. On the example of microscopic traffic models and an epidemics
model, we study the fidelity and overhead of the differentiable models, as well
as the convergence speed and solution quality achieved by gradient-based
optimization compared to gradient-free methods. In traffic signal timing
optimization problems with high input dimension, the gradient-based methods
exhibit substantially superior performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the
approach enables gradient-based training of neural network-controlled
simulation entities embedded in the model logic.

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing systems such as DYNAPs and Loihi have recently been
introduced to the computing community to improve performance and energy
efficiency of machine learning programs, especially those that are implemented
using Spiking Neural Network (SNN). The role of a system software for
neuromorphic systems is to cluster a large machine learning model (e.g., with
many neurons and synapses) and map these clusters to the computing resources of
the hardware. In this work, we formulate the energy consumption of a
neuromorphic hardware, considering the power consumed by neurons and synapses,
and the energy consumed in communicating spikes on the interconnect. Based on
such formulation, we first evaluate the role of a system software in managing
the energy consumption of neuromorphic systems. Next, we formulate a simple
heuristic-based mapping approach to place the neurons and synapses onto the
computing resources to reduce energy consumption. We evaluate our approach with
10 machine learning applications and demonstrate that the proposed mapping
approach leads to a significant reduction of energy consumption of neuromorphic
computing systems.

 &lt;p&gt;It has long been hypothesized that operating close to the critical state is
beneficial for natural and artificial systems. We test this hypothesis by
evolving foraging agents controlled by neural networks that can change the
system's dynamical regime throughout evolution. Surprisingly, we find that all
populations, regardless of their initial regime, evolve to be subcritical in
simple tasks and even strongly subcritical populations can reach comparable
performance. We hypothesize that the moderately subcritical regime combines the
benefits of generalizability and adaptability brought by closeness to
criticality with the stability of the dynamics characteristic for subcritical
systems. By a resilience analysis, we find that initially critical agents
maintain their fitness level even under environmental changes and degrade
slowly with increasing perturbation strength. On the other hand, subcritical
agents originally evolved to the same fitness, were often rendered utterly
inadequate and degraded faster. We conclude that although the subcritical
regime is preferable for a simple task, the optimal deviation from criticality
depends on the task difficulty: for harder tasks, agents evolve closer to
criticality. Furthermore, subcritical populations cannot find the path to
decrease their distance to criticality. In summary, our study suggests that
initializing models near criticality is important to find an optimal and
flexible solution.

 &lt;p&gt;In this work, we show that neural networks can be represented via the
mathematical theory of quiver representations. More specifically, we prove that
a neural network is a quiver representation with activation functions, a
mathematical object that we represent using a network quiver. Also, we show
that network quivers gently adapt to common neural network concepts such as
fully-connected layers, convolution operations, residual connections, batch
normalization, pooling operations and even randomly wired neural networks. We
show that this mathematical representation is by no means an approximation of
what neural networks are as it exactly matches reality. This interpretation is
algebraic and can be studied with algebraic methods. We also provide a quiver
representation model to understand how a neural network creates representations
from the data. We show that a neural network saves the data as quiver
representations, and maps it to a geometrical space called the moduli space,
which is given in terms of the underlying oriented graph of the network, i.e.,
its quiver. This results as a consequence of our defined objects and of
understanding how the neural network computes a prediction in a combinatorial
and algebraic way. Overall, representing neural networks through the quiver
representation theory leads to 9 consequences and 4 inquiries for future
research that we believe are of great interest to better understand what neural
networks are and how they work.

 &lt;p&gt;While deep neural networks have surpassed human performance in multiple
situations, they are prone to catastrophic forgetting: upon training a new
task, they rapidly forget previously learned ones. Neuroscience studies, based
on idealized tasks, suggest that in the brain, synapses overcome this issue by
adjusting their plasticity depending on their past history. However, such
&quot;metaplastic&quot; behaviours do not transfer directly to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in deep neural networks. In this work, we interpret the hidden
weights used by binarized neural networks, a low-precision version of deep
neural networks, as metaplastic variables, and modify their training technique
to alleviate forgetting. Building on this idea, we propose and demonstrate
experimentally, in situations of multitask and stream learning, a training
technique that reduces catastrophic forgetting without needing previously
presented data, nor formal boundaries between datasets and with performance
approaching more mainstream techniques with task boundaries. We support our
approach with a theoretical analysis on a tractable task. This work bridges
computational neuroscience and deep learning, and presents significant assets
for future embedded and neuromorphic systems, especially when using novel
nanodevices featuring physics analogous to metaplasticity.

 &lt;p&gt;The ability to store and retrieve learned information over prolonged periods of time is an essential and intriguing property of the brain. Insight into the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie memory consolidation is of utmost importance for our understanding of memory persistence and how this is affected in memory disorders. Recent evidence indicates that a given memory is encoded by sparsely distributed neurons that become highly activated during learning, so-called engram cells. Research by us and others confirms the persistent nature of cortical engram cells by showing that these neurons are required for memory expression up to at least 1 month after they were activated during learning. Strengthened synaptic connectivity between engram cells is thought to ensure reactivation of the engram cell network during retrieval. However, given the continuous integration of new information into existing neuronal circuits and the relatively rapid turnover rate of synaptic proteins, it is unclear whether a lasting learning-induced increase in synaptic connectivity is mediated by stable synapses or by continuous dynamic turnover of synapses of the engram cell network. Here, we first discuss evidence for the persistence of engram cells and memory-relevant adaptations in synaptic plasticity, and then propose models of synaptic adaptations and molecular mechanisms that may support memory persistence through the maintenance of enhanced synaptic connectivity within an engram cell network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Despite the complexity of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), from their genotype to phenotype, in the last few decades substantial progress has been made in understanding their pathophysiology. Recent accumulating evidence shows the relevance of genetic variants in thousand and one (TAO) kinases as major contributors to several NDDs. Although it is well-known that TAO kinases are a highly conserved family of STE20 kinase and play important roles in multiple biological processes, the emerging roles of TAO kinases in neurodevelopment and NDDs have yet to be intensively discussed. In this review article, we summarize the potential roles of the TAO kinases based on structural and biochemical analyses, present the genetic data from clinical investigations, and assess the mechanistic link between the mutations of TAO kinases, neuropathology, and behavioral impairment in NDDs. We then offer potential perspectives from basic research to clinical therapies, which may contribute to fully understanding how TAO kinases are involved in NDDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;No study to date investigated structural white matter (WM) connectome characteristics in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). Previous research in AN found evidence of imbalances in global and regional connectomic brain architecture and highlighted a role of malnutrition in determining structural brain changes. The aim of our study was to explore the characteristics of the WM network architecture in a sample of patients with AN. Thirty-six patients with AN and 36 healthy women underwent magnetic resonance imaging to obtain a high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted anatomical image and a diffusion tensor imaging scan. Probabilistic tractography data were extracted and analyzed in their network properties through graph theory tools. In comparison to healthy women, patients with AN showed lower global network segregation (normalized clustering: p = 0.029), an imbalance between global network integration and segregation (i.e., lower small-worldness: p = 0.031), and the loss of some of the most integrative and influential hubs. Both clustering and small-worldness correlated with the lowest lifetime body mass index. A significant relationship was found between the average regional loss of cortical volume and changes in network properties of brain nodes: the more the difference in the cortical volume of brain areas, the more the increase in the centrality of corresponding nodes in the whole brain, and the decrease in clustering and efficiency of the nodes of parietal cortex. Our findings showed an unbalanced connectome wiring in AN patients, which seems to be influenced by malnutrition and loss of cortical volume. The role of this rearrangement in the maintenance and prognosis of AN and its reversibility with clinical improvement needs to be established by future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect that provides the contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been demonstrated to affect the linewidth of spectral peaks as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and through this, may be used as an indirect measure of cerebral blood flow related to neural activity. By acquiring MR-spectra interleaved with frames without water suppression, it may be possible to image the BOLD effect and associated metabolic changes simultaneously through changes in the linewidth of the unsuppressed water peak. The purpose of this study was to implement this approach with the MEGA-PRESS sequence, widely considered to be the standard sequence for quantitative measurement of GABA at field strengths of 3 T and lower, to observe how changes in both glutamate (measured as Glx) and GABA levels may relate to changes due to the BOLD effect. MR-spectra and fMRI were acquired from the occipital cortex (OCC) of 20 healthy participants whilst undergoing intrascanner visual stimulation in the form of a red and black radial checkerboard, alternating at 8 Hz, in 90 s blocks comprising 30 s of visual stimulation followed by 60 s of rest. Results show very strong agreement between the changes in the linewidth of the unsuppressed water signal and the canonical haemodynamic response function as well as a strong, negative, but not statistically significant, correlation with the Glx signal as measured from the OFF spectra in MEGA-PRESS pairs. Findings from this experiment suggest that the unsuppressed water signal provides a reliable measure of the BOLD effect and that correlations with associated changes in GABA and Glx levels may also be measured. However, discrepancies between metabolite levels as measured from the difference and OFF spectra raise questions regarding the reliability of the respective methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;How speech sounds are represented in the brain is not fully understood. The mismatch negativity (MMN) has proven to be a powerful tool in this regard. The MMN event-related potential is elicited by a deviant stimulus embedded within a series of repeating standard stimuli. Listeners construct auditory memory representations of these standards despite acoustic variability. In most designs that test speech sounds, however, this variation is typically intra-category: All standards belong to the same phonetic category. In the current paper, inter-category variation is presented in the standards. These standards vary in manner of articulation but share a common phonetic feature. In the standard retroflex experimental block, Mandarin Chinese speaking participants are presented with a series of “standard” consonants that share the feature [retroflex], interrupted by infrequent non-retroflex deviants. In the non-retroflex standard experimental block, non-retroflex standards are interrupted by infrequent retroflex deviants. The within-block MMN was calculated, as was the identity MMN (iMMN) to account for intrinsic differences in responses to the stimuli. We only observed a within-block MMN to the non-retroflex deviant embedded in the standard retroflex block. This suggests that listeners extract [retroflex] despite significant inter-category variation. In the non-retroflex standard block, because there is little on which to base a coherent auditory memory representation, no within-block MMN was observed. The iMMN to the retroflex was observed in a late time-window at centro-parieto-occipital electrode sites instead of fronto-central electrodes, where the MMN is typically observed, potentially reflecting the increased difficulty posed by the added variation in the standards. In short, participants can construct auditory memory representations despite significant acoustic and inter-category phonological variation so long as a shared phonetic feature binds them together.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The brain functional network extracted from the BOLD signals reveals the correlated activity of the different brain regions, which is hypothesized to underlie the integration of the information across functionally specialized areas. Functional networks are not static and change over time and in different brain states, enabling the nervous system to engage and disengage different local areas in specific tasks on demand. Due to the low temporal resolution, however, BOLD signals do not allow the exploration of spectral properties of the brain dynamics over different frequency bands which are known to be important in cognitive processes. Recent studies using imaging tools with a high temporal resolution has made it possible to explore the correlation between the regions at multiple frequency bands. These studies introduce the frequency as a new dimension over which the functional networks change, enabling brain networks to transmit multiplex of information at any time. In this computational study, we explore the functional connectivity at different frequency ranges and highlight the role of the distance between the nodes in their correlation. We run the generalized Kuramoto model with delayed interactions on top of the brain's connectome and show that how the transmission delay and the strength of the connections, affect the correlation between the pair of nodes over different frequency bands.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies have demonstrated improved outcomes for treating ICH-induced neuronal defects, and the neural network reconstruction and neurological function recovery were enhanced in rodent ICH models through the mechanisms of neurogenesis, angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis. However, many key issues associated with the survival, differentiation, and safety of grafted MSCs after ICH remain to be resolved, which hinder the clinical translation of MSC therapy. Herein, we reviewed an overview of the research status of MSC transplantation after ICH in different species including rodents, swine, monkey, and human, and the challenges for MSC-mediated ICH recovery from pathological microenvironment have been summarized. Furthermore, some efficient strategies for the outcome improvement of MSC transplantation were proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Normal establishment of cognition occurs after forming a sensation to stimuli from internal or external cues, in which self-reference processing may be partially involved. However, self-reference processing has been less studied in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) field within the self-reference network (SRN) and has instead been investigated within the default-mode network (DMN). Differences between these networks have been proven in the last decade, while ultra-early diagnoses have increased. Therefore, investigation of the altered pattern of SRN is significantly important, especially in the early stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 65 individuals, including 43 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 22 cognitively normal individuals, participated in this study. The SRN, dorsal attention network (DAN), and salience network (SN) were constructed with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and voxel-based analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore significant regions of network interactions. Finally, the correlation between the network interactions and clinical characteristics was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We discovered four interactions among the three networks, with the SRN showing different distributions in the left and right hemispheres from the DAN and SN and modulated interactions between them. Group differences in the interactions that were impaired in MCI patients indicated that the degree of damage was most severe in the SRN, least severe in the SN, and intermediate in the DAN. The two SRN-related interactions showed positive effects on the executive and memory performances of MCI patients with no overlap with the clinical assessments performed in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study is the first and primary evidence of SRN interactions related to MCI patients’ functional performance. The influence of the SRN in the ultra-early stages of AD is nonnegligible. There are still many unknowns regarding the contribution of the SRN in AD progression, and we strongly recommend future research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Behavioral specialization is key to the success of social insects and leads to division of labor among colony members. Response thresholds to task-specific stimuli are thought to proximally regulate behavioral specialization but their neurobiological regulation is complex and not well-understood. Here, we show that response thresholds to task-relevant stimuli correspond to the specialization of three behavioral phenotypes of honeybee workers in the well-studied and important &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Apis cerana&lt;/i&gt;. Quantitative neuropeptidome comparisons suggest two tachykinin-related peptides (TRP2 and TRP3) as candidates for the modification of these response thresholds. Based on our characterization of their receptor binding and downstream signaling, we confirm a functional role of tachykinin signaling in regulating specific responsiveness of honeybee workers: TRP2 injection and RNAi-mediated downregulation cause consistent, opposite effects on responsiveness to task-specific stimuli of each behaviorally specialized phenotype but not to stimuli that are unrelated to their tasks. Thus, our study demonstrates that TRP-signaling regulates the degree of task-specific responsiveness of specialized honeybee workers and may control the context-specificity of behavior in animals more generally.</content>

 Corruption often involves bribery, when a briber suborns a power-holder to gain advantages usually at a cost of moral transgression. Despite its wide presence in human societies, the neurocomputational basis of bribery remains elusive. Here, using model-based fMRI, we investigated the neural substrates of how a power-holder decides to accept or reject a bribe. Power-holders considered two types of moral cost brought by taking bribes: the cost of conniving with a fraudulent briber, encoded in the anterior insula, and the harm brought to a third party, represented in the right temporoparietal junction. These moral costs were integrated into a value signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was selectively engaged to guide anti-corrupt behaviors when a third party would be harmed. Multivariate and connectivity analyses further explored how these neural processes depend on individual differences. These findings advance our understanding of the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying corrupt behaviors.</content>

 Glia in the central nervous system engulf neuron fragments to remodel synapses and recycle photoreceptor outer-segments. Whether glia passively clear shed neuronal debris, or actively prune neuron fragments is unknown. How pruning of single-neuron endings impacts animal behavior is also unclear. Here we report our discovery of glia-directed neuron pruning in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans. &lt;/i&gt;Adult &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;AMsh glia engulf sensory endings of the AFD thermosensory neuron by repurposing components of the conserved apoptotic corpse phagocytosis machinery. The phosphatidylserine (PS) flippase TAT-1/ATP8A, functions with glial PS-receptor PSR-1/PSR and PAT-2/α-integrin to initiate engulfment. This activates glial CED-10/Rac1 GTPase through the ternary GEF complex of CED-2/CrkII, CED-5/DOCK180, CED-12/ELMO. Execution of phagocytosis uses the actin-remodeler WSP-1/nWASp. This process dynamically tracks AFD activity and is regulated by temperature, the AFD sensory input. Importantly, glial CED-10 levels regulate engulfment rates downstream of neuron activity, and engulfment-defective mutants exhibit altered AFD-ending shape and thermosensory behavior. Our findings reveal a molecular pathway underlying glia-dependent engulfment in a peripheral sense-organ, and demonstrate that glia actively engulf neuron-fragments, with profound consequences on neuron shape and animal sensory behavior.</content>

 Human and non-human primates are good at identifying an object based on its motion, a task that is believed to be carried out by the ventral visual pathway. However, the neural mechanisms underlying such ability remains unclear. We trained macaque monkeys to do orientation discrimination for motion-boundaries (MB) and recorded neuronal response in area V2 with microelectrode arrays. We found 10.9% of V2 neurons exhibited robust orientation-selectivity to MBs, and their responses correlated with monkeys' orientation-discrimination performances. Furthermore, the responses of V2 direction-selective neurons recorded at the same time showed correlated activity with MB neurons for particular MB stimuli, suggesting that these motion-sensitive neurons made specific functional contributions to MB discrimination tasks. Our findings support the view that V2 plays a critical role in MB analysis and may achieve this through a neural circuit within area V2.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria form close physical associations to facilitate calcium transfer, thereby regulating mitochondrial function. Neurons with high metabolic demands, such as sensory hair cells, are especially dependent on precisely regulated ER-mitochondria associations. We previously showed that the secreted metalloprotease Pregnancy associated plasma protein-aa (Pappaa) regulates mitochondrial function in zebrafish lateral line hair cells (Alassaf et al., 2019). Here, we show that &lt;i&gt;pappaa &lt;/i&gt;mutant hair cells exhibit excessive and abnormally close ER-mitochondria associations, suggesting increased ER-mitochondria calcium transfer. &lt;i&gt;pappaa&lt;/i&gt; mutant hair cells are more vulnerable to pharmacological induction of ER-calcium transfer. Additionally, &lt;i&gt;pappaa &lt;/i&gt;mutant hair cells display ER stress and dysfunctional downstream processes of the ER-mitochondria axis including altered mitochondrial morphology and reduced autophagy. We further show that Pappaa influences ER-calcium transfer and autophagy via its ability to stimulate insulin-like growth factor-1 bioavailability. Together our results identify Pappaa as a novel regulator of the ER-mitochondria axis.</content>

 Across sensory systems, complex spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity arise following the onset (ON) and offset (OFF) of stimuli. While ON responses have been widely studied, the mechanisms generating OFF responses in cortical areas have so far not been fully elucidated. We examine here the hypothesis that OFF responses are single-cell signatures of recurrent interactions at the network level. To test this hypothesis, we performed population analyses of two-photon calcium recordings in the auditory cortex of awake mice listening to auditory stimuli, and compared linear single-cell and network models. While the single-cell model explained some prominent features of the data, it could not capture the structure across stimuli and trials. In contrast, the network model accounted for the low-dimensional organisation of population responses and their global structure across stimuli, where distinct stimuli activated mostly orthogonal dimensions in the neural state-space.</content>

 Hippocampal neurogenesis has a role in many essential learning and memory processes, including forgetting. This forgetting process is important because it prevents proactive interference between old and new memories. While several studies have now established the role of neurogenesis in forgetting, the specific mechanisms mediating neurogenesis-induced forgetting have not been elucidated. The goal of this study was to examine how increased neurogenesis affects the recall of context fear memory in addition to its effects on population activity within hippocampal subregions. We trained mice in contextual fear conditioning and then increased neurogenesis via 4 weeks of voluntary wheel running. Increased neurogenesis led to a reduction in freezing behaviour during context testing, replicating previous studies showing that increased neurogenesis causes forgetting of context fear memories. Additionally, we mapped the expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos within hippocampal subregions and found that increasing neurogenesis led to reduced CA1 c-Fos expression during context testing. The results suggest that reduced CA1 population activity may underlie the association between increased neurogenesis and forgetting.</content>

 Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) struggle with social interactions due to deficits in theory of mind (ToM). In this study, we collected behavioral and neuroimaging data from 9 children with ASD and 19 neurotypical children between the age of 7 and 14 years old, particularly in the area of emotion recognition to better understand those skills needed for meaningful social interaction. The results suggest impaired abilities in multiple ToM metrics and brain deficits associated with ToM-related emotion recognition and processing among children with ASD. Findings from this study are expected to establish connections between behavior and brain activities surrounding ToM in ASD, which may assist the development of neuroanatomical diagnostic criteria and provide a way to measure intervention outcomes.</content>

 The adult brain is organized into distinct functional networks, forming the basis of information processing and determining individual differences in behavior. Is this network organization genetically determined and present at birth? Here, we use unsupervised learning to uncover intrinsic functional brain organization using resting-state connectivity from a large cohort of neonates (Developing Human Connectome Project). We identified a set of symmetric, hierarchical, and replicable networks: sensorimotor, visual, default mode, ventral attention, and high-level vision. We also quantified neonate individual variability, finding low variability for sensorimotor, but high for ventral attention networks. These neonate networks resembled adult networks (Yeo et al., 2011), but frontoparietal and limbic networks found in adults were indiscernible in neonates. Finally, differential gene expression provided a potential explanation for the emergence of these distinct networks. Our results reveal the basic proto-organization of cortex at birth, but indicate a role for maturation and experience in developing adult-like functional brain organization.</content>

 Neuronal activity generates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific loci in vitro and this facilitates the rapid transcriptional induction of early response genes (ERGs). Physiological neuronal activity, including exposure of mice to learning behaviors, also cause the formation of DSBs, yet the distribution of these breaks and their relation to brain function remains unclear. Here, following contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, we profiled the locations of DSBs genome-wide in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus using {gamma}H2AX ChIP-Seq. Remarkably, we found that DSB formation is widespread in the brain compared to cultured primary neurons and they are predominately involved in synaptic processes. We observed increased DNA breaks at genes induced by CFC in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei. Activity-regulated and proteostasis-related transcription factors appear to govern some of these gene expression changes across cell types. Finally, we find that glia but not neurons have a robust transcriptional response to glucocorticoids, and many of these genes are sites of DSBs. Our results indicate that learning behaviors cause widespread DSB formation in the brain that are associated with experience-driven transcriptional changes across both neuronal and glial cells.</content>

		<content type="html">
 When listening to speech, brain responses time-lock to acoustic events in the stimulus. Recent studies have also reported that cortical responses track linguistic representations of speech. However, tracking of these representations is often described without controlling for acoustic properties. Therefore, the response to these linguistic representations might reflect unaccounted acoustic processing rather than language processing. Here we tested several recently proposed linguistic representations, using audiobook speech, while controlling for acoustic and other linguistic representations. Indeed, some of these linguistic representations were not significantly tracked after controlling for acoustic properties. However, phoneme surprisal, cohort entropy, word surprisal and word frequency were significantly tracked over and beyond acoustic properties. Additionally, these linguistic representations are tracked similarly across different stories, spoken by different readers. Together, this suggests that these representations characterize processing of the linguistic content of speech and might allow a behaviour-free evaluation of the speech intelligibility.</content>

 The extraction of &quot;fingerprints&quot; from human brain connectivity data has become a new frontier in neuroscience. However, the time scales of human brain identifiability have not been addressed yet. In other words, what temporal features make our brains more &quot;identifiable&quot;? We here explore the dynamics of brain fingerprints (or brainprints) along two complementary axes: 1) what is the optimal time scale at which brainprints integrate sufficient information, 2) when best identification happens. Using dynamic identifiability, we show that the best identification emerges at longer time scales (~300s); however, short transient &quot;bursts of identifiability&quot; persist even when looking at shorter functional interactions. We find that these bursts of identifiability might be strongly associated with neuronal activity. Furthermore, we report evidence that different parts of connectome fingerprints relate to different time scales: i.e., more visual-somatomotor at short temporal windows, more frontoparietal-DMN driven by increasing temporal windows. Finally, using a meta-analytic approach, we show that there is a broad spectrum of associations between brainprints and behavior. At faster time scales, human brain fingerprints are linked to multisensory stimulation, eye movements, affective processing, visuospatial attention. At slower time scales instead, we find higher-cognitive functions, such as language and verbal semantics, awareness, declarative and working memory, social cognition. We hope that this first investigation of the temporality of the human brain fingerprint will pave the way towards a better understanding of what and when makes our brains unique.</content>

 Brain activities, called brain rhythms, are the micro-level electrical signals (that is, Electroencephalogram or EEG) generated in our brain while we are performing a task. Even when we imagine a limb movement, it generates the same EEG signals called motor-imagery. Motor-imagery-based Brain-computer Interface (BCI) provides a non-muscular means to connect the human brain with limbs through computer-based interpretations. The main aim of this paper is to find a suitable feature-set and a classifier to efficiently classify EEG signals into distinct motor-imagery brain-states. We propose to use sliding temporal window-based approaches for feature extraction from EEG and a mix-bagging classifier which is essentially a bagging-based ensemble of multiple types of learners for motor imagery EEG classification. We observe that mix-bagging with overlapping sliding window-based feature extraction achieves an accuracy of 91.43% on the BCI Competition II Dataset III. To reduce the feature size further, we use a fuzzy discernibility matrix that selects the most discriminative features instead of all the features. This additional feature selection strategy improves the classification accuracy to 92.14% and sets a new state-of-the-art result on this dataset.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Loss of myelin underlies the pathology of several neurological disorders of diverse etiology. CNS remyelination by adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) can occur but it differs from developmental myelination carried out by neonatal OPCs. We asked whether the myelin proteome of remyelinated regions is changed. We compared the myelin proteome formed during development to the remyelination proteome attained after lysolecithin-induced demyelination in the mouse spinal cord. Mass-spectrometry analysis of iTRAQ labelled myelin protein lysates showed that the proteome of remyelination is different from that of developmental myelination, leading to profound changes in myelin protein content. Aside from known mediators of oligodendrocyte differentiation, we found proteome alterations included modulators of metabolism, cell signaling and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Downregulating one candidate (FSCN1/Fascin1) was sufficient to partially hamper oligodendrocytes in-vitro. In summary, we identify the difference in the proteome of remyelinating oligodendrocytes as a novel potential contributor to the pathophysiology of demyelinating disorders, thus providing new potential therapeutic targets for future studies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Impaired working memory capacity is a common and disabling consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that is caused by aberrant neural processing. However, due to high heterogeneity in results across studies, it is challenging to conclude whether impaired working memory in this population is driven by neural hypo- or hyper-activation, and the extent to which deficits are perpetuated by specific working memory subprocesses. Using a combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and working memory paradigm, we tested the hypothesis that the pattern of neural activation subserving working memory following TBI would interact with both task demands and specific working memory subcomponents: encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Behaviourally, we found that working memory deficits were confined to the high cognitive load trials. Our results confirmed our key prediction. Overall, TBI participants showed reduced brain activity while performing the working memory task. However, interrogation of the subcomponents of working memory revealed a more nuanced pattern of activation. When we simply averaged across all task trials, regardless of cognitive load or subcomponent, TBI participants showed reduced neural activation. When examined more closely, patterns of brain activity following TBI were found to interact with both task demands and working memory subcomponent. Participants with TBI demonstrated an inability to appropriately modulate brain activity between low and high demand conditions necessary during encoding and maintenance stages. Therefore, we demonstrate that conclusions about aberrant neural processing are dependent upon the level of analysis and the extent to which general cognitive domains can be parcellated into its constituent parts.</content>

 Using neuronal tract tracing and immunohistochemical methods, we have identified a previously unreported group of auditory efferent neurons located in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus that project unmyelinated axons to the inner hair cell region in mouse. These ‘dorsal efferents’ were then anatomically characterized using a combination of light, fluorescent and electron microscopy, and their possible functional significance within the context of the known olivocochlear efferents is discussed.






Abstract
Auditory efferents originate in the central auditory system and project to the cochlea. Although the specific anatomy of the olivocochlear (OC) efferents can vary between species, two types of auditory efferents have been identified based upon the general location of their cell bodies and their distinctly different axon terminations in the organ of Corti. In the mouse, the relatively small somata of the lateral (LOC) efferents reside in the lateral superior olive (LSO), have unmyelinated axons, and terminate around ipsilateral inner hair cells (IHCs), primarily against the afferent processes of type I auditory nerve fibers. In contrast, the larger somata of the medial (MOC) efferents are distributed in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB), have myelinated axons, and terminate bilaterally against the base of multiple outer hair cells (OHCs). Using in vivo retrograde cell body marking, anterograde axon tracing, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, we have identified a group of efferent neurons in mouse, whose cell bodies reside in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL). By virtue of their location, we call them dorsal efferent (DE) neurons. Labelled DE cells were immuno‐negative for tyrosine hydroxylase, glycine, and GABA, but immuno‐positive for choline acetyltransferase. Morphologically, DEs resembled LOC efferents by their small somata, unmyelinated axons, and ipsilateral projection to IHCs. These three classes of efferent neurons all project axons directly to the cochlea and exhibit cholinergic staining characteristics. The challenge is to discover the contributions of this new population of neurons to auditory efferent function.

 &lt;p&gt;Educational datamining involves the application of datamining techniques to
student activity. However, in the context of computer programming, many
datamining techniques can not be applied because they expect vector-shaped
input whereas computer programs have the form of syntax trees. In this paper,
we present ast2vec, a neural network that maps Python syntax trees to vectors
and back, thereby facilitating datamining on computer programs as well as the
interpretation of datamining results. Ast2vec has been trained on almost half a
million programs of novice programmers and is designed to be applied across
learning tasks without re-training, meaning that users can apply it without any
need for (additional) deep learning. We demonstrate the generality of ast2vec
in three settings: First, we provide example analyses using ast2vec on a
classroom-sized dataset, involving visualization, student motion analysis,
clustering, and outlier detection, including two novel analyses, namely a
progress-variance-projection and a dynamical systems analysis. Second, we
consider the ability of ast2vec to recover the original syntax tree from its
vector representation on the training data and two further large-scale
programming datasets. Finally, we evaluate the predictive capability of a
simple linear regression on top of ast2vec, obtaining similar results to
techniques that work directly on syntax trees. We hope ast2vec can augment the
educational datamining toolbelt by making analyses of computer programs easier,
richer, and more efficient.

 &lt;p&gt;While artificial intelligence has been applied to control players' decisions
in board games for over half a century, little attention is given to games with
no player competition. Pandemic is an exemplar collaborative board game where
all players coordinate to overcome challenges posed by events occurring during
the game's progression. This paper proposes an artificial agent which controls
all players' actions and balances chances of winning versus risk of losing in
this highly stochastic environment. The agent applies a Rolling Horizon
Evolutionary Algorithm on an abstraction of the game-state that lowers the
branching factor and simulates the game's stochasticity. Results show that the
proposed algorithm can find winning strategies more consistently in different
games of varying difficulty. The impact of a number of state evaluation metrics
is explored, balancing between optimistic strategies that favor winning and
pessimistic strategies that guard against losing.

 &lt;p&gt;Thermal issue is of great importance during layout design of heat source
components in systems engineering, especially for high functional-density
products. Thermal analysis generally needs complex simulation, which leads to
an unaffordable computational burden to layout optimization as it iteratively
evaluates different schemes. Surrogate modeling is an effective way to
alleviate computation complexity. However, temperature field prediction (TFP)
with complex heat source layout (HSL) input is an ultra-high dimensional
nonlinear regression problem, which brings great difficulty to traditional
regression models. The Deep neural network (DNN) regression method is a
feasible way for its good approximation performance. However, it faces great
challenges in both data preparation for sample diversity and uniformity in the
layout space with physical constraints, and proper DNN model selection and
training for good generality, which necessitates efforts of both layout
designer and DNN experts. To advance this cross-domain research, this paper
proposes a DNN based HSL-TFP surrogate modeling task benchmark. With
consideration for engineering applicability, sample generation, dataset
evaluation, DNN model, and surrogate performance metrics, are thoroughly
studied. Experiments are conducted with ten representative state-of-the-art DNN
models. Detailed discussion on baseline results is provided and future
prospects are analyzed for DNN based HSL-TFP tasks.

 &lt;p&gt;Although there are massive parameters in deep neural networks, the training
can actually proceed in a rather low-dimensional space. By investigating such
low-dimensional properties of the training trajectory, we propose a Dynamic
Linear Dimensionality Reduction (DLDR), which dramatically reduces the
parameter space to a variable subspace of significantly lower dimension. Since
there are only a few variables to optimize, second-order methods become
applicable. Following this idea, we develop a quasi-Newton-based algorithm to
train these variables obtained by DLDR, rather than the original parameters of
neural networks. The experimental results strongly support the dimensionality
reduction performance: for many standard neural networks, optimizing over only
40 variables, one can achieve comparable performance against the regular
training over thousands or even millions of parameters.

 &lt;p&gt;It is known that bipolar disorder and its lithium treatment involve the
modulation of oxidative stress. Moreover, it has been observed that lithium's
effects are isotope-dependent. Based on these findings, here we propose that
lithium exerts its effects by influencing the recombination dynamics of a
naturally occurring radical pair involving oxygen. We develop a simple model
inspired by the radical-pair mechanism in cryptochrome in the context of avian
magnetoreception and xenon-induced anesthesia. Our model reproduces the
observed isotopic dependence in the lithium treatment of hyperactivity in rats.
It predicts a magnetic-field dependence of the effectiveness of lithium, which
provides one potential experimental test of our hypothesis. Our findings show
that Nature might harness quantum entanglement for the brain's cognitive
processes.

 &lt;p&gt;The general approach taken when training deep learning classifiers is to save
the parameters after every few iterations, train until either a human observer
or a simple metric-based heuristic decides the network isn't learning anymore,
and then backtrack and pick the saved parameters with the best validation
accuracy. Simple methods are used to determine if a neural network isn't
learning anymore because, as long as it's well after the optimal values are
found, the condition doesn't impact the final accuracy of the model. However
from a runtime perspective, this is of great significance to the many cases
where numerous neural networks are trained simultaneously (e.g. hyper-parameter
tuning). Motivated by this, we introduce a statistical significance test to
determine if a neural network has stopped learning. This stopping criterion
appears to represent a happy medium compared to other popular stopping
criterions, achieving comparable accuracy to the criterions that achieve the
highest final accuracies in 77% or fewer epochs, while the criterions which
stop sooner do so with an appreciable loss to final accuracy. Additionally, we
use this as the basis of a new learning rate scheduler, removing the need to
manually choose learning rate schedules and acting as a quasi-line search,
achieving superior or comparable empirical performance to existing methods.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The role of consciousness in biological cybernetics remains an essential yet
open question. We applied the principles of the Projective Consciousness Model
(PCM) to derive a model of appraisal and social-affective perspective taking,
and their role in the motivation of action, based on the concept of Field of
Consciousness, central to the PCM. We show how these principles can account for
known relationships between appraisal and distance as an inverse distance law,
and how it can be generalised to implement Theory of Mind. We used simulations
of artificial agents based on psychological rationale to demonstrate how
different model parameters could generate a variety of emergent adaptive and
maladaptive behaviours: the ability to be resilient in the face of obstacles
through imaginary projections, the emergence of social approach and joint
attention behaviours, the ability to take advantage of false beliefs attributed
to others, the emergence of avoidance behaviours as observed in social anxiety
disorders, the presence of restricted interests as observed in autism spectrum
disorders. The simulation of agents was applied to a specific robotic context,
and agents' behaviours were demonstrated by controlling the corresponding
robots. The approach opens new paths towards a science of consciousness, and
applications, from clinical assessment and training to the design of artificial
(virtual and robotic) agents.

 &lt;p&gt;The C3–C4 propriospinal system is an important pathway mediating movement in cats; it contributes to movements in primates (including humans), and may have a role in recovery after lesion. Validated clinical tests of this system would find many applications, therefore we sought to test whether non-monosynaptic homonymous facilitation of the forearm flexor H reflex is mediated solely via a C3–C4 propriospinal pathway. In one anesthetized macaque monkey, median nerve stimulation elicited an H reflex in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR). Median nerve conditioning stimuli at sub-threshold intensities facilitated the H reflex, for inter-stimulus intervals up to 30 ms. Successive spinal surgical hemisections were then made. C2 lesion left the homonymous facilitation intact, suggesting mediation by spinal, not supraspinal pathways. Facilitation also remained after a second lesion at C5, indicating a major role for segmental (C7–C8) rather than propriospinal (C3–C4) interneurons. In separate experiments in five healthy human subjects, a threshold tracking approach assessed changes in peripheral axon excitability after conditioning stimulation. This was found to be enhanced up to 20 ms after the conditioning stimulus, and could partly, although not completely, underlie the H reflex facilitation seen. We conclude that homonymous facilitation of the H reflex in FCR can be produced by segmental spinal mechanisms, as well as by a supranormal period of nerve excitability. Unfortunately, this straightforward test cannot therefore be used for selective assessment of propriospinal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHC) and spiral ganglion neurons are specialized to faithfully encode sound with sub-millisecond precision over prolonged periods of time. Here, we studied the role of Rab3 interacting molecule-binding proteins (RIM-BP) 1 and 2 – multidomain proteins of the active zone known to directly interact with RIMs, Bassoon and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 – in IHC presynaptic function and hearing. Recordings of auditory brainstem responses and otoacoustic emissions revealed that genetic disruption of RIM-BPs 1 and 2 in mice (RIM-BP1/2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) causes a synaptopathic hearing impairment exceeding that found in mice lacking RIM-BP2 (RIM-BP2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;). Patch-clamp recordings from RIM-BP1/2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; IHCs indicated a subtle impairment of exocytosis from the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles that had not been observed in RIM-BP2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; IHCs. In contrast, the reduction of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-influx and sustained exocytosis was similar to that in RIMBP2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; IHCs. We conclude that both RIM-BPs are required for normal sound encoding at the IHC synapse, whereby RIM-BP2 seems to take the leading role.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Type I and type II classical cadherins comprise a family of cell adhesion molecules that regulate cell sorting and tissue separation by forming specific homo and heterophilic bonds. Factors that affect cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion include cadherin binding affinity and expression level. This study examines the expression pattern of type I cadherins (Cdh1, Cdh2, Cdh3, and Cdh4), type II cadherins (Cdh6, Cdh7, Cdh8, Cdh9, Cdh10, Cdh11, Cdh12, Cdh18, Cdh20, and Cdh24), and the atypical cadherin 13 (Cdh13) during distinct morphogenetic events in the developing mouse central nervous system from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56. Cadherin mRNA expression levels obtained from in situ hybridization experiments carried out at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (https://alleninstitute.org/) were retrieved from the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas. Cdh2 is the most abundantly expressed type I cadherin throughout development, while Cdh1, Cdh3, and Cdh4 are expressed at low levels. Type II cadherins show a dynamic pattern of expression that varies between neuroanatomical structures and developmental ages. Atypical Cdh13 expression pattern correlates with Cdh2 in abundancy and localization. Analyses of cadherin-mediated relative adhesion estimated from their expression level and binding affinity show substantial differences in adhesive properties between regions of the neural tube associated with the segmentation along the anterior–posterior axis. Differences in relative adhesion were also observed between brain nuclei in the developing subpallium (basal ganglia), suggesting that differential cell adhesion contributes to the segregation of neuronal pools. In the adult cerebral cortex, type II cadherins Cdh6, Cdh8, Cdh10, and Cdh12 are abundant in intermediate layers, while Cdh11 shows a gradated expression from the deeper layer 6 to the superficial layer 1, and Cdh9, Cdh18, and Cdh24 are more abundant in the deeper layers. Person’s correlation analyses of cadherins mRNA expression patterns between areas and layers of the cerebral cortex and the nuclei of the subpallium show significant correlations between certain cortical areas and the basal ganglia. The study shows that differential cadherin expression and cadherin-mediated adhesion are associated with a wide range of morphogenetic events in the developing central nervous system including the organization of neurons into layers, the segregation of neurons into nuclei, and the formation of neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Our previous study revealed that miR-184 expression is significantly altered in the brain following ischemic stroke in rats. However, it is unknown whether this alteration in miR-184 expression contributes to brain injury after ischemic stroke. Here, we aim to address the potential of miR-184 to impact nerve injury following ischemia and reperfusion. Rats received ICV injection of miR-184 adenovirus or empty vector and were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to establish an ischemic stroke model. We cultured SH-SY5Y cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and transfected them with miR-184 lentivirus to explore the primary mechanisms. To evaluate miR-184 expression, neurological function deficits, the cerebral infarct volume, cell viability, and apoptosis, qRT-PCR analysis of miR-184 expression, the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) system, TTC staining, the CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were utilized. We found that miR-184 expression was downregulated and that the cerebral infarct volume and mNSSs were increased following ischemic stroke; however, increasing the level of miR-184 alleviated brain damage. Overexpression of miR-184 resulted in increased viability and reduced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells following OGD/R in vitro. We identified the phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2B (PPAP2B) gene as a direct target gene of miR-184. In summary, our results reveal that attenuation of miR-184 levels in ischemic stroke contributes to ischemic injury through targeting PPAP2B mRNA-mediated apoptosis, which may be a promising therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) post-traumatic injury can cause severe nerve damage with devastating consequences. However, its pathophysiological mechanisms remain vague. There is still an urgent need for more effective treatments. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that can form covalently closed RNA circles. Through second-generation sequencing technology, microarray analysis, bioinformatics, and other technologies, recent studies have shown that a number of circRNAs are differentially expressed after traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI). These circRNAs play important roles in the proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis in CNS post-traumatic injury. In this review, we summarize the expression and functions of circRNAs in CNS in recent studies, as well as the circRNA–miRNA–mRNA interaction networks. The potential clinical value of circRNAs as a therapeutic target is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Different bacterial families colonize most mucosal tissues in the human organism such as the skin, mouth, vagina, respiratory, and gastrointestinal districts. In particular, the mammalian intestine hosts a microbial community of between 1,000 and 1,500 bacterial species, collectively called “microbiota.” Co-metabolism between the microbiota and the host system is generated and the symbiotic relationship is mutually beneficial. The balance that is achieved between the microbiota and the host organism is fundamental to the organization of the immune system. Scientific studies have highlighted a direct correlation between the intestinal microbiota and the brain, establishing the existence of the gut microbiota–brain axis. Based on this theory, the microbiota acts on the development, physiology, and cognitive functions of the brain, although the mechanisms involved have not yet been fully interpreted. Similarly, a close relationship between alteration of the intestinal microbiota and the onset of several neurological pathologies has been highlighted. This review aims to point out current knowledge as can be found in literature regarding the connection between intestinal dysbiosis and the onset of particular neurological pathologies such as anxiety and depression, autism spectrum disorder, and multiple sclerosis. These disorders have always been considered to be a consequence of neuronal alteration, but in this review, we hypothesize that these alterations may be non-neuronal in origin, and consider the idea that the composition of the microbiota could be directly involved. In this direction, the following two key points will be highlighted: (1) the direct cross-talk that comes about between neurons and gut microbiota, and (2) the degree of impact of the microbiota on the brain. Could we consider the microbiota a valuable target for reducing or modulating the incidence of certain neurological diseases?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The first clinical symptoms focused on the presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been respiratory failure, however, accumulating evidence also points to its presentation with neuropsychiatric symptoms, the exact mechanisms of which are not well known. By using a computational methodology, we aimed to explain the molecular paths of COVID-19 associated neuropsychiatric symptoms, based on the mimicry of the human protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Available 11 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins’ structures have been extracted from Protein Data Bank. HMI-PRED (Host-Microbe Interaction PREDiction), a recently developed web server for structural PREDiction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between host and any microbial species, was used to find the “interface mimicry” through which the microbial proteins hijack host binding surfaces. Classification of the found interactions was conducted using the PANTHER Classification System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Predicted Human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions have been extensively compared with the literature. Based on the analysis of the molecular functions, cellular localizations and pathways related to human proteins, SARS-CoV-2 proteins are found to possibly interact with human proteins linked to synaptic vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, axonal transport, neurotransmission, growth factors, mitochondrial and blood-brain barrier elements, in addition to its peripheral interactions with proteins linked to thrombosis, inflammation and metabolic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions may lead to the development of delirium, psychosis, seizures, encephalitis, stroke, sensory impairments, peripheral nerve diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Our findings are also supported by the previous in vivo and in vitro studies from other viruses. Further in vivo and in vitro studies using the proteins that are pointed here, could pave new targets both for avoiding and reversing neuropsychiatric presentations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the morphometric alterations in the cortical and subcortical structures in multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to explore the association with cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 45 MSA patients (25 MSA-only, 20 MSA-MCI) and 29 healthy controls were recruited. FreeSurfer software was used to analyze cortical thickness, and voxel-based morphometry was used to analyze the gray matter volumes. Cortical thickness and gray matter volume changes were correlated with cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared to healthy controls, both MSA subgroups exhibited widespread morphology alterations of brain structures in the fronto-temporal regions. Direct comparison of MSA-MCI and MSA-only patients showed volume reduction in the left superior and middle temporal gyrus, while cortical thinning was found in the left middle and inferior temporal gyrus in MSA-MCI patients. Cortical thinning in the left middle temporal gyrus correlated with cognitive assessment and disease duration.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Structural changes in the brain occur in MSA-MCI patients. The alteration of brain structure in the left temporal regions might be a biomarker of cognitive decline in MSA-MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Selective attention depends on goal-directed and stimulus-driven modulatory factors, each relayed by different brain rhythms. Under certain circumstances, stress-related states can change the balance between goal-directed and stimulus-driven factors. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear. In this study, we explored how psychosocial stress can modulate brain rhythms during an attentional task and a task-free period. We recorded the EEG and ECG activity of 42 healthy participants subjected to either the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a controlled procedure to induce stress, or a comparable control protocol (same physical and cognitive effort but without the stress component), flanked by an attentional task, a 90 s of task-free period and a state of anxiety questionnaire. We observed that psychosocial stress induced an increase in heart rate (HR), self-reported anxiety, and alpha power synchronization. Also, psychosocial stress evoked a relative beta power increase during correct trials of the attentional task, which correlates positively with anxiety and heart rate increase, and inversely with attentional accuracy. These results suggest that psychosocial stress affects performance by redirecting attentional resources toward internal threat-related thoughts. An increment of endogenous top-down modulation reflected an increased beta-band activity that may serve as a compensatory mechanism to redirect attentional resources toward the ongoing task. The data obtained here may contribute to designing new ways of clinical management of the human stress response in the future and could help to minimize the damaging effects of persistent stressful experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Given its non-invasive nature, there is increasing interest in the use of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) across basic, translational and clinical research. Contemporaneously, tVNS can be achieved by stimulating either the auricular branch or the cervical bundle of the vagus nerve, referred to as transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation(VNS) and transcutaneous cervical VNS, respectively. In order to advance the field in a systematic manner, studies using these technologies need to adequately report sufficient methodological detail to enable comparison of results between studies, replication of studies, as well as enhancing study participant safety. We systematically reviewed the existing tVNS literature to evaluate current reporting practices. Based on this review, and consensus among participating authors, we propose a set of minimal reporting items to guide future tVNS studies. The suggested items address specific technical aspects of the device and stimulation parameters. We also cover general recommendations including inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, outcome parameters and the detailed reporting of side effects. Furthermore, we review strategies used to identify the optimal stimulation parameters for a given research setting and summarize ongoing developments in animal research with potential implications for the application of tVNS in humans. Finally, we discuss the potential of tVNS in future research as well as the associated challenges across several disciplines in research and clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in not only the loss of voluntary muscle control, but also in the presence of involuntary movement or spasms. These spasms post-SCI involve hyperexcitability in the spinal motor system. Hyperactive motor commands post SCI result from enhanced excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and persistent inward currents in voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (LTCCs), which are reflected in evoked root reflexes with different timings. To further understand the contributions of these cellular mechanisms and to explore the involvement of LTCC subtypes in SCI-induced hyperexcitability, we measured root reflexes with ventral root recordings and motoneuron activities with intracellular recordings in an in vitro preparation using a mouse model of chronic SCI (cSCI). Specifically, we explored the effects of 1-(3-chlorophenethyl)-3-cyclopentylpyrimidine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione (CPT), a selective negative allosteric modulator of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 LTCCs. Our results suggest a hyperexcitability in the spinal motor system in these SCI mice. Bath application of CPT displayed slow onset but dose-dependent inhibition of the root reflexes with the strongest effect on LLRs. However, the inhibitory effect of CPT is less potent in cSCI mice than in acute SCI (aSCI) mice, suggesting changes either in composition of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 or other cellular mechanisms in cSCI mice. For intracellular recordings, the intrinsic plateau potentials, was observed in more motoneurons in cSCI mice than in aSCI mice. CPT inhibited the plateau potentials and reduced motoneuron firings evoked by intracellular current injection. These results suggest that the LLR is an important target and that CPT has potential in the therapy of SCI-induced muscle spasms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;It is well-established that astrocytes respond to norepinephrine with cytosolic calcium rises in various brain areas, such as hippocampus or neocortex. However, less is known about the effect of norepinephrine on olfactory bulb astrocytes. In the present study, we used confocal calcium imaging and immunohistochemistry in mouse brain slices of the olfactory bulb, a brain region with a dense innervation of noradrenergic fibers, to investigate the calcium signaling evoked by norepinephrine in astrocytes. Our results show that application of norepinephrine leads to a cytosolic calcium rise in astrocytes which is independent of neuronal activity and mainly mediated by PLC/IP3-dependent internal calcium release. In addition, store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) contributes to the late phase of the response. Antagonists of both α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors, but not β-receptors, largely reduce the adrenergic calcium response, indicating that both α-receptor subtypes mediate norepinephrine-induced calcium transients in olfactory bulb astrocytes, whereas β-receptors do not contribute to the calcium transients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hexanucleotide repeat expansion (G4C2&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) mutations in the gene C9ORF72 account for approximately 30% of familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as approximately 7% of sporadic cases of ALS. G4C2&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; mutations are known to result in the production of five species of dipeptide repeat proteins (DRPs) through non-canonical translation processes. Arginine-enriched dipeptide repeat proteins, glycine-arginine (polyGR), and proline-arginine (polyPR) have been demonstrated to be cytotoxic and deleterious in multiple experimental systems. Recently, we and others have implicated methylation of polyGR/polyPR arginine residues in disease processes related to G4C2&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; mutation-mediated neurodegeneration. We previously reported that inhibition of asymmetric dimethylation (ADMe) of arginine residues is protective in cell-based models of polyGR/polyPR cytotoxicity. These results are consistent with the idea that PRMT-mediated arginine methylation in the context of polyGR/polyPR exposure is harmful. However, it remains unclear why. Here we discuss the influence of arginine methylation on diverse cellular processes including liquid-liquid phase separation, chromatin remodeling, transcription, RNA processing, and RNA-binding protein localization, and we consider how methylation of polyGR/polyPR may disrupt processes essential for normal cellular function and survival.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic continues to prevail as a catastrophic wave infecting over 111 million people globally, claiming 2. 4 million lives to date. Aged individuals are particularly vulnerable to this disease due to their fraility, immune dysfunction, and higher rates of medical comorbidities, among other causes. Apart from the primary respiratory illness, this virus is known to cause multi-organ dysfunction including renal, cardiac, and neurologic injuries, particularly in the critically-ill cohorts. Elderly patients 65 years of age or older are known to have more severe systemic disease and higher rates of neurologic complications. Morbidity and mortality is very high in the elderly population with 6–930 times higher likelihood of death compared to younger cohorts, with the highest risk in elderly patients ≥85 years and especially those with medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and underlying respiratory illness. Commonly reported neurologic dysfunctions of COVID-19 include headache, fatigue, dizziness, and confusion. Elderly patients may manifest atypical presentations like fall or postural instability. Other important neurologic dysfunctions in the elderly include cerebrovascular diseases, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Elderly patients with preexisting neurologic diseases are susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection and higher rates of mortality. Treatment of neurologic dysfunction of COVID-19 is based on existing practice standards of specific neurologic condition in conjunction with systemic treatment of the viral illness. The physical, emotional, psychologic, and financial implications of COVID-19 pandemic have been severe. Long-term data are still needed to understand the lasting effects of this devastating pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of α-synuclein (α-Syn)-rich Lewy bodies (LBs) and the preferential loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (SNpc). However, the widespread involvement of other central nervous systems (CNS) structures and peripheral tissues is now widely documented. The onset of the molecular and cellular neuropathology of PD likely occurs decades before the onset of the motor symptoms characteristic of PD, so early diagnosis of PD and adequate tracking of disease progression could significantly improve outcomes for patients. Because the clinical diagnosis of PD is challenging, misdiagnosis is common, which highlights the need for disease-specific and early-stage biomarkers. This review article aims to summarize useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD, as well as the biomarkers used to monitor disease progression. This review article describes the role of α-Syn in PD and how it could potentially be used as a biomarker for PD. Also, preclinical and clinical investigations encompassing genetics, immunology, fluid and tissue, imaging, as well as neurophysiology biomarkers are discussed. Knowledge of the novel biomarkers for preclinical detection and clinical evaluation will contribute to a deeper understanding of the disease mechanism, which should more effectively guide clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Understanding allostery in enzymes and tools to identify it, offer promising alternative strategies to inhibitor development. Through a combination of equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we identify allosteric effects and communication pathways in two prototypical class A β-lactamases, TEM-1 and KPC-2, which are important determinants of antibiotic resistance. The nonequilibrium simulations reveal pathways of communication operating over distances of 30 Å or more. Propagation of the signal occurs through cooperative coupling of loop dynamics. Notably, 50% or more of clinically relevant amino acid substitutions map onto the identified signal transduction pathways. This suggests that clinically important variation may affect, or be driven by, differences in allosteric behavior, providing a mechanism by which amino acid substitutions may affect the relationship between spectrum of activity, catalytic turnover and potential allosteric behavior in this clinically important enzyme family. Simulations of the type presented here will help in identifying and analyzing such differences.</content>

 In emerging epithelial tissues, cells undergo dramatic rearrangements to promote tissue shape changes. Dividing cells remain interconnected via transient cytokinetic bridges. Bridges are cleaved during abscission and currently, the consequences of disrupting abscission in developing epithelia are not well understood. We show that the Rab GTPase, Rab25, localizes near cytokinetic midbodies and likely coordinates abscission through endomembrane trafficking in the epithelium of the zebrafish gastrula during epiboly. In maternal-zygotic Rab25a and Rab25b mutant embryos, morphogenic activity tears open persistent apical cytokinetic bridges that failed to undergo timely abscission. Cytokinesis defects result in anisotropic cell morphologies that are associated with a reduction of contractile actomyosin networks. This slows cell rearrangements and alters the viscoelastic responses of the tissue, all of which likely contribute to delayed epiboly. We present a model in which Rab25 trafficking coordinates cytokinetic bridge abscission and cortical actin density, impacting local cell shape changes and tissue-scale forces.</content>

 The inflammatory environment of demyelinated lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients contributes to remyelination failure. Inflammation activates a cytoprotective pathway, the integrated stress response (ISR), but it remains unclear whether enhancing the ISR can improve remyelination in an inflammatory environment. To examine this possibility, the remyelination stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), as well as a mouse model that incorporates cuprizone-induced demyelination along with CNS delivery of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ were used here. We demonstrate that either genetic or pharmacological ISR enhancement significantly increased the number of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons in the inflammatory lesions. Moreover, the combined treatment of the ISR modulator Sephin1 with the oligodendrocyte differentiation enhancing reagent bazedoxifene increased myelin thickness of remyelinated axons to pre-lesion levels. Taken together, our findings indicate that prolonging the ISR protects remyelinating oligodendrocytes and promotes remyelination in the presence of inflammation, suggesting that ISR enhancement may provide reparative benefit to MS patients.</content>

 Intracisternal A-particles (IAPs) are endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) responsible for most insertional mutations in the mouse. Full-length IAPs harbour genes flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs). Here, we identify a solo LTR IAP variant (&lt;i&gt;Iap5-1&lt;sup&gt;solo&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) recently formed in the inbred C57BL/6J mouse strain. In contrast to the C57BL/6J full-length IAP at this locus (&lt;i&gt;Iap5-1&lt;sup&gt;full&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Iap5-1&lt;sup&gt;solo&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; lacks DNA methylation and H3K9 trimethylation. The distinct DNA methylation levels between the two alleles are established during preimplantation development, likely due to loss of KRAB zinc finger protein binding at the &lt;i&gt;Iap5-1&lt;sup&gt;solo&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; variant. &lt;i&gt;Iap5-1&lt;sup&gt;solo&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; methylation increases and becomes more variable in a hybrid genetic background yet is unresponsive to maternal dietary methyl supplementation. Differential epigenetic modification of the two variants is associated with metabolic differences and tissue-specific changes in adjacent gene expression. Our characterisation of &lt;i&gt;Iap5-1 &lt;/i&gt;as a genetically-induced epiallele with functional consequences establishes a new model to study transposable element repression and host-element co-evolution.</content>

 Numerous reports of vascular events after an initial recovery from COVID-19 form our impetus to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on vascular health of recovered patients. We found elevated levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs), a biomarker of vascular injury, in COVID-19 convalescents compared to healthy controls. In particular, those with pre-existing conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) had more pronounced endothelial activation hallmarks than non-COVID-19 patients with matched cardiovascular risk. Several proinflammatory and activated T lymphocyte-associated cytokines sustained from acute infection to recovery phase, which correlated positively with CEC measures, implicating cytokine-driven endothelial dysfunction. Notably, we found higher frequency of effector T cells in our COVID-19 convalescents compared to healthy controls. The activation markers detected on CECs mapped to counter receptors found primarily on cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, raising the possibility of cytotoxic effector cells targeting activated endothelial cells. Clinical trials in preventive therapy for post-COVID-19 vascular complications may be needed.</content>

We validated this approach by showing that, in pregnant women, circulating DNA carrying fetal-specific alleles was entirely placenta-derived. In lung-transplant recipients, we showed that, at 72 hours after transplantation, the lung contributed only a median of 17% to the plasma DNA carrying donor-specific alleles and hematopoietic cells contributed a median of 78%. In hepatocellular cancer patients, the liver was identified as the predominant source of plasma DNA carrying tumor-specific mutations. In a pregnant woman with lymphoma, plasma DNA molecules carrying cancer mutations and fetal-specific alleles were accurately shown to be derived from the lymphocytes and placenta, respectively. Analysis of tissue origin for plasma DNA carrying genetic variants is potentially useful for noninvasive prenatal testing, transplantation monitoring and cancer screening.</content>

 SHP2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that normally potentiates intracellular signaling by growth factors, antigen receptors, and some cytokines, yet is frequently mutated in human cancer. Here, we examine the role of SHP2 in the responses of breast cancer cells to EGF by monitoring phosphoproteome dynamics when SHP2 is allosterically inhibited by SHP099. The dynamics of phosphotyrosine abundance at more than 400 tyrosine residues reveal six distinct response signatures following SHP099 treatment and washout. Remarkably, in addition to newly identified substrate sites on proteins such as occludin, ARHGAP35, and PLCγ2, another class of sites shows reduced phosphotyrosine abundance upon SHP2 inhibition. Sites of decreased phospho-abundance are enriched on proteins with two nearby phosphotyrosine residues, which can be directly protected from dephosphorylation by the paired SH2 domains of SHP2 itself. These findings highlight the distinct roles of the scaffolding and catalytic activities of SHP2 in effecting a transmembrane signaling response.</content>

 Immunity to malaria is often considered slow to develop but this only applies to defense mechanisms that function to eliminate parasites (resistance). In contrast, immunity to severe disease can be acquired quickly and without the need for improved pathogen control (tolerance). Using &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium chabaudi&lt;/i&gt;, we show that a single malaria episode is sufficient to induce host adaptations that can minimise inflammation, prevent tissue damage and avert endothelium activation, a hallmark of severe disease. Importantly, monocytes are functionally reprogrammed to prevent their differentiation into inflammatory macrophages and instead promote mechanisms of stress tolerance to protect their niche. This alternative fate is not underpinned by epigenetic reprogramming of bone marrow progenitors but appears to be imprinted within the remodelled spleen. Crucially, all of these adaptations operate independently of pathogen load and limit the damage caused by malaria parasites in subsequent infections. Acquired immunity to malaria therefore prioritises host fitness over pathogen clearance.</content>

 Many insects use patterns of polarized light in the sky to orient and navigate. Here we functionally characterize neural circuitry in the fruit fly, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, that conveys polarized light signals from the eye to the central complex, a brain region essential for the fly's sense of direction. Neurons tuned to the angle of polarization of ultraviolet light are found throughout the anterior visual pathway, connecting the optic lobes with the central complex via the anterior optic tubercle and bulb, in a homologous organization to the 'sky compass' pathways described in other insects. We detail how a consistent, map-like organization of neural tunings in the peripheral visual system is transformed into a reduced representation suited to flexible processing in the central brain. This study identifies computational motifs of the transformation, enabling mechanistic comparisons of multisensory integration and central processing for navigation in the brains of insects.</content>

 Mothers are crucial for mammals’ survival before nutritional independence, but many social mammals reside with their mothers long after. In these species the social adversity caused by maternal loss later in life can dramatically reduce fitness. However, in some human populations these negative consequences can be overcome by care from other group members. We investigated the consequences of maternal loss in mountain gorillas and found no discernible fitness costs to maternal loss through survival, age at first birth, or survival of first offspring through infancy. Social network analysis revealed that relationships with other group members, particularly dominant males and those close in age, strengthened following maternal loss. In contrast to most social mammals, where maternal loss causes considerable social adversity, in mountain gorillas, as in certain human populations, this may be buffered by relationships within cohesive social groups, breaking the link between maternal loss, increased social adversity, and decreased fitness.</content>

 Theoretical and empirical advances have revealed the importance of biodiversity for stabilizing ecosystem functions through time. Despite the global degradation of soils, whether the loss of soil microbial diversity can destabilize ecosystem functioning is poorly understood. Here, we experimentally quantified the contribution of soil fungal and bacterial communities to the temporal stability of four key ecosystem functions related to biogeochemical cycling. Microbial diversity enhanced the temporal stability of all ecosystem functions and this pattern was particularly strong in plant-soil mesocosms with reduced microbial richness where over 50% of microbial taxa were lost. The stabilizing effect of soil biodiversity was linked to asynchrony among microbial taxa whereby different soil fungi and bacteria promoted different ecosystem functions at different times. Our results emphasize the need to conserve soil biodiversity for the provisioning of multiple ecosystem functions that soils provide to the society.</content>

 Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are microbial light-gated ion channels utilized in optogenetics to control neural activity with light . Light absorption causes retinal chromophore isomerization and subsequent protein conformational changes visualized as optically distinguished intermediates, coupled with channel opening and closing. However, the detailed molecular events underlying channel gating remain unknown. We performed time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallographic analyses of ChR by using an X-ray free electron laser, which revealed conformational changes following photoactivation. The isomerized retinal adopts a twisted conformation and shifts toward the putative internal proton donor residues, consequently inducing an outward shift of TM3, as well as a local deformation in TM7. These early conformational changes in the pore-forming helices should be the triggers that lead to opening of the ion conducting pore.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Motor inhibitory control implemented as response inhibition is an essential cognitive function required to dynamically adapt to rapidly changing environments. Despite of over a decade of research on the neural mechanisms of response inhibition, it remains unclear, how exactly response inhibition is initiated and implemented. Using a multimodal MEG/fMRI approach in 59 subjects our results reliably reveal that response inhibition is initiated by the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) as a form of attention-independent top-down control that involves the modulation of beta-band activity. Furthermore, stopping performance was predicted by beta-band power and beta-band connectivity was directed from rIFG to pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), indicating rIFG's dominance over pre-SMA. Thus, these results strongly support the hypothesis that rIFG initiates stopping, implemented by beta-band oscillations with potential to open up new ways of spatially localized oscillation-based interventions.</content>

 Domesticated animals experienced profound changes in diet, environment, and social interactions that likely shaped their gut microbiota and were potentially analogous to ecological changes experienced by humans during industrialization. Comparing the gut microbiota of wild and domesticated mammals plus chimpanzees and humans, we found a strong signal of domestication in overall gut microbial community composition and similar changes in composition with domestication and industrialization. Reciprocal diet switches within mouse and canid dyads demonstrated the critical role of diet in shaping the domesticated gut microbiota. Notably, we succeeded in recovering wild-like microbiota in domesticated mice through experimental colonization. Although fundamentally different processes, we conclude that domestication and industrialization have impacted the gut microbiota in related ways, likely through shared ecological change. Our findings highlight the utility, and limitations, of domesticated animal models for human research and the importance of studying wild animals and non-industrialized humans for interrogating signals of host–microbial coevolution.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The claustrum is uniquely positioned to communicate with almost all higher-order cortical areas through widespread and reciprocal anatomical projections, yet the in vivo functional properties of claustrum neurons are not well understood. Here we use microendoscope imaging in mice to measure activity in populations of genetically-labelled Gnb4+ claustrum neurons. We find that only a small fraction of cells in the anterior claustrum are responsive to visual or auditory stimuli when delivered under passive yet wakeful conditions. In contrast, during a visual behavioral task, the majority of cells in the anterior claustrum are strongly modulated, with separate and spatially intermingled cell populations showing either increases or decreases in activity relative to spontaneous levels. Our results suggest that the Gnb4+ cells in the anterior claustrum do not represent passively presented sensory stimuli; rather, these cells are strongly engaged during behavior associated with sensory-motor transformations.</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 Females displayed a greater withdrawal‐induced increase in interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) γ‐aminobutyric acid levels than males. This measure of inhibitory tone was suppressed to a larger extent in females following blockade of corticotropin‐releasing factor type 1 (CRF1) receptors, an effect that was likely due to greater CRF innervation of the IPN in females following chronic nicotine exposure.

Abstract
Prior work in male rodents established that the medial habenula‐interpeduncular nucleus (MHb‐IPN) pathway modulates nicotine withdrawal. Specifically, withdrawal severity has been closely associated with inhibitory tone in the IPN via interneurons that release γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA). Inhibitory tone in the IPN is regulated by projections from the MHb that co‐release glutamate and acetylcholine. Within the IPN, inhibitory tone is also regulated via corticotropin‐releasing factor type 1 (CRF1) receptors that control GABA release from local interneurons. This study extends previous work by comparing sex differences in GABA, glutamate, as well serotonin levels in the IPN during precipitated nicotine withdrawal. Sex differences in withdrawal‐induced neurochemical effects were also compared following systemic administration of a CRF1 receptor antagonist. The results revealed that there were no group differences in serotonin levels in the IPN. A major finding was that females displayed a larger withdrawal‐induced increases in GABA levels in the IPN than males. Also, withdrawal increased IPN glutamate levels in a similar manner in females and males. Blockade of CRF1 receptors produced a larger suppression of the withdrawal‐induced increases in GABA levels in the IPN of females versus males, an effect that was likely related to the robust increase in glutamate following administration of the CRF1 receptor antagonist in females. These data suggest that amino acid systems in the IPN modulate sex differences in the behavioral effects of nicotine withdrawal. Furthermore, our data imply that medications that target stress‐induced activation of the IPN may reduce withdrawal severity, particularly in females.</content>

 Reliable, unbiased, hippocampal subfield volume measurements optimize statistical power of a hypothesis test and reduce standard error of parameter estimate, together improving external validity of the hippocampal volume measures in constructing theoretical models of memory development.

Abstract
The hippocampus (Hc) is composed of cytoarchitectonically distinct subfields: dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis sectors 1‐3 (CA1‐3), and subiculum. Limited evidence suggests differential maturation rates across the Hc subfields. While longitudinal studies are essential in demonstrating differential development of Hc subfields, a prerequisite for interpreting meaningful longitudinal effects is establishing test–retest consistency of Hc subfield volumes measured in vivo over time. Here, we examined test–retest consistency of Hc subfield volumes measured from structural MR images in two independent developmental samples. Sample One (n = 28, ages 7–20 years, M = 12.64, SD = 3.35) and Sample Two (n = 28, ages 7–17 years, M = 11.72, SD = 2.88) underwent MRI twice with a 1‐month and a 2‐year delay, respectively. High‐resolution PD‐TSE‐T2‐weighted MR images (0.4 × 0.4 × 2 mm3) were collected and manually traced using a longitudinal manual demarcation protocol. In both samples, we found excellent consistency of Hc subfield volumes between the two visits, assessed by two‐way mixed intraclass correlation (ICC (3) single measures ≥ 0.87), and no difference between children and adolescents. The results further indicated that discrepancies between repeated measures were not related to Hc subfield volumes, or visit number. In addition to high consistency, with the applied longitudinal protocol, we detected significant variability in Hc subfield volume changes over the 2‐year delay, implying high sensitivity of the method in detecting individual differences. Establishing unbiased, high longitudinal consistency of Hc subfield volume measurements optimizes statistical power of a hypothesis test and reduces standard error of the estimate, together improving external validity of the measures in constructing theoretical models of memory development.</content>

Our sense of touch helps us encounter the richness of our natural world. Across a myriad of contexts and repetitions, we have learned to deploy certain exploratory movements in order to elicit perceptual cues that are salient and efficient. The task of identifying optimal exploration strategies and somatosensory cues that underlie our softness perception remains relevant and incomplete. Leveraging psychophysical evaluations combined with computational finite element modeling of skin contact mechanics, we investigate an illusion phenomenon in exploring softness; where small-compliant and large-stiff spheres are indiscriminable. By modulating contact interactions at the finger pad, we find this elasticity-curvature illusion is observable in passive touch, when the finger is constrained to be stationary and only cutaneous responses from mechanosensitive afferents are perceptible. However, these spheres become readily discriminable when explored volitionally with musculoskeletal proprioception available. We subsequently exploit this phenomenon to dissociate relative contributions from cutaneous and proprioceptive signals in encoding our percept of material softness. Our findings shed light on how we volitionally explore soft objects, i.e., by controlling surface contact force to optimally elicit and integrate proprioceptive inputs amidst indiscriminable cutaneous contact cues. Moreover, in passive touch, e.g., for touch-enabled displays grounded to the finger, we find those spheres are discriminable when rates of change in cutaneous contact are varied between the stimuli, to supplant proprioceptive feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ebHDeLHWLSM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Across the life sciences, processing next generation sequencing data commonly relies upon a computationally expensive process where reads are mapped onto a reference sequence. Prior to such processing, however, there is a vast amount of information that can be ascertained from the reads, potentially obviating the need for processing, or allowing optimized mapping approaches to be deployed. Here, we present a method termed FlexTyper which facilitates a “reverse mapping” approach in which high throughput sequence queries, in the form of k-mer searches, are run against indexed short-read datasets in order to extract useful information. This reverse mapping approach enables the rapid counting of target sequences of interest. We demonstrate FlexTyper’s utility for recovering depth of coverage, and accurate genotyping of SNP sites across the human genome. We show that genotyping unmapped reads can correctly inform a sample’s population, sex, and relatedness in a family setting. Detection of pathogen sequences within RNA-seq data was sensitive and accurate, performing comparably to existing methods, but with increased flexibility. We present two examples of ways in which this flexibility allows the analysis of genome features not well-represented in a linear reference. First, we analyze contigs from African genome sequencing studies, showing how they distribute across families from three distinct populations. Second, we show how gene-marking k-mers for the killer immune receptor locus allow allele detection in a region that is challenging for standard read mapping pipelines. The future adoption of the reverse mapping approach represented by FlexTyper will be enabled by more efficient methods for FM-index generation and biology-informed collections of reference queries. In the long-term, selection of population-specific references or weighting of edges in pan-population reference genome graphs will be possible using the FlexTyper approach. FlexTyper is available at https://github.com/wassermanlab/OpenFlexTyper.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W2i0o-zDRZk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The maintenance of synaptic changes resulting from long-term potentiation (LTP) is essential for brain function such as memory and learning. Different LTP phases have been associated with diverse molecular processes and pathways, and the molecular underpinnings of LTP on the short, as well as long time scales, are well established. However, the principles on the intermediate time scale of 1-6 hours that mediate the early phase of LTP (E-LTP) remain elusive. We hypothesize that the interplay between specific features of postsynaptic receptor trafficking is responsible for sustaining synaptic changes during this LTP phase. We test this hypothesis by formalizing a biophysical model that integrates several experimentally-motivated mechanisms. The model captures a wide range of experimental findings and predicts that synaptic changes are preserved for hours when the receptor dynamics are shaped by the interplay of structural changes of the spine in conjunction with increased trafficking from recycling endosomes and the cooperative binding of receptors. Furthermore, our model provides several predictions to verify our findings experimentally.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6ZUjvMYRm5E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Sesquiterpene synthases (STSs) catalyze the formation of a large class of plant volatiles called sesquiterpenes. While thousands of putative STS sequences from diverse plant species are available, only a small number of them have been functionally characterized. Sequence identity-based screening for desired enzymes, often used in biotechnological applications, is difficult to apply here as STS sequence similarity is strongly affected by species. This calls for more sophisticated computational methods for functionality prediction. We investigate the specificity of precursor cation formation in these elusive enzymes. By inspecting multi-product STSs, we demonstrate that STSs have a strong selectivity towards one precursor cation. We use a machine learning approach combining sequence and structure information to accurately predict precursor cation specificity for STSs across all plant species. We combine this with a co-evolutionary analysis on the wealth of uncharacterized putative STS sequences, to pinpoint residues and distant functional contacts influencing cation formation and reaction pathway selection. These structural factors can be used to predict and engineer enzymes with specific functions, as we demonstrate by predicting and characterizing two novel STSs from &lt;i&gt;Citrus bergamia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wv6DUMRehuA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In contrast to common meiotic gene conversion, mitotic gene conversion, because it is so rare, is often ignored as a process influencing allelic diversity. We show that if there is a large enough number of premeiotic cell divisions, as seen in many organisms without early germline sequestration, such as plants, this is an unsafe position. From examination of 1.1 million rice plants, we determined that the rate of mitotic gene conversion events, per mitosis, is 2 orders of magnitude lower than the meiotic rate. However, owing to the large number of mitoses between zygote and gamete and because of long mitotic tract lengths, meiotic and mitotic gene conversion can be of approximately equivalent importance in terms of numbers of markers converted from zygote to gamete. This holds even if we assume a low number of premeiotic cell divisions (approximately 40) as witnessed in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. A low mitotic rate associated with long tracts is also seen in yeast, suggesting generality of results. For species with many mitoses between each meiotic event, mitotic gene conversion should not be overlooked.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/to16rViU1i8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The scientific community is focused on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data, we compare within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with analogous dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our quantitative analyses using a mathematical model revealed that the within-host reproduction number at symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2 was statistically significantly larger than that of MERS-CoV and similar to that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the time from symptom onset to the viral load peak for SARS-CoV-2 infection was shorter than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These findings suggest the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection by antivirals. We further used the viral dynamics model to predict the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs that have different modes of action. The efficacy was measured by the reduction in the viral load area under the curve (AUC). Our results indicate that therapies that block de novo infection or virus production are likely to be effective if and only if initiated before the viral load peak (which appears 2–3 days after symptom onset), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity of infected cells are likely to have effects with less sensitivity to the timing of treatment initiation. Furthermore, combining a therapy that promotes cytotoxicity and one that blocks de novo infection or virus production synergistically reduces the AUC with early treatment. Our unique modeling approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may be useful for development of antiviral therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uC2PdVrny4Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 We labeled markers of cell division (PCNA), cell migration (DCX), and neuronal maturation (NeuN) in vocal control brain regions of male and female zebra finch brains at four different stages of song learning. Sex differences in the size of these regions emerged by the onset of song learning, and the rate of neurogenic processes varied across brain regions in a sex‐ and region‐specific manner.







Abstract
The brain regions that control the learning and production of song and other learned vocalizations in songbirds exhibit some of the largest sex differences in the brain known in vertebrates and are associated with sex differences in singing behavior. Song learning takes place through multiple stages: an early sensory phase when song models are memorized, followed by a sensorimotor phase in which auditory feedback is used to modify song output through subsong, plastic song, to adult crystalized song. However, how patterns of neurogenesis in these brain regions change through these learning stages, and differ between the sexes, is little explored. We collected brains from 63 young male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) over four stages of song learning. Using neurogenesis markers for cell division (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), neuron migration (doublecortin), and mature neurons (neuron‐specific nuclear protein), we demonstrate that there are sex‐specific changes in neurogenesis over song development that differ between the caudal motor pathway and anterior forebrain pathway of the vocal control circuit. In many of these regions, sex differences emerged very early in development, by 25 days post hatch, at the beginning of song learning. The emergence of sex differences in other components of the system was more gradual and had specific trajectories depending on the brain region and its function. In conclusion, we found that sex differences occurred early and continued during song learning. Moreover, transitions from the different phases of song development do not seem to depend on large changes in neurogenesis in the vocal control areas measured.</content>

 Objective
Migraine is three times more common in women. CGRP plays a critical role in migraine pathology and causes female‐specific behavioral responses upon meningeal application. These effects are likely mediated through interactions of CGRP with signaling systems specific to females. Prolactin (PRL) levels have been correlated with migraine attacks. Here, we explore a potential interaction between CGRP and PRL in the meninges.


Methods
Prolactin, CGRP, and receptor antagonists CGRP8‐37 or Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL were administered onto the dura of rodents followed by behavioral testing. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine PRL, CGRP and Prolactin receptor (Prlr) expression within the dura. Electrophysiology on cultured and back‐labeled trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons was used to assess PRL‐induced excitability. Finally, the effects of PRL on evoked CGRP release from ex vivo dura were measured.


Results
We found that dural PRL produced sustained and long‐lasting migraine‐like behavior in cycling and ovariectomized female, but not male rodents. Prlr was expressed on dural afferent nerves in females with little‐to‐no presence in males. Consistent with this, PRL increased excitability only in female TG neurons innervating the dura and selectively sensitized CGRP release from female ex vivo dura. We demonstrate crosstalk between PRL and CGRP systems as CGRP8‐37 decreases migraine‐like responses to dural PRL. Reciprocally, Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL attenuates dural CGRP‐induced migraine behaviors. Similarly, Prlr deletion from sensory neurons significantly reduced migraine‐like responses to dural CGRP.


Interpretation
This CGRP‐PRL interaction in the meninges is a mechanism by which these peptides could produce female‐selective responses and increase the prevalence of migraine in women.

 Objective
Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke and neurological deficits in children and young adults, however, no pharmacological intervention is available to treat these patients. Although more than 95% of bAVMs are sporadic without family history, the pathogenesis of sporadic bAVMs is largely unknown, which may account for the lack of therapeutic options. KRAS mutations are frequently observed in cancer, and a recent unprecedented finding of these mutations in human sporadic bAVMs offers a new direction in the bAVM research. Using a novel adeno‐associated virus targeting brain endothelium (AAV‐BR1), the current study tested if endothelial KRASG12V mutation induces sporadic bAVMs in mice.


Methods
Five‐week‐old mice were systemically injected with either AAV‐BR1‐GFP or ‐KRASG12V. At 8 weeks after the AAV injection, bAVM formation and characteristics were addressed by histological and molecular analyses. The effect of MEK/ERK inhibition on KRASG12V‐induced bAVMs was determined by treatment of trametinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved MEK/ERK inhibitor.


Results
The viral‐mediated KRASG12V overexpression induced bAVMs, which were composed of a tangled nidus mirroring the distinctive morphology of human bAVMs. The bAVMs were accompanied by focal angiogenesis, intracerebral hemorrhages, altered vascular constituents, neuroinflammation, and impaired sensory/cognitive/motor functions. Finally, we confirmed that bAVM growth was inhibited by trametinib treatment.


Interpretation
Our innovative approach using AAV‐BR1 confirms that KRAS mutations promote bAVM development via the MEK/ERK pathway, and provides a novel preclinical mouse model of bAVMs which will be useful to develop a therapeutic strategy for patients with bAVM. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Risk factors for developing dementia from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) probably differ between MCI subtypes. We investigated how frailty relates to dementia risk in amnestic MCI (a‐MCI; n = 2,799) and non‐amnestic MCI (na‐MCI; n = 629) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Although higher frailty increased dementia risk for people with either a‐MCI or na‐MCI, the larger risk was in na‐MCI (interaction hazard ratio = 1.35 [95% confidence interval = 1.15–1.59], p &amp;lt; 0.001). Even after the onset of clinically significant cognitive impairment, poor general health, quantified by a high degree of frailty, is a significant risk for dementia. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Glutamate delta 1 (GluD1) is more strongly expressed in the striosome than in the matrix compartment of the monkey caudate nucleus. At the subcellular level, GluD1 is found at asymmetric glutamatergic synapses on dendrites and spines. Double immunofluorescence data suggest an association between GluD1 profiles and vGluT2‐containing thalamic terminals in both striatal compartments.







Abstract
The glutamate receptor delta 1 (GluD1) is strongly expressed in the striatum. Knockout of GluD1 expression in striatal neurons elicits cognitive deficits and disrupts the thalamostriatal system in mice. To understand the potential role of GluD1 in the primate striatum, we compared the cellular and subcellular localization of striatal GluD1 immunoreactivity (GluD1‐IR) in mice and monkeys. In both species, striatal GluD1‐IR displayed a patchy pattern of distribution in register with the striosome/matrix compartmentation, but in an opposite fashion. While GluD1 was more heavily expressed in the striosomes than the matrix in the monkey caudate nucleus, the opposite was found in the mouse striatum. At the electron microscopic level, GluD1‐IR was preferentially expressed in dendritic shafts (47.9 ± 1.2%), followed by glia (37.7 ± 2.5%), and dendritic spines (14.3 ± 2.6%) in the matrix of the mouse striatum. This pattern was not statistically different from the labeling in the striosome and matrix compartments of the monkey caudate nucleus, with the exception of a small amount of GluD1‐positive unmyelinated axons and axon terminals in the primate striatum. Immunogold staining revealed synaptic and perisynaptic GluD1 labeling at putative axo‐dendritic and axo‐spinous glutamatergic synapses, and intracellular labeling on the surface of mitochondria. Confocal microscopy showed that GluD1 is preferentially colocalized with thalamic over cortical terminals in both the striosome and matrix compartments. These data provide the anatomical substrate for a deeper understanding of GluD1 regulation of striatal glutamatergic synapses, but also suggest possible extrasynaptic, glial, and mitochondrial GluD1 functions.</content>

 The cuneate nucleus normally receives cortical inputs from the hand regions of sensorimotor cortex in the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. This cortical descending influence remains similar in New World monkeys with the short recoveries from the dorsal column lesion, but is greatly increased after the long recoveries.







Abstract
Recovery of responses to cutaneous stimuli in the area 3b hand cortex of monkeys after dorsal column lesions (DCLs) in the cervical spinal cord relies on neural rewiring in the cuneate nucleus (Cu) over time. To examine whether the corticocuneate projections are modified during recoveries after the DCL, we injected cholera toxin subunit B into the hand representation in Cu to label the cortical neurons after various recovery times, and related results to the recovery of neural responses in the affected area 3b hand cortex. In normal New World monkeys, labeled neurons were predominately distributed in the hand regions of contralateral areas 3b, 3a, 1 and 2, parietal ventral (PV), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), and primary motor cortex (M1), with similar distributions in the ipsilateral cortex in significantly smaller numbers. In monkeys with short‐term recoveries, the area 3b hand neurons were unresponsive or responded weakly to touch on the hand, while the cortical labeling pattern was largely unchanged. After longer recoveries, the area 3b hand neurons remained unresponsive, or responded to touch on the hand or somatotopically abnormal parts, depending on the lesion extent. The distributions of cortical labeled neurons were much more widespread than the normal pattern in both hemispheres, especially when lesions were incomplete. The proportion of labeled neurons in the contralateral area 3b hand cortex was not correlated with the functional reactivation in the area 3b hand cortex. Overall, our findings indicated that corticocuneate inputs increase during the functional recovery, but their functional role is uncertain.</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 A high degree of behavioral variation has been observed among macaque species. To investigate the neural basis of this variation, we used stereological methods to compare neural cell density and serotonin transporter‐immunoreactive axon density in the amygdala among four species that differ in social style. We hypothesized that significantly greater serotonergic innervation would be observed in the amygdala of the most socially tolerant species in our sample, the moor macaque. Instead, the pigtailed macaque, which is considered moderately tolerant, possessed significantly greater serotonergic innervation in the amygdala relative to Japanese and moor macaques. Our findings provide insight on the neural substrates of primate sociality from an evolutionary perspective.







Abstract
The genus Macaca is an ideal model for investigating the biological basis of primate social behavior from an evolutionary perspective. A significant amount of behavioral diversity has been reported among the macaque species, but little is known about the neural substrates that support this variation. The present study compared neural cell density and serotonergic innervation of the amygdala among four macaque species using histological and immunohistochemical methods. The species examined included rhesus (Macaca mulatta), Japanese (M. fuscata), pigtailed (M. nemestrina), and moor macaques (M. maura). We anticipated that the more aggressive rhesus and Japanese macaques would have lower serotonergic innervation within the amygdala compared to the more affiliative pigtailed and moor macaques. In contrast to our prediction, pigtailed macaques had higher serotonergic innervation than Japanese and moor macaques in the basal and central amygdala nuclei when controlling for neuron density. Our analysis of neural cell populations revealed that Japanese macaques possess significantly higher neuron and glia densities relative to the other three species, however we observed no glia‐to‐neuron ratio differences among species. The results of this study revealed serotonergic innervation and cell density differences among closely related macaque species, which may play a role in modulating subtle differences in emotional processing and species‐typical social styles.</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 The front legs in whip spiders are modified into very long feelers (antenniform legs) equipped with sensory structures, including tens of thousands olfactory receptor neurons. Olfactory afferents terminate on hundreds of primary olfactory glomeruli in the first leg neuromere. Projection neurons relay this information to secondary olfactory glomeruli in the brain's exceptionally large mushroom bodies. The mushroom bodies also comprise thousands of considerably smaller glomeruli that receive visual information. Mushroom bodies are supposed to underlie the whip spiders' advanced multimodal navigation abilities.







Abstract
Whip spiders (Amblypygi) are known for their nocturnal navigational abilities, which rely on chemosensory and tactile cues and, to a lesser degree, on vision. Unlike true spiders, the first pair of legs in whip spiders is modified into extraordinarily long sensory organs (antenniform legs) covered with thousands of mechanosensory, olfactory, and gustatory sensilla. Olfactory neurons send their axons through the leg nerve into the corresponding neuromere of the central nervous system, where they terminate on a particularly large number (about 460) of primary olfactory glomeruli, suggesting an advanced sense of smell. From the primary glomeruli, olfactory projection neurons ascend to the brain and terminate in the mushroom body calyx on a set of secondary olfactory glomeruli, a feature that is not known from olfactory pathways of other animals. Another part of the calyx receives visual input from the secondary visual neuropil (the medulla). This calyx region is composed of much smaller glomeruli (“microglomeruli”). The bimodal input and the exceptional size of their mushroom bodies may support the navigational capabilities of whip spiders. In addition to input to the mushroom body, we describe other general anatomical features of the whip spiders' central nervous system.</content>

 Rats and marmosets were injected with pentylenetetrazol and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Our results showed that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of pentylenetetrazol and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals' orders.







Abstract
Previous evidence indicated a potential mechanism that might support the fact that primates exhibit greater neural integration capacity as a result of the activation of different structures of the central nervous system, as compared to rodents. The current study aimed to provide further evidence to confirm previous findings by analyzing the patterns of c‐Fos expression in more neocortical structures of rats and marmosets using a more robust quantitative technique and evaluating a larger number of brain areas. Nineteen Wistar rats and 21 marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were distributed among control groups (animals without injections) and animals injected with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using unbiased and efficient stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Marmosets had a c‐Fos expression that was notably more widely expressed (5× more cells) and longer lasting (up to 3 hr) than rats. c‐Fos expression in rats presented similar patterns of expression according to the function of the brain cortical structures (associative, sensorial, and motor functions), which was not observed for marmosets (in which no clear pattern could be drawn, and a more diverse profile emerged). Our results provide evidence that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of PTZ and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals' orders.</content>

 Claustrocortical projections are organized across the dorsoventral axis and map onto the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex. Interneuron subtypes are differentially localized to the core and shell of the claustrum. The lines linking claustrum and cortex highlight some of the most numerous and divergent claustrocortical pathways identified in this study.







Abstract
The claustrum is densely connected to the cortex and participates in brain functions such as attention and sleep. Although some studies have reported the widely divergent organization of claustrum projections, others describe parallel claustrocortical connections to different cortical regions. Therefore, the details underlying how claustrum neurons broadcast information to cortical networks remain incompletely understood. Using multicolor retrograde tracing we determined the density, topography, and co‐projection pattern of 14 claustrocortical pathways, in mice. We spatially registered these pathways to a common coordinate space and found that the claustrocortical system is topographically organized as a series of overlapping spatial modules, continuously distributed across the dorsoventral claustrum axis. The claustrum core projects predominantly to frontal‐midline cortical regions, whereas the dorsal and ventral shell project to the cortical motor system and temporal lobe, respectively. Anatomically connected cortical regions receive common input from a subset of claustrum neurons shared by neighboring modules, whereas spatially separated regions of cortex are innervated by different claustrum modules. Therefore, each output module exhibits a unique position within the claustrum and overlaps substantially with other modules projecting to functionally related cortical regions. Claustrum inhibitory cells containing parvalbumin, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y also show unique topographical distributions, suggesting different output modules are controlled by distinct inhibitory circuit motifs. The topographic organization of excitatory and inhibitory cell types may enable parallel claustrum outputs to independently coordinate distinct cortical networks.</content>

 Mammalian brain can adapt to life experiences and reorganize its functional network to learn a new task. In our study we were able to detect and characterize rs‐fMRI signals from alert rabbits to track the functional reorganization of the neural networks that mediate acquisition and retention of eyeblink conditioning.







Abstract
Animal imaging studies have the potential to further establish resting‐state fMRI (rs‐fMRI) and enable its validation for clinical use. The rabbit subjects used in this work are an ideal model system for studying learning and behavior and are also an excellent established test subject for awake scanning given their natural tolerance for restraint. We found that analysis of rs‐fMRI conducted on a cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning can reveal functional brain connectivity changes associated with learning, and that rs‐fMRI can be used to capture differences between subjects with different levels of cognitive performance. rs‐fMRI sessions were conducted on a cohort of rabbits before and after trace eyeblink conditioning. MRI results were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and network analysis. Behavioral data were collected with standard methods using an infrared reflective sensor aimed at the cornea to detect blinks. Behavioral results were analyzed, and a median split was used to create two groups of rabbits based on their performance. The cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning exhibited increased functional connectivity in the cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and thalamus consistent with brain reorganization associated with increased learning. Differences in the striatum and right cerebellum were also identified between rabbits in the top or bottom halves of the group as measured by the behavioral assay. Thus, rs‐fMRI can provide not only a tool to detect and monitor functional brain changes associated with learning, but also to discriminate between different levels of cognitive performance.</content>

 The present study compares age‐related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans across the adult lifespan utilizing measures of total midsagittal area and regional thickness. We find that the chimpanzee compared to the human aging trajectory is characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, as well as by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood. Thus, callosal atrophy in old age is not a universal characteristic of the aging brain, but rather appears to be human‐specific phenomenon of aging.







Abstract
The human corpus callosum exhibits substantial atrophy in old age, which is stronger than what would be predicted from parallel changes in overall brain anatomy. To date, however, it has not been conclusively established whether this accentuated decline represents a common feature of brain aging across species, or whether it is a specific characteristic of the aging human brain. In the present cross‐sectional study, we address this question by comparing age‐related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans. For this purpose, we measured total midsagittal area and regional thickness of the corpus callosum from T1‐weighted MRI data from 213 chimpanzees, aged between 9 and 54 years. The results were compared with data drawn from a large‐scale human sample which was age‐range matched using two strategies: (a) matching by chronological age (human sample size: n = 562), or (b) matching by accounting for differences in longevity and various maturational events between the species (i.e., adjusted human age range: 13.6 to 80.9 years; n = 664). Using generalized additive modeling to fit and compare aging trajectories, we found significant differences between the two species. The chimpanzee aging trajectory compared with the human trajectory was characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, and by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood, which, however, was present in humans. Thus, the accentuated decline of the corpus callosum found in aging humans is not a universal characteristic of the aging brain, and appears to be human‐specific.</content>

 Highlights

Three weeks of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody injection at a dose of 8 mg/(kg • d) significantly improved the spatial memory ability of rats under chronic stress
The synapses of the DG, CA1, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus were significantly decreased after 7 weeks of CS stimulation
Three weeks of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody treatment reversed the CS‐induced decrease in the synapses in the DG, CA1, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus









Abstract
Chronic stress can induce cognitive impairment, and synapse number was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of rats suffering from chronic stress. Lingo‐1 is a potent negative regulator of axonal outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. In the current study, the effects of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody on the spatial learning and memory abilities and hippocampal synapses of stressed rats were investigated. After 4 weeks of stress exposure, the model group was randomly divided into a chronic stress group and an anti‐Lingo‐1 group. Then, the anti‐Lingo‐1 group rats were treated with anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody (8 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. The effects of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody on the spatial learning and memory abilities were investigated with the Morris water maze test. Immunohistological staining and an unbiased stereological method were used to estimate the total number of dendritic spine synapses in the hippocampus. At the behavioral level, after 3 weeks of treatment, the anti‐Lingo‐1 group rats displayed significantly more platform location crossings in the Morris water maze test than the chronic stress group rats. Anti‐Lingo‐1 significantly prevented the declines in dendritic spine synapses and postsynaptic density protein‐95 (PSD‐95) expression in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. The present results indicated that anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody may be a safe and effective drug for alleviating memory impairment in rats after chronic stress and protecting synapses in the hippocampus of stressed rats.</content>

 Punishment feels bad, but relief from it feels good. Correspondingly, negative memories are formed for cues when these are associated with the occurrence of punishment. In contrast, positive memories result from their association with relief. Such timing‐dependent valence reversal is observed in humans and in animals alike. Using Drosophila larvae, Weiglein et al. present an odor cue either before or after optogenetically activating single, identified dopaminergic neurons known to mediate punishment. This reveals that these dopaminergic neurons are heterogeneous: DAN‐f1 establishes timing‐dependent valence reversal, whereas DAN‐d1 does not. Together with recent findings in the reward domain and from adult Drosophila, this suggests that such heterogeneity might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.







Abstract
Dopamine serves many functions, and dopamine neurons are correspondingly diverse. We use a combination of optogenetics, behavioral experiments, and high‐resolution video‐tracking to probe for the functional capacities of two single, identified dopamine neurons in larval Drosophila. The DAN‐f1 and the DAN‐d1 neuron were recently found to carry aversive teaching signals during Pavlovian olfactory learning. We enquire into a fundamental feature of these teaching signals, namely their temporal “fingerprint”. That is, receiving punishment feels bad, whereas being relieved from it feels good, and animals and humans alike learn with opposite valence about the occurrence and the termination of punishment (the same principle applies in the appetitive domain, with opposite sign). We find that DAN‐f1 but not DAN‐d1 can mediate such timing‐dependent valence reversal: presenting an odor before DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned avoidance of the odor (punishment memory), whereas presenting the odor upon termination of DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned approach (relief memory). In contrast, DAN‐d1 confers punishment memory only. These effects are further characterized in terms of the impact of the duration of optogenetic activation, the temporal stability of the memories thus established, and the specific microbehavioral patterns of locomotion through which they are expressed. Together with recent findings in the appetitive domain and from adult Drosophila, our results suggest that heterogeneity in the temporal fingerprint of teaching signals might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.</content>

 The prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) is one of the major sources of cholinergic input to the cerebellum. We report the proportions of cholinergic neurons in PHN projections to distinct cerebellar regions by applying retrograde labeling with dextran‐conjugated Alexa 488 in ChAT‐tdTomato rats. The results suggest the proportion of cholinergic PHN neurons differs depending on cerebellar target areas and the rostro‐caudal regions of the PHN.







Abstract
Cerebellar functions are modulated by cholinergic inputs, the density of which varies among cerebellar regions. Although the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN), a brainstem structure involved in controlling gaze holding, is known as one of the major sources of these cholinergic inputs, the proportions of cholinergic neurons in PHN projections to distinct cerebellar regions have not been quantitatively analyzed. In this study, we identified PHN neurons projecting to the cerebellum by applying retrograde labeling with dextran‐conjugated Alexa 488 in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)‐tdTomato transgenic rats and compared the proportion of cholinergic PHN neurons in the PHN projections to four different regions of the cerebellum, namely the flocculus (FL), the uvula and nodulus (UN), lobules III‐V in the vermis (VM), and the hemispheric paramedian lobule and crus 2 (PC). In the PHN, the percentage of cholinergic PHN neurons was lower in the projection to the FL than in the projection to the UN, VM or PC. Preposito‐cerebellar neurons, except for preposito‐FL neurons, included different proportions of cholinergic neurons at different rostrocaudal positions in the PHN. These results suggest that cholinergic PHN neurons project to not only the vestibulocerebellum but also the anterior vermis and posterior hemisphere and that the proportion of cholinergic neurons among projection neurons from the PHN differs depending on cerebellar target areas and the rostro‐caudal regions of the PHN. This study provides insights regarding the involvement of cerebellar cholinergic networks in gaze holding.</content>

 The current study investigated morphological features of all three neuronal populations in the primary olfactory center of the moth, Helicoverpa armigera, by means of intracellular iontophoretic staining combined with confocal microscopy. The detailed characterizations of individual antennal‐lobe neurons—covering projection neurons, local interneurons, and centrifugal neurons—include several novel categories not previously described. Amira reconstructions were used to visualize the distinct neuronal types and sub‐types. Confocal images of all 190 neurons demonstrate the impressive morphological variety, suggesting complex signal processing already at this level of the insect olfactory pathway.







Abstract
The relatively large primary olfactory center of the insect brain, the antennal lobe (AL), contains several heterogeneous neuronal types. These include projection neurons (PNs), providing olfactory information to higher‐order neuropils via parallel pathways, and local interneurons (LNs), which provide lateral processing within the AL. In addition, various types of centrifugal neurons (CNs) offer top‐down modulation onto the other AL neurons. By performing iontophoretic intracellular staining, we collected a large number of AL neurons in the moth, Helicoverpa armigera, to examine the distinct morphological features of PNs, LNs, and CNs. We characterize 190 AL neurons. These were allocated to 25 distinct neuronal types or sub‐types, which were reconstructed and placed into a reference brain. In addition to six PN types comprising 15 sub‐types, three LN and seven CN types were identified. High‐resolution confocal images allowed us to analyze AL innervations of the various reported neurons, which demonstrated that all PNs innervating ventroposterior glomeruli contact a protocerebral neuropil rarely targeted by other PNs, that is the posteriorlateral protocerebrum. We also discuss the functional roles of the distinct CNs, which included several previously uncharacterized types, likely involved in computations spanning from multisensory processing to olfactory feedback signalization into the AL.</content>

 Primary mechanosensory afferents serve as the first level of signal processing at the somatosensory periphery and provide information about behaviorally relevant stimulus features. Here, we show that the mechanosensory Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons in larval zebrafish are rapidly adapting cells that can signal stimulus onset and offset and encode stimulus intensity implementing rate and temporal coding mechanisms. We also revealed a rostrocaudal variation in both morphology and physiology within the RB neuron population, which offers insights on what signals RBs carry into central circuits and on their role in locomotor behaviors.







Abstract
Primary mechanosensory neurons play an important role in converting mechanical forces into the sense of touch. In zebrafish, Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity. This study reveals an unappreciated complexity of the larval zebrafish mechanosensory system and demonstrates how differences in the morphological and physiological properties of RBs related to their rostrocaudal location can influence the signals that enter the spinal cord.</content>

 Axon terminal branches, originating from the ventral hippocampus and distributed in the prefrontal cortex, undergo more frequent bifurcation but bear less numerous varicosities, which are putative synaptic sites, in Alzheimer's than wild‐type mice. This projection appears to be more widely spread, with scantier synapses, and therefore diluted in Alzheimer's mice.







Abstract
Emotional dysregulation often accompanies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus, most notably damaged by AD pathology, is classified into the cognition‐bound posterior and emotion‐bound anterior hippocampi. Since the anterior hippocampus or its rodent counterpart, the ventral hippocampus (VH), sends dense afferents to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the two structures implicated in fear responses, we investigated whether these afferents are modified in 3xTg AD model mice. An anterograde dextrin tracer injected into VH revealed that axons in PFC were more ramified in 3xTg than wild‐type (WT) mice, with the synaptic density reduced. The VH projections to BLA were not affected. Intracellular accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) or Aβ‐like immunoreactivity was found in PFC and BLA neurons alike. Behaviorally, in the 2‐way active avoidance test, the frequency of chamber change was higher, with the test performance better, in 3xTg than WT mice, suggesting a distorted contextual fear in the 3xTg group. Given the essential involvement of parts of PFC in contextual fear responses and that of BLA in fear responses in general, the observed remodeling of VH‐to‐PFC afferents and the accumulation of intracellular Aβ in BLA and PFC pyramidal cells might exercise critical influences on enhanced avoidance behavior in 3xTg mice.</content>

 Preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) inputs are anatomically distinct from interscapular brown adipose tissue.
Dorsolumbar and inguinal iWAT portions are innervated by anatomically distinct sympathetic nerves.
Sympathetic postganglionic iWAT innervation reaches its target organ via lateral cutaneous rami of intercostal nerves T11–L1 and anterior cutaneous femoral nerve (as part of the lumbar plexus, L1)
White adipocytes are sparsely innervated (sparse varicosities), while brown adipocytes (beige islands) show dense innervation (dense varicosities) in iWAT.









Abstract
Adipose tissue plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis and its prominent role as endocrine organ is now well recognized. Adipose tissue is controlled via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). New viral, molecular‐genetic tools will soon allow a more detailed study of adipose tissue innervation in metabolic function, yet, the precise anatomical extent of preganglionic and postganglionic inputs to the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is limited. Furthermore, several viral, molecular‐genetic tools will require the use of cre/loxP mouse models, while the available studies on sympathetic iWAT innervation were established in larger species. In this study, we generated a detailed map for the sympathetic innervation of iWAT in male and female mice. We adapted iDISCO tissue clearing to process large, whole‐body specimens for an unprecedented view of the natural abdominal SNS. Combined with pseudorabies virus retrograde tracing from the iWAT, we defined the preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic input to iWAT. We used fluorescence‐guided anatomical dissections of sympathetic nerves in reporter mice to further clarify that postganglionic axons connect to iWAT via lateral cutaneous rami (dorsolumbar iWAT portion) and the lumbar plexus (inguinal iWAT portion). Importantly, these rami carry axons that branch to iWAT, as well as axons that travel further to innervate the skin and vasculature, and their functional impact will require consideration in denervation studies. Our study may serve as a comprehensive map for future experiments that employ virally driven neuromodulation techniques to predict anatomy‐based viral labeling.</content>

 Sequencing analysis for the lesion site of the rat SCI model revealed that the injury significantly stimulated the expression of circRNA‐2960, which acted as a miRNA‐124 sponge to regulate the downstream pathways. Increased circRNA‐2960 expression in SCI decreased the activity of miRNA‐124, which further promoted neuroinflammation and apoptosis.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in many human diseases, but their roles in secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. In the current study circRNA sequencing was performed in the damaged tissues of SCI rats on the seventh day after injury, and related molecular mechanisms were investigated. Quantitative PCR validations of molecules that exhibited significantly altered expression in SCI mice were performed. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted to assess differentially expressed circRNAs. A novel circRNA‐2960 was the most significantly upregulated in the SCI group. It could downregulate its target molecule miRNA‐124, then exacerbate the inflammatory response and induce apoptosis at the lesion site. Disrupting circRNA‐2960 expression promoted recovery of tissues affected by secondary SCI damage. The results of the present study may provide new insight into the mechanisms of secondary injury in SCI, and a new molecular marker for the diagnosis and treatment of SCI.</content>

 In this study, we show that both the number of primary cilia and the number of ciliated neurons declines with age in major retinorecipient targets. Our data suggests that the maturation timing of neuronal and non‐neural cilia differs with maturation of neuronal cilia occurring over a longer postnatal period.







Abstract
The mammalian visual system is composed of circuitry connecting sensory input from the retina to the processing core of the visual cortex. The two main retinorecipient brain targets, the superior colliculus (SC) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), bridge retinal input and visual output. The primary cilium is a conserved organelle increasingly viewed as a critical sensor for the regulation of developmental and homeostatic pathways in most mammalian cell types. Moreover, cilia have been described as crucial for neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, and survival in the cortex and retina. However, cilia in the visual relay center remain to be fully described. In this study, we characterized the ciliation profile of the SC and dLGN and found that the overall number of ciliated cells declined during development. Interestingly, shorter ciliated cells in both regions were identified as neurons, whose numbers remained stable over time, suggesting that cilia retention is a critical feature for optimal neuronal function in SC and dLGN. Our study suggests that primary cilia are important for neuronal maturation and function in cells of the SC and dLGN.</content>

Abstract
Accumulation of the heavy‐chain neurofilaments reflects the maturation status of neuronal structures. The spatial distribution and postnatal developmental dynamic of neurons expressing nonphosphorylated heavy‐chain neurofilaments (labeled by SMI‐32 antibody) were analyzed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of the cat. Both interlaminar and intralaminar differences in the dynamic of SMI‐32 staining were observed. The following results were obtained: (a) Ascending dorsoventral gradient in the density of SMI‐32 immunopositive (SMI‐32(+)) neurons (the greatest neuronal density in layer Cm, the minor in the top sublayer of layer A). This gradient was most prominent at the earliest stages of postnatal development (1st–2nd weeks) and slowly flattened up to adulthood; (b) Layer A1 exhibits increases in SMI‐32‐positive cells earlier than layer A; (c) The general transient increment in the number and density of SMI‐32(+) neurons around 2–5 postnatal weeks. Since SMI‐32 antibody is considered to be a putative marker for Y cells forming a motion processing stream, we suggest that peculiarities of SMI‐32 staining at geniculate level could reflect the heterogeneity of Y cell subpopulations and the heterochrony of their postnatal maturation.</content>

 A comprehensive look at the whole brain serotonergic projection using the SERT‐EGFP transgenic mice. The area‐specific pattern and rostro‐caudal change from the raphe nuclei in brainstem were mapped.







Abstract
It is well established that serotonergic fibers distribute throughout the brain. Abnormal densities or patterns of serotonergic fibers have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Although many classical studies have examined the distribution pattern of serotonergic fibers, most of them were either limited to specific brain areas or had limitations in demonstrating the fine axonal morphology. In this study, we utilize male mice expressing green fluorescence protein under the serotonin transporter (SERT) promoter to map the topography of serotonergic fibers across the rostro‐caudal extent of each brain area. We demonstrate previously unreported regional density and fine‐grained anatomy of serotonergic fibers. Our findings include: (a) SERT fibers distribute abundantly in the thalamic nuclei close to the midline and dorsolateral areas, in most of the hypothalamic nuclei with few exceptions such as the median eminence and arcuate nuclei, and within the basal amygdaloid complex and lateral septal nuclei, (b) the source fibers of innervation of the hippocampus traverse through the septal nuclei before reaching its destination, (c) unique, filamentous type of straight terminal fibers within the nucleus accumbens, (d) laminar pattern of innervation in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb and cortex with heterogenicity in innervation density among the layers, (e) cortical labeling density gradually decreases rostro‐caudally, (f) fibers traverse and distribute mostly within the gray matter, leaving the white fiber bundles uninnervated, and (g) most of the highly labeled nuclei and cortical areas have predominant anatomical connection to limbic structures. In conclusion, we provide novel, regionally specific insights on the distribution map of serotonergic fibers using transgenic mouse.</content>

 Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide produced in various hypothalamic nuclei including the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the supraoptic nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The AVP gene encodes pre‐pro‐AVP that comprises the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin II (NPII), and the glycopeptide copeptin. Here, we report that there is a marked species difference between rodents and primates in the processing of the pro‐AVP precursor and production of free copeptin, and that the processing may not be the same in different groups of pro‐AVP‐expressing cells within a given species.







Abstract
Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized in parvocellular‐ and magnocellular neuroendocrine neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Whereas magnocellular AVP neurons project primarily to the posterior pituitary, parvocellular AVP neurons project to the median eminence (ME) and to extrahypothalamic areas. The AVP gene encodes pre‐pro‐AVP that comprises the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin (NPII), and a copeptin glycopeptide. In the present study, we used an N‐terminal copeptin antiserum to examine copeptin expression in magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the hypothalamus in the mouse, rat, and macaque monkey. Although magnocellular NPII‐expressing neurons exhibited strong N‐terminal copeptin immunoreactivity in all three species, a great majority (~90%) of parvocellular neurons that expressed NPII was devoid of copeptin immunoreactivity in the mouse, and in approximately half (~53%) of them in the rat, whereas in monkey hypothalamus, virtually all NPII‐immunoreactive parvocellular neurons contained strong copeptin immunoreactivity. Immunoelectron microscopy in the mouse clearly showed copeptin‐immunoreactivity co‐localized with NPII‐immunoreactivity in neurosecretory vesicles in the internal layer of the ME and posterior pituitary, but not in the external layer of the ME. Intracerebroventricular administration of a prohormone convertase inhibitor, hexa‐d‐arginine amide resulted in a marked reduction of copeptin‐immunoreactivity in the NPII‐immunoreactive magnocellular PVN neurons in the mouse, suggesting that low protease activity and incomplete processing of pro‐AVP could explain the disproportionally low levels of N‐terminal copeptin expression in rodent AVP (NPII)‐expressing parvocellular neurons. Physiologic and phylogenetic aspects of copeptin expression among neuroendocrine neurons require further exploration.</content>

 Striatal cholinergic (ChAT+) interneurons in WT and heterozygous Q175 mice at 18 months of age. The images show that striatal cholinergic interneuron abundance is comparable, but dendrites in Q175 mice are significantly fewer and shorter. These abnormalities and diverse striatal projection neuron abnormalities develop between 2 and 6 months of age in Q175 heterozygotes, indicating early effects of the HD mutation on the striatum in these mice that in many regards resemble those in human HD. Nonetheless, the pathologies do not yet involve overt striatal neuron loss even by 18 months, indicating they are less severe than even in premanifest HD.







Abstract
We used behavioral testing and morphological methods to detail the progression of basal ganglia neuron type‐specific pathology and the deficits stemming from them in male heterozygous Q175 mice, compared to age‐matched WT males. A rotarod deficit was not present in Q175 mice until 18 months, but increased open field turn rate (reflecting hyperkinesia) and open field anxiety were evident at 6 months. No loss of striatal neurons was seen out to 18 months, but ENK+ and DARPP32+ striatal perikarya were fewer by 6 months, due to diminished expression, with further decline by 18 months. No reduction in SP+ striatal perikarya or striatal interneurons was seen in Q175 mice at 18 months, but cholinergic interneurons showed dendrite attenuation by 6 months. Despite reduced ENK expression in indirect pathway striatal perikarya, ENK‐immunostained terminals in globus pallidus externus (GPe) were more abundant at 6 months and remained so out to 18 months. Similarly, SP‐immunostained terminals from striatal direct pathway neurons were more abundant in globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra at 6 months and remained so at 18 months. FoxP2+ arkypallidal GPe neurons and subthalamic nucleus neurons were lost by 18 months but not prototypical PARV+ GPe neurons or dopaminergic nigral neurons. Our results show that striatal projection neuron abnormalities and behavioral abnormalities reflecting them develop between 2 and 6 months of age in Q175 male heterozygotes, indicating early effects of the HD mutation. The striatal pathologies resemble those in human HD, but are less severe at 18 months than even in premanifest HD.</content>

 Macroscopic gray matter changes have been well documented in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The present study examined microscopic gray matter changes in CTE by comparing the dendritic arbors of supragranular pyramidal neurons from prefrontal and occipital cortices in both Control and CTE cases. CTE neurons exhibited significantly lower mean dendritic measure values than did Control neurons, while also displaying considerably greater variability across measures. These changes may be a newly described pathological marker of CTE and could supplement current mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.







Abstract
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with repetitive head impacts. Neuropathologically, it is defined by the presence of perivascular hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in cortical tissue (McKee et al., 2016, Acta Neuropathologica, 131, 75–86). Although many pathological and assumed clinical correlates of CTE have been well characterized, its effects on cortical dendritic arbors are still unknown. Here, we quantified dendrites and dendritic spines of supragranular pyramidal neurons in tissue from human frontal and occipital lobes, in 11 cases with (Mage = 79 ± 7 years) and 5 cases without (Mage = 76 ± 11 years) CTE. Tissue was stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Dendritic systems of 20 neurons per region in each brain (N = 640 neurons) were quantified using computer‐assisted morphometry. One key finding was that CTE neurons exhibited increased variability and distributional changes across six of the eight dendritic system measures, presumably due to ongoing degeneration and compensatory reorganization of dendritic systems. However, despite heightened variation among CTE neurons, CTE cases exhibited lower mean values than Control cases in seven of the eight dendritic system measures. These dendritic alterations may represent a new pathological marker of CTE, and further examination of dendritic changes could contribute to both mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.</content>

 In this study, we provide an overview of rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neuron (OEN) development in the zebrafish. OENs are born in two groups: the rostral (REN) group is born in r4 with the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), while the caudal (CEN) group is born in r5. From there, the OENs migrate alongside the FBMNs to r6 and r7, where they cluster into bilateral nuclei. However, we identify several key differences between the mechanisms OENs and FBMNs use to migrate.







Abstract
In vertebrate animals, motor and sensory efferent neurons carry information from the central nervous system (CNS) to peripheral targets. These two types of efferent systems sometimes bear a close resemblance, sharing common segmental organization, axon pathways, and chemical messengers. Here, we focus on the development of the octavolateral efferent neurons (OENs) and their interactions with the closely‐related facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) in zebrafish. Using live‐imaging approaches, we investigate the birth, migration, and projection patterns of OENs. We find that OENs are born in two distinct groups: a group of rostral efferent neurons (RENs) that arises in the fourth segment, or rhombomere (r4), of the hindbrain and a group of caudal efferent neurons (CENs) that arises in r5. Both RENs and CENs then migrate posteriorly through the hindbrain between 18 and 48 hrs postfertilization, alongside the r4‐derived FBMNs. Like the FBMNs, migration of the r4‐derived RENs depends on function of the segmental identity gene hoxb1a; unlike the FBMNs, however, both OEN populations move independently of prickle1b. Further, we investigate whether the previously described “pioneer” neuron that leads FBMN migration through the hindbrain is an r4‐derived FBMN/REN or an r5‐derived CEN. Our experiments verify that the pioneer is an r4‐derived neuron and reaffirm its role in leading FBMN migration across the r4/5 border. In contrast, the r5‐derived CENs migrate independently of the pioneer. Together, these results indicate that the mechanisms OENs use to navigate the hindbrain differ significantly from those employed by FBMNs.</content>

 Graph illustrating the heterogeneity within the mesodiencephalic dopaminergic nuclei, in the proportion of cells immunopositive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH+) that expressed the vesicular glutamatergic transporter 2 (Vglut2) during their lifetime according to a cell fate mapping strategy. Each dot illustrates the proportion measured from one mouse.







Abstract
Co‐transmission of glutamate by brain dopaminergic (DA) neurons was recently proposed as a potential factor influencing cell survival in models of Parkinson's disease. Intriguingly, brain DA nuclei are differentially affected in Parkinson's disease. Whether this is associated with different patterns of co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype along the rostrocaudal brain axis is unknown in mammals. We hypothesized that, as in zebrafish, the glutamatergic phenotype is present preferentially in the caudal mesodiencephalic DA nuclei. Here, we used in mice a cell fate mapping strategy based on reporter protein expression (ZsGreen) consecutive to previous expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) gene, coupled with immunofluorescence experiments against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine transporter (DAT). We found three expression patterns in DA cells, organized along the rostrocaudal brain axis. The first pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐positive, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A8–A10. The second pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A11. The third pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐negative) was found in A12–A13. These patterns should help to refine the establishment of the homology of DA nuclei between vertebrate species. Our results also uncover that Vglut2 is expressed at some point during cell lifetime in DA nuclei known to degenerate in Parkinson's disease and largely absent from those that are preserved, suggesting that co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype in DA cells influences their survival in Parkinson's disease.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons from the success of deep learning is that
learned representations tend to perform much better at any task compared to
representations we design by hand. Yet evolution of evolvability algorithms,
which aim to automatically learn good genetic representations, have received
relatively little attention, perhaps because of the large amount of
computational power they require. The recent method Evolvability ES allows
direct selection for evolvability with little computation. However, it can only
be used to solve problems where evolvability and task performance are aligned.
We propose Quality Evolvability ES, a method that simultaneously optimizes for
task performance and evolvability and without this restriction. Our proposed
approach Quality Evolvability has similar motivation to Quality Diversity
algorithms, but with some important differences. While Quality Diversity aims
to find an archive of diverse and well-performing, but potentially genetically
distant individuals, Quality Evolvability aims to find a single individual with
a diverse and well-performing distribution of offspring. By doing so Quality
Evolvability is forced to discover more evolvable representations. We
demonstrate on robotic locomotion control tasks that Quality Evolvability ES,
similarly to Quality Diversity methods, can learn faster than objective-based
methods and can handle deceptive problems.

 &lt;p&gt;The elapsed time model has been widely studied in the context of mathematical
neuroscience with many open questions left. The model consists of an
age-structured equation that describes the dynamics of interacting neurons
structured by the elapsed time since their last discharge. Our interest lies in
highly connected networks leading to strong nonlinearities where perturbation
methods do not apply. To deal with this problem, we choose a particular case
which can be reduced to delay equations. We prove a general convergence result
to a stationary state in the inhibitory and the weakly excitatory cases.
Moreover, we prove the existence of particular periodic solutions with jump
discontinuities in the strongly excitatory case. Finally, we present some
numerical simulations which ilustrate various behaviors, which are consistent
with the theoretical results.

 &lt;p&gt;We present an algorithm for multi-objective optimization of computationally
expensive problems. The proposed algorithm is based on solving a set of
surrogate problems defined by models of the real one, so that only solutions
estimated to be approximately Pareto-optimal are evaluated using the real
expensive functions. Aside of the search for solutions, our algorithm also
performs a meta-search for optimal surrogate models and navigation strategies
for the optimization landscape, therefore adapting the search strategy for
solutions to the problem as new information about it is obtained. The
competitiveness of our approach is demonstrated by an experimental comparison
with one state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm on a set of
benchmark problems.

 &lt;p&gt;Standard frame-based cameras that sample light intensity frames are heavily
impacted by motion blur for high-speed motion and fail to perceive scene
accurately when the dynamic range is high. Event-based cameras, on the other
hand, overcome these limitations by asynchronously detecting the variation in
individual pixel intensities. However, event cameras only provide information
about pixels in motion, leading to sparse data. Hence, estimating the overall
dense behavior of pixels is difficult. To address such issues associated with
the sensors, we present Fusion-FlowNet, a sensor fusion framework for
energy-efficient optical flow estimation using both frame- and event-based
sensors, leveraging their complementary characteristics. Our proposed network
architecture is also a fusion of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Analog
Neural Networks (ANNs) where each network is designed to simultaneously process
asynchronous event streams and regular frame-based images, respectively. Our
network is end-to-end trained using unsupervised learning to avoid expensive
video annotations. The method generalizes well across distinct environments
(rapid motion and challenging lighting conditions) and demonstrates
state-of-the-art optical flow prediction on the Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event
Camera (MVSEC) dataset. Furthermore, our network offers substantial savings in
terms of the number of network parameters and computational energy cost.

 &lt;p&gt;Rhythmic electrical activity in the brain emerges from regular non-trivial
interactions between millions of neurons. Neurons are intricate cellular
structures that transmit excitatory (or inhibitory) signals to other neurons,
often non-locally, depending on the graded input from other neurons. Often this
requires extensive detail to model mathematically, which poses several issues
in modelling large systems beyond clusters of neurons, such as the whole brain.
Approaching large populations of neurons with interconnected constituent
single-neuron models results in an accumulation of exponentially many
complexities, rendering a realistic simulation that does not permit
mathematical tractability and obfuscates the primary interactions required for
emergent electrodynamical patterns in brain rhythms. A statistical mechanics
approach with non-local interactions may circumvent these issues while
maintaining mathematically tractability. Neural field theory is a
population-level approach to modelling large sections of neural tissue based on
these principles. Herein we provide a review of key stages of the history and
development of neural field theory and contemporary uses of this branch of
mathematical neuroscience. We elucidate a mathematical framework in which
neural field models can be derived, highlighting the many significant inherited
assumptions that exist in the current literature, so that their validity may be
considered in light of further developments in both mathematical and
experimental neuroscience.

 &lt;p&gt;Traditional neural networks require enormous amounts of data to build their
complex mappings during a slow training procedure that hinders their abilities
for relearning and adapting to new data. Memory-augmented neural networks
enhance neural networks with an explicit memory to overcome these issues.
Access to this explicit memory, however, occurs via soft read and write
operations involving every individual memory entry, resulting in a bottleneck
when implemented using the conventional von Neumann computer architecture. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose a robust architecture that employs a
computational memory unit as the explicit memory performing analog in-memory
computation on high-dimensional (HD) vectors, while closely matching 32-bit
software-equivalent accuracy. This is achieved by a content-based attention
mechanism that represents unrelated items in the computational memory with
uncorrelated HD vectors, whose real-valued components can be readily
approximated by binary, or bipolar components. Experimental results demonstrate
the efficacy of our approach on few-shot image classification tasks on the
Omniglot dataset using more than 256,000 phase-change memory devices. Our
approach effectively merges the richness of deep neural network representations
with HD computing that paves the way for robust vector-symbolic manipulations
applicable in reasoning, fusion, and compression.

 &lt;p&gt;The brain exhibits capabilities of fast incremental learning from few noisy
examples, as well as the ability to associate similar memories in
autonomously-created categories and to combine contextual hints with sensory
perceptions. Together with sleep, these mechanisms are thought to be key
components of many high-level cognitive functions. Yet, little is known about
the underlying processes and the specific roles of different brain states. In
this work, we exploited the combination of context and perception in a
thalamo-cortical model based on a soft winner-take-all circuit of excitatory
and inhibitory spiking neurons. After calibrating this model to express awake
and deep-sleep states with features comparable with biological measures, we
demonstrate the model capability of fast incremental learning from few
examples, its resilience when proposed with noisy perceptions and contextual
signals, and an improvement in visual classification after sleep due to induced
synaptic homeostasis and association of similar memories.

 &lt;p&gt;Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNN) in the human brain learn to perform
a wide range of perceptual, cognitive and motor tasks very efficiently in terms
of energy consumption and requires very few examples. This motivates the search
for biologically inspired learning rules for RSNNs to improve our understanding
of brain computation and the efficiency of artificial intelligence. Several
spiking models and learning rules have been proposed, but it remains a
challenge to design RSNNs whose learning relies on biologically plausible
mechanisms and are capable of solving complex temporal tasks. In this paper, we
derive a learning rule, local to the synapse, from a simple mathematical
principle, the maximization of the likelihood for the network to solve a
specific task. We propose a novel target-based learning scheme in which the
learning rule derived from likelihood maximization is used to mimic a specific
spiking pattern that encodes the solution to complex temporal tasks. This
method makes the learning extremely rapid and precise, outperforming state of
the art algorithms for RSNNs. We demonstrate the capacity of our model to
tackle several problems like learning multidimensional trajectories and solving
the classical temporal XOR benchmark. Finally, we show that an online
approximation of the gradient ascent, in addition to guaranteeing complete
locality in time and space, allows learning after very few presentations of the
target output. Our model can be applied to different types of biological
neurons. The analytically derived plasticity learning rule is specific to each
neuron model and can produce a theoretical prediction for experimental
validation.

 &lt;p&gt;Learning, especially rapid learning, is critical for survival. However,
learning is hard: a large number of synaptic weights must be set based on
noisy, often ambiguous, sensory information. In such a high-noise regime,
keeping track of probability distributions over weights is the optimal
strategy. Here we hypothesize that synapses take that strategy; in essence,
when they estimate weights, they include error bars. They then use that
uncertainty to adjust their learning rates, with more uncertain weights having
higher learning rates. We also make a second, independent, hypothesis: synapses
communicate their uncertainty by linking it to variability in PSP size, with
more uncertainty leading to more variability. These two hypotheses cast
synaptic plasticity as a problem of Bayesian inference, and thus provide a
normative view of learning. They generalize known learning rules, offer an
explanation for the large variability in the size of post-synaptic potentials,
and make falsifiable experimental predictions.

 &lt;p&gt;The sliding-window-based dynamic functional connectivity networks (SW-D-FCN) derive from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging has become an increasingly useful tool in the diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is still challenging to learn how to extract and select the most discriminative features from SW-D-FCN. Conventionally, existing methods opt to select a single discriminative feature set or concatenate a few more from the SW-D-FCN. However, such reductionist strategies may fail to fully capture the personalized discriminative characteristics contained in each functional connectivity (FC) sequence of the SW-D-FCN. To address this issue, we propose a unit-based personalized fingerprint feature selection (UPFFS) strategy to better capture the most discriminative feature associated with a target disease for each unit. Specifically, we regard the FC sequence between any pair of brain regions of interest (ROIs) is regarded as a unit. For each unit, the most discriminative feature is identified by a specific feature evaluation method and all the most discriminative features are then concatenated together as a feature set for the subsequent classification task. In such a way, the personalized fingerprint feature derived from each FC sequence can be fully mined and utilized in classification decision. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we conduct experiments to distinguish subjects diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder from normal controls. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy can select relevant discriminative features and achieve superior performance to benchmark methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Acquisition of fine motor skills is a time-consuming process as it is based on learning via frequent repetitions. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a promising means of enhancing simple motor skill development via neuromodulatory mechanisms. Here, we report that non-invasive neurostimulation facilitates the learning of complex fine bimanual motor skills associated with a surgical task. During the training of 12 medical students on the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) pattern cutting task over a period of 12 days, we observed that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) decreased error level and the variability in performance, compared to the Sham group. Furthermore, by concurrently monitoring the cortical activations of the subjects via functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), our study showed that the cortical activation patterns were significantly different between the tDCS and Sham group, with the activation of primary motor cortex (M1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) contralateral to the anodal electrode significantly decreased while supplemental motor area (SMA) increased by tDCS. The lowered performance errors were retained after 1-month post-training. This work supports the use of tDCS to enhance performance accuracy in fine bimanual motor tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate iron deposition in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients associated with levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seventeen PD patients with LID, 17 PD patients without LID, and 16 healthy controls were recruited for this study. The mean QSM values of the whole, left, and right SN were compared among the three groups. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to determine the factors associated with increased risk of LID. The receiver operating characteristic curve of the QSM value of SN in discriminating PD with and without LID was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean QSM values of the whole and right SN in the PD with LID were higher than those in the PD without LID (&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;P = 0.03, &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;P = 0.03). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the QSM value of whole, left, or right SN was a predictor of the development of LID (&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;P = 0.03, &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;P = 0.04, and &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;P = 0.04). The predictive accuracy of LID in adding the QSM value of the whole, left, and right SN to LID-related clinical risk factors was 70.6, 64.7, and 67.6%, respectively. The QSM cutoff values between PD with and without LID of the whole, left, and right SN were 148.3, 165.4, and 152.7 ppb, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study provides the evidence of higher iron deposition in the SN of PD patients with LID than those without LID, suggesting that the QSM value of the SN may be a potential early diagnostic neuroimaging biomarker for LID.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Depression induces an early onset of Parkinson’s disease (PD), aggravates dyskinesia and cognitive impairment, and accelerates disease progression. However, it is very difficult to identify and diagnose PD with depression (PDD) in the early clinical stage. Few studies have suggested that the changes in neural networks are associated with PDD, while degree centrality (DC) has been documented to be effective in detecting brain network changes.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The objectives of this study are to explore DC changes between patients with PDD and without depression (PDND) and to find the key brain hubs involved with depression in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;One hundred and four PD patients and 54 healthy controls (HCs) underwent brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The Data Processing and Analysis of Brain Imaging and Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Data Analysis Toolkit were used for processing and statistical analysis. The DC value of each frequency band was calculated. One-way analysis of variance and a two-sample t-test for post hoc comparison were used to compare the differences of the DC values in different frequency bands among PDD, PDND, and healthy control group. Gaussian random field was used for multiple comparison correction. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between each individual’s DC map and clinical indicators.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The DC value of different brain regions changed in PDD and PDND in different frequency bands. The prefrontal lobe, limbic system, and basal ganglia were the main brain regions involved. PDD patients showed a wider range and more abnormal brain areas in the slow-4 frequency band (0.027–0.073 Hz) compared to the HCs. PDD showed a decreased DC value in the medial frontal gyrus, bilateral cuneus gyrus, right lingual gyrus, bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), bilateral superior frontal gyrus, and left paracentral lobule, but an increased DC value in the bilateral brainstem, midbrain, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, left superior temporal gyrus, bilateral insula, left fusiform gyrus, and left caudate nucleus in the traditional frequency band (0.01–0.08 Hz) compared to PDND patients. PDND patients displayed more abnormal functions in the basal ganglia in the slow-4 frequency band.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The DC changes in PDD and PDND are frequency dependent and frequency specific. The medial frontal gyrus, SMA, and limbic system may be the key hubs for depression in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is susceptible to protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. This protein accumulation is partially attributed to an impaired clearance; however, the removal pathways for fluids and waste products are not fully understood. The aim of this study was therefore to map the clearance pathways from the mouse brain. A mixture of two fluorescently labeled tracers with different molecular weights was infused into the hippocampus. A small subset of mice (n = 3) was sacrificed directly after an infusion period of 10 min to determine dispersion of the tracer due to the infusion, while another group was sacrificed after spreading of the tracers for an additional 80 min (n = 7). Upon sacrifice, mice were frozen and sectioned as a whole by the use of a custom-built automated imaging cryomicrotome. Detailed 3D reconstructions were created to map the tracer spreading. We observed that tracers distributed over the hippocampus and entered adjacent brain structures, such as the cortex and cerebroventricular system. An important clearance pathway was found along the ventral part of the hippocampus and its bordering interpeduncular cistern. From there, tracers left the brain via the subarachnoid spaces in the directions of both the nose and the spinal cord. Although both tracers followed the same route, the small tracer distributed further, implying a major role for diffusion in addition to convection. Taken together, these results reveal an important clearance pathway of solutes from the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Group analysis in diffusion tensor imaging is challenging. Comparisons of tensor morphology across groups have typically been performed on scalar measures of diffusivity, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), disregarding the complex three-dimensional morphologies of diffusion tensors. Scalar measures consider only the magnitude of the diffusion but not directions. In the present study, we have introduced a new approach based on directional statistics to use directional information of diffusion tensors in statistical group analysis based on Bingham distribution. We have investigated different directional statistical models to find the best fit. During the experiments, we confirmed that carrying out directional statistical analysis along the tract is much more effective than voxel- or skeleton-guided directional statistics. Hence, we propose a new method called tract profiling and directional statistics (TPDS) applicable to fiber bundles. As a case study, the method has been applied to identify connectivity differences of patients with major depressive disorder. The results obtained with the directional statistic-based analysis are consistent with those of NBS, but additionally, we found significant changes in the right hemisphere striatum, ACC, and prefrontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital connections as well as left hemispheric differences in the limbic areas such as the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The results are also evaluated with respect to fiber lengths. Comparison with the output of the network-based statistical toolbox indicated that the benefit of the proposed method becomes much more distinctive as the tract length increases. The likelihood of finding clusters of voxels that differ in long tracts is higher in TPDS, while that relationship is not clearly established in NBS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders. Present treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy and pharmacological treatments show only moderate success, which emphasizes the importance for the development of new treatment protocols. Non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been probed as therapeutic option for anxiety disorders in recent years. Mechanistic information about their mode of action, and most efficient protocols is however limited. Here the fear extinction model can serve as a model of exposure therapies for studying therapeutic mechanisms, and development of appropriate intervention protocols. We systematically reviewed 30 research articles that investigated the impact of rTMS and tDCS on fear memory and extinction in animal models and humans, in clinical and healthy populations. The results of these studies suggest that tDCS and rTMS can be efficient methods to modulate fear memory and extinction. Furthermore, excitability-enhancing stimulation applied over the vmPFC showed the strongest potential to enhance fear extinction. We further discuss factors that determine the efficacy of rTMS and tDCS in the context of the fear extinction model and provide future directions to optimize parameters and protocols of stimulation for research and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural complexity and brain entropy (BEN) have gained greater interest in recent years. The dynamics of neural signals and their relations with information processing continue to be investigated through different measures in a variety of noteworthy studies. The BEN of spontaneous neural activity decreases during states of reduced consciousness. This evidence has been showed in primary consciousness states, such as psychedelic states, under the name of “the entropic brain hypothesis.” In this manuscript we propose an extension of this hypothesis to physiological and pathological aging. We review this particular facet of the complexity of the brain, mentioning studies that have investigated BEN in primary consciousness states, and extending this view to the field of neuroaging with a focus on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We first introduce historic and conceptual ideas about entropy and neural complexity, treating the mindbrain as a complex nonlinear dynamic adaptive system, in light of the free energy principle. Then, we review the studies in this field, analyzing the idea that the aim of the neurocognitive system is to maintain a dynamic state of balance between order and chaos, both in terms of dynamics of neural signals and functional connectivity. In our exploration we will review studies both on acute psychedelic states and more chronic psychotic states and traits, such as those in schizophrenia, in order to show the increase of entropy in those states. Then we extend our exploration to physiological and pathological aging, where BEN is reduced. Finally, we propose an interpretation of these results, defining a general trend of BEN in primary states and cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Efficient methods for assessing walking adaptability in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are urgently needed. Therefore, this study aimed to assess C-Gait for detecting freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with early- to middle-stage PD.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;People with PD (PWP) diagnosis (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1–3) were recruited from April 2019 to November 2019 in Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital. The participants performed six items of walking adaptability on an instrumented treadmill augmented with visual targets and obstacles (C-Mill). The patient’s walking adaptability was evaluated by C-Gait assessment and traditional walking tests, and FOG-related indexes were collected as outcome measures. Two discriminant models were established by stepwise discriminant analysis; area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to validate the models.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;In total, 53 patients were included in this study. Most C-Gait assessment items had no or low correlations with traditional walking tests. The obstacle avoidance (r = −0.639, P = 0.003) and speed of adaptation (r = −0.486, P = 0.035) items could lead to FOG with high sensitivity. In addition, the C-Gait assessment model (AUC = 0.755) had slightly better discrimination of freezers from non-freezers compared with traditional walking test models (AUC = 0.672); specifically, obstacle avoidance and speed of adaptation have uniquely discriminant potential.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;C-gait assessment could provide additional value to the traditional walking tests for PD. Gait adaptability assessment, as measured by C-Gait, may be able to help identify freezers in a PD population.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Bilingualism has been identified as a potential cognitive factor linked to delayed onset of dementia as well as boosting executive functions in healthy individuals. However, more recently, this claim has been called into question following several failed replications. It remains unclear whether these contradictory findings reflect how bilingualism is defined between studies, or methodological limitations when measuring the bilingual effect. One key issue is that despite the claims that bilingualism yields general protection to cognitive processes (i.e., the cognitive reserve hypothesis), studies reporting putative bilingual differences are often focused on domain specific experimental paradigms. This study chose a broader approach, by considering the consequences of bilingualism on a wide range of cognitive functions within individuals. We utilised 19 measures of different cognitive functions commonly associated with bilingual effects, to form a “cognitive profile” for 215 non-clinical participants. We recruited Welsh speakers, who as a group of bilinguals were highly homogeneous, as means of isolating the bilingualism criterion. We sought to determine if such analyses would independently classify bilingual/monolingual participant groups based on emergent patterns driven by collected cognitive profiles, such that population differences would emerge. Multiple predictive models were trained to independently recognise the cognitive profiles of bilinguals, older adults (60-90 years of age) and higher education attainment. Despite managing to successfully classify cognitive profiles based on age and education, the model failed to differentiate between bilingual and monolingual cognitive ability at a rate greater than that of chance. Repeated modelling using alternative definitions of bilingualism, and just the older adults, yielded similar results. In all cases then, using our “bottom–up” analytical approach, there was no evidence that bilingualism as a variable indicated differential cognitive performance – as a consequence, we conclude that bilinguals are not cognitively different from their monolingual counterparts, even in older demographics. We suggest that studies that have reported a bilingual advantage (typically recruiting immigrant populations) could well have confounded other key variables that may be driving reported advantages. We recommend that future research refine the machine learning methods used in this study to further investigate the complex relationship between bilingualism and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes elicit transient Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations induced by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), yet their role in vivo remains unknown. To address this, transgenic mice with astrocytic expression of the optogenetic Gq-type GPCR, Optoα1AR, were established, in which transient Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations similar to those in wild type mice were induced by brief blue light illumination. Activation of cortical astrocytes resulted in an adenosine A1 receptor-dependent inhibition of neuronal activity. Moreover, sensory stimulation with astrocytic activation induced long-term depression of sensory evoked response. At the behavioral level, repeated astrocytic activation in the anterior cortex gradually affected novel open field exploratory behavior, and remote memory was enhanced in a novel object recognition task. These effects were blocked by A1 receptor antagonism. Together, we demonstrate that GPCR-triggered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation in cortical astrocytes has causal impacts on neuronal activity and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor integration is a pivotal feature of the nervous system for ensuring a coordinated motor response to external stimuli. In essence, such neural circuits can optimize behavioral performance based on the saliency of environmental cues. In zebrafish, habituation of the acoustic startle response (ASR) is a simple behavior integrated into the startle command neurons, called the Mauthner cells. Whereas the essential neuronal components that regulate the startle response have been identified, the principles of how this regulation is integrated at the subcellular regions of the Mauthner cell, which in turn modulate the performance of the behavior, is still not well understood. Here, we reveal mechanistically distinct dynamics of excitatory inputs converging onto the lateral dendrite (LD) and axon initial segment (AIS) of the Mauthner cell by in vivo imaging glutamate release using iGluSnFR, an ultrafast glutamate sensing fluorescent reporter. We find that modulation of glutamate release is dependent on NMDA receptor activity exclusively at the AIS, which is responsible for setting the sensitivity of the startle reflex and inducing a depression of synaptic activity during habituation. In contrast, glutamate-release at the LD is not regulated by NMDA receptors and serves as a baseline component of Mauthner cell activation. Finally, using in vivo calcium imaging at the feed-forward interneuron population component of the startle circuit, we reveal that these cells indeed play pivotal roles in both setting the startle threshold and habituation by modulating the AIS of the Mauthner cell. These results indicate that a command neuron may have several functionally distinct regions to regulate complex aspects of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a member of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-the secretin-glucagon family of neuropeptides. They act through two classes of receptors: PACAP type 1 (PAC1) and type 2 (VPAC1 and VPAC2). Among their pleiotropic effects throughout the body, PACAP functions as neuromodulators and neuroprotectors, rescuing neurons from apoptosis, mostly through the PAC1 receptor. To explore the potential protective effect of endogenous PACAP against Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), we used a knockout mouse model lacking PAC1 receptor expression (PACR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) and a transgenic humanized mouse model expressing the human PAC1 receptor (TgHPAC1R). Based on complementary approaches combining electrophysiological, histochemical, and molecular biological evaluations, we show PAC1R expression in spiral ganglion neurons and in cochlear apical cells of the organ of Corti. Wild-type (WT), PAC1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;, and TgHPAC1R mice exhibit similar auditory thresholds. For most of the frequencies tested after acute noise damage, however, PAC1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a larger elevation of the auditory threshold than did their WT counterparts. By contrast, in a transgene copy number-dependent fashion, TgHPAC1R mice showed smaller noise-induced elevations of auditory thresholds compared to their WT counterparts. Together, these findings suggest that PACAP could be a candidate for endogenous protection against noise-induced hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The advances in single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and the development of bioinformatics pipelines enable us to more accurately define the heterogeneity of cell types in a selected tissue. In this report, we re-analyzed recently published single-cell RNA sequencing data sets and provide a rationale to redefine the heterogeneity of cells in both intact and injured mouse peripheral nerves. Our analysis showed that, in both intact and injured peripheral nerves, cells could be functionally classified into four categories: Schwann cells, nerve fibroblasts, immune cells, and cells associated with blood vessels. Nerve fibroblasts could be sub-clustered into epineurial, perineurial, and endoneurial fibroblasts. Identified immune cell clusters include macrophages, mast cells, natural killer cells, T and B lymphocytes as well as an unreported cluster of neutrophils. Cells associated with blood vessels include endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes. We show that endothelial cells in the intact mouse sciatic nerve have three sub-types: epineurial, endoneurial, and lymphatic endothelial cells. Analysis of cell type-specific gene changes revealed that Schwann cells and endoneurial fibroblasts are the two most important cell types promoting peripheral nerve regeneration. Analysis of communication between these cells identified potential signals for early blood vessel regeneration, neutrophil recruitment of macrophages, and macrophages activating Schwann cells. Through this analysis, we also report appropriate marker genes for future single cell transcriptome data analysis to identify cell types in intact and injured peripheral nerves. The findings from our analysis could facilitate a better understanding of cell biology of peripheral nerves in homeostasis, regeneration, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The facial dermato-muscular system consists of highly specialized muscles tightly adhering to the overlaying skin and thus form a complex morphological conglomerate. This is the anatomical and functional basis for versatile facial expressions, which are essential for human social interaction. The neural innervation of the facial skin and muscles occurs via branches of the trigeminal and facial nerves. These are also the most commonly pathologically affected cranial nerves, often requiring surgical treatment. Hence, experimental models for researching these nerves and their pathologies are highly relevant to study pathophysiology and nerve regeneration. Experimental models for the distinctive investigation of the complex afferent and efferent interplay within facial structures are scarce. In this study, we established a robust surgical model for distinctive exploration of facial structures after complete elimination of afferent or efferent innervation in the rat. Animals were allocated into two groups according to the surgical procedure. In the first group, the facial nerve and in the second all distal cutaneous branches of the trigeminal nerve were transected unilaterally. All animals survived and no higher burden was caused by the procedures. Whisker pad movements were documented with video recordings 4 weeks after surgery and showed successful denervation. Whole-mount immunofluorescent staining of facial muscles was performed to visualize the innervation pattern of the neuromuscular junctions. Comprehensive quantitative analysis revealed large differences in afferent axon counts in the cutaneous branches of the trigeminal nerve. Axon number was the highest in the infraorbital nerve (28,625 ± 2,519), followed by the supraorbital nerve (2,131 ± 413), the mental nerve (3,062 ± 341), and the cutaneous branch of the mylohyoid nerve (343 ± 78). Overall, this surgical model is robust and reliable for distinctive surgical deafferentation or deefferentation of the face. It may be used for investigating cortical plasticity, the neurobiological mechanisms behind various clinically relevant conditions like facial paralysis or trigeminal neuralgia as well as local anesthesia in the face and oral cavity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The nervous system coordinates pathways and circuits to process sensory information and govern motor behaviors. Mapping these pathways is important to further understand the connectivity throughout the nervous system and is vital for developing treatments for neuronal diseases and disorders. We targeted long ascending propriospinal neurons (LAPNs) in the rat spinal cord utilizing Fluoro-Ruby (FR) [10kD rhodamine dextran amine (RDA)], and two dual-viral systems. Dual-viral tracing utilizing a retrograde adeno-associated virus (retroAAV), which confers robust labeling in the brain, resulted in a small number of LAPNs being labeled, but dual-viral tracing using a highly efficient retrograde (HiRet) lentivirus provided robust labeling similar to FR. Additionally, dual-viral tracing with HiRet lentivirus and tracing with FR may preferentially label different subpopulations of LAPNs. These data demonstrate that dual-viral tracing in the spinal cord employing a HiRet lentivirus provides robust and specific labeling of LAPNs and emphasizes the need to empirically optimize viral systems to target specific neuronal population(s).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although a general age-related decline in neural plasticity is evident, the effects of age on neural plasticity after motor practice are inconclusive. Inconsistencies in the literature may be related to between-study differences in task difficulty. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effects of age and task difficulty on motor learning and associated brain activity. We used task-related electroencephalography (EEG) power in the alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) frequency bands to assess neural plasticity before, immediately after, and 24-h after practice of a mirror star tracing task at one of three difficulty levels in healthy younger (19–24 yr) and older (65–86 yr) adults. Results showed an age-related deterioration in motor performance that was more pronounced with increasing task difficulty and was accompanied by a more bilateral activity pattern for older vs. younger adults. Task difficulty affected motor skill retention and neural plasticity specifically in older adults. Older adults that practiced at the low or medium, but not the high, difficulty levels were able to maintain improvements in accuracy at retention and showed modulation of alpha TR-Power after practice. Together, these data indicate that both age and task difficulty affect motor learning, as well as the associated neural plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders with increasing incidence and still without cure. The extensive time required for development and approval of novel therapeutics highlights the need for testing and repurposing known safe molecules. Since doxycycline impacts α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity, herein we tested its effect on tau. We found that doxycycline reduces amyloid aggregation of the 2N4R and K18 isoforms of tau protein in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in a cell free system doxycycline also prevents tau seeding and in cell culture reduces toxicity of tau aggregates. Overall, our results expand the spectrum of action of doxycycline against aggregation-prone proteins, opening novel perspectives for its repurposing as a disease-modifying drug for tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 We measured the modulation of pupil-size (in constant lighting) elicited by observing transparent surfaces of black and white moving dots, perceived as a cylinder rotating about its vertical axis. The direction of rotation was swapped periodically by flipping stereo-depth of the two surfaces. Pupil size modulated in synchrony with the changes in front-surface color (dilating when black). The magnitude of pupillary modulation was larger for human participants with higher Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), consistent with a local perceptual style , with attention focused on the front surface. The modulation with surface color, and its correlation with AQ, was equally strong when participants passively viewed the stimulus. No other indicator, including involuntary pursuit eye-movements, covaried with AQ. These results reinforce our previous report with a similar bistable stimulus (Turi, Burr, &amp;amp; Binda, 2018), and go on to show that bistable illusory motion is not necessary for the effect, or its dependence on AQ.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Synaptotagmins confer calcium-dependence to the exocytosis of secretory vesicles, but how coexpressed synaptotagmins interact remains unclear. We find that synaptotagmin-1 and synaptotagmin-7 when present alone act as standalone fast and slow Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensors for vesicle fusion in mouse chromaffin cells. When present together, synaptotagmin-1 and synaptotagmin-7 are found in largely non-overlapping clusters on dense-core vesicles. Synaptotagmin-7 stimulates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent vesicle priming and inhibits depriming, and it promotes ubMunc13-2- and phorbolester-dependent priming, especially at low resting calcium concentrations. The priming effect of synaptotagmin-7 increases the number of vesicles fusing via synaptotagmin-1, while negatively affecting their fusion speed, indicating both synergistic and competitive interactions between synaptotagmins. Synaptotagmin-7 places vesicles in close membrane apposition (&amp;lt;6 nm); without it, vesicles accumulate out of reach of the fusion complex (20-40 nm). We suggest that a synaptotagmin-7-dependent movement toward the membrane is involved in Munc13-2/phorbolester/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent priming as a prelude to fast and slow exocytosis triggering.</content>

 Circadian clocks display remarkable reliability despite significant stochasticity in biomolecular reactions. We study the dynamics of a circadian clock-controlled gene at the individual cell level in &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt; sp. PCC 7120, a multicellular filamentous cyanobacterium. We found significant synchronization and spatial coherence along filaments, clock coupling due to cell-cell communication, and gating of the cell cycle. Furthermore, we observed low-amplitude circadian oscillatory transcription of &lt;i&gt;kai&lt;/i&gt; genes comprising the post-transcriptional core oscillatory circuit, and high-amplitude oscillations of &lt;i&gt;rpaA&lt;/i&gt; coding for the master regulator transducing the core clock output. Transcriptional oscillations of &lt;i&gt;rpaA&lt;/i&gt; suggest an additional level of regulation. A stochastic, one-dimensional toy model of coupled clock cores and their phosphorylation states shows that demographic noise can seed stochastic oscillations outside the region where deterministic limit cycles with circadian periods occur. The model reproduces the observed spatio-temporal coherence along filaments, and provides a robust description of coupled circadian clocks in a multicellular organism.</content>

 Mutation of the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homology (WASH) complex subunit, SWIP, is implicated in human intellectual disability, but the cellular etiology of this association is unknown. We identify the neuronal WASH complex proteome, revealing a network of endosomal proteins. To uncover how dysfunction of endosomal SWIP leads to disease, we generate a mouse model of the human &lt;i&gt;WASHC4&lt;sup&gt;c.3056C&amp;gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mutation. Quantitative spatial proteomics analysis of SWIP&lt;sup&gt;P1019R&lt;/sup&gt; mouse brain reveals that this mutation destabilizes the WASH complex and uncovers significant perturbations in both endosomal and lysosomal pathways. Cellular and histological analyses confirm that SWIP&lt;sup&gt;P1019R&lt;/sup&gt; results in endo-lysosomal disruption and uncover indicators of neurodegeneration. We find that SWIP&lt;sup&gt;P1019R&lt;/sup&gt; not only impacts cognition, but also causes significant progressive motor deficits in mice. A retrospective analysis of SWIP&lt;sup&gt;P1019R&lt;/sup&gt; patients reveals similar movement deficits in humans. Combined, these findings support the model that WASH complex destabilization, resulting from SWIP&lt;sup&gt;P1019R&lt;/sup&gt;, drives cognitive and motor impairments via endo-lysosomal dysfunction in the brain.</content>

 Objective
Mutant expansions of DNA CAG ≥32 repeats in ATXN2 can be a rare cause of Parkinson disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We recently reported that the stress granule (SG) protein Staufen1 (STAU1) was overabundant in neurodegenerative disorder SCA2 patient cells, animal models, and ALS‐TDP‐43 fibroblasts and provided a link between SG formation and autophagy. We aimed to test if STAU1 overabundance has role in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases.


Methods
With multiple neurodegenerative patient‐derived cell models, animal models, and human postmortem ALS tissue, we evaluate STAU1 function using biochemical and immunohistological analyses.


Results
We demonstrate STAU1 overabundance and increased total and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in fibroblast cells from ALS patients with mutations in TDP‐43, dementia patients with PSEN1 mutations, a parkinsonism patient with MAPT mutation, Huntington disease (HD) mutations, and SCA2 mutations. Increased STAU1 levels and mTOR activity were seen in human ALS spinal cord tissues as well as in animal models. Changes in STAU1 and mTOR protein levels were post‐transcriptional. Exogenous expression of STAU1 in wildtype cells was sufficient to activate mTOR and downstream targets and form SGs. Targeting STAU1 by RNAi normalized mTOR, suggesting a potential role for therapy in diseases associated with STAU1 overabundance.


Interpretation
STAU1 overabundance in neurodegeneration is a common phenomenon associated with hyperactive mTOR. Targeting STAU1 with ASOs or miRNA viral vectors may represent a novel, efficacious therapy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by overabundant STAU1.

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26068?af=R"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 Objective
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy frequently associated with multiple types of seizures. The classical Na+ channel inhibitors are in general ineffective against the seizures in LGS. Rufinamide is a new Na+ channel inhibitor, but approved for the treatment of LGS. This is not consistent with a choice of antiseizure drugs (ASD) according to simplistic categorical grouping.


Methods
The effect of rufinamide on the Na+ channel, cellular discharges, and seizure behaviors were quantitatively characterized in native neurons and mammalian models of epilepsy, and compared with the other Na+ channel inhibitors.


Results
With a much faster binding rate to the inactivated Na+ channel than phenytoin, rufinamide is distinctively effective if the seizure discharges chiefly involve short bursts interspersed by hyperpolarized interburst intervals, exemplified by spike and wave discharges (SWD) in electroencephalograms. Consistently, rufinamide, but not phenytoin, suppresses SWD‐associated seizures in pentylenetetrazole or AY‐9944 models, which recapitulate the major electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations in typical and atypical absence seizures including LGS.


Interpretation
Na+ channel inhibitors must have sufficiently fast binding to exert an action during the short bursts and then suppress SWD, in which cases rufinamide is superior. For the other epileptiform discharges where the interburst intervals are not so hyperpolarized, phenytoin could be better because of the higher affinity. Na+ channel inhibitors with different binding kinetics and affinity to the inactivated channels may have different antiseizure scope. A rational choice of ASD according to in‐depth molecular pharmacology and the attributes of ictal discharges is advisable.

 Prichard et al. examined dogs’ perception of real world objects using awake, unrestrained fMRI. Using the same video stimuli and real world objects, they identified object‐selective regions of the dog brain. Object regions of the dog brain responded more to objects associated with a mouth action than objects associated with a paw action. Somatosensory cortex was active during dogs’ anticipation of performing a mouth action on an object. This suggests that dogs’ perception of objects depends on how dogs expect to interact with them.






Abstract
The perception and representation of objects in the world is foundational to all animals. The relative importance of objects' physical properties versus how the objects are interacted with continues to be debated. Neural evidence in humans and non‐human primates suggests animate‐inanimate and face‐body dimensions of objects are represented in the temporal cortex. However, because primates have opposable thumbs and interact with objects in similar ways, the question remains as to whether this similarity represents the evolution of a common cognitive process or whether it reflects a similarity of physical interaction. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in dogs to test whether the type of interaction affects object processing in an animal that interacts primarily with its mouth. In Study 1, we identified object‐processing regions of cortex by having dogs passively view movies of faces and objects. In Study 2, dogs were trained to interact with two new objects with either the mouth or paw. Then, we measured responsivity in the object regions to the presentation of these objects. Mouth‐objects elicited significantly greater activity in object regions than paw‐objects. Mouth‐objects were also associated with activity in somatosensory cortex, suggesting dogs were anticipating mouthing interactions. These findings suggest that object perception in dogs is affected by how dogs expect to interact with familiar objects.

 Male mice were trained either in the delayed alternation task (fully‐adapted) or the alternation task without any delays (partially‐adapted) for 9 days. The control group remained in their homecage for the same time. The fully adapted group exhibited improved cognitive flexibility, increased long‐term potentiation and dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex and increased mature dendritic spine density in the hippocampus, compared ot the other two groups.

Abstract
Working memory (WM) is the ability to hold on‐line and manipulate information. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key brain region involved in WM, while the hippocampus is also involved, particularly, in spatial WM. Although several studies have investigated the neuronal substrates of WM in trained animals, the effects and the mechanisms underlying learning WM tasks have not been explored. In our study, we investigated the effects of learning WM tasks in mice on the function of PFC and hippocampus, by training mice in the delayed alternation task for 9 days (adaptive group). This group was compared to naïve mice (which stayed in their homecage) and mice trained in the alternation procedure only (non‐adaptive). Following training, a cohort of mice (Experiment A) was tested in the left–right discrimination task and the reversal learning task, while another cohort (Experiment B) was tested in the attention set‐shifting task (AST). The adaptive group performed significantly better in the reversal learning task (Experiment A) and AST (Experiment B), compared to non‐adaptive and naïve groups. At the end of the behavioral experiments in Experiment A, field excitatory post‐synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were performed in PFC and hippocampal brain slices. The adaptive group had enhanced the long‐term potentiation (LTP) in the PFC, compared to the other groups. In the hippocampus, both the adaptive and the non‐adaptive groups exhibited increased fEPSP compared to the naïve group, but no differences in LTP. In Experiment B, the dendritic spine density was measured, which, in the PFC, was found increased in the adaptive group, compared to the non‐adaptive and naïve groups. In the hippocampus, there was an increase in mature dendritic spine density in the adaptive group, compared to the other two groups. Our results indicate a role for LTP and dendritic spine density in learning WM tasks.</content>

Adenosine receptors (ARs) have been demonstrated to be potential therapeutic targets against Parkinson’s disease (PD). In the present study, we describe a multistage virtual screening approach that identifies dual adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists using deep learning, pharmacophore models, and molecular docking methods. Nineteen hits from the ChemDiv library containing 1,178,506 compounds were selected and further tested by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays (cAMP functional assay and radioligand binding assay); of these hits, two compounds (C8 and C9) with 1,2,4-triazole scaffolds possessing the most potent binding affinity and antagonistic activity for A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; ARs at the nanomolar level (pK&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of 7.16–7.49 and pIC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 6.31–6.78) were identified. Further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested similarly strong binding interactions of the complexes between the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; ARs and two compounds (C8 and C9). Notably, the 1,2,4-triazole derivatives (compounds C8 and C9) were identified as the most potent dual A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; AR antagonists in our study and could serve as a basis for further development. The effective multistage screening approach developed in this study can be utilized to identify potent ligands for other drug targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NMtYLjJHLwM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Spinal microglia are highly responsive to peripheral nerve injury and are known to be a key player in pain. However, there has not been any direct evidence showing that selective microglial activation in vivo is sufficient to induce chronic pain. Here, we used optogenetic approaches in microglia to address this question employing CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;creER/+&lt;/sup&gt;: R26&lt;sup&gt;LSL-ReaChR/+&lt;/sup&gt; transgenic mice, in which red-activated channelrhodopsin (ReaChR) is inducibly and specifically expressed in microglia. We found that activation of ReaChR by red light in spinal microglia evoked reliable inward currents and membrane depolarization. In vivo optogenetic activation of microglial ReaChR in the spinal cord triggered chronic pain hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. In addition, activation of microglial ReaChR up-regulated neuronal c-Fos expression and enhanced C-fiber responses. Mechanistically, ReaChR activation led to a reactive microglial phenotype with increased interleukin (IL)-1β production, which is likely mediated by inflammasome activation and calcium elevation. IL-1 receptor antagonist (&lt;i&gt;IL-1ra&lt;/i&gt;) was able to reverse the pain hypersensitivity and neuronal hyperactivity induced by microglial ReaChR activation. Therefore, our work demonstrates that optogenetic activation of spinal microglia is sufficient to trigger chronic pain phenotypes by increasing neuronal activity via IL-1 signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dO-FcSRwXwg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 By means of serial block‐face electron microscopy, Wang et al. revealed subcellular structural bases for row‐specific cytoarchitecture and innervation pattern in mouse cochlear amplifier.







Abstract
In mammalian cochlea, sound‐induced vibration is amplified by a three‐row lattice of Y‐shaped microstructures consisting of electromotile outer hair cell and supporting Deiters cell. This highly organized structure is thought to be essential for hearing of low‐level sounds. Prior studies reported differences in geometry and synaptic innervation of the outer hair cells between rows, but how these fine features are achieved at subcellular level still remains unclear. Using serial block‐face electron microscopy, we acquired few‐hundred‐micron‐sized cytoarchitecture of mouse organ of Corti at nanometer resolution. Structural quantifications were performed on the Y‐shapes as well as afferent and efferent projections to outer hair cells (OHCs). Several new features, which support the previously observed inter‐row heterogeneity, are described. Our result provides structural bases for the gradient of mechanical properties and diverse centrifugal regulation of OHC rows.</content>

Though it has been suggested that auditory cortex is the origin of ASSR, how the laminar architecture of the neocortex contributes to the ASSR recorded from the brain surface remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We used a 16-channel silicon probe to record the local field potential and the single-unit spike activity in the different layers of the auditory cortex of unanesthetized mice. Click-trains with a repetition rate at 40-Hz were present as sound stimuli to evoke ASSR.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that the LFPs of all cortical layers showed a stable ASSR synchronizing to the 40-Hz click stimuli, while the ASSR was strongest in the granular (thalamorecipient) layer. Furthermore, time-frequency analyses also revealed the strongest coherence between the signals recorded from the granular layer and pial surface.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal that the 40-Hz ASSR primarily shows the evoked gamma oscillation of thalamorecipient layers in the neocortex, and that the ASSR may be a biomarker to detect the cognitive deficits associated with impaired thalamo-cortical connection.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Over four decades ago, in vitro experiments showed that tau protein interacts with and stabilizes microtubules in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This observation fueled the widespread hypotheses that these properties extend to living neurons and that reduced stability of microtubules represents a major disease-driving event induced by pathological forms of tau in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies. Accordingly, most research efforts to date have addressed this protein as a substrate, focusing on evaluating how specific mutations, phosphorylation, and other post-translational modifications impact its microtubule-binding and stabilizing properties. In contrast, fewer efforts were made to illuminate potential mechanisms linking physiological and disease-related forms of tau to the normal and pathological regulation of kinases and phosphatases. Here, we discuss published work indicating that, through interactions with various kinases and phosphatases, tau may normally act as a scaffolding protein to regulate phosphorylation-based signaling pathways. Expanding on this concept, we also review experimental evidence linking disease-related tau species to the misregulation of these pathways. Collectively, the available evidence supports the participation of tau in multiple cellular processes sustaining neuronal and glial function through various mechanisms involving the scaffolding and regulation of selected kinases and phosphatases at discrete subcellular compartments. The notion that the repertoire of tau functions includes a role as a signaling hub should widen our interpretation of experimental results and increase our understanding of tau biology in normal and disease conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ability of tau aggregates to recruit and misfold monomeric tau and propagate across brain regions has been studied extensively and is now recognized as a critical pathological step in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Recent evidence suggests that the detection of tau seeds in human samples may be relevant and correlate with clinical data. Here, we review the available methods for the measurement of such tau seeds, their limitations and their potential implementation for the development of the next-generation biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although animal studies and studies on Parkinson’s disease (PD) suggest that dopamine deficiency slows the pace of the internal clock, which is corrected by dopaminergic medication, timing deficits in parkinsonism remain to be characterized with diverse findings. Here we studied patients with PD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 3–4 h after drug intake, and normal age-matched subjects. We contrasted perceptual (temporal bisection, duration comparison) and motor timing tasks (time production/reproduction) in supra- and sub-second time domains, and automatic versus cognitive/short-term memory–related tasks. Subjects were allowed to count during supra-second production and reproduction tasks. In the time production task, linearly correlating the produced time with the instructed time showed that the “subjective sense” of 1 s is slightly longer in PD and shorter in PSP than in normals. This was superposed on a prominent trend of underestimation of longer (supra-second) durations, common to all groups, suggesting that the pace of the internal clock changed from fast to slow as time went by. In the time reproduction task, PD and, more prominently, PSP patients over-reproduced shorter durations and under-reproduced longer durations at extremes of the time range studied, with intermediate durations reproduced veridically, with a shallower slope of linear correlation between the presented and produced time. In the duration comparison task, PD patients overestimated the second presented duration relative to the first with shorter but not longer standard durations. In the bisection task, PD and PSP patients estimated the bisection point (BP50) between the two supra-second but not sub-second standards to be longer than normal subjects. Thus, perceptual timing tasks showed changes in opposite directions to motor timing tasks: underestimating shorter durations and overestimating longer durations. In PD, correlation of the mini-mental state examination score with supra-second BP50 and the slope of linear correlation in the reproduction task suggested involvement of short-term memory in these tasks. Dopamine deficiency didn’t correlate significantly with timing performances, suggesting that the slowed clock hypothesis cannot explain the entire results. Timing performance in PD may be determined by complex interactions among time scales on the motor and sensory sides, and by their distortion in memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Studies in animal models have suggested that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (encoded by ALDH1A1) protects against Parkinson’s disease (PD) by reducing toxic metabolites of dopamine. Herein we aimed to investigate whether ALDH1A1 was genetically associated with PD susceptibility in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A Han Chinese population of 1,039 subjects was recruited to analyze six tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), followed by haplotype analyses and variants interaction analyses. Real-time PCR was used to analyze mRNA levels of ALDH1A1 in peripheral blood of 42 subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The tag-SNP rs7043217 of ALDH1A1 was significantly associated with PD susceptibility with the T serving as a risk allele (genotype frequency, P = 0.030; allele frequency, P = 0.013, OR = 1.258, 95% CI = 1.050–1.508). Multiple haplotypes were linked to abnormalities of PD risk, topped by a 4-SNP GGTA module in the order of rs4646547, rs1888202, rs7043217, and rs647880 (P = 9.610 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–8&lt;/sup&gt;, OR = 6.420, 95% CI = 2.944–13.998). Interaction analyses showed that a simultaneous presence of the CC genotype of rs7043217 and the TT genotype of ALDH2 variant rs4767944 conferred an elevated protection against PD (P = 4.68 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;, OR = 0.378, 95% CI = 0.219–0.652). The mRNA expression of ALDH1A1 showed a trend of reduction (P = 0.084) in PD patients compared to the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results provide novel genetic insights into the role of ALDH1 in PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although the increased expression of members of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan family, such as neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2), have been well documented after an injury to the spinal cord, a complete picture as to the cellular origins and function of this NG2 expression has yet to be made. Using a spinal cord injury (SCI) mouse model, we describe that some infiltrated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMΦ) are early contributors to NG2/CSPG4 expression and secretion after SCI. We demonstrate for the first time that a lesion-related form of cellular debris generated from damaged myelin sheaths can increase NG2/CSPG4 expression in BMDMΦ, which then exhibit enhanced proliferation and decreased phagocytic capacity. These results suggest that BMDMΦ may play a much more nuanced role in secondary spinal cord injury than previously thought, including acting as early contributors to the NG2 component of the glial scar.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;An active lifestyle as well as cognitive and physical training (PT) may benefit cognition by increasing cognitive reserve, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of this reserve capacity are not well understood. To investigate these mechanisms of cognitive reserve, we focused on electrophysiological correlates of cognitive performance, namely on an event-related measure of auditory memory and on a measure of global coherence. Both measures have shown to be sensitive markers for cognition and might therefore be suitable to investigate potential training- and lifestyle-related changes. Here, we report on the results of an electrophysiological sub-study that correspond to previously published behavioral findings. Altogether, 65 older adults with subjective or objective cognitive impairment and aged 60–88 years were assigned to a 10-week cognitive (n = 19) or a 10-week PT (n = 21) or to a passive control group (n = 25). In addition, self-reported lifestyle was assessed at baseline. We did not find an effect of both training groups on electroencephalography (EEG) measures of auditory memory decay or global coherence (ps ≥ 0.29) and a more active lifestyle was not associated with improved global coherence (p = 0.38). Results suggest that a 10-week unimodal cognitive or PT and an active lifestyle in older adults at risk for dementia are not strongly related to improvements in electrophysiological correlates of cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explore the genetic causes of complex diseases. However, classical approaches ignore the biological context of the genetic variants and genes under study. To address this shortcoming, one can use biological networks, which model functional relationships, to search for functionally related susceptibility loci. Many such network methods exist, each arising from different mathematical frameworks, pre-processing steps, and assumptions about the network properties of the susceptibility mechanism. Unsurprisingly, this results in disparate solutions. To explore how to exploit these heterogeneous approaches, we selected six network methods and applied them to GENESIS, a nationwide French study on familial breast cancer. First, we verified that network methods recovered more interpretable results than a standard GWAS. We addressed the heterogeneity of their solutions by studying their overlap, computing what we called the &lt;i&gt;consensus&lt;/i&gt;. The key gene in this consensus solution was &lt;i&gt;COPS5&lt;/i&gt;, a gene related to multiple cancer hallmarks. Another issue we observed was that network methods were unstable, selecting very different genes on different subsamples of GENESIS. Therefore, we proposed a &lt;i&gt;stable consensus&lt;/i&gt; solution formed by the 68 genes most consistently selected across multiple subsamples. This solution was also enriched in genes known to be associated with breast cancer susceptibility (&lt;i&gt;BLM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CASP8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CASP10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DNAJC1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FGFR2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MRPS30&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;SLC4A7&lt;/i&gt;, P-value = 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;). The most connected gene was &lt;i&gt;CUL3&lt;/i&gt;, a regulator of several genes linked to cancer progression. Lastly, we evaluated the biases of each method and the impact of their parameters on the outcome. In general, network methods preferred highly connected genes, even after random rewirings that stripped the connections of any biological meaning. In conclusion, we present the advantages of network-guided GWAS, characterize their shortcomings, and provide strategies to address them. To compute the consensus networks, implementations of all six methods are available at https://github.com/hclimente/gwas-tools.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IvWhAxDfMiU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Developing mathematical models to accurately predict microbial growth dynamics remains a key challenge in ecology, evolution, biotechnology, and public health. To reproduce and grow, microbes need to take up essential nutrients from the environment, and mathematical models classically assume that the nutrient uptake rate is a saturating function of the nutrient concentration. In nature, microbes experience different levels of nutrient availability at all environmental scales, yet parameters shaping the nutrient uptake function are commonly estimated for a single initial nutrient concentration. This hampers the models from accurately capturing microbial dynamics when the environmental conditions change. To address this problem, we conduct growth experiments for a range of micro-organisms, including human fungal pathogens, baker’s yeast, and common coliform bacteria, and uncover the following patterns. We observed that the maximal nutrient uptake rate and biomass yield were both decreasing functions of initial nutrient concentration. While a functional form for the relationship between biomass yield and initial nutrient concentration has been previously derived from first metabolic principles, here we also derive the form of the relationship between maximal nutrient uptake rate and initial nutrient concentration. Incorporating these two functions into a model of microbial growth allows for variable growth parameters and enables us to substantially improve predictions for microbial dynamics in a range of initial nutrient concentrations, compared to keeping growth parameters fixed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vGlKY91L79U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A systematic and reproducible “workflow”—the process that moves a scientific investigation from raw data to coherent research question to insightful contribution—should be a fundamental part of academic data-intensive research practice. In this paper, we elaborate basic principles of a reproducible data analysis workflow by defining 3 phases: the Explore, Refine, and Produce Phases. Each phase is roughly centered around the audience to whom research decisions, methodologies, and results are being immediately communicated. Importantly, each phase can also give rise to a number of research products beyond traditional academic publications. Where relevant, we draw analogies between design principles and established practice in software development. The guidance provided here is not intended to be a strict rulebook; rather, the suggestions for practices and tools to advance reproducible, sound data-intensive analysis may furnish support for both students new to research and current researchers who are new to data-intensive work.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oLH_lynFcp4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Extensive amounts of multi-omics data and multiple cancer subtyping methods have been developed rapidly, and generate discrepant clustering results, which poses challenges for cancer molecular subtype research. Thus, the development of methods for the identification of cancer consensus molecular subtypes is essential. The lack of intuitive and easy-to-use analytical tools has posed a barrier. Here, we report on the development of the COnsensus Molecular SUbtype of Cancer (COMSUC) web server. With COMSUC, users can explore consensus molecular subtypes of more than 30 cancers based on eight clustering methods, five types of omics data from public reference datasets or users’ private data, and three consensus clustering methods. The web server provides interactive and modifiable visualization, and publishable output of analysis results. Researchers can also exchange consensus subtype results with collaborators via project IDs. COMSUC is now publicly and freely available with no login requirement at http://comsuc.bioinforai.tech/ (IP address: http://59.110.25.27/). For a video summary of this web server, see S1 Video and S1 File.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CmGaMFGa8QY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The interventions and outcomes in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are highly varied. The disease and the interventions both impose costs and harm on society. Some interventions with particularly high costs may only be implemented briefly. The design of optimal policy requires consideration of many intervention scenarios. In this paper we investigate the optimal timing of interventions that are not sustainable for a long period. Specifically, we look at at the impact of a single short-term non-repeated intervention (a “one-shot intervention”) on an epidemic and consider the impact of the intervention’s timing. To minimize the total number infected, the intervention should start close to the peak so that there is minimal rebound once the intervention is stopped. To minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, leading to initial reduction and then having a rebound to the same prevalence as the pre-intervention peak rather than one very large peak. To delay infections as much as possible (as might be appropriate if we expect improved interventions or treatments to be developed), earlier interventions have clear benefit. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each subcommunity separately.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3XSe9-HIZSg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Many initiatives have addressed the global need to upskill biologists in bioinformatics tools and techniques. Australia is not unique in its requirement for such training, but due to its large size and relatively small and geographically dispersed population, Australia faces specific challenges. A combined training approach was implemented by the authors to overcome these challenges. The “hybrid” method combines guidance from experienced trainers with the benefits of both webinar-style delivery and concurrent face-to-face hands-on practical exercises in classrooms. Since 2017, the hybrid method has been used to conduct 9 hands-on bioinformatics training sessions at international scale in which over 800 researchers have been trained in diverse topics on a range of software platforms. The method has become a key tool to ensure scalable and more equitable delivery of short-course bioinformatics training across Australia and can be easily adapted to other locations, topics, or settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JTKfdcHOEms&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Disease epidemic outbreaks on human metapopulation networks are often driven by a small number of superspreader nodes, which are primarily responsible for spreading the disease throughout the network. Superspreader nodes typically are characterized either by their locations within the network, by their degree of connectivity and centrality, or by their habitat suitability for the disease, described by their reproduction number (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;). Here we introduce a model that considers simultaneously the effects of network properties and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; on superspreaders, as opposed to previous research which considered each factor separately. This type of model is applicable to diseases for which habitat suitability varies by climate or land cover, and for direct transmitted diseases for which population density and mitigation practices influences &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. We present analytical models that quantify the superspreader capacity of a population node by two measures: probability-dependent superspreader capacity, the expected number of neighboring nodes to which the node in consideration will randomly spread the disease per epidemic generation, and time-dependent superspreader capacity, the rate at which the node spreads the disease to each of its neighbors. We validate our analytical models with a Monte Carlo analysis of repeated stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) simulations on randomly generated human population networks, and we use a random forest statistical model to relate superspreader risk to connectivity, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;, centrality, clustering, and diffusion. We demonstrate that either degree of connectivity or &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; above a certain threshold are sufficient conditions for a node to have a moderate superspreader risk factor, but both are necessary for a node to have a high-risk factor. The statistical model presented in this article can be used to predict the location of superspreader events in future epidemics, and to predict the effectiveness of mitigation strategies that seek to reduce the value of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;, alter host movements, or both.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rNQctTQRavE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Spatial expansion of a population of cells can arise from growth of microorganisms, plant cells, and mammalian cells. It underlies normal or dysfunctional tissue development, and it can be exploited as the foundation for programming spatial patterns. This expansion is often driven by continuous growth and division of cells within a colony, which in turn pushes the peripheral cells outward. This process generates a repulsion velocity field at each location within the colony. Here we show that this process can be approximated as coarse-grained repulsive-expansion kinetics. This framework enables accurate and efficient simulation of growth and gene expression dynamics in radially symmetric colonies with homogenous z-directional distribution. It is robust even if cells are not spherical and vary in size. The simplicity of the resulting mathematical framework also greatly facilitates generation of mechanistic insights.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S1mxnnhNbIg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We previously reported that rhesus monkeys recover spontaneous use of the more impaired (contralesional) hand following neurosurgical lesions to the arm/hand representations of primary motor cortex (M1) and lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) (F2 lesion) when tested for reduced use (RU) in a fine motor task allowing use of either hand. Recovery occurred without constraint of the less impaired hand and with occasional forced use of the more impaired hand, which was the preferred hand for use in fine motor tasks before the lesion. Here, we compared recovery of five F2 lesion cases in the same RU test to recovery after unilateral lesions of M1, LPMC, S1 and anterior portion of parietal cortex (F2P2 lesion – four cases). Average and highest %use of the contralesional hand in the RU task in F2 cases were twice that in F2P2 cases (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Recovery in the RU task was closely associated with volume and percentage of lesion to caudal (new) M1 (M1c) in both F2 and F2P2 lesion cases. One F2P2 case, with the largest M1c lesion and a large rostral somatosensory cortex (S1r) lesion developed severe contralesional hand non-use despite exhibiting some recovery of fine motor function initially. We conclude that the degree of reduced use of the contralesional hand is primarily related to the volume of M1c injury and that severe non-use requires extensive injury to M1c and S1r. Thus, assessing peri-Rolandic injury extent in stroke patients may have prognostic value for predicting susceptibility to RU and non-use in rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Dysfunction at synapses is thought to be an early change contributing to cognitive, psychiatric and motor disturbances in Huntington’s disease (HD). In neurons, mutant Huntingtin collects in aggregates and distributes to the same sites as wild-type Huntingtin including on membranes and in synapses. In this study, we investigated the biochemical integrity of synapses in HD mouse striatum. We performed subcellular fractionation of striatal tissue from 2 and 6-month old knock-in Q175/Q7 HD and Q7/Q7 mice. Compared to striata of Q7/Q7 mice, proteins including GLUT3, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase, NMDAR 2b, PSD95, and VGLUT1 had altered distribution in Q175/Q7 HD striata of 6-month old mice but not 2-month old mice. These proteins are found on plasma membranes and pre- and postsynaptic membranes supporting hypotheses that functional changes at synapses contribute to cognitive and behavioral symptoms of HD. Lipidomic analysis of mouse fractions indicated that compared to those of wild-type, fractions 1 and 2 of 6 months Q175/Q7 HD had altered levels of two species of PIP2, a phospholipid involved in synaptic signaling, increased levels of cholesterol ester and decreased cardiolipin species. At 2 months, increased levels of species of acylcarnitine, phosphatidic acid and sphingomyelin were measured. EM analysis showed that the contents of fractions 1 and 2 of Q7/Q7 and Q175/Q7 HD striata had a mix of isolated synaptic vesicles, vesicle filled axon terminals singly or in clusters, and ER and endosome-like membranes. However, those of Q175/Q7 striata contained significantly fewer and larger clumps of particles compared to those of Q7/Q7. Human HD postmortem putamen showed differences from control putamen in subcellular distribution of two proteins (Calnexin and GLUT3). Our biochemical, lipidomic and EM analysis show that the presence of the HD mutation conferred age dependent disruption of localization of synaptic proteins and lipids important for synaptic function. Our data demonstrate concrete biochemical changes suggesting altered integrity of synaptic compartments in HD mice that may mirror changes in HD patients and presage cognitive and psychiatric changes that occur in premanifest HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Based on early evidence of in vitro neurotoxicity following exposure to serum derived from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), several studies have attempted to explore whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from people with ALS could possess similar properties. Although initial findings proved inconclusive, it is now increasingly recognized that ALS-CSF may exert toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying CSF-induced neurodegeneration remains unclear. This review aims to summarize the 40-year long history of CSF toxicity studies in ALS, while discussing the various mechanisms that have been proposed, including glutamate excitotoxicity, proteotoxicity and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we consider the potential implications of a toxic CSF circulatory system in the pathophysiology of ALS, and also assess its significance in the context of current ALS research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Core spliceosome and related RNA-binding proteins aggregate in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain even in early asymptomatic stages (AsymAD) of disease. To assess the specificity of RNA-binding protein aggregation in AD, we developed a targeted mass spectrometry approach to quantify broad classes of RNA-binding proteins with other pathological proteins including tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) in detergent insoluble fractions from control, AsymAD, AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD) brain. Relative levels of specific insoluble RNA-binding proteins across different disease groups correlated with accumulation of Aβ and tau aggregates. RNA-binding proteins, including splicing factors with homology to the basic-acidic dipeptide repeats of U1-70K, preferentially aggregated in AsymAD and AD. In contrast, PD brain aggregates were relatively depleted of many RNA-binding proteins compared to AsymAD and AD groups. Correlation network analyses resolved 29 distinct modules of co-aggregating proteins including modules linked to spliceosome assembly, nuclear speckles and RNA splicing. Modules related to spliceosome assembly and nuclear speckles showed stage-specific enrichment of insoluble RBPs from AsymAD and AD brains, whereas the RNA splicing module was reduced specifically in PD. Collectively, this work identifies classes of RNA-binding proteins that distinctly co-aggregate in detergent-insoluble fractions across the specific neurodegenerative diseases we examined.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A majority of blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients experience persistent neurological dysfunction with no findings on conventional structural MR imaging. It is urgent to develop advanced imaging modalities to detect and understand the pathophysiology of blast-induced mTBI. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET) could detect neuronal function and activity of the injured brain, while MR spectroscopy provides complementary information and assesses metabolic irregularities following injury. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of combining &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET with MR spectroscopy to evaluate acute and subacute metabolic cerebral alterations caused by blast-induced mTBI. Thirty-two adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to a single blast (mTBI group) and 32 rats were not exposed to the blast (sham group), followed by &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET, MRI, and histological evaluation at baseline, 1–3 h, 1 day, and 7 days post-injury in three separate cohorts. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake showed a transient increase in the amygdala and somatosensory cortex, followed by a gradual return to baseline from day 1 to 7 days post-injury and a continuous rise in the motor cortex. In contrast, decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake was seen in the midbrain structures (inferior and superior colliculus). Analysis of MR spectroscopy showed that inflammation marker myo-inositol (Ins), oxidative stress marker glutamine + glutamate (Glx), and hypoxia marker lactate (Lac) levels markedly elevated over time in the somatosensory cortex, while the major osmolyte taurine (Tau) level immediately increased at 1–3 h and 1 day, and then returned to sham level on 7 days post-injury, which could be due to the disruption of the blood–brain barrier. Increased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake and elevated Ins and Glx levels over time were confirmed by histology analysis which showed increased microglial activation and gliosis in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET and MR spectroscopy can be used together to reflect more comprehensive neuropathological alterations in vivo, which could improve our understanding of the complex alterations in the brain after blast-induced mTBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;While often presented as promising assistive technologies for motor-impaired users, electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) remain barely used outside laboratories due to low reliability in real-life conditions. There is thus a need to design long-term reliable BCIs that can be used outside-of-the-lab by end-users, e.g., severely motor-impaired ones. Therefore, we propose and evaluate the design of a multi-class Mental Task (MT)-based BCI for longitudinal training (20 sessions over 3 months) of a tetraplegic user for the CYBATHLON BCI series 2019. In this BCI championship, tetraplegic pilots are mentally driving a virtual car in a racing video game. We aimed at combining a progressive user MT-BCI training with a newly designed machine learning pipeline based on adaptive Riemannian classifiers shown to be promising for real-life applications. We followed a two step training process: the first 11 sessions served to train the user to control a 2-class MT-BCI by performing either two cognitive tasks (REST and MENTAL SUBTRACTION) or two motor-imagery tasks (LEFT-HAND and RIGHT-HAND). The second training step (9 remaining sessions) applied an adaptive, session-independent Riemannian classifier that combined all 4 MT classes used before. Moreover, as our Riemannian classifier was incrementally updated in an unsupervised way it would capture both within and between-session non-stationarity. Experimental evidences confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Namely, the classification accuracy improved by about 30% at the end of the training compared to initial sessions. We also studied the neural correlates of this performance improvement. Using a newly proposed BCI user learning metric, we could show our user learned to improve his BCI control by producing EEG signals matching increasingly more the BCI classifier training data distribution, rather than by improving his EEG class discrimination. However, the resulting improvement was effective only on synchronous (cue-based) BCI and it did not translate into improved CYBATHLON BCI game performances. For the sake of overcoming this in the future, we unveil possible reasons for these limited gaming performances and identify a number of promising future research directions. Importantly, we also report on the evolution of the user's neurophysiological patterns and user experience throughout the BCI training and competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Due to the individual differences controlling brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the applicability and accuracy of BCIs based on motor imagery (MI-BCIs) are limited. To improve the performance of BCIs, this article examined the effect of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) on brain activity during MI. This article designed an experimental paradigm that combines tES and MI and examined the effects of tES based on the measurements of electroencephalogram (EEG) features in MI processing, including the power spectral density (PSD) and dynamic event-related desynchronization (ERD). Finally, we investigated the effect of tES on the accuracy of MI classification using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results showed that the ERD of the μ and β rhythms in the left-hand MI task was enhanced after electrical stimulation with a significant effect in the tDCS group. The average classification accuracy of the transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) group and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) group (88.19% and 89.93% respectively) were improved significantly compared to the pre-and pseudo stimulation groups. These findings indicated that tES can improve the performance and applicability of BCI and that tDCS was a potential approach in regulating brain activity and enhancing valid features during noninvasive MI-BCI processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Psychedelics have been recognized as model interventions for studying altered states of consciousness. However, few empirical studies of the shamanic state of consciousness, which is anecdotally similar to the psychedelic state, exist. We investigated the neural correlates of shamanic trance using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in 24 shamanic practitioners and 24 healthy controls during rest, shamanic drumming, and classical music listening, followed by an assessment of altered states of consciousness. EEG data were used to assess changes in absolute power, connectivity, signal diversity, and criticality, which were correlated with assessment measures. We also compared assessment scores to those of individuals in a previous study under the influence of psychedelics. Shamanic practitioners were significantly different from controls in several domains of altered states of consciousness, with scores comparable to or exceeding that of healthy volunteers under the influence of psychedelics. Practitioners also displayed increased gamma power during drumming that positively correlated with elementary visual alterations. Furthermore, shamanic practitioners had decreased low alpha and increased low beta connectivity during drumming and classical music and decreased neural signal diversity in the gamma band during drumming that inversely correlated with insightfulness. Finally, criticality in practitioners was increased during drumming in the low and high beta and gamma bands, with increases in the low beta band correlating with complex imagery and elementary visual alterations. These findings suggest that psychedelic drug-induced and non-pharmacologic alterations in consciousness have overlapping phenomenal traits but are distinct states of consciousness, as reflected by the unique brain-related changes during shamanic trance compared to previous literature investigating the psychedelic state.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: Studies of reactive and proactive modes of inhibitory control tend to show age-related declines and are accompanied by abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex. We explored which mode of inhibitory control would be more amenable to change and accrue greater benefits following engagement in a 4-week theater acting intervention in older adults. These gains were evaluated by performance on the AX-CPT task. We hypothesized that an increase in proactive control would relate to an increase in AY errors and a decrease in BX errors. In contrast, an increase in reactive control would be associated with a decrease in AY errors, no change in AY reaction time, and an increase in BX response time. Further, we posited that an increase in behavioral proactive control would accompany greater cue versus probe activity for previously identified regions in the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, an increase in behavioral reactive control would be accompanied by greater probe activation in these identified brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: The participants were 179 community-dwelling adults aged 60–89 years who were on average, college-educated. Participants were pseudo-randomly assigned to either an active-experiencing acting intervention condition (n = 93) or the active control condition (n = 86); participant assignment was subject to time of enrollment. Participants in both groups were trained by theater-actor researchers with expertise in acting interventions. In contrast to the active control participants who attended a course on theater acting, the acting-intervention group was required to consistently deploy proactive and reactive control mechanisms. Both groups met two times/week for 75-min for 4 weeks. Participant brain-behavioral performance on the AX-CPT task was evaluated prior to and after this four-week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: No intervention effects were found in favor of proactive control. Behavioral evidence in favor of reactive control was weak. Brain-related benefits to reactive control was illustrated by greater probe-activation in Brodmann areas 6 and 8, relative to controls and pre-intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We found some evidence for improvements in reactive control via brain measures, attributed to engagement in the acting intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Schizophrenia affects around 1% of the global population. Functional connectivity extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has previously been used to study schizophrenia and has great potential to provide novel insights into the disorder. Some studies have shown abnormal functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) of individuals with schizophrenia, and more recent studies have shown abnormal dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in individuals with schizophrenia. However, DMN dFC and the link between abnormal DMN dFC and symptom severity have not been well-characterized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Resting-state fMRI data from subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC) across two datasets were analyzed independently. We captured seven maximally independent subnodes in the DMN by applying group independent component analysis and estimated dFC between subnode time courses using a sliding window approach. A clustering method separated the dFCs into five reoccurring brain states. A feature selection method modeled the difference between SZs and HCs using the state-specific FC features. Finally, we used the transition probability of a hidden Markov model to characterize the link between symptom severity and dFC in SZ subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found decreases in the connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and increases in the connectivity between the precuneus (PCu) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (i.e., PCu/PCC) of SZ subjects. In SZ, the transition probability from a state with weaker PCu/PCC and stronger ACC connectivity to a state with stronger PCu/PCC and weaker ACC connectivity increased with symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate DMN dFC and its link to schizophrenia symptom severity. We identified reproducible neural states in a data-driven manner and demonstrated that the strength of connectivity within those states differed between SZs and HCs. Additionally, we identified a relationship between SZ symptom severity and the dynamics of DMN functional connectivity. We validated our results across two datasets. These results support the potential of dFC for use as a biomarker of schizophrenia and shed new light upon the relationship between schizophrenia and DMN dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: We aimed to examine the effects of repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation (rPNMS) on the excitability of the contralateral motor cortex and motor function of the upper limb in healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Forty-six healthy subjects were randomly assigned to either a repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation group (n = 23) or a sham group (n = 23). The repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation group received stimulation using magnetic pulses at 20 Hz, which were applied on the median nerve of the non-dominant hand, whereas the sham group underwent the same protocol without the stimulation output. The primary outcome was contralateral transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced corticomotor excitability for the abductor pollicis brevis of the stimulated hand in terms of resting motor threshold (rMT), the slope of recruitment curve, and peak amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP), which were measured at baseline and immediately after each session. The secondary outcomes were motor hand function including dexterity and grip strength of the non-dominant hand assessed at baseline, immediately after stimulation, and 24 h post-stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with the sham stimulation, repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation increased the peak motor evoked potential amplitude immediately after the intervention. The repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation also increased the slope of the recruitment curve immediately after intervention and enhanced hand dexterity after 24 h. However, the between-group difference for the changes was not significant. The significant changes in hand dexterity and peak amplitude of motor evoked potential after repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation were associated with their baseline value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation may modulate the corticomotor excitability together with a possible lasting improvement in hand dexterity, indicating that it might be helpful for clinical rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Primary dissociated neuronal cultures have become a standard model for studying central nervous system (CNS) development. Such cultures are predominantly prepared from the hippocampus or cortex of rodents (mice and rats), while other mammals are less used. Here, we describe the establishment and extensive characterization of the primary dissociated neuronal cultures derived from the cortex of the gray South American short-tailed opossums, Monodelphis domestica. Opossums are unique in their ability to fully regenerate their CNS after an injury during their early postnatal development. Thus, we used cortex of postnatal day (P) 3–5 opossum to establish long-surviving and nearly pure neuronal cultures, as well as mixed cultures composed of radial glia cells (RGCs) in which their neurogenic and gliogenic potential was confirmed. Both types of cultures can survive for more than 1 month in vitro. We also prepared neuronal cultures from the P16–18 opossum cortex, which were composed of astrocytes and microglia, in addition to neurons. The long-surviving opossum primary dissociated neuronal cultures represent a novel mammalian in vitro platform particularly useful to study CNS development and regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived organoids have become increasingly used systems allowing 3D-modeling of human organ development, and disease. They are also a reliable source of cells for transplantation in cell therapy and an excellent model to validate gene therapies. To make full use of these systems, a toolkit of genetic modification techniques is necessary to control their activity in line with the downstream application. We have previously described adeno-associated viruse (AAV) vectors for efficient targeting of cells within human retinal organoids. Here, we describe biological restriction and enhanced gene expression in cone cells of such organoids thanks to the use of a 1.7-kb L-opsin promoter. We illustrate the usefulness of implementing such a promoter to enhance the expression of the red-shifted opsin Jaws in fusion with a fluorescent reporter gene, enabling cell sorting to enrich the desired cell population. Increased Jaws expression after transplantation improved light responses promising better therapeutic outcomes in a cell therapy setting. Our results point to the importance of promoter activity in restricting, improving, and controlling the kinetics of transgene expression during the maturation of hiPSC retinal derivatives. Differentiation requires mechanisms to initiate specific transcriptional changes and to reinforce those changes when mature cell states are reached. By employing a cell-type-specific promoter we put transgene expression under the new transcriptional program of mature cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke has been reported to cause significant changes to memory, thinking, and behavior. Intriguingly, recently reported studies have indicated the association of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) with the acute phase of ischemic stroke. However, the comprehensive underlying mechanism remained unknown. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between TMAO and recovery of neurological function after ischemic stroke. For this purpose, a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model was established and treated with TMAO or/and sh-ALK5, followed by the neurological function evaluation. Behaviors of rats were observed through staircase and cylinder tests. Moreover, the expression of Smurf2 and ALK5 was detected by immunohistochemistry while expression of GFAP, Neurocan, and Phosphacan in brain tissues was determined by immunofluorescence. Thereafter, gain- and loss-of-function assays in astrocytes, the proliferation, viability, and migration were evaluated by the EdU, CCK-8, and Transwell assays. Besides, Smurf2 mRNA expression was determined by the RT-qPCR, whereas, Smurf2, ALK5, GFAP, Neurocan, and Phosphacan expression was evaluated by the Western blotting. Finally, the interaction of Smurf2 with ALK5 and ALK5 ubiquitination was assessed by the co-immunoprecipitation. Notably, our results showed that TMAO promoted the proliferation of reactive astrocyte and formation of glial scar in MCAO/R rats. However, this effect was abolished by the Smurf2 overexpression or ALK5 silencing. We further found that TMAO upregulated the ALK5 expression by inhibiting the ubiquitination role of Smurf2. Overexpression of ALK5 reversed the inhibitory effect of Smurf2 on astrocyte proliferation, migration, and viability. Collectively, our work identifies the evolutionarily TMAO/Smurf2/ALK5 signaling as a major genetic factor in the control of reactive astrocyte proliferation and glial scar formation in ischemic stroke, thus laying a theoretical foundation for the identification of ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Telencephalic cognitive and emotional circuits/functions are strongly modulated by subcortical inputs. The main focus of past research on the nature of this modulation has been on the widespread monoamine projections to the telencephalon. However, the nucleus incertus (NI) of the pontine tegmentum provides a strong GABAergic and peptidergic innervation of the hippocampus, basal forebrain, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and related regions; and represents a parallel source of ascending modulation of cognitive and emotional domains. NI GABAergic neurons express multiple peptides, including neuromedin-B, cholecystokinin, and relaxin-3, and receptors for stress and arousal transmitters, including corticotrophin-releasing factor and orexins/hypocretins. A functional relationship exists between NI neurons and their associated peptides, relaxin-3 and neuromedin-B, and hippocampal theta rhythm, which in turn, has a key role in the acquisition and extinction of declarative and emotional memories. Furthermore, RXFP3, the cognate receptor for relaxin-3, is a G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; protein-coupled receptor, and its activation inhibits the cellular accumulation of cAMP and induces phosphorylation of ERK, processes associated with memory formation in the hippocampus and amygdala. Therefore, this review summarizes the role of NI transmitter systems in relaying stress- and arousal-related signals to the higher neural circuits and processes associated with memory formation and retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Brain iron deposition, low hemoglobin (HGB), and increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) have been implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the association among them in PD is poorly studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To explore the association of the level of HO-1 with brain iron deposition and low level of HGB in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 32 patients with PD and 26 controls were recruited for this study. C57BL/6 male mice were used in generating 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced chronic PD model. The Levels of serum HO-1 and HGB of human subjects and mice were assayed by ELISA, blood routine test, respectively. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used to quantitatively analyze brain iron deposition in human subjects and mice. HO-1 inhibitor (Sn-protoporphyrin, SnPP) was used to suppress the function and expression of HO-1 in PD mice. Correlations between the concentration of serum HO-1 and iron deposition of the region of interests (ROIs), levels of HGB, between the three factors mentioned above, and scores of clinical scales were explored in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: This study revealed significant elevation of the serum HO-1 concentration, iron deposition within bilateral substantial nigra (SN), red nucleus (RN), and putamen (PUT) and decrease of HGB level in PD patients. There was a significantly positive correlation between the serum HO-1 concentration and iron deposition within SN, an inverse correlation between the serum HO-1 concentration and HGB level in PD patients. A significant increase in HO-1 expression of serum and iron deposition in SN was also observed in the PD mouse model, and the SnPP could significantly reduce iron deposition in the SN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The high level of HO-1 may be the common mechanism of iron deposition and low HGB in PD. Therefore, the findings presented in this study indicate that HO-1 correlates with brain iron deposition and anemia in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, affecting a significant part of the population. The majority of AD cases occur in the elderly with a typical age of onset of the disease above 65 years. AD presents a major burden for the healthcare system and since population is rapidly aging, the burden of the disease will increase in the future. However, no effective drug treatment for a full-blown disease has been developed to date. The genetic background of AD is extensively studied; numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified significant genes associated with increased risk of AD development. This review summarizes more than 100 risk loci. Many of them may serve as biomarkers of AD progression, even in the preclinical stage of the disease. Furthermore, we used GWAS data to identify key pathways of AD pathogenesis: cellular processes, metabolic processes, biological regulation, localization, transport, regulation of cellular processes, and neurological system processes. Gene clustering into molecular pathways can provide background for identification of novel molecular targets and may support the development of tailored and personalized treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: White matter hyperintensities (WMH)s is a very common neuroradiological manifestation in the elderly and is an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline. As we all know, the thalamocortical circuit plays an important part in cognition regulation. However, the role of this circuit in WMHs and its related cognitive deficits is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Eighty WMH patients and 37 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in the current study. WMH patients were divided into a mild WMH group (n = 33) and moderate-severe WMH group (n = 47) according to Fazekas scores. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of all participants were collected for thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The analysis was performed in two steps. First, the whole cerebral cortex was divided into six regions of interest (ROIs), which were used as seeds to investigate the changes of FC with the thalamus. Then, the subregion of the thalamus generated in the previous step was used as the seed for FC analysis with the whole brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the first step of FC analysis, it was found that precentral gyrus (PrCG)-interthalamic adhesion (ITA) FC values in moderate-severe WMH group were higher than those in HC and mild WMH groups. However, when compared with the HC group, the increase of PrCG-ITA FC values in mild WMH group was not statistically significant. In the second step of FC analysis, the ITA was set as the seed, and compared with the HC group, the results showed that the FC values of the ITA-medial frontal gyrus (MFG) in mild group and moderate-severe WMH groups were significantly increased. In addition, the FC values in moderate-severe group were significantly higher than those in mild group. Finally, it was also found that FC values (PrCG-ITA and ITA-MFG) were significantly correlated with neuropsychological test results for multiple cognitive functions such as memory, execution and attention in WMH patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Abnormal thalamocortical FC was closely related with cognitive impairments in WMH patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Can metastatic-primary (M-P) genomic divergence measured from next generation sequencing reveal the natural history of metastatic dissemination? This remains an open question of utmost importance in facilitating a deeper understanding of metastatic progression, and thereby, improving its prevention. Here, we utilize mathematical and computational modeling to tackle this question as well as to provide a framework that illuminates the fundamental elements and evolutionary determinants of M-P divergence. Our framework facilitates the integration of sequencing detectability of somatic variants, and hence, paves the way towards bridging the measurable between-tumor heterogeneity with analytical modeling and interpretability. We show that the number of somatic variants of the metastatic seeding cell that are experimentally undetectable in the primary tumor, can be characterized as the path of the phylogenetic tree from the last appearing variant of the seeding cell back to the most recent detectable variant. We find that the expected length of this path is principally determined by the decay in detectability of the variants along the seeding cell’s lineage; and thus, exhibits a significant dependence on the underlying tumor growth dynamics. A striking implication of this fact, is that dissemination from an advanced detectable subclone of the primary tumor can lead to an abrupt drop in the expected measurable M-P divergence, thereby breaking the previously assumed monotonic relation between seeding time and M-P divergence. This is emphatically verified by our single cell-based spatial tumor growth simulation, where we find that M-P divergence exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with seeding time when the primary tumor grows under branched and linear evolution. On the other hand, a monotonic relationship holds when we condition on the dynamics of progressive diversification, or by restricting the seeding cells to always originate from undetectable subclones. Our results highlight the fact that a precise understanding of tumor growth dynamics is the &lt;i&gt;sine qua non&lt;/i&gt; for exploiting M-P divergence to reconstruct the chronology of metastatic dissemination. The quantitative models presented here enable further careful evaluation of M-P divergence in association with crucial evolutionary and sequencing parameters.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KCi63x9YhZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

During development, neurons arrive at local brain areas in an extended period of time, but how they form local neural circuits is unknown. Here we computationally model the emergence of a network for precise timing in the premotor nucleus HVC in songbird. We show that new projection neurons, added to HVC post hatch at early stages of song development, are recruited to the end of a growing feedforward network. High spontaneous activity of the new neurons makes them the prime targets for recruitment in a self-organized process via synaptic plasticity. Once recruited, the new neurons fire readily at precise times, and they become mature. Neurons that are not recruited become silent and replaced by new immature neurons. Our model incorporates realistic HVC features such as interneurons, spatial distributions of neurons, and distributed axonal delays. The model predicts that the birth order of the projection neurons correlates with their burst timing during the song.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wh94un-bhFs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Amphipathic helices have hydrophobic and hydrophilic/charged residues situated on oppo site faces of the helix. They can anchor peripheral membrane proteins to the membrane, be attached to integral membrane proteins, or exist as independent peptides. Despite the widespread presence of membrane-interacting amphipathic helices, there is no computational tool within Rosetta to model their interactions with membranes. In order to address this need, we developed the AmphiScan protocol with PyRosetta, which runs a grid search to find the most favorable position of an amphipathic helix with respect to the membrane. The performance of the algorithm was tested in benchmarks with the &lt;i&gt;RosettaMembrane&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ref2015_memb&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;franklin2019&lt;/i&gt; score functions on six engineered and 44 naturally-occurring amphipathic helices using membrane coordinates from the OPM and PDBTM databases, OREMPRO server, and MD simulations for comparison. The AmphiScan protocol predicted the coordinates of amphipathic helices within less than 3Å of the reference structures and identified membrane-embedded residues with a Matthews Correlation Constant (MCC) of up to 0.57. Overall, AmphiScan stands as fast, accurate, and highly-customizable protocol that can be pipelined with other Rosetta and Python applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hO5eyyEVK1E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Thrombosis is a recognized complication of Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) illness and is often associated with poor prognosis. There is a well-recognized link between coagulation and inflammation, however, the extent of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 warrants further investigation. Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms, by which some of these variants may contribute to disease, are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mvXf7WFaEoI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Non-human primates infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit mild clinical signs. Here we used a mathematical model to characterize in detail the viral dynamics in 31 cynomolgus macaques for which nasopharyngeal and tracheal viral load were frequently assessed. We identified that infected cells had a large burst size (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; virus) and a within-host reproductive basic number of approximately 6 and 4 in nasopharyngeal and tracheal compartment, respectively. After peak viral load, infected cells were rapidly lost with a half-life of 9 hours, with no significant association between cytokine elevation and clearance, leading to a median time to viral clearance of 10 days, consistent with observations in mild human infections. Given these parameter estimates, we predict that a prophylactic treatment blocking 90% of viral production or viral infection could prevent viral growth. In conclusion, our results provide estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetic parameters in an experimental model of mild infection and they provide means to assess the efficacy of future antiviral treatments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/623KOQ6xXik&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

There are currently limited Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Enhanced understanding of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To provide insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host–viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures over a time course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target at the onset of infection, which we confirmed by electron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Over the course of infection, the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) and interleukin (IL)-6 but not IL-1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both infected and bystander cells. This provides a detailed characterization of genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human airway.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/atRd_kJRPv8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Using genetic deletion in mice, we demonstrate that extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 5 (Erk5) plays important roles in central sensitization in formalin‐induced inflammatory pain. Extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 2 and Erk5 are involved in discrete but parallel mechanisms underlying central sensitization in the early second phase of formalin‐induced nociceptive behaviors. 

Abstract
Nervous systems are designed to become extra sensitive to afferent nociceptive stimuli under certain circumstances such as inflammation and nerve injury. How pain hypersensitivity comes about is key issue in the field since it ultimately results in chronic pain. Central sensitization represents enhanced pain sensitivity due to increased neural signaling within the central nervous system (CNS). Particularly, much evidence indicates that underlying mechanism of central sensitization is associated with the change of spinal neurons. Extracellular signal‐regulated kinases have received attention as key molecules in central sensitization. Previously, we revealed the isoform‐specific function of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 2 (Erk2) in spinal neurons for central sensitization using mice with Cre‐loxP‐mediated deletion of Erk2 in the CNS. Still, how extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 5 (Erk5) in spinal neurons contributes to central sensitization has not been directly tested, nor is the functional relevance of Erk5 and Erk2 known. Here, we show that Erk5 and Erk2 in the CNS play redundant and/or distinct roles in central sensitization, depending on the plasticity context (cell types, pain types, time, etc.). We used male mice with Erk5 deletion specifically in the CNS and found that Erk5 plays important roles in central sensitization in a formalin‐induced inflammatory pain model. Deletion of both Erk2 and Erk5 leads to greater attenuation of central sensitization in this model, compared to deletion of either isoform alone. Conversely, Erk2 but not Erk5 plays important roles in central sensitization in neuropathic pain, a type of chronic pain caused by nerve damage. Our results suggest the elaborate mechanisms of Erk signaling in central sensitization.</content>

 We demonstrate a critical role for ERK signaling in microglia in Alzheimer’s disease using a preclinical model of Alzheimer’s disease pathology and quantitative studies of postmortem human brains.

Abstract
The importance of mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling in regulating microglia‐mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. We examined the role of MAPK signaling in microglia using a preclinical model of AD pathology and quantitative proteomics studies of postmortem human brains. In multiplex immunoassay analyses of MAPK phosphoproteins in acutely isolated microglia and brain tissue from 5xFAD mice, we found phosphorylated extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) was the most strongly upregulated phosphoprotein within the MAPK pathway in acutely isolated microglia, but not whole‐brain tissue from 5xFAD mice. The importance of ERK signaling in primary microglia cultures was next investigated using transcriptomic profiling and functional assays of amyloid‐β and neuronal phagocytosis, which confirmed that ERK is a critical regulator of IFNγ‐mediated pro‐inflammatory activation of microglia, although it was also partly important for constitutive microglial functions. Phospho‐ERK was an upstream regulator of disease‐associated microglial gene expression (Trem2, Tyrobp), as well as several human AD risk genes (Bin1, Cd33, Trem2, Cnn2), indicative of the importance of microglial ERK signaling in AD pathology. Quantitative proteomic analyses of postmortem human brain showed that ERK1 and ERK2 were the only MAPK proteins with increased protein expression and positive associations with neuropathological grade. In a human brain phosphoproteomic study, we found evidence for increased flux through the ERK signaling pathway in AD. Overall, our analyses strongly suggest that ERK phosphorylation, particularly in microglia in mouse models, is a regulator of pro‐inflammatory immune responses in AD pathogenesis.</content>

 In normal rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) overlap with callosal patches in V1. ODCs (a) and callosal patches (c) are present by postnatal day 10 (P10). In rats monocularly enucleated (ME) at P10 and perfused before the onset of the critical period (~P20), ODCs desegregate in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye (b), whereas callosal patches do not desegregate in this hemisphere (d).







Abstract
In Long Evans rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in V1 overlap with patches of callosal connections. Using anatomical tracers, we found that ODCs and callosal patches are present at postnatal day 10 (P10), several days before eye opening, and about 10 days before the activation of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (~P20). In rats monocularly enucleated at P10 and perfused ~P20, ODCs ipsilateral to the remaining eye desegregated, indicating that rat ODCs are highly susceptible to monocular enucleation during a precritical period. Monocular enucleation during the critical period exerted significant, although smaller, effects. Monocular eye lid suture during the critical period led to a significant expansion of the ipsilateral projection from the nondeprived eye, whereas the contralateral projection invaded into, and intermixed with, ipsilateral ODCs innervated by the deprived eye. We propose that this intermixing allows callosal connections to contribute to the effects of monocular deprivation assessed in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the nondeprived eye. The ipsilateral and contralateral projections from the deprived eye did not undergo significant shrinkage. In contrast, we found that callosal patches are less susceptible to imbalance of eye input. In rats monocularly enucleated during either the precritical or critical periods, callosal patches were maintained in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye, but desegregated in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the enucleated orbit. Callosal patches were maintained in rats binocularly enucleated at P10 or later. Similarly, monocular deprivation during the critical period had no significant effect on callosal patches in either hemisphere.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the most widely distributed and abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a class of diseases with a slow onset, progressive progression, and poor prognosis. Common clinical NDDs include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington’s disease (HD). Although these diseases have different etiologies, they are all associated with neuronal loss and pathological dysfunction. Accumulating evidence indicates that neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, and toxic metabolites that are produced and released by activated astrocytes affect and regulate the function of neurons at the receptor, ion channel, antigen transfer, and gene transcription levels in the pathogenesis of NDDs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding RNAs that play a wide range of biological roles by regulating the transcription and post-transcriptional translation of target mRNAs to induce target gene expression and silencing. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs participate in the pathogenesis of NDDs by regulating astrocyte function through different mechanisms and may be potential targets for the treatment of NDDs. Here, we review studies of the role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of NDDs and discuss possible mechanisms of miRNAs in the regulation of astrocyte function, suggesting that miRNAs may be targeted as a novel approach for the treatment of NDDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Vision and hearing disorders comprise the most common sensory disorders found in people. Many forms of vision and hearing loss are inherited and current treatments only provide patients with temporary or partial relief. As a result, developing genetic therapies for any of the several hundred known causative genes underlying inherited retinal and cochlear disorders has been of great interest. Recent exciting advances in gene therapy have shown promise for the clinical treatment of inherited retinal diseases, and while clinical gene therapies for cochlear disease are not yet available, research in the last several years has resulted in significant advancement in preclinical development for gene delivery to the cochlea. Furthermore, the development of somatic targeted genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 has brought new possibilities for the treatment of dominant or gain-of-function disease. Here we discuss the current state of gene therapy for inherited diseases of the retina and cochlea with an eye toward areas that still need additional development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is mainly manifested as insidious onset, chronic progressive cognitive decline and non-cognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, which seriously affects the quality of life of the elderly and causes a very large burden on society and families. This paper uses graph theory to analyze the constructed brain network, and extracts the node degree, node efficiency, and node betweenness centrality parameters of the two modal brain networks. The T test method is used to analyze the difference of graph theory parameters between normal people and AD patients, and brain regions with significant differences in graph theory parameters are selected as brain network features. By analyzing the calculation principles of the conventional convolutional layer and the depth separable convolution unit, the computational complexity of them is compared. The depth separable convolution unit decomposes the traditional convolution process into spatial convolution for feature extraction and point convolution for feature combination, which greatly reduces the number of multiplication and addition operations in the convolution process, while still being able to obtain comparisons. Aiming at the special convolution structure of the depth separable convolution unit, this paper proposes a channel pruning method based on the convolution structure and explains its pruning process. Multimodal neuroimaging can provide complete information for the quantification of Alzheimer’s disease. This paper proposes a cascaded three-dimensional neural network framework based on single-modal and multi-modal images, using MRI and PET images to distinguish AD and MCI from normal samples. Multiple three-dimensional CNN networks are used to extract recognizable information in local image blocks. The high-level two-dimensional CNN network fuses multi-modal features and selects the features of discriminative regions to perform quantitative predictions on samples. The algorithm proposed in this paper can automatically extract and fuse the features of multi-modality and multi-regions layer by layer, and the visual analysis results show that the abnormally changed regions affected by Alzheimer’s disease provide important information for clinical quantification.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The human brain grows the most dramatically during the perinatal and early post-natal periods, during which pre-term birth or perinatal injury that may alter brain structure and lead to developmental anomalies. Thus, characterizing cortical thickness of developing brains remains an important goal. However, this task is often complicated by inaccurate cortical surface extraction due to small-size brains. Here, we propose a novel complex framework for the reconstruction of neonatal WM and pial surfaces, accounting for large partial volumes due to small-size brains. The proposed approach relies only on T1-weighted images unlike previous T2-weighted image-based approaches while only T1-weighted images are sometimes available under the different clinical/research setting. Deep neural networks are first introduced to the neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pipeline to address the mis-segmentation of brain tissues. Furthermore, this pipeline enhances cortical boundary delineation using combined models of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/GM boundary detection with edge gradient information and a new skeletonization of sulcal folding where no CSF voxels are seen due to the limited resolution. We also proposed a systematic evaluation using three independent datasets comprising 736 pre-term and 97 term neonates. Qualitative assessment for reconstructed cortical surfaces shows that 86.9% are rated as accurate across the three site datasets. In addition, our landmark-based evaluation shows that the mean displacement of the cortical surfaces from the true boundaries was less than a voxel size (0.532 ± 0.035 mm). Evaluating the proposed pipeline (namely NEOCIVET 2.0) shows the robustness and reproducibility across different sites and different age-groups. The mean cortical thickness measured positively correlated with post-menstrual age (PMA) at scan (p &amp;lt; 0.0001); Cingulate cortical areas grew the most rapidly whereas the inferior temporal cortex grew the least rapidly. The range of the cortical thickness measured was biologically congruent (1.3 mm at 28 weeks of PMA to 1.8 mm at term equivalent). Cortical thickness measured on T1 MRI using NEOCIVET 2.0 was compared with that on T2 using the established dHCP pipeline. It was difficult to conclude that either T1 or T2 imaging is more ideal to construct cortical surfaces. NEOCIVET 2.0 has been open to the public through CBRAIN (https://mcin-cnim.ca/technology/cbrain/), a web-based platform for processing brain imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a clinical syndrome with complex biological determinants, but which in most cases is characterized by TDP-43 pathology. The identification in CSF of a protein signature of TDP-43 network dysfunction would have the potential to inform the identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We compared CSF proteomic data from patients with ALS (n = 41), Parkinson’s disease (n = 19) and healthy control participants (n = 20). Weighted correlation network analysis was used to identify modules within the CSF protein network and combined with gene ontology enrichment analysis to functionally annotate module proteins. Analysis of module eigenproteins and differential correlation analysis of the CSF protein network was used to compare ALS and Parkinson’s disease protein co-correlation with healthy controls. In order to monitor temporal changes in the CSF proteome, we performed longitudinal analysis of the CSF proteome in a subset of ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Weighted correlation network analysis identified 10 modules, including those enriched for terms involved in gene expression including nucleic acid binding, RNA metabolism and translation; humoral immune system function, including complement pathways; membrane proteins, axonal outgrowth and adherence; and glutamatergic synapses. Immune system module eigenproteins were increased in ALS, whilst axonal module eigenproteins were decreased in ALS. The 19 altered protein correlations in ALS were enriched for gene expression (OR 3.05, p = 0.017) and membrane protein modules (OR 17.48, p = 0.011), including intramodular hub proteins previously identified as TDP-43 interactors. Proteins decreasing over longitudinal analysis ALS were enriched in glutamatergic synapse and axonal outgrowth modules. Protein correlation network disruptions in Parkinson’s disease showed no module enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the co-correlation network in CSF samples identified a set of pathways known to be associated with TDP-43 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ALS, with important implications for therapeutic targeting and biomarker development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The assessment of three-dimensional (3D) brain cytoarchitecture at a cellular resolution remains a great challenge in the field of neuroscience and constant development of imaging techniques has become crucial, particularly when it comes to offering direct and clear obtention of data from macro to nano scales. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electron or optical microscopy, although valuable, still face some issues such as the lack of contrast and extensive sample preparation protocols. In this context, x-ray microtomography (μCT) has become a promising non-destructive tool for imaging a broad range of samples, from dense materials to soft biological specimens. It is a new supplemental method to be explored for deciphering the cytoarchitecture and connectivity of the brain. This review aims to bring together published works using x-ray μCT in neurobiology in order to discuss the achievements made so far and the future of this technique for neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging non-invasive neuromodulation technique for focal epilepsy. Because epilepsy is a disease affecting the brain network, our study was aimed to evaluate and predict the treatment outcome of cathodal tDCS (ctDCS) by analyzing the ctDCS-induced functional network alterations.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Either the active 5-day, −1.0 mA, 20-min ctDCS or sham ctDCS targeting at the most active interictal epileptiform discharge regions was applied to 27 subjects suffering from focal epilepsy. The functional networks before and after ctDCS were compared employing graph theoretical analysis based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. A support vector machine (SVM) prediction model was built to predict the treatment outcome of ctDCS using the graph theoretical measures as markers.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that the mean clustering coefficient and the global efficiency decreased significantly, as well as the characteristic path length and the mean shortest path length at the stimulation sites in the fMRI functional networks increased significantly after ctDCS only for the patients with response to the active ctDCS (at least 20% reduction rate of seizure frequency). Our prediction model achieved the mean prediction accuracy of 68.3% (mean sensitivity: 70.0%; mean specificity: 67.5%) after the nested cross validation. The mean area under the receiver operating curve was 0.75, which showed good prediction performance.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrated that the response to ctDCS was related to the topological alterations in the functional networks of epilepsy patients detected by fMRI. The graph theoretical measures were promising for clinical prediction of ctDCS treatment outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We investigated spectral resting-state EEG in persons with chronic stroke-induced aphasia to determine its reliability, sensitivity, and relationship to functional behaviors. Resting-state EEG has not yet been characterized in this population and was selected given the demonstrated potential of resting-state investigations using other neuroimaging techniques to guide clinical decision-making. Controls and persons with chronic stroke-induced aphasia completed two EEG recording sessions, separated by approximately 1 month, as well as behavioral assessments of language, sensorimotor, and cognitive domains. Power in the classic frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) was examined via spectral analysis of resting-state EEG data. Results suggest that power in the theta, alpha, and beta bands is reliable for use as a repeated measure. Significantly greater theta and lower beta power was observed in persons with aphasia (PWAs) than controls. Finally, in PWAs theta power negatively correlated with performance on a discourse informativeness measure, while alpha and beta power positively correlated with performance on the same measure. This indicates that spectral rsEEG slowing observed in PWAs in the chronic stage is pathological and suggests a possible avenue for directly altering brain activation to improve behavioral function. Taken together, these results suggest that spectral resting-state EEG holds promise for sensitive measurement of functioning and change in persons with chronic aphasia. Future studies investigating the utility of these measures as biomarkers of frank or latent aphasic deficits and treatment response in chronic stroke-induced aphasia are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We investigated if emotion regulation can be improved through self-regulation training on non-emotional brain regions, as well as how to change the brain networks implicated in this process. During the training period, the participants were instructed to up-regulate their right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) activity according to real-time functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neurofeedback signals, and there was no emotional element. The results showed that the training significantly increased emotion regulation, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the emotion regulation network (ERN) and frontoparietal network (FPN), and rsFC between the ERN and amygdala; however, training did not influence the rsFC between the FPN and the amygdala. However, self-regulation training on rDLPFC significantly improved emotion regulation and generally increased the rsFCs within the networks; the rsFC between the ERN and amygdala was also selectively increased. The present study also described a safe approach that may improve emotion regulation through self-regulation training on non-emotional brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;More than 6 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the incidence is growing rapidly with our aging population. Numerous therapeutics have failed to make it to the clinic, potentially due to a focus on presumptive pathogenic proteins instead of cell-type-specific signaling mechanisms. The tau propagation hypothesis that inter-neuronal tau transfer drives AD pathology has recently garnered attention, as accumulation of pathological tau in the brain has high clinical significance in correlating with progression of cognitive AD symptoms. However, studies on tau pathology in AD are classically neuron-centric and have greatly overlooked cell-type specific effects of tau internalization, degradation, and propagation. While the contribution of microglia to tau processing and propagation is beginning to be recognized and understood, astrocytes, glial cells in the brain important for maintaining neuronal metabolic, synaptic, trophic, and immune function which can produce, internalize, degrade, and propagate tau are understudied in their ability to affect AD progression through tau pathology. Here, we showcase evidence for whether tau uptake by astrocytes may be beneficial or detrimental to neuronal health and how astrocytes and their immunometabolic functions may be key targets for future successful AD therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Chronic stress appears to alter DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in brain regions related to emotion. Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) mediates the development of depression by regulating microtubule dynamics. In this study, rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). At the end of the CUMS procedure, normal saline or fluoxetine was administered to the rats. Moreover, normal saline or the 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza) was administered to the hippocampal CA1 region of the rats. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the depressive-like phenotypes. The CRMP2 DNA methylation levels and cytoskeletal microtubular system-related biomarkers were detected by several molecular biology techniques. The results showed that the rat model of depression was successfully established by exposure to CUMS, and fluoxetine treatment exerted an antidepressant-like effect. We observed the upregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3a in the hippocampus of stressed rats. CUMS induced a decrease in CRMP2 expression and an increase in phosphorylated CRMP2 (pCRMP2) expression in the hippocampus of rats. The rate of DNA methylation in the CpG island of the CRMP2 promoter region in the hippocampus of stressed rats was significantly higher than that in control rats. Moreover, CUMS significantly decreased the interaction between CRMP2 and α-tubulin and decreased the microtubule dynamics. Chronic fluoxetine treatment reversed these changes. Also, hypomethylation induced by 5-aza injection into the hippocampal CA1 region caused antidepressant-like effects and increased CRMP2 expression and microtubule dynamics. These results suggested that CRMP2 DNA methylation may be involved in regulating the cytoskeletal microtubular system and mediating depressive-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the MPV17 gene are associated with hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. The mechanisms through which MPV17 mutations cause respiratory chain dysfunction and mtDNA depletion is still unclear. The MPV17 gene encodes an inner membrane mitochondrial protein that was recently described to function as a non-selective channel. Although its exact function is unknown, it is thought to be important in the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). To obtain more information about the role of MPV17 in human disease, we investigated the effect of MPV17 knockdown and of selected known MPV17 mutations associated with MPV17 disease in vitro. We used different approaches in order to evaluate the cellular consequences of MPV17 deficiency. We found that lower levels of MPV17 were associated with impaired mitochondrial respiration and with a quiescent energetic metabolic profile. All the mutations studied destabilized the protein, resulting in reduced protein levels. We also demonstrated that different mutations caused different cellular abnormalities, including increased ROS production, decreased oxygen consumption, loss of ΔΨm, and mislocalization of MPV17 protein. Our study provides novel insight into the molecular effects of MPV17 mutations and opens novel possibilities for testing therapeutic strategies for a devastating group of disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The entopeduncular nucleus is one of the basal ganglia's output nuclei, thereby controlling basal ganglia information processing. Entopeduncular nucleus neurons integrate GABAergic inputs from the Striatum and the globus pallidus, together with glutamatergic inputs from the subthalamic nucleus. We show that endocannabinoids and dopamine interact to modulate the long-term plasticity of all these primary afferents to the entopeduncular nucleus. Our results suggest that the interplay between dopamine and endocannabinoids determines the balance between direct pathway (striatum) and indirect pathway (globus pallidus) in entopeduncular nucleus output. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, despite the lack of axon collaterals, information is transferred between neighboring neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus via endocannabinoid diffusion. These results transform the prevailing view of the entopeduncular nucleus as a feedforward “relay” nucleus to an intricate control unit, which may play a vital role in the process of action selection.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human stem cell derived brain organoids are increasingly gaining attention as an ideal model system for investigating neurological diseases, particularly those that involve myelination defects. However, current protocols for generating brain organoids with sufficiently mature oligodendrocytes that deposit myelin on endogenously produced neurons are lengthy and complicated. Taking advantage of a human pluripotent stem cell line that reports on SOX10 expression, we developed a protocol that involves a 42 day exposure of neuroectoderm-derived organoids to a cocktail of growth factors and small molecules that collectively foster oligodendrocyte specification and survival. Importantly, the resulting day 42 brain organoids contain both myelinating oligodendrocytes, cortical neuronal cells and astrocytes. These oligodendrocyte brain organoids therefore constitute a valuable and tractable platform for functional neurogenomics and drug screening for white matter diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system, myelin is attached to the axon in the paranodal region by a trimolecular complex of Neurofascin155 (NF155) in the myelin membrane, interacting with Caspr1 and Contactin1 on the axolemma. Alternative splicing of a single Neurofascin transcript generates several different Neurofascins expressed by several cell types, but NF155, which is expressed by oligodendrocytes, contains a domain in the third fibronectinIII-like region of the molecule that is unique. The immunoglobulin 5–6 domain of NF155 is essential for binding to Contactin1, but less is known about the functions of the NF155-unique third fibronectinIII-like domain. Mutations and autoantibodies to this region are associated with several neurodevelopmental and demyelinating nervous system disorders. Here we used Crispr-Cas9 gene editing to delete a 9 bp sequence of NF155 in this unique domain, which has recently been identified as a thrombin binding site and implicated in plasticity of the myelin sheath. This small deletion results in dysmyelination, eversion of paranodal loops of myelin, substantial enlargement of the nodal gap, a complete loss of paranodal septate junctions, and mislocalization of Caspr1 and nodal sodium channels. The animals exhibit tremor and ataxia, and biochemical and mass spectrometric analysis indicates that while NF155 is transcribed and spliced normally, the NF155 protein is subsequently degraded, resulting in loss of the full length 155 kDa native protein. These findings reveal that this 9 bp region of NF155 in its unique third fibronectinIII-like domain is essential for stability of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Abnormal α-Synuclein (α-SYN) aggregates are the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease (PD), which may affect dopamine (DA) neuron function and DA metabolism. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is an enzyme located on the outer mitochondrial membrane that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of DA. Both α-SYN and MAOA are associated with PD pathogenesis, suggesting possible crosstalk between these two molecules. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential impacts of α-SYN on MAOA function and further explore the underlying mechanisms. Our study showed that overexpression of α-SYN [both wild-type (WT) and A53T] increased MAOA function via upregulating its expression without impacting MAOA stability. Overexpression of α-SYN&lt;sup&gt;WT&lt;/sup&gt; or α-SYN&lt;sup&gt;A53T&lt;/sup&gt; enhanced the transcription activity of the MAOA promoter region containing the binding sites of cell division cycle associated 7 like (R1, a transcriptional repressor of MAOA) and trans-acting transcription factor 1 (Sp1, a transcription factor of MAOA). Interestingly, α-SYN selectively increased Sp1 expression, thereby enhancing the binding capacity of Sp1 with MAOA promoter to increase MAOA expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that α-SYN can upregulate MAOA expression via modulation of Sp1 and may shed light on future studies of α-SYN associated PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A correlation between the abnormal cerebral glucose metabolism and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been found in previous studies, suggesting that glucose alterations may be used to predict the histopathological diagnosis in AD. In this study, we investigated the dynamic changes of cerebral glucose uptake in vivo using MR glucose chemical exchange saturation transfer (glucoCEST) imaging in a rat model of AD with an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of amyloid Aβ-protein (25–35), confirmed by Morris water maze and Nissl staining. In total, 6 rats in the AD group and 6 rats in the control group that were given an injection of sterile normal saline were included. At 28 days after injection, all rats performed a 7.0 T MR exanimation, including glucoCEST, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and hippocampus magnetic resonance spectra (MRS), to detect the possible metabolic and structural changes in the rat brain. A significantly elevated brain glucoCEST signal in the brain of AD rats was observed, and a decreased brain glucose uptake was also explored during the progression of glucose infusion compared with those in rats of the control group. In addition, there is a significant positive correlation between glucoCEST enhancement (GCE) and myo-Inosito (Ins) in the AD group and the control group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). A significantly reduced number of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus in AD rats combined with the significantly longer escape and a decreased number of crossings were verified at 28 days after Aβ25–35 injection by Nissl staining and Morris water maze, respectively. Our results indicated that an abnormal brain glucose mechanism in AD rats could be detected by glucoCEST imaging, suggesting a new method to explore the occurrence and progress of diabetes-related AD or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives
Patients with established Parkinson's disease (PD) display differences in peripheral blood markers of immune function, including leukocyte differential counts, compared with controls. These differences may be useful biomarkers to predict PD and may shed light on pathogenesis. We sought to identify whether peripheral immune dysregulation was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis.


Methods
We examined the relationship between incident PD, baseline differential leukocyte count and other blood markers of acute inflammation in UK Biobank (UKB), a longitudinal cohort with ~500,000 participants. We used a range of sensitivity analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) to further explore the nature of associations.


Results
After excluding individuals with comorbidities which could influence biomarkers of inflammation, 465 incident PD cases and 312,125 controls remained. Lower lymphocyte count was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–1.32, padjusted = 0.01). There was some evidence that reductions in eosinophil counts, monocyte counts and C‐reactive protein (CRP) were associated with increased PD risk, and that higher neutrophil count was also associated. Only the association between lower lymphocyte count and increased PD risk remained robust to sensitivity analyses. MR suggested that the effect of lower lymphocyte count on PD risk may be causal (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count; ORMR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01–1.18, p = 0.02).


Interpretation
We provide converging evidence from observational analyses in UKB and MR that lower lymphocyte count is associated with an increased risk of subsequent PD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:803–812</content>

 Objective
Perinatal intracranial hemorrhage (pICH) is a rare event that occurs during the fetal/neonatal period with potentially devastating neurological outcome. However, the etiology of pICH is frequently hard to depict. We investigated the role of rare genetic variations in unexplained cases of pICH.


Methods
We performed whole‐exome sequencing (WES) in fetuses and term neonates with otherwise unexplained pICH and their parents. Variant causality was determined according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria, consistency between suggested genes and phenotypes, and mode of inheritance.


Results
Twenty‐six probands (25 families) were included in the study (9 with a prenatal diagnosis and 17 with a postnatal diagnosis). Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was the most common type of hemorrhage (n = 16, 62%), followed by subpial (n = 4, 15%), subdural (n = 4, 15%), and parenchymal (n = 2, 8%) hemorrhage. Causative/likely causative variants were found in 4 subjects from 3 of the 25 families (12%) involving genes related to the brain microenvironment (COL4A1, COL4A2, and TREX‐1). Additionally, potentially causative variants were detected in genes related to coagulation (GP1BA, F11, Von Willebrand factor [VWF], FGA, and F7; n = 4, 16%). A potential candidate gene for phenotypic expansion related to microtubular function (DNAH5) was identified in 1 case (4%). Fifty‐five percent of the variants were inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Overall, these findings showed a monogenic cause for pICH in 12% to 32% of the families.


Interpretation
Our findings reveal a clinically significant diagnostic yield of WES in apparently idiopathic pICH and support the use of WES in the evaluation of these cases. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:813–822</content>

 Objective
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the utility of evoked potentials as a biomarker of cortical function in Rett syndrome (RTT). As a number of disease‐modifying therapeutics are currently under development, there is a pressing need for biomarkers to objectively and precisely assess the effectiveness of these treatments.


Method
Yearly visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were acquired from individuals with RTT, aged 2 to 37 years, and control participants across 5 sites as part of the Rett Syndrome and Related Disorders Natural History Study. Baseline and year 1 data, when available, were analyzed and the repeatability of the results was tested. Two syndrome‐specific measures from the Natural History Study were used for evaluating the clinical relevance of the VEP and AEP parameters.


Results
At the baseline study, group level comparisons revealed reduced VEP and AEP amplitude in RTT compared to control participants. Further analyses within the RTT group indicated that this reduction was associated with RTT‐related symptoms, with greater severity associated with lower VEP and AEP amplitude. In participants with RTT, VEP and AEP amplitude was also negatively associated with age. Year 1 follow‐up data analyses yielded similar findings and evidence of repeatability of EPs at the individual level.


Interpretation
The present findings indicate the promise of evoked potentials (EPs) as an objective measure of disease severity in individuals with RTT. Our multisite approach demonstrates potential research and clinical applications to provide unbiased assessment of disease staging, prognosis, and response to therapy.

 Objective
This study was undertaken to assess the impact of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).


Methods
We retrospectively collected data of PwMS with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19. All the patients had complete follow‐up to death or recovery. Severe COVID‐19 was defined by a 3‐level variable: mild disease not requiring hospitalization versus pneumonia or hospitalization versus intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We evaluated baseline characteristics and MS therapies associated with severe COVID‐19 by multivariate and propensity score (PS)‐weighted ordinal logistic models. Sensitivity analyses were run to confirm the results.


Results
Of 844 PwMS with suspected (n = 565) or confirmed (n = 279) COVID‐19, 13 (1.54%) died; 11 of them were in a progressive MS phase, and 8 were without any therapy. Thirty‐eight (4.5%) were admitted to an ICU; 99 (11.7%) had radiologically documented pneumonia; 96 (11.4%) were hospitalized.
After adjusting for region, age, sex, progressive MS course, Expanded Disability Status Scale, disease duration, body mass index, comorbidities, and recent methylprednisolone use, therapy with an anti‐CD20 agent (ocrelizumab or rituximab) was significantly associated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–4.74, p = 0.015) with increased risk of severe COVID‐19. Recent use (&amp;lt;1 month) of methylprednisolone was also associated with a worse outcome (OR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.20–12.53, p = 0.001). Results were confirmed by the PS‐weighted analysis and by all the sensitivity analyses.


Interpretation
This study showed an acceptable level of safety of therapies with a broad array of mechanisms of action. However, some specific elements of risk emerged. These will need to be considered while the COVID‐19 pandemic persists. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:780–789</content>

 In this work, we describe the association of a novel homozygous VPS11 variant with adult‐onset generalized dystonia, providing a detailed clinical report and biological evidence of disease mechanism. Vps11 is a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which promotes the fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with the lysosome. Functional studies on mutated fibroblasts showed marked lysosomal and autophagic abnormalities, which improved after overexpression of the wild type Vps11 protein. In conclusion, a deleterious VPS11 variant, damaging the autophagic and lysosomal pathways, is the probable genetic cause of a novel form of generalized dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:834–839</content>

 Objective
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is still burdened by high mortality in a subset of patients, such as those affected by hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and carry out preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of polyomavirus JC (JCPyV)‐specific T cell therapy in a cohort of hematological patients with PML.


Methods
Between 2014 and 2019, 9 patients with a diagnosis of “definite PML” according to the 2013 consensus who were showing progressive clinical deterioration received JCPyV‐specific T cells. Cell lines were expanded from autologous or allogenic peripheral blood mononuclear cells by stimulation with JCPyV antigen‐derived peptides.


Results
None of the patients experienced treatment‐related adverse events. In the evaluable patients, an increase in the frequency of circulating JCPyV‐specific lymphocytes was observed, with a decrease or clearance of JCPyV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. In responsive patients, transient appearance of punctate areas of contrast enhancement within, or close to, PML lesions was observed, which was interpreted as a sign of immune control and which regressed spontaneously without the need for steroid treatment. Six of 9 patients achieved PML control, with 5 alive and in good clinical condition at their last follow‐up.


Interpretation
Among other novel treatments, T cell therapy is emerging as a viable treatment option in patients with PML, particularly for those not amenable to restoration of specific immunity. Neurologists should be encouraged to refer PML patients to specialized centers to allow access to this treatment strategy. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:769–779</content>

 The Mediator multiprotein complex functions as a regulator of RNA polymerase II–catalyzed gene transcription. In this study, exome sequencing detected biallelic putative disease‐causing variants in MED27, encoding Mediator complex subunit 27, in 16 patients from 11 families with a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome. Patient phenotypes are highly homogeneous, including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, axial hypotonia with distal spasticity, dystonic movements, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Seizures and cataracts were noted in severely affected individuals. Identification of multiple patients with biallelic MED27 variants supports the critical role of MED27 in normal human neural development, particularly for the cerebellum.

 Objective
The objective of this study was to evaluate patients with ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody (gAChR‐Ab) positive autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy using a multimodal testing protocol to characterize their full clinical phenotype and explore biomarkers to quantify immunotherapy response.


Methods
We conducted a cohort study of 13 individuals (7 women, 21–69 years of age) with autonomic failure and gAChR‐Ab &amp;gt;100 pM identified between 2005 and 2019. From 2018, all patients were longitudinally assessed with cardiovascular, pupillary, urinary, sudomotor, lacrimal and salivary testing, and Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS‐31) autonomic symptom questionnaires. The orthostatic intolerance ratio was calculated by dividing change in systolic blood pressure over time tolerated on head‐up tilt. Eleven patients received immunotherapy.


Results
At first assessment, all 13 patients had cardiovascular and pupillary impairments, 7 of 8 had postganglionic sudomotor dysfunction, 9 of 11 had urinary retention and xeropthalmia, and 6 of 8 had xerostomia. After immunotherapy, there were significant improvements in orthostatic intolerance ratio (33.3 [17.8–61.3] to 5.2 [1.4–8.2], p = 0.007), heart rate response to deep breathing (1.5 [0.0–3.3] to 4.5 [3.0–6.3], p = 0.02), pupillary constriction to light (12.0 [5.5–18.0] to 19.0 [10.6–23.8]%, p = 0.02), saliva production (0.01 [0.01–0.05] to 0.08 [0.02–0.20] g/min, p = 0.03), and COMPASS‐31 scores (52 to 17, p = 0.03). Orthostatic intolerance ratio correlated with autonomic symptoms at baseline (r = 0.841, p = 0.01) and following immunotherapy (r = 0.889, p = 0.02). Immunofluorescence analyses of skin samples from a patient 32 years after disease onset showed loss of nerve fibers supplying the dermal autonomic adnexa and epidermis, with clear improvements following immunotherapy.


Interpretation
Patients with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy demonstrated objective evidence of widespread sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic failure, with significant improvements after immunotherapy. Quantitative autonomic biomarkers should be used to define initial deficits, guide therapeutic decisions, and document treatment response. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:753–768</content>

 Objective
Discovery of a novel antibody would enable diagnosis and early treatment of autoimmune encephalitis. The aim was to discover a novel antibody targeting a synaptic receptor and characterize the pathogenic mechanism.


Method
We screened for unknown antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from autoimmune encephalitis patients. Samples with reactivity to rat brain sections and no reactivity to conventional antibody tests underwent further processing for antibody discovery, using immunoprecipitation to primary neuronal cells, mass‐spectrometry analysis, an antigen‐binding assay on an antigen‐overexpressing cell line, and an electrophysiological assay with cultured hippocampal neurons.


Results
Two patients had a novel antibody against CaVα2δ (voltage‐gated calcium channel alpha‐2/delta subunit). The patient samples stained neuropils of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cortex in rat brain sections and bound to a CaVα2δ‐overexpressing cell line. Knockdown of CaVα2δ expression in cultured neurons turned off the immunoreactivity of the antibody from the patients to the neurons. The patients were associated with preceding meningitis or neuroendocrine carcinoma and responded to immunotherapy. In cultured neurons, the antibody reduced neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals by interfering with tight coupling of calcium channels and exocytosis.


Interpretation
Here, we discovered a novel autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti‐CaVα2δ antibody. Further analysis of the antibody in autoimmune encephalitis might promote early diagnosis and treatment. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:740–752</content>

 Objective
Neurology residency program websites often serve as the initial face of a program for prospective residents early in the application process. We evaluated adult neurology residency program websites to determine their comprehensiveness to identify areas for improvement.


Methods
A list of adult neurology residency programs in the United States was compiled using information on the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) websites. A total of 24 website criteria covering educational, recruitment, and compensation content were assessed for comprehensiveness. Programs’ website comprehensiveness was compared based on geographic location, program affiliation (community and/or academic), program size, and program/hospital Doximity and U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report rankings.


Results
A total of 153 US adult neurology residency program websites were evaluated. Fewer than one‐half of program websites were accessible with a direct link from either FREIDA or ERAS. The number of residency program websites reporting each content criterion varied greatly. Mean percentage of overall website comprehensiveness among neurology residency programs was 65.9%. Northeast location, academic affiliation, larger programs, and top‐ranked programs on Doximity were associated with greater program website comprehensiveness.


Interpretation
There is opportunity for all neurology residency programs to improve their websites to provide prospective applicants with a more informed and comprehensive perspective of programs during the application process. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:637–642</content>

 Objective
Approximately 50% of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex develop infantile spasms, a sudden onset epilepsy syndrome associated with poor neurological outcomes. An increased burden of tubers confers an elevated risk of infantile spasms, but it remains unknown whether some tuber locations confer higher risk than others. Here, we test whether tuber location and connectivity are associated with infantile spasms.


Methods
We segmented tubers from 123 children with (n = 74) and without (n = 49) infantile spasms from a prospective observational cohort. We used voxelwise lesion symptom mapping to test for an association between spasms and tuber location. We then used lesion network mapping to test for an association between spasms and connectivity with tuber locations. Finally, we tested the discriminability of identified associations with logistic regression and cross‐validation as well as statistical mediation.


Results
Tuber locations associated with infantile spasms were heterogenous, and no single location was significantly associated with spasms. However, &amp;gt;95% of tuber locations associated with spasms were functionally connected to the globi pallidi and cerebellar vermis. These connections were specific compared to tubers in patients without spasms. Logistic regression found that globus pallidus connectivity was a stronger predictor of spasms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–3.50, p = 0.02) than tuber burden (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 0.90–3.04, p = 0.11), with a mean receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.73 (±0.1) during repeated cross‐validation.


Interpretation
Connectivity between tuber locations and the bilateral globi pallidi is associated with infantile spasms. Our findings lend insight into spasm pathophysiology and may identify patients at risk. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:726–739</content>
