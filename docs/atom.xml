 &lt;p&gt;Inferring brain connectivity network and quantifying the significance of
interactions between brain regions are of paramount importance in neuroscience.
Although there have recently emerged some tests for graph inference based on
independent samples, there is no readily available solution to test the change
of brain network for paired and correlated samples. In this article, we develop
a paired test of matrix graphs to infer brain connectivity network when the
groups of samples are correlated. The proposed test statistic is both bias
corrected and variance corrected, and achieves a small estimation error rate.
The subsequent multiple testing procedure built on this test statistic is
guaranteed to asymptotically control the false discovery rate at the
pre-specified level. Both the methodology and theory of the new test are
considerably different from the two independent samples framework, owing to the
strong correlations of measurements on the same subjects before and after the
stimulus activity. We illustrate the efficacy of our proposal through
simulations and an analysis of an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaing Initiative
dataset.

 &lt;p&gt;Experimental evidence suggests that the computational state of cortical
systems change according to behavioral and stimulus context. However, it is
still unknown what mechanisms underlie this adaptive processing in cortical
circuitry. In this paper, we present a model of randomly coupled supercritical
Andronov-Hopf oscillators which can act as an adaptive processor by exhibiting
drastically different dynamics depending on the value of a single network
parameter. Despite being only composed of supercritical subunits, the full
system can exhibit either supercritical or subcritical Andronov-Hopf
bifurcations. This model might provide a novel mechanism for switching between
globally asymptotically stable and nonhyperbolic neural network types in
pattern recognition theory.

 &lt;p&gt;We conduct a novel imaging genetics study with the goal of examining how
effective brain connectivity is related to genetics within the context of
dementia. Our study develops an analysis examining a sample obtained from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)
and genetic data obtained from 112 subjects, where each subject is classified
as either cognitively normal (CN), as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
or as having Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) is fit to
the rs-fMRI time series in the spectral domain (spectral DCM) in order to
estimate a directed network representing effective brain connectivity within
the default mode network (DMN), a key network commonly known to be active when
the brain is at rest. These networks are then used as a phenotype and related
to a set of genetic markers potentially related to disease using the Bayes
factor, where the set of markers is selected based on a genome-wide association
study. Our exploratory analysis reveals a potential path of aligned connections
within the network being studied forming a path from the medial prefrontal
cortex to the right intraparietal cortex through the left right intraparietal
cortex that is potentially associated with a genetic signal from chromosome 11.
In a separate analysis examining the influence of genetics on disease, this
same genetic signal is selected as potentially associated with the probability
of Alzheimer's Disease using LASSO penalized multinomial logistic regression.
Our analysis serves to motivate a number of further studies with the goal of
replicating our findings in a larger sample size and with the goal of expanding
the network of brain regions included in the network.

 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitability is known to be affected by transcranial electrical
stimulation. However, due to the existence of both excitatory and inhibitory
neurons in the cortex, the mechanism of neuronal excitability shift is still
not clear. Here, we study electrical stimulation disturbance on neuronal
excitability in the neuromuscular system on an acute rat model. We design a
special stimulation waveform of enveloped high frequency stimulation (EHFS).
With modeling and in vivo measurements, EHFS is confirmed to synchronize the
neuronal recruitment at the positive and negative electrode. This unique
synchronization property of EHFS amplifies the electrical stimulation
disturbance on neuronal excitability, to enable the macroscopic observations of
large increase and decrease of force output. By eliminating the complicated
inhibitory interneuron effects in the cortex, our observations on the
neuromuscular system supports the argument that electrical stimulation
dynamically shifts neuronal excitability, by inducing depolarization during
anodal stimulation and hyperpolarization during cathodal stimulation.

 Synaptic transmission has been studied for decades, as a fundamental step in brain function. The structure of the synapse, and its changes during activity, turned out to be key aspects not only in the transfer of information between neurons, but also in cognitive processes such as learning and memory. The overall synaptic morphology has traditionally been studied by electron microscopy, which enables the visualization of synaptic structure in great detail. The changes in the organization of easily identified structures, such as the presynaptic active zone, or the postsynaptic density, are optimally studied via electron microscopy. However, few reliable methods are available for labeling individual organelles or protein complexes in electron microscopy. For such targets one typically relies either on combination of electron and fluorescence microscopy, or on super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. This review focuses on approaches and techniques used to specifically reveal synaptic organelles and protein complexes, such as cytoskeletal assemblies. We place the strongest emphasis on methods detecting the targets of interest by affinity binding, and we discuss the advantages and limitations of each method</content>

 Phosphoinositides, the seven phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol have emerged as key regulators of multiple sub-cellular processes such as membrane transport, cytoskeletal function and signalling in eukaryotic cells. All of these processes are also present in the cells that constitute the nervous system of animals and in this setting too phosphoinositides are likely to regulate key aspects of cell biology tuned to the unique aspects of cell biology of neurons. Phosphoinositides metabolism and function are mediated by enzymes and proteins that are conserved in evolution and analysis of knockouts of these in animal models implicate this signalling system in neural function. Most recently, with the advent of human genome analysis, mutations that impact components of the phosphoinositide signalling pathway has been implicated in human diseases although the cell biological basis of disease in many cases remains unclear. In this review we evaluate existing evidence for the involvement of phosphoinositide signalling in human nervous system diseases and discuss ways of enhancing our understanding of the role of this pathway in human nervous system function in health and disease.</content>

 Effective treatments for pain management remain elusive due to the dangerous side-effects of current gold-standard opioid analgesics, including the respiratory depression that has led to skyrocketing death rates from opioid overdoses over the past decade. In an attempt to address the horrific opioid crisis worldwide, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has recently proposed boosting research on specific pharmacological mechanisms mediated by a number of G protein-coupled receptors. This research is expected to expedite the discovery of medications for opioid overdose and opioid use disorders, leading towards a safer and more effective treatment of pain. Here, we review mechanistic insights from recent all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a specific subset of GPCRs for which high-resolution experimental structures are available, including opioid, cannabinoid, orexin, metabotropic glutamate, and dopamine receptor subtypes.</content>

		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00899</id>

		<content type="html">
 Background
Early exposure to nociceptive events may cause brain structural alterations in preterm neonates (PN), with long-lasting consequences on neurodevelopmental outcome. Little is known on the extent to which early pain may affect brain connectivity. We aim to evaluate brain functional connectivity changes in PN that underwent multiple invasive procedures during the postnatal period, and to correlate them with the neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months. 
Methods
In this prospective case-control study, we collected information about exposure to painful events during the early postnatal period and resting-state BOLD-fMRI data at term equivalent age from two groups of PN:  33 subjected to painful procedures during the neonatal intensive care (mean gestational age 26.9±1.8 weeks) and 13 who did not require invasive procedures (average gestational age 31.2±2.1 weeks). A data-driven principal-component-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to investigate the effect of early pain exposure on brain functional connectivity, and the relationship between connectivity changes and neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months, assessed with Griffiths’Developmental Scale-Revised:0-2.
Results
Early pain was associated with decreased functional connectivity between thalami and bilateral somatosensory cortex, and between the right insular cortex and ipsilateral amygdala and hippocampal regions, with a more evident effect in PN undergoing more invasive procedures. Functional connectivity of the right thalamocortical pathway was related to neuromotor outcome at 24 months (P=.003). 
Conclusions
Early exposure to pain is associated with abnormal functional connectivity of developing networks involved in the modulation of noxious stimuli in PN, contributing to the neurodevelopmental consequence of preterm birth.</content>

 The inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) is a white matter tract that connects the occipital and the temporal lobes. ILF abnormalities have been associated with deficits in visual processing and language comprehension in dementia patients, thus suggesting that its integrity is important for semantic processing. However, it remains elusive whether ILF microstructural organization per se impacts the visual semantic processing efficiency in the healthy brain. The present study aims to investigate whether there is an association between ILF’s microstructural organization and visual semantic processing at the individual level. We hypothesized that the efficiency of visual semantic processing positively correlates with the degree of anisotropy of the ILF. We studied 10 healthy right-handed subjects. We determined fractional anisotropy (FA) of the ILF using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We extracted N400m latency and amplitude from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals during a visual semantic decision task. N400m and mean FA of the ILF were left lateralized with the higher FA value in the left hemisphere. Inter-individual analysis showed that FA of the ILF negatively correlated with the N400m latency and amplitude, which suggests that high ILF anisotropy is associated with more efficient semantic processing. In summary, our findings provide supporting evidence for a role of the ILF in language comprehension.</content>

 Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent long-term neurodegenerative disease. Though the criteria of PD diagnosis are relatively well defined, current diagnostic procedures using medical images are labor-intensive and expertise-demanding. Hence, highly integrated automatic diagnostic algorithms are desirable.
Methods: In this work, we propose an end-to-end multi-modality diagnostic framework, including segmentation, registration, feature extraction and machine learning, to analyze the features of striatum for PD diagnosis. Multi-modality images, including T1-weighted MRI and 11C-CFT PET, are integrated into the proposed framework. The reliability of this method is validated on a dataset with the paired images from 49 PD subjects and 18 Normal (NL) subjects.
Results: We obtained a promising diagnostic accuracy in the PD/NL classification task. Meanwhile, several comparative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed framework.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that (1) the automatic segmentation provides accurate results for the diagnostic framework, (2) the method combining multi-modality images generates a better prediction accuracy than the method with single-modality PET images, and (3) the volume of the striatum is proved to be irrelevant to PD diagnosis.</content>

 Brain functioning relies on various segregated/specialized neural regions functioning as an integrated-interconnected network (i.e. metastability). Various psychiatric and neurologic disorders are associated with aberrant functioning of these brain networks. In this study, we present a novel framework integrating the strength and temporal variability of metastability in brain networks. We demonstrate that this approach provides novel mechanistic insights which enables better imaging-based predictions. Using whole-brain resting-state fMRI and a graph-theoretic framework, we integrated strength and temporal-variability of complex-network properties derived from effective connectivity networks, obtained from 87 U.S. Army soldiers consisting of healthy combat controls (n=28), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n=17), and PTSD with comorbid mild-traumatic brain injury (mTBI; n=42). We identified prefrontal dysregulation of key subcortical and visual regions in PTSD/mTBI, with all network properties exhibiting lower variability over time, indicative of poorer flexibility. Larger impairment in the prefrontal-subcortical pathway but not prefrontal-visual pathway differentiated comorbid PTSD/mTBI from the PTSD group. Network properties of the prefrontal-subcortical pathway also had significant association (R2=0.56) with symptom severity and neurocognitive performance; and were also found to possess high predictive ability (81.4% accuracy in classifying the disorders, explaining 66-72% variance in symptoms), identified through machine learning. Our framework explained 13% more variance in behaviors compared to the conventional framework. These novel insights and better predictions were made possible by our novel framework using static and time-varying network properties in our 3-group scenario, advancing the mechanistic understanding of PTSD and comorbid mTBI. Our contribution has wide-ranging applications for network-level characterization of healthy brains as well as mental disorders.</content>

 The current study examined whether emotional expectations gate attention to emotional words in early visual cortex. Colour cues informed about word valence and onset latency. We observed a stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) prior to the onset of cued words that was larger for negative than for neutral words. This indicates that emotional words are more anticipated than neutral words before target onset. During stimulus presentation the Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), elicited by flickering words, was attenuated for cued compared to uncued words, indicating sharpened sensory activity i.e. expectation suppression. Most importantly, the SSVEP was more enhanced for negative than neutral words when these were cued. Uncued conditions did not differ in SSVEP amplitudes, paralleling previous studies reporting lexico-semantic but not early visual effects of emotional words. We suggest that cueing mediates the capture of visual resources by providing an early ‘emotional gist’ of an upcoming word. Consequently, visual single-word studies may have underestimated attentional effects of emotional words and their anticipation during reading.</content>

 Conscious memories are critically dependent upon the bilateral hippocampal formation, and interhemispheric commissural projections made by mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells. GABAergic interneurons also make long-range axonal projections, but little is known regarding their commissural, inter-hippocampal connections. We used retrograde and adeno-associated viral tracing, immunofluorescent and electron microscopy, and in vitro optogenetics to assess contralateral projections of neurochemically defined interneuron classes. We found that contralateral-projecting interneurons were 24-fold less common compared to hilar mossy cells, and mostly consisted of somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing types. Somatostatin-expressing cells made denser contralateral axonal projections than parvalbumin-expressing cells, although this was typically 10-fold less than the ipsilateral projection density. Somatostatin-expressing cells displayed a topographic-like innervation according to the location of their somata, whereas parvalbumin-expressing cells mostly innervated CA1. In the dentate gyrus molecular layer, commissural interneuron post-synaptic targets were predominantly putative granule cell apical dendrites. In the hilus, varicosities in close vicinity to various interneuron subtypes, as well as mossy cells, were observed, but most contralateral axon varicosities had no adjacent immunolabelled structure. Due to the relative sparsity of the connection and the likely distal dendritic location of their synapses, commissural projections made by interneurons were found to be weak. We postulate that these projections may become functionally active upon intense network activity during tasks requiring increased memory processing.</content>

 A fundamental question in cell biology is how cellular components are delivered to their destination with spatial and temporal precision within the crowded cytoplasmic environment. The long processes of neurons represent a significant spatial challenge and make these cells particularly dependent on mechanisms for long-range cytoskeletal transport of proteins, RNA and organelles. Although many studies have substantiated a role for defective transport of axonal cargoes in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, remarkably little is known about how transport is regulated throughout ageing. The scale of the challenge posed by ageing is considerable because, in this case, the temporal regulation of transport is ultimately dictated by the length of organismal lifespan, which can extend to days, years or decades.
 	Recent methodological advances to study live axonal transport during ageing in situ have provided new tools to scratch beneath the surface of this complex problem and revealed that age-dependent decline in the transport of mitochondria is a common feature across different neuronal populations of several model organisms. In certain instances, the molecular pathways that affect transport in ageing animals have begun to emerge. However, the functional implications of these observations are still not fully understood. Whether transport decline is a significant determinant of neuronal ageing or a mere consequence of decreased cellular fitness remains an open question. 
	In this review, we discuss the latest developments in axonal trafficking in the ageing nervous system, along with the early studies that inaugurated this new area of research. We explore the possibility that the interplay between mitochondrial function and motility represents a crucial driver of ageing in neurons and put forward the hypothesis that declining axonal transport may be legitimately considered a hallmark of neuronal ageing.</content>

 RAD6 participates in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair by ubiquitinating histone H2B in mitotic cells. In terminally differentiated cells, however, the mechanisms of DNA damage repair are less well known. In this study, we investigate whether RAD6B is involved in DSBs repair in neurons and effects of RAD6B deficiency on neuronal survival. We compared neurons of RAD6B-deficient mice with those of littermate wild type (WT) mice and induced DNA damage by X-ray irradiation. We provide evidence that RAD6B is essential for neural DDR and RAD6B deficiency results in increased genomic instability and neurodegeneration. Moreover, higher levels of p53 and p21 are present in the brains of RAD6B-deficient mice, which may be responsible for neuronal senescence and degeneration. In addition, behavioral experiments show that RAD6B-deficient mice exhibit marked learning and memory deficits. In conclusion, these findings suggest that RAD6B is critical for neural integrity and that the absence of RAD6B accelerates neurodegeneration in mice.</content>

 In mammals, reproduction is regulated by a wide range of metabolic hormones that maintain the proper energy balance. In addition to regulating feeding and energy expenditure, these metabolic messengers also modulate the functional performance of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Secretin, a member of the secretin-glucagon-vasoactive intestinal peptide hormone family, has been shown to alter reproduction centrally, although the underlying mechanisms have not been explored yet. In order to elucidate its central action in the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction, in vitro electrophysiological slice experiments were carried out on GnRH-GFP neurons in male mice. Bath application of secretin (100 nM) signiﬁcantly increased the frequency of the spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) to 118.0 ± 2.64% compared to the control, and that of the GABAergic miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) to 147.6 ± 19.19 %. Resting membrane potential became depolarized by 12.74 ± 4.539 mV after secretin treatment. Frequency of evoked action potentials also increased to 144.3 ± 10.8 %. The secretin-triggered elevation of the frequency of mPSCs was prevented by using either a secretin receptor antagonist (3 µM) or intracellularly applied G-protein-coupled receptor blocker (GDP-β-S; 2 mM) supporting the involvement of secretin receptor in the process. Regarding the actions downstream to secretin receptor, intracellular blockade of protein kinase A (PKA) with KT-5720 (2 µM) or intracellular inhibition of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) by NPLA (1 µM) abolished the stimulatory effect of secretin on mPSCs. These data suggest that secretin acts on GnRH neurons via secretin receptors whose activation triggers the cAMP/PKA/nNOS signaling pathway resulting in nitric oxide release and in the presynaptic terminals this retrograde NO machinery regulates the GABAergic input to GnRH neurons.</content>

 Gliosis defined as reactive changes of resident glia is the primary response of the central nervous system (CNS) to trauma. The proliferation and fate controls of injury-reactivated glia are essential but remain largely unexplored. In zebrafish optic tectum, we found that stab injury drove a subset of radial glia (RG) into the cell cycle, and surprisingly, proliferative RG responding to sequential injuries of the same site were distinct but overlapping, which was in agreement with stochastic cell-cycle entry. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and functional assays further revealed the involvement of Notch/Delta lateral inhibition in this stochastic cell-cycle entry. Furthermore, the long-term clonal analysis showed that proliferative RG were largely gliogenic. Notch inhibition of reactive RG, not dormant and proliferative RG, resulted in an increased production of neurons, which were short-lived. Our findings gain new insights into the proliferation and fate controls of injury-reactivated CNS glia in zebrafish.</content>

 Perception and behavior can be guided by predictions, which are often based on learned statistical regularities. Neural responses to expected stimuli are frequently found to be attenuated after statistical learning. However, whether this sensory attenuation following statistical learning occurs automatically or depends on attention remains unknown. In the present fMRI study, we exposed human volunteers to sequentially presented object stimuli, in which the first object predicted the identity of the second object. We observed a reliable attenuation of neural activity for expected compared to unexpected stimuli in the ventral visual stream. Crucially, this sensory attenuation was only apparent when stimuli were attended, and vanished when attention was directed away from the predictable objects. These results put important constraints on neurocomputational theories that cast perception as a process of probabilistic integration of prior knowledge and sensory information.</content>

 During organogenesis, inductive signals cause cell differentiation and morphogenesis. However, how these phenomena are coordinated to form functional organs is poorly understood. Here, we show that cell differentiation of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; trachea is sequentially determined in two steps and that the second step is synchronous with the invagination of the epithelial sheet. The master gene &lt;i&gt;trachealess&lt;/i&gt; is dispensable for the initiation of invagination, while it is essential for maintaining the invaginated structure, suggesting that tracheal morphogenesis and differentiation are separately induced. &lt;i&gt;trachealess&lt;/i&gt; expression starts in bipotential tracheal/epidermal placode cells. After invagination, its expression is maintained in the invaginated cells but is extinguished in the remaining sheet cells. A &lt;i&gt;trachealess&lt;/i&gt; cis-regulatory module that shows both tracheal enhancer activity and silencer activity in the surface epidermal sheet was identified. We propose that the coupling of &lt;i&gt;trachealess&lt;/i&gt; expression with the invaginated structure ensures that only invaginated cells canalize robustly into the tracheal fate.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective: Whether immunotherapy improves long-term disability in multiple sclerosis has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. This study examined the effect of immunotherapy on long-term disability outcomes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Methods: We studied patients from MSBase followed for 1 year, with 3 visits, 1 visit per year and exposed to a multiple sclerosis therapy, and a subset of patients with 15-year follow-up. Marginal structural models were used to compare the hazard of 12-month confirmed increase and decrease in disability, EDSS step 6 and the incidence of relapses between treated and untreated periods. Marginal structural models were continuously re-adjusted for patient age, sex, pregnancy, date, disease course, time from first symptom, prior relapse history, disability and MRI activity. Results: 14,717 patients were studied. During the treated periods, patients were less likely to experience relapses (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.43- 0.82, p=0.0016), worsening of disability (0.56, 0.38-0.82, p=0.0026) and progress to EDSS step 6 (0.33, 0.19-0.59, p=0.00019). Among 1085 patients with 15-year follow-up, the treated patients were less likely to experience relapses (0.59, 0.50- 0.70, p=10-9) and worsening of disability (0.81, 0.67-0.99, p=0.043). Conclusions: Continued treatment with multiple sclerosis immunotherapies reduces disability accrual (by 19-44%), the risk of need of a walking aid by 67% and the frequency of relapses (by 40-41%) over 15 years. A proof of long-term effect of immunomodulation on disability outcomes is the key to establishing its disease modifying properties.</content>

Tailored therapy aims to cure cancer patients effectively and safely, based on the complex interactions between patients' genomic features, disease pathology and drug metabolism. Thus, the continual increase in scientific literature drives the need for efficient methods of data mining to improve the extraction of useful information from texts based on patients' genomic features. An important application of text mining to tailored therapy in cancer encompasses the use of mutations and cancer fusion genes as moieties that change patients' cellular networks to develop cancer, and also affect drug metabolism. Fusion proteins, which are derived from the slippage of two parental genes, are produced in cancer by chromosomal aberrations and trans-splicing. Given that the two parental proteins for predicted fusion proteins are known, we used our previously developed method for identifying chimeric protein–protein interactions (ChiPPIs) associated with the fusion proteins. Here, we present a validation approach that receives fusion proteins of interest, predicts their cellular network alterations by ChiPPI and validates them by our new method, ProtFus, using an online literature search. This process resulted in a set of 358 fusion proteins and their corresponding protein interactions, as a training set for a Naïve Bayes classifier, to identify predicted fusion proteins that have reliable evidence in the literature and that were confirmed experimentally. Next, for a test group of 1817 fusion proteins, we were able to identify from the literature 2908 PPIs in total, across 18 cancer types. The described method, ProtFus, can be used for screening the literature to identify unique cases of fusion proteins and their PPIs, as means of studying alterations of protein networks in cancers.

Because of the inherent complexity of bioprocesses, mathematical models are more and more used for process design, control, optimization, etc. These models are generally based on a set of biochemical reactions. Model equations are then derived from mass balance, coupled with empirical kinetics. Biological models are nonlinear and represent processes, which by essence are dynamic and adaptive. The temptation to embed most of the biology is high, with the risk that calibration would not be significant anymore. The most important task for a modeler is thus to ensure a balance between model complexity and ease of use. Since a model should be tailored to the objectives, which will depend on applications and environment, a universal model representing any possible situation is probably not the best option.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J02G9l9G3F8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Pituitary endocrine cells fire action potentials (APs) to regulate their cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and hormone secretion rate. Depending on animal species, cell type, and biological conditions, pituitary APs are generated either by TTX-sensitive Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;), high-voltage activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;), or by a combination of the two. Previous computational models of pituitary cells have mainly been based on data from rats, where &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; is largely inactivated at the resting potential, and spontaneous APs are predominantly mediated by &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;. Unlike in rats, spontaneous &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated APs are consistently seen in pituitary cells of several other animal species, including several species of fish. In the current work we develop a computational model of gonadotropin releasing cells in the teleost fish medaka (&lt;i&gt;Oryzias latipes&lt;/i&gt;). The model stands out from previous modeling efforts by being (1) the first model of a pituitary cell in teleosts, (2) the first pituitary cell model that fires sponateous APs that are predominantly mediated by &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;, and (3) the first pituitary cell model where the kinetics of the depolarizing currents, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;, are directly fitted to voltage-clamp data. We explore the firing properties of the model, and compare it to the properties of previous models that fire &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;-based APs. We put a particular focus on how the big conductance K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;BK&lt;/sub&gt;) modulates the AP shape. Interestingly, we find that &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;BK&lt;/sub&gt; can prolong AP duration in models that fire &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;-based APs, while it consistently shortens the duration of the predominantly &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated APs in the medaka gonadotroph model. Although the model is constrained to experimental data from gonadotroph cells in medaka, it may likely provide insights also into other pituitary cell types that fire &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated APs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZD17bWFkaUE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Multiple cellular organelles tightly orchestrate intracellular calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) dynamics to regulate cellular activities and maintain homeostasis. The interplay between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a major store of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and mitochondria, an important source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), has been the subject of much research, as their dysfunction has been linked with metabolic diseases. Interestingly, throughout the cell’s cytosolic domain, these two organelles share common microdomains called mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), where their membranes are in close apposition. The role of MAMs is critical for intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics as they provide hubs for direct Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchange between the organelles. A recent experimental study reported correlation between obesity and MAM formation in mouse liver cells, and obesity-related cellular changes that are closely associated with the regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. We constructed a mathematical model to study the effects of MAM Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics on global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activities. Through a series of model simulations, we investigated cellular mechanisms underlying the altered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics in the cells under obesity. We predict that, as the dosage of stimulus gradually increases, liver cells from obese mice will reach the state of saturated cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration at a lower stimulus concentration, compared to cells from healthy mice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uLyy-DKm4ZU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alpha rhythm (8–13 Hz) is linked to relaxed mental state in humans. Earlier reports have shown that individuals can increase their alpha power if provided with a valid feedback, compared to controls who are provided invalid feedback. However, these results remain controversial, partly because controls may be in a different behavioral state, making it difficult to directly compare their alpha power with the valid group. We here address this issue by using an experimental paradigm in which an invalid feedback is given on a fraction of trials, such that both valid and invalid conditions can be obtained from the same participant. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we recorded alpha power from the occipital area from 24 humans (nine females) and played a feedback tone which could be valid (tone frequency proportional to alpha power), invalid (tone sequence from a previous valid trial; participants were unaware of this condition), or neutral (constant tone frequency). We found that during eyes closed-state, neurofeedback did not enhance alpha activity beyond pre-trained state within the experimental duration, probably because of saturation of alpha rhythmicity. However, for participants whose alpha power decreased over time within a trial, valid feedback helped them to sustain alpha more than invalid feedback. Further, alpha increase showed a weak negative correlation with their self-reported attentional load but was uncorrelated with relaxation levels. Our results reconcile many conflicting reports in the neurofeedback literature, and show that even under most stringent control, valid neurofeedback can help participants who are otherwise unable to sustain their alpha activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The human cerebral cortex is a complex structure with tightly interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks. In order to study human cortical function, we recently developed a method to generate cortical neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that form both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks resembling the composition of the human cortex. These cultures and organoids recapitulate neuronal populations representative of the six cortical layers and a balanced excitatory and inhibitory network that is functional and homeostatically stable. To determine whether hiPSC-derived neurons can integrate and retain physiologic activities &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we labeled hiPSCs with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and introduced hiPSC-derived neural progenitors to rat brains. Efficient neural induction, followed by differentiation resulted in a RFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neural population with traits of forebrain identity and a balanced synaptic activity composed of both excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Ten weeks after transplantation, grafted cells structurally integrated into the rat forebrain. Remarkably, these hiPSC-derived neurons were able to fire, exhibiting both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which culminates in the establishment of neuronal connectivity with the host circuitry. This study demonstrates that neural progenitors derived from hiPSCs can differentiate into functional cortical neurons and can participate in neural network activity through functional synaptic integration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, thereby contributing to information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;As NASA prepares for a mission to Mars, concerns regarding the health risks associated with deep space radiation exposure have emerged. Until now, the impacts of such exposures have only been studied in animals after acute exposures, using dose rates ~1.5&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; higher than those actually encountered in space. Using a new, low dose-rate neutron irradiation facility, we have uncovered that realistic, low dose-rate exposures produce serious neurocognitive complications associated with impaired neurotransmission. Chronic (6 month) low-dose (18 cGy) and dose rate (1 mGy/d) exposures of mice to a mixed field of neutrons and photons result in diminished hippocampal neuronal excitability and disrupted hippocampal and cortical long-term potentiation. Furthermore, mice displayed severe impairments in learning and memory, and the emergence of distress behaviors. Behavioral analyses showed an alarming increase in risk associated with these realistic simulations, revealing for the first time, some unexpected potential problems associated with deep space travel on all levels of neurological function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synapse formation can be promoted by intense activity. At the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), new synaptic boutons can grow acutely in response to patterned stimulation. We combined confocal imaging with electron microscopy and tomography to investigate the initial stages of growth and differentiation of new presynaptic boutons at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; NMJ. We found that the new boutons can form rapidly in intact larva in response to intense crawling activity, and we observed two different patterns of bouton formation and maturation. The first pathway involves the growth of filopodia followed by a formation of boutons that are initially devoid of synaptic vesicles (SVs) but filled with filamentous matrix. The second pathway involves rapid budding of synaptic boutons packed with SVs, and these more mature boutons are sometimes capable of exocytosis/endocytosis. We demonstrated that intense activity predominantly promotes the second pathway, i.e., budding of more mature boutons filled with SVs. We also showed that this pathway depends on synapsin (Syn), a neuronal protein which reversibly associates with SVs and mediates their clustering via a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanism. Finally, we took advantage of the temperature-sensitive mutant &lt;i&gt;sei&lt;/i&gt; to demonstrate that seizure activity can promote very rapid budding of new boutons filled with SVs, and this process occurs at scale of minutes. Altogether, these results demonstrate that intense activity acutely and selectively promotes rapid budding of new relatively mature presynaptic boutons filled with SVs, and that this process is regulated via a PKA/Syn-dependent pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The mammalian PIM family of serine/threonine kinases regulate several cellular functions, such as cell survival and motility. Because PIM expression is observed in sensory organs, such as olfactory epithelium, we now wanted to explore the physiological roles of PIM kinases there. As our model organism, we used the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes, which express two PIM-related kinases, PRK-1 and PRK-2. We demonstrated PRKs to be true PIM orthologs with similar substrate specificity as well as sensitivity to PIM-inhibitory compounds. When we analyzed the effects of pan-PIM inhibitors on &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; sensory functions, we observed that PRK activity is selectively required to support olfactory sensations to volatile repellents and attractants sensed by AWB and AWC&lt;sup&gt;ON&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, respectively, but is dispensable for gustatory sensations. Analyses of &lt;i&gt;prk&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mutant strains confirmed these findings and suggested that PRK-1, but not PRK-2 is responsible for the observed effects on olfaction. This regulatory role of PRK-1 is further supported by its observed expression in the head and tail neurons, including AWB and AWC neurons. Based on the evolutionary conservation of PIM-related kinases, our data may have implications in regulation of also mammalian olfaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord atrophy is a clinically relevant feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), but longitudinal assessments on magnetic resonance imaging using segmentation‐based methods suffer from measurement variability, especially in multicenter studies. We compared the generalized boundary shift integral (GBSI), a registration‐based method, with a standard segmentation‐based method.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline and 1‐year spinal cord 3‐dimensional T1‐weighted images (1mm isotropic) were obtained from 282 patients (52 clinically isolated syndrome [CIS], 196 relapsing–remitting MS [RRMS], 34 progressive MS [PMS]), and 82 controls from 8 MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis) sites on multimanufacturer and multi–field‐strength scans. Spinal Cord Toolbox was used for C2‐5 segmentation and cross‐sectional area (CSA) calculation. After cord straightening and registration, GBSI measured atrophy based on the probabilistic boundary‐shift region of interest. CSA and GBSI percentage annual volume change was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GBSI provided similar rates of atrophy, but reduced measurement variability compared to CSA in all MS subtypes (CIS: −0.95 ± 2.11% vs −1.19 ± 3.67%; RRMS: −1.74 ± 2.57% vs −1.74 ± 4.02%; PMS: −2.29 ± 2.40% vs −1.29 ± 3.20%) and healthy controls (0.02 ± 2.39% vs −0.56 ± 3.77%). GBSI performed better than CSA in differentiating healthy controls from CIS (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.66 vs 0.53; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03), RRMS (AUC = 0.73 vs 0.59; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), PMS (AUC = 0.77 vs 0.53; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and patients with disability progression from patients without progression (AUC = 0.59 vs 0.50; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). Sample size to detect 60% treatment effect on spinal cord atrophy over 1 year was lower for GBSI than CSA (CIS: 106 vs 830; RRMS: 95 vs 335; PMS: 44 vs 215; power = 80%; alpha = 5%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The registration‐based method (GBSI) allowed better separation between MS patients and healthy controls and improved statistical power, when compared with a conventional segmentation‐based method (CSA), although it is still far from perfect. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are widely deployed to solve complex pattern
recognition, function approximation and image classification tasks. With the
growing size and complexity of these networks, hardware implementation becomes
challenging because scaling up the size of a single array (crossbar) of fully
connected neurons is no longer feasible due to strict energy budget. Modern
neromorphic hardware integrates small-sized crossbars with time-multiplexed
interconnects. Partitioning SNNs becomes essential in order to map them on
neuromorphic hardware with the major aim to reduce the global communication
latency and energy overhead. To achieve this goal, we propose our instantiation
of particle swarm optimization, which partitions SNNs into local synapses
(mapped on crossbars) and global synapses (mapped on time-multiplexed
interconnects), with the objective of reducing spike communication on the
interconnect. This improves latency, power consumption as well as application
performance by reducing inter-spike interval distortion and spike disorders.
Our framework is implemented in Python, interfacing CARLsim, a GPU-accelerated
application-level spiking neural network simulator with an extended version of
Noxim, for simulating time-multiplexed interconnects. Experiments are conducted
with realistic and synthetic SNN-based applications with different computation
models, topologies and spike coding schemes. Using power numbers from in-house
neuromorphic chips, we demonstrate significant reductions in energy consumption
and spike latency over PACMAN, the widely-used partitioning technique for SNNs
on SpiNNaker.

 &lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging is one of the most important tools in neurophysiology as it
enables the observation of neuronal activity for hundreds of cells in parallel
and at single-cell resolution. In order to use the data gained with calcium
imaging, it is necessary to extract individual cells and their activity from
the recordings. Although many sophisticated methods have been proposed, the
cell extraction from calcium imaging data can still be prohibitively laborious
and require manual annotation and correction. We present DISCo, a novel
approach for the cell segmentation in Calcium Imaging Analysis (CIA) that
combines the advantages of Deep learning with a state-of-the-art Instance
Segmentation algorithm and uses temporal information from the recordings in a
computationally efficient way by computing Correlations between pixels.

 &lt;p&gt;This study utilises an experiment famous in quantum physics, the
Stern-Gerlach experiment, to inform the structure of an experimental protocol
from which a quantum cognitive decision model can be developed. The
'quantumness' of this model is tested by computing a discrete
quasi-probabilistic Wigner function. Based on theory from quantum physics, our
hypothesis is that the Stern-Gerlach protocol will admit negative values in the
Wigner function, thus signalling that the cognitive decision model is quantum.
A crowdsourced experiment of two images was used to collect decisions around
three questions related to image trustworthiness. The resultant data was used
to instantiate the quantum model and compute the Wigner function. Negative
values in the Wigner functions of both images were encountered, thus
substantiating our hypothesis. Findings also revealed that the quantum
cognitive model was a more accurate predictor of decisions when compared to
predictions computed using Bayes' rule.

 &lt;p&gt;Finite Element Modeling (FEM) has been widely used to model the electric
field distribution, to study the interaction between stimulation electrodes and
neural tissue. However, due to the insufficient computational capability to
represent neural tissue down to an atom-level, the existing FEM fails to model
the real electric field that is perpendicular to neuron membrane to initiate an
action potential. Thus, to reveal the real electrode-tissue interactions, we
developed a circuit to model transmembrane voltage waveforms. Here, we show a
distributed-parameter circuit model to systematically study how
electrode-tissue interaction is affected by electrode position, input current
waveform, and biological structures in the neuromuscular system. Our model
explains and predicts various phenomena in neuromuscular stimulation, guides
new stimulation electrode and method design, and more importantly, facilitates
a fundamental understanding of the physical process during electrode-tissue
interaction. In our model, myelin is assumed to be inductive. The voltage
waveform resonance caused by this inductive myelin accounts for the much lower
stimulation threshold to activate motoneurons than muscle fibers, which is
observed with in vivo measurements. These findings confirmed the feasibility of
studying electrode-tissue interaction using a proper distributed-parameter
circuit. Our current application on the neuromuscular system also raises the
possibility that this distributed-parameter circuit model could potentially be
applied to study other neural tissues, including the Peripheral Nervous System
(PNS) and the Central Nervous System (CNS).

 Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia which characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive function due to degeneration of synapses and axons. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease. Deposition of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are two major hallmark pathologic changes in  the brain of Alzheimer's patient. Autophagy is the major mechanism in cells responsible for removing protein aggregates. Anormalous immature autophagic vacuoles accumulated in dystrophic neurites in Alzheimer patient's brain suggests that autophagy process is disturbed. It is not yet clear whether autophagy plays a causative role, a protective role or just a consequence of the disease process itself. Understanding the exact role of autophagy in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease progression may help to design more effective therapeutic strategies towards this devastating disorder.</content>

 Abstract
The human brain is thought to be an extremely complex but efficient computing engine, processing vast amounts of information from a changing world. The decline in the synaptic density of neuronal networks is one of the most important characteristics of brain development, which is closely related to synaptic pruning, synaptic growth, synaptic plasticity, and energy metabolism. However, because of technical limitations in observing large-scale neuronal networks dynamically connected through synapses, how neuronal networks are organized and evolve as their synaptic density declines remains unclear. Here, by establishing a biologically reasonable neuronal network model, we show that despite a decline in the synaptic density, the connectivity and efficiency of neuronal networks can be improved. Importantly, by analysing the degree distribution, we also find that both the scale-free characteristic of neuronal networks and the emergence of hub neurons rely on the spatial distance between neurons. These findings may promote our understanding of neuronal networks in the brain and have guiding significance for the design of neuronal network models.

 Accumulation and aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein is believed to be a cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at S129 is known to be associated with the pathological misfolding process, but efforts to investigate the relevance of this post-translational modification for pathology have been frustrated by difficulties in detecting and quantifying it in relevant samples. We report novel, ultrasensitive immunoassays based on single-molecule counting technology, useful for detecting alpha-synuclein and its S129 phosphorylated form in clinical samples in the low pg/ml range. Using human CSF and plasma samples, we find levels of alpha-synuclein comparable to those previously reported. However, while alpha-synuclein phosphorylated on S129 could easily be detected in human plasma, where its detection is extremely sensitive to protein phosphatases, its levels in CSF were undetectable, with a possible influence of a matrix effect. In plasma samples from a small test cohort comprising 5 PD individuals and 5 age-matched control individuals we find that pS129 alpha-synuclein levels are increased in PD plasma samples, in line with previous reports. We conclude that pS129 alpha-synuclein is not detectable in CSF and recommend the addition of phosphatase inhibitors to plasma samples at the time of collection. Moreover, the findings obtained on the small cohort of clinical plasma samples point to plasma pS129 alpha-synuclein levels as a candidate diagnostic biomarker in PD.</content>

 The study of dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) has been important to understand the healthy and diseased brain. Recent developments model groups of functionally related brain structures (defined as functional domains) as entities that can send and receive information. A domain analysis starts by detecting a finite set of connectivity patterns known as domain states within each functional domain. Dynamic functional domain connectivity (DFDC) is a novel information theoretic framework for studying the temporal sequence of the domain states and the amount of information shared among domains. In this setting, the information flow among functional domains can be compared to the flow of bits among entities in a digital network. Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder which is associated with how the brain processes information. Here we employed the DFDC framework to analyze a dataset containing resting-state fMRI scans from 163 healthy controls (HCs) and 151 schizophrenia patients (SZs). As in other information theory methods, this study measured domain state probabilities, entropy within each DFDC and the cross-domain mutual information (CDMI) between pairs of DFDC. Results indicate that SZs show significantly higher (transformed) entropy than HCs in subcortical (SC)-SC; default mode network (DMN)-visual (VIS) and frontoparietal (FRN)-VIS DFDCs. SZs also show lower (transformed) CDMI between SC-VIS vs SC-sensorimotor (SM), attention (ATTN)-VIS vs ATTN-SM and ATTN-SM vs ATTN-ATTN DFDC pairs after correcting for multiple comparisons. These results imply that different DFDC pairs function in a more independent manner in SZs compared to HCs. Our findings present evidence of higher uncertainty and randomness in SZ brain function.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Sensory deprivation, such as hearing loss, has been demonstrated to change the intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) of the brain, as measured with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Patients with sloping sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) are a unique population among the hearing impaired, as they have all been exposed to some auditory input throughout their lifespan and all use spoken language. Material and Methods: Twenty patients with SNHL and 21 control subjects participated in a rs-fMRI study. Whole-brain seed-driven FC maps were obtained, with audiological scores of patients, including hearing loss severity and speech performance, used as covariates. Results: Most profound differences in FC were found between patients with prelingual (before language development, PRE) vs postlingual onset (after language development, POST) of SNHL. An early onset was related to enhancement in long-range network connections, including the default-mode network, the dorsal-attention network and the fronto-parietal network, as well as in local sensory networks, the visual and the sensorimotor. A number of multisensory brain regions in frontal and parietal cortices, as well as the cerebellum, were also more internally connected. We interpret these effects as top-down mechanisms serving optimization of multisensory experience in SNHL with a prelingual onset. At the same time, POST patients showed enhanced FC between the salience network and multisensory parietal areas, as well as with the hippocampus, when they were compared to those with PRE hearing loss. Signal in several cortex regions subserving visual processing was also more intra-correlated in POST vs PRE patients. This outcome might point to more attention resources directed to multisensory as well as memory experience. Finally, audiological scores correlated with FC in several sensory and high-order brain regions in all patients. Conclusions: The results show that a sloping hearing loss is related to altered resting-state brain organization. Effects were shown in attention and cognitive control networks, as well as visual and sensorimotor regions. Specifically, we found that even in a partial hearing deficit (affecting only some of the hearing frequency ranges), the age at the onset affects the brain function differently, pointing to the role of sensitive periods in brain development.</content>

 When retrieval occurs concomitantly with novelty detection, mismatch perception or reactivation of conflicting information, consolidated memories can enter into a labile state and, to persist, must be restabilized through a protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation process during which their strength and content can be modified. Extensive literature implicates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a key regulator of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, in the acquisition, consolidation and extinction of several memory types. However, the participation of BDNF in memory reconsolidation has been less studied. In this review, we discuss recent reports supporting the involvement of BDNF signaling in reactivation-induced memory updating.</content>

 Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits and some proteins play some essential roles in AD pathogenesis. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging as an indicator of tissue protein has shown promise for AD diseases. In this study, we chose 20 AD model rats as the experimental group and 20 sham-operated rats as the control group. They were firstly underwent Y-maze test, and then performed on a 7.0 T animal MRI scanner to acquire brain amide proton transfer image using saturation with frequency alternating RF irradiation (APTSAFARI) method. Compared with the control group, APT (3.5ppm) values of brain were significantly reduced in AD models (p&amp;lt;0.002). The APTSAFARI imaging is more significantly than APT imaging (p&amp;lt;0.0001). The Y-maze showed there were loss spatial learning and memory in the AD model, as well as significant neuronal loss in the hippocampus CA1 region and cortex compared with sham-operated rat. In conclusion, we demonstrated that APT technology could potentially provide molecular biomarkers for the noninvasive diagnosis of AD. These results suggested that APTSAFARI MRI could be used as an effective tool to improve the accuracy of diagnosis of AD as a possible biomarker.</content>

 Insulin signaling controls metabolic homeostasis. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of full-length insulin receptor (IR) and insulin complex in the active state. This structure unexpectedly reveals that maximally 4 insulins can bind the 'T'-shaped IR dimer at 4 distinct sites related by 2-fold symmetry. Insulins 1 and 1' bind to sites 1 and 1', formed by L1 of one IR protomer and α-CT and FnIII-1 of the other. Insulins 2 and 2' bind to sites 2 and 2' on FnIII-1 of each protomer. Mutagenesis and cellular assays show that both sites 1 and 2 are required for optimal insulin binding and IR activation. We further identify a homotypic FnIII-2-FnIII-2 interaction in mediating the dimerization of membrane proximal domains in the active IR dimer. Our results indicate that binding of multiple insulins at two distinct types of sites disrupts the autoinhibited apo-IR dimer and stabilizes the active dimer.</content>

 The gastric proton pump (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase), a P-type ATPase responsible for gastric acidification, mediates electro-neutral exchange of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; coupled with ATP hydrolysis, but with an as yet undetermined transport stoichiometry. Here we show crystal structures at a resolution of 2.5 Å of the pump in the E2-P transition state, in which the counter-transporting cation is occluded. We found a single K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; bound to the cation-binding site of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase, indicating an exchange of 1H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/1K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; per hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. This fulfills the energy requirement for the generation of a six pH unit gradient across the membrane. The structural basis of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; recognition is resolved and supported by molecular dynamics simulations, establishing how the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase overcomes the energetic challenge to generate an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gradient of more than a million-fold—one of the highest cation gradients known in mammalian tissue—across the membrane.</content>

 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) encompass a variety of vesicles secreted into the extracellular space. EVs have been implicated in promoting tumor metastasis, but the molecular composition of tumor-derived EV sub-types and the mechanisms by which molecules are sorted into EVs remain mostly unknown. We report the separation of two small EV sub-populations from a metastatic breast cancer cell line, with biochemical features consistent with different sub-cellular origins. These EV sub-types use different mechanisms of miRNA sorting (selective and non-selective), suggesting that sorting occurs via fundamentally distinct processes, possibly dependent on EV origin. Using biochemical and genetic tools, we identified the Lupus La protein as mediating sorting of selectively packaged miRNAs. We found that two motifs embedded in miR-122 are responsible for high-affinity binding to Lupus La and sorting into vesicles formed in a cell-free reaction. Thus, tumor cells can simultaneously deploy multiple EV species using distinct sorting mechanisms that may enable diverse functions in normal and cancer biology.</content>

 Males and females typically pursue divergent reproductive strategies and accordingly require different dietary compositions to maximise their fitness. Here we move from identifying sex-specific optimal diets to understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie male and female responses to dietary variation in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We examine male and female gene expression on male-optimal (carbohydrate-rich) and female-optimal (protein-rich) diets. We find that the sexes share a large core of metabolic genes that are concordantly regulated in response to dietary composition. However, we also observe smaller sets of genes with divergent and opposing regulation, most notably in reproductive genes which are over-expressed on each sex's optimal diet. Our results suggest that nutrient sensing output emanating from a shared metabolic machinery are reversed in males and females, leading to opposing diet-dependent regulation of reproduction in males and females. Further analysis and experiments suggest that this reverse regulation occurs within the IIS/TOR network.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM)-containing receptor G6b-B is critical for platelet production and activation. Loss of G6b-B results in severe macrothrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis and aberrant platelet function in mice and humans. Using a combination of immunohistochemistry, affinity chromatography and proteomics, we identified the extracellular matrix heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan perlecan as a G6b-B binding partner. Subsequent &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; biochemical studies and a cell-based genetic screen demonstrated that the interaction is specifically mediated by the HS chains of perlecan. Biophysical analysis revealed that heparin forms a high-affinity complex with G6b-B and mediates dimerization. Using platelets from humans and genetically-modified mice, we demonstrate that binding of G6b-B to HS and multivalent heparin inhibits platelet and megakaryocyte function by inducing downstream signaling via the tyrosine phosphatases Shp1 and Shp2. Our findings provide novel insights into how G6b-B is regulated and contribute to our understanding of the interaction of megakaryocytes and platelets with glycans.</content>

 The &lt;i&gt;de novo &lt;/i&gt;emergence of new genes has been well documented through genomic analyses. However, a functional analysis, especially of very young protein-coding genes, is still largely lacking. Here, we identify a set of house mouse-specific protein-coding genes and assess their translation by ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry data. We functionally analyze one of them, &lt;i&gt;Gm13030&lt;/i&gt;, which is specifically expressed in females in the oviduct. The interruption of the reading frame affects the transcriptional network in the oviducts at a specific stage of the estrous cycle. This includes the upregulation of &lt;i&gt;Dcpp&lt;/i&gt; genes, which are known to stimulate the growth of preimplantation embryos. As a consequence, knockout females have their second litters after shorter times and have a higher infanticide rate. Given that &lt;i&gt;Gm13030&lt;/i&gt; shows no signs of positive selection, our findings support the hypothesis that a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; evolved gene can directly adopt a function without much sequence adaptation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Many eukaryotic proteins regulating phosphate (Pi) homeostasis contain SPX domains that are receptors for inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsP), suggesting that PP-InsPs may regulate Pi homeostasis. Here we report that deletion of two diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases VIH1/2 impairs plant growth and leads to constitutive Pi starvation responses. Deletion of phosphate starvation response transcription factors partially rescues vih1 vih2 mutant phenotypes, placing diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases in plant Pi signal transduction cascades. VIH1/2 are bifunctional enzymes able to generate and break-down PP-InsPs. Mutations in the kinase active site lead to increased Pi levels and constitutive Pi starvation responses. ATP levels change significantly in different Pi growth conditions. ATP-Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations shift the relative kinase and phosphatase activities of diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases in vitro. Pi inhibits the phosphatase activity of the enzyme. Thus, VIH1 and VIH2 relay changes in cellular ATP and Pi concentrations to changes in PP-InsP levels, allowing plants to maintain sufficient Pi levels.</content>

 Animals survive environmental challenges by adapting their physiology and behavior through homeostatic regulatory processes, mediated in part by specific neuropeptide release from the hypothalamus. Animals can also avoid environmental stressors within seconds, a fast behavioral adaptation for which hypothalamic involvement is not established. Using brain-wide neural activity imaging in behaving zebrafish, here we find that hypothalamic neurons are rapidly engaged during common avoidance responses elicited by various environmental stressors. By developing methods to register cellular-resolution neural dynamics to multiplexed in situ gene expression, we find that each category of stressor recruits similar combinations of multiple peptidergic cell types in the hypothalamus. Anatomical analysis and functional manipulations demonstrate that these diverse cell types play shared roles in behavior, are glutamatergic, and converge upon spinal-projecting brainstem neurons required for avoidance. These data demonstrate that hypothalamic neural populations, classically associated with slow and specific homeostatic adaptations, also together give rise to fast and generalized avoidance behavior.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is a major hub of the reward system and has been shown to activate specifically in response to pleasant / rewarding stimuli. Previous studies demonstrate enhanced pleasant cue reactivity after single applications of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the vmPFC. Here we present a pilot case study in which we assess the cumulative impact of multiple consecutive vmPFC-tDCS sessions on the processing of visual emotional stimuli in an event-related MEG recording design. The results point to stable modulation of increased positivity biases (pleasant &amp;gt; unpleasant stimulus signal strength) after excitatory vmPFC stimulation and a reversed pattern (pleasant &amp;lt; unpleasant) after inhibitory stimulation across five consecutive tDCS sessions. Moreover, cumulative effects of these emotional bias modulations were observable for several source-localized spatio-temporal clusters, suggesting an increase in modulatory efficiency by repeated tDCS sessions. This pilot study provides evidence for improvements in the effectiveness and utility of a novel tDCS paradigm in the context of emotional processing.</content>

 Animals need to remember the locations of nourishing and toxic food sources for survival, a fact that necessitates a mechanism for associating taste experiences with particular places. We have previously identified such responses within hippocampal place cells, the activity of which is thought to aid memory-guided behavior by forming a mental map of an animal's environment that can be reshaped through experience. It remains unknown, however, whether specific place cells are preconfigured to respond to tastes, or whether taste-responsiveness emerges as a result of experience that reorganizes spatial maps. Here, we recorded from neurons in the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region of rats running for taste rewards delivered via intra-oral cannulae at specific locations on a linear track. We found that taste responsiveness was inherent to a subset of cells that, even prior to taste delivery, had larger place fields than non-taste-responsive cells overlapping with stimulus delivery zones. Taste-responsive cells' place fields then contracted, as a result of taste exposure, to be more restricted to stimulus delivery zones, leading to a stronger representation of rewarded areas on the track. These remapped units exhibited increased sharp-wave ripple co-activation during the taste delivery session, which correlated with the degree of place field contraction. Our results suggest that taste responsivity is preconfigured in a subset of hippocampal place cells, whose spatial representations are then refined by sensory experience to signal reward. This represents a possible mechanism by which animals identify and remember locations where ecologically relevant stimuli are found within their environment.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In the nervous system, the properties of neurons must be matched to their role within the network [1]. In vision, this begins with light detection by photoreceptors [2-5]. Because different behaviourally critical visual stimuli tend to appear in different parts of visual space, photoreceptors should be adjusted depending on their location in the eye [6-12]. However, a direct link between an animal's specific visual requirements [13], a corresponding regional tuning of photoreceptors, and their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms has not been made. Here we show that UV-cones in the larval zebrafish area temporalis [14] are specifically tuned for UV-bright prey capture in their upper frontal visual field, which uses the signal from a single cone at a time. For this, UV-detection efficiency is regionally boosted 42-fold. Next, in vivo 2-photon imaging, transcriptomics and computational modelling reveal that these cones use an elevated baseline of synaptic calcium to facilitate the encoding of bright objects, which in turn results from expressional tuning of phototransduction genes [3,15,16]. Finally, this signal is further accentuated at the level of glutamate release driving retinal networks. Our results demonstrate how same-type photoreceptors can be regionally tuned at the level of cellular anatomy, biochemical pathways and synaptic function to support specific tasks within the eye. These regional differences tally with variations between peripheral and foveal cones in primates [10,12,17,18] and hint at a common mechanistic origin. Together, our results highlight a rich mechanistic toolkit for the tuning of neurons.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Kalirin-7 (Kal7) is a Rac1/RhoG GEF and multidomain scaffold localized to the postsynaptic density which plays an important role in synaptic plasticity. Behavioral and physiological phenotypes observed in the Kal7 knockout mouse are quite specific: genetics of breeding, growth, strength and coordination are normal; Kal7 knockout animals self-administer cocaine far more than normal mice, show exaggerated locomotor responses to cocaine, but lack changes in dendritic spine morphology seen in wildtype mice; Kal7 knockout mice have depressed surface expression of GluN2B receptor subunits and exhibit marked suppression of long-term potentiation and depression in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord; and Kal7 knockout mice have dramatically blunted perception of pain. To address the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms which are deranged by loss of Kal7, we administered intracellular blocking peptides to acutely change Kal7 function at the synapse, to determine if plasticity deficits in Kal7-/- mice are the product of developmental processes since conception, or could be detected on a much shorter time scale. We found that specific disruption of the interactions of Kal7 with PSD-95 or GluN2B resulted in significant suppression of long-term potentiation and long-term depression. Biochemical approaches indicated that Kal7 interacted with PSD-95 at multiple sites within Kal7.</content>

 The neurohypophysis (NH), located at the posterior lobe of the pituitary, is a major neuroendocrine tissue, which mediates osmotic balance, blood pressure, reproduction, and lactation by means of releasing the neurohormones oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin from the brain into the peripheral blood circulation. The major cellular components of the NH are hypothalamic axonal termini, fenestrated endothelia and pituicytes, the resident astroglia. However, despite the physiological importance of the NH, the exact molecular signature defining neurohypophyseal cell types and in particular the pituicytes, remains unclear. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we captured seven distinct cell types in the NH and intermediate lobe (IL) of adult male mouse. We revealed novel pituicyte markers showing higher specificity than previously reported markers. Multiplexing single molecule in situ hybridization revealed spatial organization of the major cell types implying intercellular communications. We present a comprehensive molecular and cellular characterization of neurohypophyseal cell-types serving as a valuable resource for further functional research.</content>

 Many objects that we encounter have &quot;typical&quot; material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft and jelly dessert is wobbly. Over a life time of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when pulled apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object's kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes &quot;pulled&quot; towards the &quot;native&quot; motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in reaction time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance. Understanding how high-level expectations are integrated with incoming sensory evidence is an essential step towards understanding how the human visual system accomplishes material perception.</content>

 Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are indispensable to maintain excitatory/inhibitory balance in neuronal circuits controlling reflex and rhythmic motor behaviors. Here we have developed Glyght, the first GlyR ligand controlled with light. It is selective over other cys-loop receptors, active in vivo, and displays an allosteric mechanism of action. The photomanipulation of glycinergic neurotransmission opens new avenues to understand inhibitory circuits in intact animals, and to develop drug-based phototherapies.</content>

 To gain novel insights into how the human brain processes self-produced auditory information during reading aloud, we investigated the coupling between neuromagnetic activity and the temporal envelope of the heard speech sounds (i.e., speech brain tracking) in a group of adults who 1) read a text aloud, 2) listened to a recording of their own speech (i.e., playback), and 3) listened to another speech recording. Coherence analyses revealed that, during reading aloud, the reader's brain tracked the slow temporal fluctuations of the speech output. Specifically, auditory cortices tracked phrasal structure (&amp;lt;1 Hz) but to a lesser extent than during the two speech listening conditions. Also, the tracking of syllable structure (4-8 Hz) occurred at parietal opercula during reading aloud and at auditory cortices during listening. Directionality analyses based on renormalized partial directed coherence revealed that speech brain tracking at &amp;lt;1 Hz and 4-8 Hz is dominated by speech-to-brain directional coupling during both reading aloud and listening, meaning that speech brain tracking mainly entails auditory feedback processing. Nevertheless, brain-to-speech directional coupling at 4-8 Hz was enhanced during reading aloud compared with listening, likely reflecting speech monitoring before production. Altogether, these data bring novel insights into how auditory verbal information is tracked by the human brain during perception and self-generation of connected speech.</content>

 The contribution of microglia in neurological disorders is emerging as a leading driver rather than a consequence of pathology. RNAseT2-deficient leukoencephalopathy is a severe childhood white matter disorder affecting patients in their first year of life and mimics a cytomegalovirus brain infection. The early onset and resemblance of the symptoms to an immune response suggest an inflammatory and embryonic origin of the pathology. In this study, we identify deficient microglia as an early marker of pathology. Using the ex utero development and the optical transparency of an rnaset2-deficient zebrafish model, we found that dysfunctional microglia fail to clear apoptotic neurons during brain development. This was associated with increased number of apoptotic cells and behavioural defects lasting into adulthood. This zebrafish model recapitulates all aspect of the human disease to be used as a robust preclinical model. Using microglia-specific depletion and rescue experiments, we identified microglia as potential drivers of the pathology and highlight tissue-specific approaches as future therapeutic avenues.</content>

		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/744094v1?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 Aside from the core language-specific left-lateralized fronto-temporal network, language comprehension sometimes additionally recruits a domain-general bilateral fronto-parietal network implicated in executive functions: the multiple demand (MD) network. However, the nature of the MD network's contributions to language comprehension remains debated. To illuminate the role of this network in language processing, we conducted a large-scale fMRI investigation using data from 30 diverse word and sentence comprehension experiments (481 unique participants, 678 scanning sessions). In line with prior findings, the MD network was active during many language tasks. Moreover, similar to the language-specific network, which is robustly lateralized to the left hemisphere, these responses were stronger in the left-hemisphere MD regions. However, in stark contrast with the language-specific network, the MD network responded more strongly (i) to lists of unconnected words than to sentences, and critically, (ii) in paradigms with an explicit task compared to passive comprehension paradigms. In fact, many passive comprehension tasks failed to elicit a response above the fixation baseline in the MD network, in contrast to strong responses in the language-specific network. In tandem, these results argue against a role for the MD network in core aspects of sentence comprehension like inhibiting irrelevant meanings or parses, keeping intermediate representations active in working memory, or predicting upcoming words or structures. These results align with recent evidence of relatively poor tracking of the linguistic signal by the MD regions during naturalistic comprehension, and instead suggest that the MD network's engagement during language processing reflects effort associated with extraneous task demands.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Due the absence of core clinical features, many subjects with neuropathologically-diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are never diagnosed as such during life. Most of these are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) or unspecified dementia. Unrecognized DLB therefore is a critical impediment to clinical studies and treatment trials of both ADD and DLB. There are numerous published studies that suggest that olfactory function tests may be able to differentiate some neurodegenerative conditions from each other and from normal subjects, but there are very few studies with neuropathological confirmation of diagnosis. We compared University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) results in 209 subjects, 29 concurrently meeting intermediate or high consensus clinicopathological criteria for both DLB and ADD, 96 meeting criteria for ADD without DLB and 84 control subjects without dementia or parkinsonism at death. The DLB subjects had significantly lower (one-way ANOVA p &amp;lt; 0.0001, pairwise Bonferroni p &amp;lt; 0.05) first and mean UPSIT scores (13.7 and 13.2) than ADD (23.3 and 22.2) or controls (29.6 and 28.9). For subjects with first and mean UPSIT scores less than 20 and 17, respectively, Firth logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, gender and mean MMSE score, conferred statistically significant odds ratios of 17.5 and 18.0 for predicting a DLB vs ADD diagnosis, as compared to 3.3 for the presence of absence of visual hallucinations throughout the clinical observation period. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date comparing olfactory function in subjects with neuropathologically confirmed DLB and ADD. Olfactory function testing may be a convenient and inexpensive strategy for enriching dementia studies or clinical trials with DLB subjects, or conversely, reducing the inclusion of DLB subjects in ADD studies or trials.</content>

 Numerous brain regions have been identified as contributing to addiction-like behaviors, but unclear is the way in which these brain regions as a whole lead to addiction. The search for a final common brain pathway that is involved in addiction remains elusive. To address this question, we used male C57BL/6J mice and performed single-cell whole-brain imaging of neural activity during withdrawal from cocaine, methamphetamine, and nicotine. We used hierarchical clustering and graph theory to identify similarities and differences in brain functional architecture. Although methamphetamine and cocaine shared some network similarities, the main common neuroadaptation between these psychostimulant drugs was a dramatic decrease in modularity, with a shift from a cortical- to subcortical-driven network, including a decrease in total hub brain regions. These results demonstrate that psychostimulant withdrawal produces the drug-dependent remodeling of functional architecture of the brain and suggest that the decreased modularity of brain functional networks and not a specific set of brain regions may represent the final common pathway that leads to addiction.</content>

 The identification of community structure in graphs continues to attract great interest in several fields. Network neuroscience is particularly concerned with this problem considering the key roles communities play in brain processes and functionality. Most methods used for community detection in brain graphs are based on the maximization of a highly parameter-dependent modularity function. In practice, the parametrization of this function often obscures the physical meaning and hierarchical organization of the partitions of network nodes. In this work, we present a new method able to detect communities at different scales in a natural, unrestricted way. First, to obtain an estimation of the information flow in the network we release random walkers to freely move over it. The activity of the walkers is separated into oscillatory modes by using empirical mode decomposition. After grouping nodes by their co-occurrence at each time scale, the so-called k-modes clustering returns the desired partitions. Our algorithm was first tested on benchmark graphs with favorable performance. We used the method on brain networks, including the anatomical connectivity of the macaque and human brains and a model for the interactions between nodes. We found a repertoire of community structures in the anatomical and functional networks, with a clear link existing between these two. The observed partitions range from the evident division in two hemispheres -in which all processes are managed globally- to specialized communities seemingly given by physical proximity and shared function. Our results stimulate the research of hierarchical community organization in terms of temporal scales of information flow.</content>

 The developing brain can respond quickly to altered sensory experience by circuit reorganization. During a critical period in early life, neurons in the primary visual cortex rapidly lose responsiveness to an occluded eye and come to respond better to the open eye. While physiological and some of the molecular mechanisms of this process have been characterized, its structural basis, except for the well-known changes in the thalamocortical projection, remains obscure. To elucidate the relationship between synaptic remodeling and functional changes during this experience-dependent process, we used 2-photon microscopy to image synaptic structures of sparsely labeled layer 2/3 neurons in the binocular zone of mouse primary visual cortex. Anatomical changes at presynaptic and postsynaptic sites in mice undergoing monocular visual deprivation (MD) were compared to those in control mice with normal visual experience. We found that postsynaptic spines remodeled quickly in response to MD, with neurons more strongly dominated by the deprived eye losing more spines. These postsynaptic changes parallel changes in visual responses during MD and their recovery after restoration of binocular vision. In control animals with normal visual experience, the formation of presynaptic boutons increased during the critical period and then declined. MD affected bouton formation, but with a delay, blocking it after 3 days. These findings reveal intracortical anatomical changes in cellular layers of the cortex that can account for rapid activity-dependent plasticity.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Age-related neural dedifferentiation, reduced distinctiveness of neural representations in the aging brain, has been associated with age-related declines in cognitive abilities. But why does neural distinctiveness decline with age? Based on prior work in non-human primates, we hypothesized that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) declines with age and is associated with neural dedifferentiation. To test this hypothesis, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and functional MRI (fMRI) to measure neural distinctiveness in the ventral visual cortex in a set of older and younger participants. Relative to younger adults, older adults exhibited lower GABA levels and less distinct activation patterns for faces and houses in the ventral visual cortex. Furthermore, individual differences in GABA within older adults predicted individual differences in neural distinctiveness even after controlling for gray matter volume and age. These results provide novel support for the view that age-related reductions of GABA contribute to age-related reductions in neural distinctiveness (i.e., neural dedifferentiation) in the human ventral visual cortex.</content>

		<content type="html">
 A fundamental feature of sleep is reduced behavioral responsiveness to external events, but the extent of processing along sensory pathways remains poorly understood. While responses are comparable across wakefulness and sleep in auditory cortex (AC), neuronal activity in downstream regions remains unknown. Here we recorded spiking activity in 435 neuronal clusters evoked by acoustic stimuli in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and in AC of freely behaving male rats across wakefulness and sleep. Neuronal responses in AC showed modest (around 10%) differences in response gain across vigilance states, replicating previous studies. By contrast, PRC neuronal responses were robustly attenuated by 47% and 36% during NREM sleep and REM sleep, respectively. Beyond the separation according to cortical region, response latency in each neuronal cluster was correlated with the degree of NREM sleep attenuation, such that late (&amp;gt;40ms) responses in all monitored regions diminished during NREM sleep. The robust attenuation of late responses prevalent in PRC represents a novel neural correlate of sensory disconnection during sleep, opening new avenues for investigating the mediating mechanisms.</content>

 This paper reports the development of a high-resolution 3-D MRI atlas of the Fischer 344 adult rat brain. The atlas is a 60 m isotropic image volume composed of 256 coronal slices with 98 manually delineated structures and substructures. The atlas was developed using Pydpiper image registration pipeline to create an average brain image of 41 four-month-old male and female Fischer 344 rats. Slices in the average brain image were then digitally segmented, individually and bilaterally, on the basis of image contrast in conjunction with Paxinos and Watson's (2007) stereotaxic rat brain atlas. Summary statistics (mean and standard deviation of regional volumes) are reported for each brain region across the sample used to generate the atlas, and a statistical comparison of a chosen subset of regional brain volumes between male and female rats is presented. On average, the coefficient of variation of regional brain volumes across all rats in our sample was 5%, with no individual brain region having a coefficient of variation greater than 14%. A full description of methods used, as well as the atlas, the template that the atlas was derived from, and a masking file, can be found at https://www.nearlab.xyz/fischer344atlas. To our knowledge, this is the first MRI atlas created using Fischer 344 rats and will thus provide an appropriate neuroanatomical model for researchers working with this strain.</content>

 Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has devastating implications for patients, including a high predisposition for developing chronic pain distal to the site of injury. Chronic pain develops weeks to months after injury, consequently patients are treated after irreparable changes have occurred. Nociceptors are central to chronic pain; however, the diversity of this cellular population presents challenges to understanding mechanisms and attributing pain modalities to specific cell types. To begin to address how peripheral sensory neurons distal to the site of injury may contribute to the below-level pain reported by SCI patients, we examined SCI-induced changes in gene expression in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) below the site of injury. SCI was performed at the T10 vertebral level, with injury produced by a vessel clip with a closing pressure of 15g for 1 minute. Alterations in gene expression produce long-term sensory changes, therefore we were interested in studying SCI-induced transcripts before the onset of chronic pain, which may trigger changes in downstream signaling pathways and ultimately facilitate the transmission of pain. To examine changes in the nociceptor subpopulation in DRG distal to the site of injury, we retrograde labeled sensory neurons projecting to the hairy hindpaw skin with fluorescent dye and collected the corresponding lumbar (L2-L6) DRG 4 days post-injury. Following dissociation, labeled neurons were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. RNA was extracted from sorted sensory neurons of naive, sham, or SCI mice and sequenced. Transcript abundances validated that the desired population of nociceptors were isolated. Cross-comparisons to data sets from similar studies confirmed we were able to isolate our cells of interest and identify a unique pattern of gene expression within a subpopulation of neurons projecting to the hairy hindpaw skin. Differential gene expression analysis showed high expression levels and significant transcript changes 4 days post-injury in SCI cell populations relevant to the onset of chronic pain. Regulatory interrelationships predicted by pathway analysis implicated changes within the synaptogenesis signaling pathway as well as networks related to inflammatory signaling mechanisms, suggesting a role for synaptic plasticity and a correlation with pro-inflammatory signaling in the transition from acute to chronic pain.</content>

Long-read sequencing and novel long-range assays have revolutionized &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; genome assembly by automating the reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. In particular, Hi-C sequencing is becoming an economical method for generating chromosome-scale scaffolds. Despite its increasing popularity, there are limited open-source tools available. Errors, particularly inversions and fusions across chromosomes, remain higher than alternate scaffolding technologies. We present a novel open-source Hi-C scaffolder that does not require an &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; estimate of chromosome number and minimizes errors by scaffolding with the assistance of an assembly graph. We demonstrate higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods across a variety of Hi-C library preparations and input assembly sizes. The Python and C++ code for our method is openly available at https://github.com/machinegun/SALSA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c1Anyb3UafQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A major tenet in theoretical neuroscience is that cognitive and behavioral processes are ultimately implemented in terms of the neural system dynamics. Accordingly, a major aim for the analysis of neurophysiological measurements should lie in the identification of the computational dynamics underlying task processing. Here we advance a state space model (SSM) based on generative piecewise-linear recurrent neural networks (PLRNN) to assess dynamics from neuroimaging data. In contrast to many other nonlinear time series models which have been proposed for reconstructing latent dynamics, our model is easily interpretable in neural terms, amenable to systematic dynamical systems analysis of the resulting set of equations, and can straightforwardly be transformed into an equivalent continuous-time dynamical system. The major contributions of this paper are the introduction of a new observation model suitable for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coupled to the latent PLRNN, an efficient stepwise training procedure that forces the latent model to capture the ‘true’ underlying dynamics rather than just fitting (or predicting) the observations, and of an empirical measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence to evaluate from empirical time series how well this goal of approximating the underlying dynamics has been achieved. We validate and illustrate the power of our approach on simulated ‘ground-truth’ dynamical systems as well as on experimental fMRI time series, and demonstrate that the learnt dynamics harbors task-related nonlinear structure that a linear dynamical model fails to capture. Given that fMRI is one of the most common techniques for measuring brain activity non-invasively in human subjects, this approach may provide a novel step toward analyzing aberrant (nonlinear) dynamics for clinical assessment or neuroscientific research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4NcN7CCED4s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Phenotypic plasticity is a vital strategy for plants to deal with changing conditions by inducing phenotypes favourable in different environments. Understanding how natural selection acts on variation in phenotypic plasticity in plants is therefore a central question in ecology, but is often ignored in modelling studies. Here we present a new modelling approach that allows for the analysis of selection for variation in phenotypic plasticity as a response strategy. We assess selection for shade avoidance strategies of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; in response to future neighbour shading signalled through a decrease in red:far-red (R:FR) ratio. For this, we used a spatially explicit 3D virtual plant model that simulates individual Arabidopsis plants competing for light in different planting densities. Plant structure and growth were determined by the organ-specific interactions with the light environment created by the vegetation structure itself. Shade avoidance plastic responses were defined by a plastic response curve relating petiole elongation and lamina growth to R:FR perceived locally. Different plasticity strategies were represented by different shapes of the response curve that expressed different levels of R:FR sensitivity. Our analyses show that the shape of the selected shade avoidance strategy varies with planting density. At higher planting densities, more sensitive response curves are selected for than at lower densities. In addition, the balance between lamina and petiole responses influences the sensitivity of the response curves selected for. Combining computational virtual plant modelling with a game theoretical analysis represents a new step towards analysing how natural selection could have acted upon variation in shade avoidance as a response strategy, which can be linked to genetic variation and underlying physiological processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_o4szQJj4ww&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Our understanding of how chromosomes structurally organize and dynamically interact has been revolutionized through the lens of long-chain polymer physics. Major protein contributors to chromosome structure and dynamics are condensin and cohesin that stochastically generate loops within and between chains, and entrap proximal strands of sister chromatids. In this paper, we explore the ability of transient, protein-mediated, gene-gene crosslinks to induce clusters of genes, thereby dynamic architecture, within the highly repeated ribosomal DNA that comprises the nucleolus of budding yeast. We implement three approaches: live cell microscopy; computational modeling of the full genome during G1 in budding yeast, exploring four decades of timescales for transient crosslinks between 5&lt;i&gt;kbp&lt;/i&gt; domains (genes) in the nucleolus on Chromosome XII; and, temporal network models with automated community (cluster) detection algorithms applied to the full range of 4D modeling datasets. The data analysis tools detect and track gene clusters, their size, number, persistence time, and their plasticity (deformation). Of biological significance, our analysis reveals an optimal mean crosslink lifetime that promotes pairwise and cluster gene interactions through “flexible” clustering. In this state, large gene clusters self-assemble yet frequently interact (merge and separate), marked by gene exchanges between clusters, which in turn maximizes global gene interactions in the nucleolus. This regime stands between two limiting cases each with far less global gene interactions: with shorter crosslink lifetimes, “rigid” clustering emerges with clusters that interact infrequently; with longer crosslink lifetimes, there is a dissolution of clusters. These observations are compared with imaging experiments on a normal yeast strain and two condensin-modified mutant cell strains. We apply the same image analysis pipeline to the experimental and simulated datasets, providing support for the modeling predictions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ekF0_71Hr84&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The formation of a membrane-enveloped virus starts with the assembly of a curved layer of capsid proteins lining the interior of the plasma membrane (PM) of the host cell. This layer develops into a spherical shell (capsid) enveloped by a lipid-rich membrane. In many cases, the budding process &lt;i&gt;stalls&lt;/i&gt; prior to the release of the virus. Recently, Brownian dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model system reproduced protracted pausing and stalling, which suggests that the origin of pausing/stalling is to be found in the physics of the budding process. Here, we propose that the pausing/stalling observed in the simulations can be understood as a &lt;i&gt;purely kinetic&lt;/i&gt; phenomenon associated with the neck geometry. A &lt;i&gt;geometrical&lt;/i&gt; potential energy barrier develops during the budding that must be overcome by capsid proteins diffusing along the membrane prior to incorporation into the capsid. The barrier is generated by a conflict between the positive Gauss curvature of the assembling capsid and the negative Gauss curvature of the neck region. A continuum theory description is proposed and is compared with the Brownian simulations of the budding of enveloped viruses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8O3cXINIou8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25582?af=R"/>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizure at onset (SaO) has been considered a relative contraindication for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke, although this appraisal is not evidence‐based. Here, we investigated the prognostic significance of SaO in patients treated with IVT for suspected ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multicenter, IVT‐registry‐based study we assessed the association between SaO and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH, ECASS‐II definition), 3‐month mortality and 3‐month functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, coarsened exact matching and inverse probability weighted analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 10,074 IVT‐treated patients, 146 (1.5%) had SaO. SaO patients had significantly higher NIHSS and glucose on admission and more often female sex, prior stroke and prior functional dependence than non‐SaO patients. In unadjusted analysis, they had generally less favorable outcomes. After controlling for confounders in adjusted, matched and weighted analyses, all associations between SaO and any of the outcomes disappeared, including sICH (odds ratio [OR]&lt;sub&gt;unadjusted&lt;/sub&gt; 1.53 [95% confidence interval: 0.74,3.14], OR&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; 0.52[0.13,2.16], OR&lt;sub&gt;matched&lt;/sub&gt; 0.68[0.15,3.03], OR&lt;sub&gt;weighted&lt;/sub&gt; 0.95[0.39,2.32]), mortality (OR&lt;sub&gt;unadjusted&lt;/sub&gt; 1.49[1.00,2.24], OR&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; 0.98[0.5,1.92], OR&lt;sub&gt;matched&lt;/sub&gt; 1.13[0.55,2.33]&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; OR&lt;sub&gt;weighted&lt;/sub&gt; 1.17[0.73,1.88]) and functional outcome (mRS≥3 / ordinal mRS: OR&lt;sub&gt;unadjusted&lt;/sub&gt; 1.33[0.96,1.84] / 1.35[1.01,1.81], OR&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; 0.78[0.45,1.32] / 0.78[0.52,1.16], OR&lt;sub&gt;matched&lt;/sub&gt; 0.75[0.43,1.32] / 0.45[0.10,2.06], OR&lt;sub&gt;weighted&lt;/sub&gt; 0.87[0.57,1.34] / 1.00[0.66,1.52]). These results were consistent regardless of whether patients had an eventual diagnosis of ischemic stroke (89/146) or stroke mimic (57/146 SaO patients).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaO was not an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Withholding IVT from patients with assumed ischemic stroke presenting with SaO seems unjustified.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A major cause of human blindness is the death of rod photoreceptors. As rods degenerate, synaptic structures between rod and rod bipolar cells disappear and the rod bipolar cells extend their dendrites and occasionally make aberrant contacts. Such changes are broadly observed in blinding disorders caused by photoreceptor cell death and are thought to occur in response to deafferentation. How the remodeled retinal circuit affects visual processing following rod rescue is not known. To address this question, we generated male and female transgenic mice wherein a disrupted cGMP-gated channel (CNG) gene can be repaired at the endogenous locus and at different stages of degeneration by tamoxifen-inducible cre-mediated recombination. In normal rods, light-induced closure of CNG channels leads to hyperpolarization of the cell, reducing neurotransmitter release at the synapse. Similarly, rods lacking CNG channels exhibit a resting membrane potential that was ~10 mV hyperpolarized compared to WT rods, indicating diminished glutamate release. Retinas from these mice undergo stereotypic retinal remodeling as a consequence of rod malfunction and degeneration. Upon tamoxifen-induced expression of CNG channels, rods recovered their structure and exhibited normal light responses. Moreover, we show that the adult mouse retina displays a surprising degree of plasticity upon activation of rod input. Wayward bipolar cell dendrites establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings demonstrate remarkable plasticity extending beyond the developmental period and support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current strategies for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders are focused on the repair of the primary affected cell type. However, the defective neurons function within a complex neural circuitry, which also becomes degraded during disease. It is not known whether rescued neurons and the remodeled circuit will establish communication to regain normal function. We show that the adult mammalian neural retina exhibits a surprising degree of plasticity following rescue of rod photoreceptors. The wayward dendrites of rod bipolar cells re-establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tau is a microtubule (MT)-associated protein that is localized to the axon. In Alzheimer's disease, the distribution of tau undergoes a remarkable alteration, leading to the formation of tau inclusions in the somatodendritic compartment. To investigate how this mislocalization occurs, we recently developed immunohistochemical tools that can separately detect endogenous mouse and exogenous human tau with high sensitivity, which allows us to visualize not only the pathological but also the pre-aggregated tau in mouse brain tissues of both sexes. Using these antibodies, we found that in tau-transgenic mouse brains, exogenous human tau was abundant in dendrites and somata even in the presymptomatic period, whereas the axonal localization of endogenous mouse tau was unaffected. In stark contrast, exogenous tau was properly localized to the axon in human tau knock-in mice. We tracked this difference to the temporal expression patterns of tau. Endogenous mouse tau and exogenous human tau in human tau knock-in mice exhibited high expression levels during the neonatal period and strong suppression into the adulthood. However, human tau in transgenic mice was expressed continuously and at high levels in adult animals. These results indicated the uncontrolled expression of exogenous tau beyond the developmental period as a cause of mislocalization in the transgenic mice. Superresolution microscopic and biochemical analyses also indicated that the interaction between MTs and exogenous tau was impaired only in the tau-transgenic mice, but not in knock-in mice. Thus, the ectopic expression of tau may be critical for its somatodendritic mislocalization, a key step of the tauopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Somatodendritic localization of tau may be an early step leading to the neuronal degeneration in tauopathies. However, the mechanisms of the normal axonal distribution of tau and the mislocalization of pathological tau remain obscure. Our immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the endogenous mouse tau is transiently expressed in neonatal brains, that exogenous human tau expressed corresponding to such tau expression profile can distribute into the axon, and that the constitutive expression of tau into adulthood (e.g., human tau in transgenic mice) results in abnormal somatodendritic localization. Thus, the expression profile of tau is tightly associated with the localization of tau, and the ectopic expression of tau in matured neurons may be involved in the pathogenesis of tauopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that presently affects an estimated 5.7 million Americans. Understanding the basis for this disease is key for the development of a future successful treatment. In this effort, we previously reported that mouse prion protein-promoter-driven, ubiquitous expression of familial AD (FAD)-linked human &lt;i&gt;PSEN1&lt;/i&gt; variants in transgenic mice impairs environmental enrichment (EE)-induced proliferation and neurogenesis of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (AHNPCs) and in a non-cell autonomous manner. These findings were confirmed in &lt;i&gt;PS1&lt;sup&gt;M146V/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice that harbor an FAD-linked mutation in the endogenous &lt;i&gt;PSEN1&lt;/i&gt; gene. We now demonstrate that CSF1R antagonist-mediated microglial depletion in transgenic male mice expressing mutant presenilin 1 (PS1) or &lt;i&gt;PS1&lt;sup&gt;M146V/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &quot;knock-in&quot; mice leads to a complete rescue of deficits in proliferation, differentiation and survival of AHNPCs. Moreover, microglia depletion suppressed the heightened baseline anxiety behavior observed in transgenic mice expressing mutant PS1 and &lt;i&gt;PS1&lt;sup&gt;M146V/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice to levels observed in mice expressing wild-type human PS1 or nontransgenic mice, respectively. These findings demonstrate that in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1, microglia play a critical role in the regulation of EE-dependent AHNPC proliferation and neurogenesis and the modulation of affective behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inheritance of mutations in genes encoding presenilin 1 (PS1) causes familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Mutant PS1 expression enhances the levels and assembly of toxic Aβ42 peptides and impairs the self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (AHNPCs) following environmental enrichment (EE) that is associated with heightened baseline anxiety. We now show that microglial depletion fully restores the EE-mediated impairments in AHNPC phenotypes and suppresses the heightened baseline anxiety observed in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1. Thus, we conclude that the memory deficits and anxiety-related behaviors in patients with PS1 mutations is a reflection not just of an increase in the levels of Aβ42 peptides, but to impairments in the self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of AHNPCs that modulate affective behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Muscle responses to mechanical disturbances exhibit two distinct phases: a response starting at ~20 ms that is fairly stereotyped, and a response starting at ~60 ms modulated by many behavioral contexts including goal-redundancy and environmental obstacles. Muscle responses to disturbances of visual feedback of the hand arise within ~90 ms. However, little is known whether these muscle responses are sensitive to behavioral contexts. We had 49 human participants (27 male) execute goal-directed reaches with visual feedback of their hand presented as a cursor. On random trials, the cursor jumped laterally to the reach direction, and thus, required a correction to attain the goal. The first experiment demonstrated that the response amplitude starting at 90 ms scaled with jump magnitude, but only for jumps &amp;lt;2 cm. For larger jumps, the duration of the muscle response scaled with the jump size starting after 120 ms. The second experiment demonstrated that the early response was sensitive to goal redundancy as wider targets evoked a smaller corrective response. The third experiment demonstrated that the early response did not consider the presence of obstacles, as this response routinely drove participants directly to the goal even though this path was blocked by an obstacle. Instead, the appropriate muscle response to navigate around the obstacle started after 120 ms. Our findings highlight that visual feedback of the limb involves two distinct phases: a response starting at 90 ms with limited sensitivity to jump magnitude and sensitive to goal-redundancy, and a response starting at 120 ms with increased sensitivity to jump magnitude and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The motor system can integrate proprioceptive feedback to guide an ongoing action in ~60 ms and is flexible to a broad range of behavioral contexts. In contrast, the present study identified that the motor response to a visual disturbance exhibits two distinct phases: an early response starting at 90 ms with limited scaling with disturbance size and sensitivity to goal-redundancy, and a slower response starting after 120 ms with increased sensitivity to disturbance size and sensitive to environmental obstacles. These data suggest visual feedback of the hand is processed through two distinct feedback processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A mental representation of the location of an object can be constructed using sensory information selected from the environment and information stored internally. Human electrophysiological evidence indicates that behaviorally relevant locations, regardless of the source of sensory information, are represented in alpha-band oscillations suggesting a shared process. Here, we present evidence from human subjects of either sex for two distinct alpha-band-based processes that separately support the representation of location, exploiting sensory evidence sampled either externally or internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our sensory environment and our internal trains of thought are coded in patterns of brain activity and are used to guide coherent behavior. Oscillations in the alpha-frequency band are a predominant feature of human brain activity. This oscillation plays a central role in both selective attention and working memory, suggesting that these important cognitive functions are mediated by a unitary mechanism. We show that the alpha oscillation reflects two distinct processes, one that is supported by continuous sampling of the external sensory environment, and one that is based on sampling from internal representations coded in visual short-term memory. This represents a significant change in our understanding of the nature of alpha oscillations and their relationship to attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Retrieval of learning-related neural activity patterns is thought to drive memory stabilization. However, finding reliable, noninvasive, content-specific indicators of memory retrieval remains a central challenge. Here, we attempted to decode the content of retrieved memories in the EEG during sleep. During encoding, male and female human subjects learned to associate spatial locations of visual objects with left- or right-hand movements, and each object was accompanied by an inherently related sound. During subsequent slow-wave sleep within an afternoon nap, we presented half of the sound cues that were associated (during wake) with left- and right-hand movements before bringing subjects back for a final postnap test. We trained a classifier on sleep EEG data (focusing on lateralized EEG features that discriminated left- vs right-sided trials during wake) to predict learning content when we cued the memories during sleep. Discrimination performance was significantly above chance and predicted subsequent memory, supporting the idea that retrieval leads to memory stabilization. Moreover, these lateralized signals increased with postcue sleep spindle power, demonstrating that retrieval has a strong relationship with spindles. These results show that lateralized activity related to individual memories can be decoded from sleep EEG, providing an effective indicator of offline retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Memories are thought to be retrieved during sleep, leading to their long-term stabilization. However, there has been relatively little work in humans linking neural measures of retrieval of individual memories during sleep to subsequent memory performance. This work leverages the prominent electrophysiological signal triggered by lateralized movements to robustly demonstrate the retrieval of specific cued memories during sleep. Moreover, these signals predict subsequent memory and are correlated with sleep spindles, neural oscillations that have previously been implicated in memory stabilization. Together, these findings link memory retrieval to stabilization and provide a powerful tool for investigating memory in a wide range of learning contexts and human populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neural basis of perceptual decision making has been built in part on relating co-fluctuations of single neuron responses to perceptual decisions on a trial-by-trial basis. The strength of this relationship is often compared across neurons or brain areas, recorded in different sessions, animals, or variants of a task. We sought to extend our understanding of perceptual decision making in three ways. First, we measured neuronal activity simultaneously in early [primary visual cortex (V1)] and midlevel (V4) visual cortex while macaque monkeys performed a fine orientation discrimination perceptual task. This allowed a direct comparison of choice signals in these two areas, including their dynamics. Second, we asked how our ability to predict animals' decisions would be improved by considering small simultaneously-recorded neuronal populations rather than individual units. Finally, we asked whether predictions would be improved by taking into account the animals' choice and reward histories, which can strongly influence decision making. We found that responses of individual V4 neurons were weakly predictive of decisions, but only in a brief epoch between stimulus offset and the indication of choice. In V1, few neurons showed significant decision-related activity. Analysis of neuronal population responses revealed robust choice-related information in V4 and substantially weaker signals in V1. Including choice- and reward-history information improved performance further, particularly when the recorded populations contained little decision-related information. Our work shows the power of using neuronal populations and decision history when relating neuronal responses to the perceptual decisions they are thought to underlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Decades of research has provided a rich description of how visual information is represented in the visual cortex. Yet how cortical responses relate to visual perception remains poorly understood. Here we relate fluctuations in small neuronal population responses, recorded simultaneously in primary visual cortex (V1) and area V4 of monkeys, to perceptual reports in an orientation discrimination task. Choice-related signals were robust in V4, particularly late in the behavioral trial, but not in V1. Models that include both neuronal responses and choice-history information were able to predict a substantial portion of decisions. Our work shows the power of integrating information across neurons and including decision history in relating neuronal responses to perceptual decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Diencephalic amnesia can be as debilitating as the more commonly known temporal lobe amnesia, yet the precise contribution of diencephalic structures to memory processes remains elusive. Across four cohorts of male rats, we used discrete lesions of the mammillothalamic tract to model aspects of diencephalic amnesia and assessed the impact of these lesions on multiple measures of activity and plasticity within the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. Lesions of the mammillothalamic tract had widespread indirect effects on hippocampocortical oscillatory activity within both theta and gamma bands. Both within-region oscillatory activity and cross-regional synchrony were altered. The network changes were state-dependent, displaying different profiles during locomotion and paradoxical sleep. Consistent with the associations between oscillatory activity and plasticity, complementary analyses using several convergent approaches revealed microstructural changes, which appeared to reflect a suppression of learning-induced plasticity in lesioned animals. Together, these combined findings suggest a mechanism by which damage to the medial diencephalon can impact upon learning and memory processes, highlighting an important role for the mammillary bodies in the coordination of hippocampocortical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Information flow within the Papez circuit is critical to memory. Damage to ascending mammillothalamic projections has consistently been linked to amnesia in humans and spatial memory deficits in animal models. Here we report on the changes in hippocampocortical oscillatory dynamics that result from chronic lesions of the mammillothalamic tract and demonstrate, for the first time, that the mammillary bodies, independently of the supramammillary region, contribute to frequency modulation of hippocampocortical theta oscillations. Consistent with the associations between oscillatory activity and plasticity, the lesions also result in a suppression of learning-induced plasticity. Together, these data support new functional models whereby mammillary bodies are important for coordinating hippocampocortical activity rather than simply being a relay of hippocampal information as previously assumed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the present study, we investigated motor cortex (M1) and a small portion of premotor and parietal cortex using intracortical microstimulation in anesthetized capuchin monkeys. Capuchins are the only New World monkeys that have evolved an opposable thumb and use tools in the wild. Like most Old World monkeys and humans, capuchin monkeys have highly dexterous hands. We surveyed a large extent of M1 and found that ~22% of all evoked movements in M1 involved the digits, and the majority of these consisted of finger flexions and extensions. Different subtypes of movements could be identified, including opposable movements of digits 1 and 2 (D1 and D2). Interestingly, the pattern of such movements varied between animals. In one case, movements involved the adduction of the medial surface of D1 toward the lateral surface of D2, whereas in the other case, the tips of D1 and D2 came in contact. Unlike other primates examined, we also found extensive representations of the prehensile foot and tail. We propose that the manual behavioral repertoire of capuchin monkeys, which includes the use of tools in the wild, is well represented within the motor cortex in the form of muscle synergies between different body parts that compose these larger, complex behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to use tools is a milestone in human evolution. Capuchin monkeys are one of the few non-human primates that use tools in the wild. The present study is the first detailed exploration of the motor cortex of these primates using long-train intracortical microstimulation. Within primary motor cortex, we evoked finger movements involving flexions and extensions of multiple digits, or of the first and second digits alone. Interestingly, flexion of tail and toes could also be evoked. Together, these results suggest that the functional organization of the motor cortex represents not just muscles of the body, but muscle synergies that form the building blocks of the complex behavioral repertoire of these animals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The cingulate cortex contributes to complex, adaptive behaviors, but the exact nature of its contributions remains unresolved. Proposals from previous studies, including evaluating past actions or selecting future ones, have been difficult to distinguish in part because of an incomplete understanding of the task-relevant variables that are encoded by individual cingulate neurons. In this study, we recorded from individual neurons in parts of both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in 2 male rhesus monkeys performing a saccadic reward task. The task required them to use adaptive, feedback-driven strategies to infer the spatial location of a rewarded saccade target in the presence of different forms of uncertainty. We found that task-relevant, spatially selective feedback signals were encoded by the activity of individual neurons in both brain regions, with stronger selectivity for spatial choice and reward-target signals in PCC and stronger selectivity for feedback in ACC. Moreover, neurons in both regions were sensitive to sequential effects of feedback that partly reflected sequential behavioral patterns. However, neither brain region exhibited systematic modulations by the blockwise conditions that governed the reliability of the trial-by-trial feedback and drove adaptive behavioral patterns. There was also little evidence that single-neuron responses in either brain region directly predicted the extent to which feedback and contextual information were used to inform choices on the subsequent trial. Thus, certain cingulate neurons encode diverse, evaluative signals needed for adaptive, feedback-driven decision-making, but those signals may be integrated elsewhere in the brain to guide actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Effective decision-making in dynamic environments requires adapting to changes in feedback and context. The anterior and posterior cingulate cortex have been implicated in adaptive decision-making, but the exact nature of their respective roles remains unresolved. Here we compare patterns of task-driven activity of subsets of individual neurons from parts of the two brain regions in monkeys performing a saccadic task with dynamically changing reward locations. We find evidence for regional specializations in neural representations of choice and feedback, including task-relevant modulations of activity that could be used for performance monitoring. However, we find little evidence that these neural representations are used directly to adjust choice behavior, which thus likely requires integration of these signals elsewhere in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The growth of axons corresponding to different neuronal subtypes is governed by unique expression profiles of molecules on the growth cone. These molecules respond to extracellular cues either locally though cell adhesion interactions or over long distances through diffusible gradients. Here, we report that that the cell adhesion molecule ALCAM (CD166) can act as an extracellular substrate to selectively promote the growth of murine midbrain dopamine (mDA) neuron axons through a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-heterophilic interaction with mDA-bound adhesion molecules. In mixed-sex primary midbrain cultures, the growth-promoting effect of ALCAM was abolished by neutralizing antibodies for components of the Semaphorin receptor complex Nrp1, Chl1, or L1cam. The ALCAM substrate was also found to modulate the response of mDA neurites to soluble semaphorins in a context-specific manner by abolishing the growth-promoting effect of Sema3A but inducing a branching response in the presence of Sema3C. These findings identify a previously unrecognized guidance mechanism whereby cell adhesion molecules act in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; to modulate the response of axonal growth cones to soluble gradients to selectively orchestrate the growth and guidance of mDA neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanisms governing the axonal connectivity of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons during neural development have remained rather poorly understood relative to other model systems for axonal growth and guidance. Here, we report a series of novel interactions between proteins previously not identified in the context of mDA neuronal growth. Significantly, the results suggest a previously unrecognized mechanism involving the convergence in signaling between local, adhesion and long-distance, soluble cues. A better understanding of the molecules and mechanisms involved in establishment of the mDA system is important as a part of ongoing efforts to understand the consequence of conditions that may result from aberrant connectivity and also for cell replacement strategies for Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Navigating a changing environment requires associating stimuli and actions with their likely outcomes and modifying these associations when they change. These processes involve the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Although some molecular mediators have been identified, developmental factors are virtually unknown. We hypothesized that the cell adhesion factor β1-integrin is essential to OFC function, anticipating developmental windows during which β1-integrins might be more influential than others. We discovered that OFC-selective β1-integrin silencing before adolescence, but not later, impaired the ability of mice to extinguish conditioned fear and select actions based on their likely outcomes. Early-life knock-down also reduced the densities of dendritic spines, the primary sites of excitatory plasticity in the brain, and weakened sensitivity to cortical inputs. Notwithstanding these defects in male mice, females were resilient to OFC (but not hippocampal) β1-integrin loss. Existing literature suggests that resilience may be explained by estradiol-mediated transactivation of β1-integrins and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (trkB). Accordingly, we discovered that a trkB agonist administered during adolescence corrected reward-related decision making in β1-integrin-deficient males. In sum, developmental β1-integrins are indispensable for OFC function later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a subregion of the frontal cortex that allows organisms to link behaviors and stimuli with anticipated outcomes, and to make predictions about the consequences of one's behavior. Aspects of OFC development are particularly prolonged, extending well into adolescence, likely optimizing organisms' abilities to prospectively calculate the consequences of their actions and select behaviors appropriately; these decision making strategies improve as young individuals mature into adulthood. Molecular factors are not, however, well understood. Our experiments reveal that a cell adhesion protein termed &quot;β1-integrin&quot; is necessary for OFC neuronal maturation and function. Importantly, β1-integrins operate during a critical period equivalent to early adolescence in humans to optimize the ability of organisms to update expectancies later in life.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The vermal cerebellum is a hub of sensorimotor integration critical for postural control and locomotion, but the nature and developmental organization of afferent information to this region have remained poorly understood &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we use &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium imaging of the vermal cerebellum in awake behaving male and female mice to record granule neuron responses to diverse sensorimotor cues targeting visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor domains. Use of an activity-independent marker revealed that approximately half (54%) of vermal granule neurons were activated during these recordings. A multikernel linear model distinguished the relative influences of external stimuli and co-occurring movements on neural responses, indicating that, among the subset of activated granule neurons, locomotion (44%–56%) and facial air puffs (50%) were more commonly and reliably encoded than visual (31%–32%) and auditory (19%–28%) stimuli. Strikingly, we also uncover populations of granule neurons that respond differentially to voluntary and forced locomotion, whereas other granule neurons in the same region respond similarly to locomotion in both conditions. Finally, by combining two-photon calcium imaging with birth date labeling of granule neurons via &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electroporation, we find that early- and late-born granule neurons convey similarly diverse sensorimotor information to spatially distinct regions of the molecular layer. Collectively, our findings elucidate the nature and developmental organization of sensorimotor information in vermal granule neurons of the developing mammalian brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellar granule neurons comprise over half the neurons in the brain, and their coding properties have been the subject of theoretical and experimental interest for over a half-century. In this study, we directly test long-held theories about encoding of sensorimotor stimuli in the cerebellum and compare the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; coding properties of early- and late-born granule neurons. Strikingly, we identify populations of granule neurons that differentially encode voluntary and forced locomotion and find that, although the birth order of granule neurons specifies the positioning of their parallel fiber axons, both early- and late-born granule neurons convey a functionally diverse sensorimotor code. These findings constitute important conceptual advances in understanding the principles underlying cerebellar circuit development and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/34/6613?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Sleep has been hypothesized to rebalance overall synaptic strength after ongoing learning during waking leads to net synaptic potentiation. If so, because synaptic strength and size are correlated, synapses on average should be larger after wake and smaller after sleep. This prediction was recently confirmed in mouse cerebral cortex using serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM). However, whether these findings extend to other brain regions is unknown. Moreover, sleep deprivation by gentle handling was reported to produce hippocampal spine loss, raising the question of whether synapse size and number are differentially affected by sleep and waking. Here we applied SBEM to measure axon–spine interface (ASI), the contact area between pre-synapse and post-synapse, and synapse density in CA1 stratum radiatum. Adolescent YFP-H mice were studied after 6–8 h of sleep (S = 6), spontaneous wake at night (W = 4) or wake enforced during the day by novelty exposure (EW = 4; males/females balanced). In each animal ≥425 ASIs were measured and synaptic vesicles were counted in ~100 synapses/mouse. Reconstructed dendrites included many small, nonperforated synapses and fewer large, perforated synapses. Relative to S, ASI sizes in perforated synapses shifted toward higher values after W and more so after EW. ASI sizes in nonperforated synapses grew after EW relative to S and W, and so did their density. ASI size correlated with presynaptic vesicle number but the proportion of readily available vesicles decreased after EW, suggesting presynaptic fatigue. Thus, CA1 synapses undergo changes consistent with sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization and their number increases after extended wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sleep benefits learning, memory consolidation, and the integration of new with old memories, but the underlying mechanisms remain highly debated. One hypothesis suggests that sleep's cognitive benefits stem from its ability to renormalize total synaptic strength, after ongoing learning during wake leads to net synaptic potentiation. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis mainly comes from the cerebral cortex, including the observation that cortical synapses are larger after wake and smaller after sleep. Using serial electron microscopy, we find here that sleep/wake synaptic changes consistent with sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization also occur in the CA1 region. Thus, the role of sleep in maintaining synaptic homeostasis may extend to the hippocampus, a key area for learning and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;How experience causes long-lasting changes in the brain is a central question in neuroscience. The common view is that synaptic function is altered by experience to change brain circuit functions that underlie conditioned behavior. We examined hippocampus synaptic circuit function &lt;i&gt;in vivo,&lt;/i&gt; in three groups of animals, to assess the impact of experience on hippocampus function in rats. The &quot;Conditioned&quot; group acquired a shock-conditioned place response during a cognitively-challenging, hippocampus synaptic plasticity-dependent task. The &quot;No-Shock&quot; group had similar exposure to the environmental conditions but no conditioning. The &quot;Home-Cage&quot; group was experimentally naive. After the 1-week retention test, under anesthesia, we stimulated the perforant path inputs to CA1, which terminate in &lt;i&gt;stratum lacunosum moleculare&lt;/i&gt;, and to the dentate gyrus, which terminate in the molecular layer. We find synaptic compartment specific changes that differ amongst the groups. The evoked field EPSP and pre-spike field response are enhanced only at the dentate gyrus input layer and only in Conditioned animals. The dentate gyrus responses, measured by the population spiking activity and post-spike responses, are enhanced in both the Conditioned and No-Shock groups compared to Home-Cage animals. These changes are pathway specific because no differences are observed in &lt;i&gt;stratum lacunosum moleculare&lt;/i&gt; of CA1. These findings demonstrate long-term, experience-dependent, pathway-specific alterations to synaptic circuit function of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated whether a hippocampus-dependent place avoidance memory causes long-lasting changes of hippocampus circuit function, as is commonly assumed. Immediately after testing 1-week memory retention in rats, under anesthesia, the entorhinal cortex projection to dentate gyrus is strengthened, as estimated by the synaptic response to stimulation as well as the amplitude of the population action potential response. These changes are pathway specific because no differences are observed in the &lt;i&gt;stratum lacunosum moleculare&lt;/i&gt; of CA1 where the entorhinal cortex projection also terminates. These findings of experience-dependent, pathway-specific alterations to synaptic circuit function in hippocampus are consistent with theories that posit that memory formation causes persistent alterations of neural circuit function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have gained attention as important players in neurological disease. In line with their heterogeneous character, defects in specific astrocyte subtypes have been identified. Leukodystrophy Vanishing White Matter shows selective vulnerability in white matter astrocytes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cell technology is extensively being explored in studies of pathophysiology and regenerative medicine. However, models for distinct astrocyte subtypes for VWM are lacking, thereby hampering identification of disease‐specific pathways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we characterize human and mouse pluripotent stem cell‐derived grey and white matter astrocyte subtypes to generate an in vitro Vanishing White Matter model. We examined morphology and functionality, and used co‐culture methods, high‐content microscopy and RNA sequencing to study Vanishing White Matter cultures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found intrinsic vulnerability in specific astrocyte subpopulations in Vanishing White Matter. When comparing Vanishing White Matter and control cultures, white matter‐like astrocytes inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, and showed affected pathways in both human and mouse cultures, involving the immune system and extracellular matrix. Interestingly, human white matter‐like astrocytes presented additional, human‐specific disease mechanisms, such as neuronal and mitochondrial functioning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocyte subtype cultures revealed disease‐specific pathways in Vanishing White Matter. Cross‐validation of human and mouse‐derived protocols identified human‐specific disease aspects. This study provides new insights into VWM disease mechanisms which helps the development of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; regenerative applications, and we further present strategies to study astrocyte subtype vulnerability in neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leukoencephalopathies comprise a broad spectrum of disorders, but the genetic background of adult leukoencephalopathies has rarely been assessed. In this study, we analyzed 101 Japanese patients with genetically unresolved adult leukoencephalopathy using whole‐exome sequencing and repeat‐primed PCR for detecting GGC expansion in &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; was recently identified as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease. We found 12 patients with GGC expansion in &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; as the most frequent cause of adult leukoencephalopathy followed by &lt;i&gt;NOTCH3&lt;/i&gt; variants in our cohort. Further, we found one case with &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; GGC expansion, which might explain the underlying pathogenesis of sporadic cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess patterns and impact of small nerve fiber dysfunction and pathology in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred seventeen women with FMS underwent neurological examination, questionnaire assessment, neurophysiology assessment, and small fiber tests: skin punch biopsy, corneal confocal microscopy, microneurography, quantitative sensory testing including C‐tactile afferents, and pain‐related evoked potentials. Data were compared with those of women with major depressive disorder and chronic widespread pain (MD‐P) and healthy women.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was reduced at different biopsy sites in 63% of FMS patients (MD‐P: 10%, controls: 18%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for each). We found 4 patterns of skin innervation in FMS: normal, distally reduced, proximally reduced, and both distally and proximally reduced (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01 for each compared to controls). Microneurography revealed initial activity‐dependent acceleration of conduction velocity upon low frequencies of stimulation in 1A fibers, besides 1B fiber spontaneous activity and mechanical sensitization in FMS patients. FMS patients had elevated warm detection thresholds (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), impaired C‐tactile afferents (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and reduced amplitudes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) of pain‐related evoked potentials compared to controls. Compared to FMS patients with normal skin innervation, those with generalized IENFD reduction had higher pain intensity and impairment due to pain, higher disease burden, more stabbing pain and paresthesias, and more anxiety (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 for each). FMS patients with generalized IENFD reduction also had lower corneal nerve fiber density (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and length (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of small fiber pathology is related to symptom severity in FMS. This knowledge may have implications for the diagnostic classification and treatment of patients with FMS. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Magic is the art of producing in the spectator an illusion of impossibility.
Although the scientific study of magic is in its infancy, the advent of recent
tracking algorithms based on deep learning allow now to quantify the skills of
the magician in naturalistic conditions at unprecedented resolution and
robustness. In this study, we deconstructed stage magic into purely motor
maneuvers and trained an artificial neural network (DeepLabCut) to follow coins
as a professional magician made them appear and disappear in a series of
tricks. Rather than using AI as a mere tracking tool, we conceived it as an
&quot;artificial spectator&quot;. When the coins were not visible, the algorithm was
trained to infer their location as a human spectator would (i.e. in the left
fist). This created situations where the human was fooled while AI (as seen by
a human) was not, and vice versa. Magic from the perspective of the machine
reveals our own cognitive biases.

 &lt;p&gt;Modeling brain dynamics to better understand and control complex behaviors
underlying various cognitive brain functions are of interests to engineers,
mathematicians, and physicists from the last several decades. With a motivation
of developing computationally efficient models of brain dynamics to use in
designing control-theoretic neurostimulation strategies, we have developed a
novel data-driven approach in a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network
architecture to predict the temporal dynamics of complex systems over an
extended long time-horizon in future. In contrast to recent LSTM-based
dynamical modeling approaches that make use of multi-layer perceptrons or
linear combination layers as output layers, our architecture uses a single
fully connected output layer and reversed-order sequence-to-sequence mapping to
improve short time-horizon prediction accuracy and to make multi-timestep
predictions of dynamical behaviors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
in reconstructing the regular spiking to bursting dynamics exhibited by an
experimentally-validated 9-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley model of hippocampal CA1
pyramidal neurons. Through simulations, we show that our LSTM neural network
can predict the multi-time scale temporal dynamics underlying various spiking
patterns with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, our results show that the
predictions improve with increasing predictive time-horizon in the
multi-timestep deep LSTM neural network.

 &lt;p&gt;Chimera states---the coexistence of synchrony and asynchrony in a
nonlocally-coupled network of identical oscillators---are often used as a model
framework for epileptic seizures. Here, we explore the dynamics of chimera
states in a network of modified Hindmarsh-Rose neurons, configured to reflect
the graph of the mesoscale mouse connectome. Our model produces superficially
epileptiform activity converging on persistent chimera states in a large region
of a two-parameter space governing connections (a) between subcortices within a

 &lt;p&gt;An increasing body of evidence suggests that the trial-to-trial variability
of spiking activity in the brain is not mere noise, but rather the reflection
of a sampling-based encoding scheme for probabilistic computing. Since the
precise statistical properties of neural activity are important in this
context, many models assume an ad-hoc source of well-behaved, explicit noise,
either on the input or on the output side of single neuron dynamics, most often
assuming an independent Poisson process in either case. However, these
assumptions are somewhat problematic: neighboring neurons tend to share
receptive fields, rendering both their input and their output correlated; at
the same time, neurons are known to behave largely deterministically, as a
function of their membrane potential and conductance. We suggest that spiking
neural networks may, in fact, have no need for noise to perform sampling-based
Bayesian inference. We study analytically the effect of auto- and
cross-correlations in functionally Bayesian spiking networks and demonstrate
how their effect translates to synaptic interaction strengths, rendering them
controllable through synaptic plasticity. This allows even small ensembles of
interconnected deterministic spiking networks to simultaneously and
co-dependently shape their output activity through learning, enabling them to
perform complex Bayesian computation without any need for noise, which we
demonstrate in silico, both in classical simulation and in neuromorphic
emulation. These results close a gap between the abstract models and the
biology of functionally Bayesian spiking networks, effectively reducing the
architectural constraints imposed on physical neural substrates required to
perform probabilistic computing, be they biological or artificial.

		<content type="html">
 Synchronization is one of the brain mechanisms allowing the coordination of neuronal activity required in many cognitive tasks. Anticipated Synchronization (AS) is a specific type of out-of-phase synchronization that occurs when two systems are unidirectionally coupled and, consequently, the information is transmitted from the sender to the receiver, but the receiver leads the sender in time. It has been shown that the primate cortex could operate in a regime of AS as part of a normal neurocognitive function. However, it is still unclear which mechanism gives rise to anticipated synchronization in neuronal motifs. Here, we investigate the synchronization properties of cortical motifs on multiple scales and show that the internal free running frequency of the receiver can be an important ingredient for AS to occur.
For biologically plausible parameters, including excitation/inhibition balance, we found that the phase difference between the sender and the receiver decreases when the free running frequency of the receiver increases. As a consequence, the system switches from the usual delayed synchronization (DS) regime to an AS regime. We show that at three different scales, neuronal microcircuits, spiking neuronal populations and neural mass models, both the inhibitory loop and the external current acting on the receiver change its free running frequency. This change may cause the receiver system to operate in an AS regime.</content>

 A key question in systems neuroscience is to identify how sensory stimuli are represented in neuronal activity, and how the activity of sensory neurons in turn is ``read out'' by downstream neurons and give rise to behavior. The choice of proper model system to adress these questions, hence, is a crucial step. Over the past decade, the increasingly powerful array of experimental approaches that has become available in non-primate models (e.g. optogenetics and two-photon imaging) has spurred a renewed interest for the use of rodent models in systems neuroscience research. Here we introduce the rodent whisker-mediated touch system as a structurally well-established and well-organized model system which despite its simplicity gives rises to complex behaviors. This system serves as a behaviorally efficient model system; known as nocturnal animals, along with their olfaction, rodents rely on their whisker-mediated touch system to collect information about their surrounding environment. Moreover, this system represents a well-studied circuitry with a somatotopic organization: at every stage of processing, one can identify anatomical and functional topographic maps of whiskers: ``barrelettes'' in the brainstem nuclei, ``barreloids'' in the sensory thalamus, and ``barrels'' in the cortex. This article provides a brief review to the basic anatomy and function of the whisker system in rodents.</content>

 Physiological studies documented highly specific corticofugal modulations making subcortical centers focus processing on sounds that the auditory cortex has experienced to be important. Here, we show the effects of focal conditioning of the primary auditory cortex (FCAI) on auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes and latencies in house mice. FCAI significantly increased ABR peak amplitudes (peaks I – V), decreased thresholds, and shortened peak latencies in responses to the frequency tuned by conditioned cortical neurons. The amounts of peak amplitude increases and latency decreases were specific for each processing level up to the auditory midbrain. The data provide new insights in possible corticofugal modulation of inner hair cell synapses and new corticofugal effects as neuronal enhancement of processing in the superior olivary complex and lateral lemniscus. Thus, our comprehensive ABR approach confirms the role of the auditory cortex as instructor of lower auditory levels and extends this role specifically to the cochlea, superior olivary complex, and lateral lemniscus. The whole pathway from the cochlea to the inferior colliculus appears, in a common mode, instructed in a very similar way.</content>

 Recent investigations of the rat posterior parietal cortex (PPC) suggest that this region plays a central role in action control together with the frontal cortical areas. Posterior parietal-frontal cortical connections have been described in rats, but little is known about whether these connections are topographically organized as in the primate. Here we injected retrograde and anterograde tracers into subdivisions of PPC as well as the frontal midline and orbital cortical areas to explore possible topographies within their connections. We found that PPC projects to several frontal cortical areas, largely reciprocating the densest input received from the same areas. All PPC subdivisions are strongly connected with the secondary motor cortex (M2) in a topographically organized manner. The medial subdivision (mPPC) has a dense reciprocal connection with the most caudal portion of M2 (cM2), whereas the lateral subdivision (lPPC) and the caudolateral subdivision (PtP) are reciprocally connected with the intermediate rostrocaudal portion of M2 (iM2). Sparser reciprocal connections were seen with anterior cingulate area 24b. mPPC connects with rostral, and lPPC and PtP connect with caudal parts of 24b, respectively. There are virtually no connections with area 24a, nor with prelimbic or infralimbic cortex. PPC and orbitofrontal cortices are also connected, showing a gradient such that mPPC entertains reciprocal connections mainly with the ventral orbitofrontal cortex, whereas lPPC and PtP are preferentially connected with medial and central portions of ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex, respectively. Our results thus indicate that the connections of PPC with frontal cortices are organized in a topographical fashion, supporting functional heterogeneity within PPC and frontal cortices.</content>

 Biological treatment development for syndromal neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism has seen slow progress for decades. Speeding drug discovery may result from the judicious development and application of biomarker measures of brain function to select patients for clinical trials, to confirm target engagement and to optimize drug dose. For neurodevelopmental disorders, electrophysiology (EEG) offers considerable promise because of its ability to monitor brain activity with high temporal resolution and its more ready application for pediatric populations relative to MRI. Here, we discuss conceptual/definitional issues related to biomarker development, discuss practical implementation issues, and suggest preliminary guidelines for validating EEG approaches as biomarkers with a context of use in neurodevelopmental disorder drug development.</content>

 Chronic pain is a major health problem, which would impair life quality and reduce productivity. Electroacupuncture (EA), a modality of medicine based on the theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine, presents great therapeutic effects on chronic pain. The clinic application has gained increasing popularity, and in parallel, more researches have been performed on the mechanisms of EA-induced analgesia. The past decades have seen enormous advances both in neuronal circuitry of needle-insertion and in its molecular mechanism. EA blocks pain by activating the descending pain inhibitory system, which originates in the brainstem and terminates at the spinal cord. This review synthesizes corresponding studies to elucidate how EA alleviate pain via the mediation of this descending system. Much emphasis has been put on the implication of descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways in the process of pain modulation. Also, other important transmitters and supraspinal regions related to analgesic effects of EA has been demonstrated. Finally, it should be noticed that there exists some shortcomings involved in the animal experimental design for EA, which account for conflicting results obtained by different studies.</content>

 Purpose
Perihematomal edema (PHE) occurs in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is often used as surrogate of secondary brain injury. PHE resolves over time, but little is known about the functional integrity of the tissues that recover from edema. In a pig ICH model, we aimed to assess metabolic integrity of perihematoma tissues by using noninvasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
Material and Methods
Fourteen male Yorkshire pigs with an average age of 8 weeks were intracerebrally injected with autologous blood to produce ICH. Proton MRS data were obtained at 1, 7, and 14 days after ICH using a whole-body 3.0T MRI system. Point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS)-localized 2D chemical shift imaging (CSI) was acquired. The concentration of N-Acetylaspartate (NAA), Choline (Cho), and Creatine (Cr) were measured within the area of PHE, tissues adjacent to the injury with no or negligible edema (ATNE), and contralesional brain tissue. A linear mixed model was used to analyze the evolution of metabolites in perihematomal tissues, with p-value &amp;lt; 0.05 indicating statistical significance.
Results
The perihematoma volume gradually decreased from 2.38 ± 1.23 ml to 0.41 ± 0.780 ml (p &amp;lt; 0.001) over 2 weeks. Significant (p &amp;lt; 0.001) reductions in NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations were found in the PHE and ATNE regions compared to the contralesional hemisphere at day 1 and day 7 after ICH. All three metabolites were significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.001) restored in the PHE tissue on day 14, but remained persistently low in the ATNE area, and unaltered  in the contralesional voxel. 
Conclusions
This study highlights the potential of MRS to probe salvageable tissues within the perihematoma in the sub-acute phase of intracerebral hemorrhage. Altered metabolites within the PHE and ATNE regions in addition to edema and hematoma volumes were explored as possible markers for tissue recovery. Perihematomal tissue with PHE demonstrated a more reversible injury compared to the tissue adjacent to the injury without edema, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of edema.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The profile of 122 metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and controls was studied. Among the 122 metabolites analyzed, 62 could be detected. Statistically significant differences between the AD and control group were only detected for metabolites of the glycolysis. Thus, accurate quantification of 11 glycolytic metabolites was done. At this, we detected a significant reduction of five of them, namely phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the AD CSF compared to controls. These results correlate with the known reduction of glucose metabolism in the brain of patients with AD and indicate that metabolic analysis of the central carbon metabolism can be a potential tool in AD diagnostic. Although the ROC analyses of the metabolites do not reach the level of the diagnostic quality of AD biomarkers, the combination of glycolysis metabolites with the established biomarkers led to an improvement in sensitivity and specificity. Thus, metabolic markers could increase diagnostic safety and represent an approach to characterize the progression of the disease.</content>

 Automatic segmentation methods based on deep learning have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the ordinary methods. Nevertheless, these methods are inapplicable for small datasets, which are very common in medical problems. To this end, we propose a knowledge transfer method between diseases via the Generative Bayesian Prior network. Our approach is compared to a pre-train approach and random initialization and obtains the best results in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient metric for the small subsets of the Brain Tumor Segmentation 2018 database (BRATS2018).</content>

 A significant body of experimental evidence has demonstrated that it is possible to induce the illusion of ownership of a fake limb or even an entire fake body using multisensory correlations. Recently, immersive virtual reality has allowed users to experience the same sensations of ownership over a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment, which in turn allows virtual reality users to have the feeling of being “embodied” in a virtual body. Using such virtual embodiment to manipulate body perception is starting to be extensively investigated and may have clinical implications for conditions that involve altered body image such as chronic pain. Here, we review experimental and clinical studies that have explored the manipulation of an embodied virtual body in immersive virtual reality for both experimental and clinical pain relief. We discuss the current state of the art, as well as the challenges faced by, and ideas for, future research. Finally, we explore the potentialities of using an embodied virtual body in immersive virtual reality in the field of neurorehabilitation, specifically in the field of pain.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The P2X7 receptor, a member of the ionotropic purinergic P2X family of extracellular ATP-gated receptors, exerts a strong trophic effect when tonically activated in cells, in addition to a cytotoxic role after sustained activation. Because of a widespread distribution, P2X7 regulates several different cell- and tissue-specific physiological functions, and is involved in a number of disease conditions. A novel role has recently emerged for P2X7 in the regulation of glucose and energy metabolism. In previous work, we have demonstrated that genetic depletion, and to a lesser extent also pharmacological inhibition of P2X7, elicits a significant decrease of whole body energy expenditure and an increase of respiratory exchange ratio. In the present work, we have investigated the effects of P2X7 stimulation in vivo on whole body energy metabolism. Adult mice were daily injected with the specific P2X7 agonist 2′(3′)-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine5′-triphosphate for one week and subjected to indirect calorimetric analysis for 48 hours. We report that 2′(3′)-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine5′-triphosphate increases metabolic rate and O2 consumption, concomitantly decreasing respiratory rate and upregulating NADPH oxidase 2 in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. Our results indicate a major impact on energy homeostasis and muscle metabolism by activation of P2X7.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Postural limb reflexes (PLRs) are an essential component of postural corrections. Spinalization leads to disappearance of postural functions (including PLRs). After spinalization, spastic, incorrectly-phased motor responses to postural perturbations containing oscillatory EMG bursting gradually develop, suggesting plastic changes in the spinal postural networks. Here, to reveal these plastic changes, rabbits at 3, 7 and 30 days after spinalization at T12 were decerebrated, and responses of spinal interneurons from L5 along with hindlimb muscles EMG responses to postural sensory stimuli, causing PLRs in subjects with intact spinal cord (control), were characterized.
	Like in control and after acute spinalization, at each of three studied time points after spinalization, neurons responding to postural sensory stimuli were found. Proportion of such neurons during first month after spinalization did not reach the control level, and was similar to that observed after acute spinalization. In contrast, their activity (which was significantly decreased after acute spinalization) reached the control value at 3 days after spinalization and remained close to this level during the following month. However, the processing of postural sensory signals, which was severely distorted after acute spinalization, did not recover by 30 days after injury. In addition, we found a significant enhancement of the oscillatory activity in a proportion of the examined neurons, which could contribute to generation of oscillatory EMG bursting.
	Motor responses to postural stimuli (which were almost absent after acute spinalization) re-appeared at 3 days after spinalization, although they were very weak, irregular, and a half of them was incorrectly phased in relation to postural stimuli. Proportion of correct and incorrect motor responses remained almost the same during the following month, but their amplitude gradually increased.
	Thus, spinalization triggers two processes of plastic changes in the spinal postural networks: rapid (taking days) restoration of normal activity level in spinal interneurons, and slow (taking months) recovery of motoneuronal excitability. Most likely, recovery of interneuronal activity underlies re-appearance of motor responses to postural stimuli. However, absence of recovery of normal processing of postural sensory signals and enhancement of oscillatory activity of neurons result in abnormal PLRs and loss of postural functions.</content>

 Formation of Tau aggregates is a common pathological feature of tauopathies and their accumulation directly correlates with cytotoxicity and neuronal degeneration. Great efforts have been made to understand Tau aggregation and to find therapeutics halting or reversing the process, however, progress has been slowed due to the lack of a suitable method for monitoring Tau aggregation.
We developed a cell-based assay allowing to detect and quantify Tau aggregation in living cells.
The system is based on the FRET biosensor CST able to monitor the molecular dynamic of Tau aggregation in different cellular conditions. We probed candidate compounds that could block Tau hyperphosphorylation. In particular, to foster the drug discovery process, we tested kinase inhibitors approved for the treatment of other diseases. We identified the ERK inhibitor PD-901 as a promising therapeutic molecule since it reduces and prevents Tau aggregation. This evidence establishes the CST cell-based aggregation assay as a reliable tool for drug discovery and suggests that PD-901 might be a promising compound to be tested for further preclinical studies on AD.</content>

 Neurotrophic factors are relevant regulators of the neurogenic process at different levels. In particular, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, is highly expressed in the hippocampus (HC) of rodents and participates in the control of neuronal proliferation and survival in the dentate gyrus. Likewise, serotonin is also involved in the regulation of neurogenesis, though its role is apparently more complex. Indeed, both enhancement of serotonin neurotransmission as well as serotonin depletion, paradoxically increase neuronal survival in the HC of mice. In this study, we analyzed the expression of the BDNF isoforms, i.e. pro- and mature-BDNF, and their respective receptors p75 and TrkB, in the HC of mice chronically treated with para-chloro-phenyl-alanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis. The same analysis was conducted in hyposerotonergic mice with concomitant administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n- propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Increased expression of p75 receptor with decreased expression of pro-BDNF was observed after chronic PCPA. Seven-day treatment with 8-OH-DPAT reestablished the expression of pro-BDNF modified by PCPA, and induced an increase in the expression of p75 receptor. It has been demonstrated that PCPA-treated mice have higher number of immature neurons in the HC. Given that immature neurons participate in the pattern separation process, the object pattern separation test was conducted. A better performance of hyposerotonergic mice was not confirmed in this assay. Altogether, our results show that molecules in the BDNF signaling pathway are differentially expressed under diverse configurations of the serotonergic system, allowing for fine-tuning of the neurogenic process.</content>

 Methamphetamine (MA) is a widely abused psychoactive drug that primarily damages the nervous system. However, the involvement of MA in the survival of microglia remains poorly understood. CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP-β) is a transcription factor and an important regulator of cell apoptosis. Lipocalin2 (lcn2) is a known apoptosis inducer and is involved in many cell death processes. We hypothesized that C/EBP-β is involved in MA-induced lcn2-mediated microglial apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we measured the protein expression of C/EBP-β after MA treatment and evaluated the effects of silencing C/EBP-β or lcn2 on MA-induced apoptosis in BV-2 cells and the mouse striatum after intrastriatal MA injection. MA exposure increased the expression of C/EBP-β and stimulated the lcn2-mediated modulation of apoptosis. Moreover, silencing the C/EBP-β-dependent lcn2 upregulation reversed the MA-induced microglial apoptosis. The in vivo relevance of these findings was confirmed in  mouse models, which demonstrated that the microinjection of anti-C/EBP-β into the striatum ameliorated the MA-induced decrease survival of microglia. These findings provide a new insight regarding the specific contributions of C/EBP-β-lcn2 to microglial survival in the context of MA abuse.</content>

 Exploration of purinergic signaling in brainstem homeostatic control processes is challenging the traditional view that the biphasic hypoxic ventilatory response, which comprises a rapid initial increase in breathing followed by a slower secondary depression, reflects the interaction between peripheral chemoreceptor-mediated excitation and central inhibition. While controversial, accumulating evidence supports that in addition to peripheral excitation, interactions between central excitatory and inhibitory purinergic mechanisms shape this key homeostatic reflex. The objective of this review is to present our working model of how purinergic signaling modulates the glutamatergic inspiratory synapse in the preBötzinger Complex (key site of inspiratory rhythm generation) to shape the hypoxic ventilatory response. It is based on the perspective that has emerged from decades of analysis of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, where the actions of extracellular ATP are determined by a complex signaling system, the purinome, that involves not only the actions of ATP and adenosine at P2 and P1 receptors, respectively, but diverse families of enzymes and transporters that collectively determine the rate of ATP degradation, adenosine accumulation and adenosine clearance. We summarize current knowledge of the roles played by these different purinergic elements in the hypoxic ventilatory response, often drawing on examples from other brain regions, and look ahead to many unanswered questions and remaining challenges.</content>

 Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induces ischemia characterized by a densely ischemic focus, and a less densely ischemic penumbral zone in which neurons and astrocytes display age-dependent dynamic variations in spontaneous Ca2+ activities. However, it is unknown whether penumbral nerve cells respond to sensory stimulation early after stroke onset, which is critical for understanding stimulation-induced stroke therapy. In this study, we investigated the ischemic penumbra’s capacity to respond to somatosensory input.  We examined adult (3- to 4-month-old) and old (18- to 24-month-old) male mice at 2–4 hours after MCAO, using two-photon microscopy to record somatosensory stimulation-induced neuronal and astrocytic Ca2+ signals in the ischemic penumbra. In both adult and old mice, MCAO abolished spontaneous and stimulation-induced electrical activity in the penumbra, and strongly reduced stimulation-induced Ca2+ responses in neuronal somas (35–82%) and neuropil (92–100%) in the penumbra. In comparison, after stroke, stimulation-induced astrocytic Ca2+ responses in the penumbra were only moderately reduced (by 54–62%) in adult mice, and were even better preserved (reduced by 31–38%) in old mice. 
Our results suggest that somatosensory stimulation evokes astrocytic Ca2+ activity in the ischemic penumbra. We hypothesize that the relatively preserved excitability of astrocytes, most prominent in aged mice, may modulate protection from ischemic infarcts during early somatosensory activation of an ischemic cortical area. Future neuroprotective efforts in stroke may target spontaneous or stimulation-induced activity of astrocytes in the ischemic penumbra.</content>

 Although subtle discourse declines in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been reported, heterogeneous measures and tasks among the MCI discourse studies have yielded widely varying outcomes. The present study aimed to first, identify discourse measures that aid the differentiation among people with amnestic MCI (aMCI), people with non-amnestic MCI (naMCI), and cognitively healthy control (HC) participants, and second, delineate the cognitive functions related to such discourse measures. Three discourse tasks (an episodic narrative, a planning task, and a picture description) were performed by 30 aMCI, 22 naMCI, and 21 HC participants. Samples were analyzed using six categories of 15 measures, namely coherence, cohesion, proposition, grammaticality, lexicality, and fluency. The statistical analyses included 1) a multivariate analysis of variance for group comparison; 2) binary simple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for differentiation between two groups; 3) binary multiple logistic regression for being diagnosed with naMCI or aMCI with the minimum number of predictors; and 4) Pearson correlation analysis for identifying the cognitive functions associated with the discourse measures. The proportion of cohesive words and propositional density in aMCI participants were worse than those in naMCI participants. Global coherence, the proportion of cohesive words, and the proportion of dysfluencies and pauses in naMCI participants were lower than those in the HC participants. Global and local coherence and the proportion of cohesive words, cohesive ties per utterances, propositional density, and dysfluencies and pauses in aMCI participants were worse than those in the HC participants. The aforementioned measures were demonstrated to be effective predictors for classifying groups by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In addition, the proportions of cohesive words and pauses were common discourse measures for differentiation between naMCI and HC participants or between aMCI and HC participants using binary multiple logistic regression. According to the correlation analysis, memory and executive functions are needed for coherent, cohesive, and efficient discourse productions in MCI. The detailed description of discourse performances in this study will aid the characterization of the declined language abilities of MCI participants and also the understanding of the cognitive functions involved in discourse performance in MCI.</content>

 Deteriorated speech comprehension is a common manifestation of the age-related decline of auditory functions (presbycusis). It could be assumed that when presbycusis is accompanied by tinnitus, general hearing functions, and particularly comprehension of speech in quiet and speech in noise, will be significantly affected. In this study, speech comprehension ability and other parameters of auditory function were assessed in elderly subjects with (T, n=25) and without (NT, n=26) tinnitus, aiming for examination of both peripheral and central auditory processing, Apart from high-frequency audiograms in quiet and in background noise, speech recognition thresholds in silence or in competitive babble noise, and the ability to understand temporally gated speech, we measured also sensitivity to frequency modulation  and interaural delay, gap detection thresholds, or the difference limens of intensity. The results show that in elderly participants matched by age (mean ages around 68 years), cognitive status (median MoCA scores around 27), and hearing thresholds (median pure-tone averages around 16 dB HL), tinnitus per se has little influence on speech comprehension. The tinnitus patients also show similar gap-detection thresholds, sensitivity to interaural intensity difference, and sensitivity to frequency modulation as the NT subjects. Despite these similarities, nevertheless, significant differences in auditory processing have been found in the tinnitus participants: a worse ability to detect tones in noise, a higher sensitivity to intensity changes, and a higher sensitivity to interaural time differences. Additional correlation analyses further revealed that speech comprehension in the T subjects is dependent on the sensitivity to temporal modulation and interaural time delay, while these correlations are weak and non-significant in the NT subjects. Therefore, despite similarities in average speech comprehension and several other parameters of auditory function, elderly people with tinnitus exhibit different auditory processing, particularly at suprathreshold level. The results also suggest that speech comprehension ability of elderly tinnitus patients relies more on temporal features of the sound stimuli, especially under difficult conditions, compared to elderly people without tinnitus.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Increased adrenergic tone resulting from cardiovascular stress leads to development of heart failure, in part, through chronic stimulation of b1 adrenergic receptors (bARs) on cardiac myocytes. Blocking these receptors is part of the basis for b-blocker therapy for heart failure. Recent data demonstrate that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including bARs, are activated intracellularly, although the biological significance is unclear. Here we investigated the functional role of Golgi bARs in rat cardiac myocytes and found they activate Golgi localized, prohypertrophic, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, that is not accessed by cell surface bAR stimulation. This pathway is accessed by the physiological neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) via an Oct3 organic cation transporter. Blockade of Oct3 or specific blockade of Golgi resident b1ARs prevents NE dependent cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. This clearly defines a pathway activated by internal GPCRs in a biologically relevant cell type and has implications for development of more efficacious b-blocker therapies.</content>

 Constantly surrounded by kin or alien organisms in nature, eukaryotes and prokaryotes developed various communication systems to coordinate adaptive multi-entity behavior. In complex and overcrowded environments, they require to discriminate relevant signals in a myriad of pheromones to execute appropriate responses. In the human gut commensal &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus salivarius&lt;/i&gt;, the cytoplasmic Rgg/RNPP regulator ComR couples competence to bacteriocin-mediated predation. Here, we describe a paralogous sensor duo, ScuR and SarF, which circumvents ComR in order to disconnect these two physiological processes. We highlighted the recurring role of Rgg/RNPP in the production of antimicrobials and designed a robust genetic screen to unveil potent/optimized peptide pheromones. Further mutational and biochemical analyses dissected the modifiable selectivity toward their pheromone and operating sequences at the subtle molecular level. Additionally, our results highlight how we might mobilize antimicrobial molecules while silencing competence in endogenous populations of human microflora and temper gut disorders provoked by bacterial pathogens.</content>

		<content type="html">
 B-1a cells play an important role in mediating tissue homeostasis and protecting against infections. They are the main producers of ‘natural’ IgM, spontaneously secreted serum antibodies predominately reactive to self antigens, like phosphatidylcholine (PtC), or antigens expressed by the intestinal microbiota. The mechanisms that regulate the B-1a immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire and their antibody secretion remain poorly understood. Here, we use a novel reporter mouse to demonstrate that production of self- and microbiota-reactive antibodies is linked to BCR signaling in B-1a cells. Moreover, we show that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical for shaping the Ig repertoire of B-1a cells as well as regulating their antibody production. Strikingly, we find that both the colonization of a microbiota as well as microbial-sensing TLRs are required for anti-microbiota B-1a responses, whereas nucleic-acid sensing TLRs are required for anti-PtC responses, demonstrating that linked activation of BCR and TLRs controls steady state B-1a responses to both self and microbiota-derived antigens.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In mice, neonatally-developing, self-reactive B-1 cells generate steady levels of natural antibodies throughout life. B-1 cells can, however, also rapidly respond to infections with increased local antibody production. The mechanisms regulating these two seemingly very distinct functions are poorly understood, but have been linked to expression of CD5, an inhibitor of BCR-signaling. Here we demonstrate that TLR-mediated activation of CD5+ B-1 cells induced the rapid reorganization of the IgM-BCR complex, leading to the eventual loss of CD5 expression, and a concomitant increase in BCR-downstream signaling, both in vitro and in vivo after infections of mice with influenza virus and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium.&lt;/i&gt; Both, initial CD5 expression and TLR-mediated stimulation, were required for the differentiation of B-1 cells to IgM-producing plasmablasts after infections. Thus, TLR-mediated signals support participation of B-1 cells in immune defense via BCR-complex reorganization.</content>

 Learning should be adjusted according to the surprise associated with observed outcomes but calibrated according to statistical context. For example, when occasional changepoints are expected, surprising outcomes should be weighted heavily to speed learning. In contrast, when uninformative outliers are expected to occur occasionally, surprising outcomes should be less influential. Here we dissociate surprising outcomes from the degree to which they demand learning using a predictive inference task and computational modeling. We show that the P300, a stimulus-locked electrophysiological response previously associated with adjustments in learning behavior, does so conditionally on the source of surprise. Larger P300 signals predicted greater learning in a changing context, but less learning in a context where surprise was indicative of a one-off outlier (oddball). Our results suggest that the P300 provides a surprise signal that is interpreted by downstream learning processes differentially according to statistical context in order to appropriately calibrate learning across complex environments.</content>

		<link href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46356"/>

		<content type="html">
 Long-term potentiation (LTP), an increase in synaptic efficacy following high-frequency stimulation, is widely considered a mechanism of learning. LTP involves local remodeling of dendritic spines and synapses. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and endosomal compartments could provide local stores of membrane and proteins, bypassing the distant Golgi apparatus. To test this hypothesis, effects of LTP were compared to control stimulation in rat hippocampal area CA1 at postnatal day 15 (P15). By two hours, small spines lacking SER increased after LTP, whereas large spines did not change in frequency, size, or SER content. Total SER volume decreased after LTP consistent with transfer of membrane to the added spines. Shaft SER remained more abundant in spiny than aspiny dendritic regions, apparently supporting the added spines. Recycling endosomes were elevated specifically in small spines after LTP. These findings suggest local secretory trafficking contributes to LTP-induced synaptogenesis and primes the new spines for future plasticity.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical growth factor involved in the maturation of the CNS, including neuronal morphology and synapse refinement. Herein, we demonstrate astrocytes express high levels of BDNF's receptor, TrkB (in the top 20 of protein-coding transcripts), with nearly exclusive expression of the truncated isoform, TrkB.T1, which peaks in expression during astrocyte morphological maturation. Using a novel culture paradigm, we show that astrocyte morphological complexity is increased in the presence of BDNF and is dependent upon BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling. Deletion of TrkB.T1, globally and astrocyte-specifically, in mice revealed morphologically immature astrocytes with significantly reduced volume, as well as dysregulated expression of perisynaptic genes associated with mature astrocyte function. Indicating a role for functional astrocyte maturation via BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling, TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes do not support normal excitatory synaptogenesis or function. These data suggest a significant role for BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling in astrocyte morphological maturation, a critical process for CNS development.</content>

A persistent obstacle for constructing kinetic models of metabolism is uncertainty in the kinetic properties of enzymes. Currently, available methods for building kinetic models can cope indirectly with uncertainties by integrating data from different biological levels and origins into models. In this study, we use the recently proposed computational approach iSCHRUNK (in Silico Approach to Characterization and Reduction of Uncertainty in the Kinetic Models), which combines Monte Carlo parameter sampling methods and machine learning techniques, in the context of Bayesian inference. Monte Carlo parameter sampling methods allow us to exploit synergies between different data sources and generate a population of kinetic models that are consistent with the available data and physicochemical laws. The machine learning allows us to data-mine the &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; generated kinetic parameters together with the integrated datasets and derive posterior distributions of kinetic parameters consistent with the observed physiology. In this work, we used iSCHRUNK to address a design question: can we identify which are the kinetic parameters and what are their values that give rise to a desired metabolic behavior? Such information is important for a wide variety of studies ranging from biotechnology to medicine. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we performed Metabolic Control Analysis, computed the flux control coefficients of the xylose uptake (XTR), and identified parameters that ensure a rate improvement of XTR in a glucose-xylose co-utilizing &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; strain. Our results indicate that only three kinetic parameters need to be accurately characterized to describe the studied physiology, and ultimately to design and control the desired responses of the metabolism. This framework paves the way for a new generation of methods that will systematically integrate the wealth of available omics data and efficiently extract the information necessary for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology decisions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IG40bea-650&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We provide a novel computational framework on how biological and artificial agents can learn to flexibly couple and decouple neural task modules for cognitive processing. In this way, they can address the stability-plasticity dilemma. For this purpose, we combine two prominent computational neuroscience principles, namely Binding by Synchrony and Reinforcement Learning. The model learns to synchronize task-relevant modules, while also learning to desynchronize currently task-irrelevant modules. As a result, old (but currently task-irrelevant) information is protected from overwriting (stability) while new information can be learned quickly in currently task-relevant modules (plasticity). We combine learning to synchronize with task modules that learn via one of several classical learning algorithms (Rescorla-Wagner, backpropagation, Boltzmann machines). The resulting combined model is tested on a reversal learning paradigm where it must learn to switch between three different task rules. We demonstrate that our combined model has significant computational advantages over the original network without synchrony, in terms of both stability and plasticity. Importantly, the resulting models’ processing dynamics are also consistent with empirical data and provide empirically testable hypotheses for future MEG/EEG studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hfeQlUO9ulM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Ferrets have become a standard animal model for the development of early visual stages. Less is known about higher-level vision in ferrets, both during development and in adulthood. Here, as a step towards establishing higher-level vision research in ferrets, we used behavioral experiments to test the motion and form integration capacity of adult ferrets. Motion integration was assessed by training ferrets to discriminate random dot kinematograms (RDK) based on their direction. Task difficulty was varied systematically by changing RDK coherence levels, which allowed the measurement of motion integration thresholds. Form integration was measured analogously by training ferrets to discriminate linear Glass patterns of varying coherence levels based on their orientation. In all experiments, ferrets proved to be good psychophysical subjects that performed tasks reliably. Crucially, the behavioral data showed clear evidence of perceptual motion and form integration. In the monkey, motion and form integration are usually associated with processes occurring in higher-level visual areas. In a second set of experiments, we therefore tested whether PSS, a higher-level motion area in the ferret, could similarly support motion integration behavior in this species. To this end, we measured responses of PSS neurons to RDK of different coherence levels. Indeed, neurometric functions for PSS were in good agreement with the behaviorally derived psychometric functions. In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate that ferrets are well suited for higher-level vision research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the research studying punishment has focused on an aversive stimulus delivered immediately after an action. However, in real-world decision-making, negative consequences often occur long after a decision has been made. This can engender myopic decisions that fail to appropriately respond to consequences. Whereas discounting of delayed rewards has been well studied in both human and animal models, systematic discounting of delayed consequences remains largely unexplored. To address this gap in the literature, we developed the delayed punishment decision-making task. Rats chose between a small, single-pellet reinforcer and a large, three-pellet reinforcer accompanied by a mild foot shock. The shock was preceded by a delay, which systematically increased throughout the session (0, 4, 8, 12, 16 s). On average, rats discounted the negative value of delayed punishment, as indicated by increased choice of the large, punished reward as the delay preceding the shock lengthened. Female rats discounted delayed punishment less than males, and this behavior was not influenced by estrous cycling. The addition of a cue light significantly decreased the undervaluation of delayed consequences for both sexes. Finally, there was no correlation between the discounting of delayed punishments and a traditional reward delay discounting task for either sex. These data indicate that the ability of punishment to regulate decision-making is attenuated when punishment occurs later in time. This task provides an avenue for exploration of the neural circuitry underlying the devaluation of delayed punishment and may assist in developing treatments for substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) mediate the synaptic uptake of glutamate from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles and are considered unambiguous neurochemical markers of glutamate neurons. However, many neurons not classically thought of as glutamatergic also express a VGLUT and co-release glutamate. Using a genetic fate-mapping strategy we found that most cholinergic neurons in the mouse mesopontine tegmentum express VGLUT2 at some point during development, including the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and parabigeminal nucleus (PBG), but not the oculomotor nucleus. In contrast, very few of these cholinergic neurons displayed evidence of vesicular GABA transporter expression. Using multiplex fluorescent &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, we determined that only PBG cholinergic neurons are also predominantly positive for VGLUT2 mRNA in the adult, with only small numbers of PPTg cholinergic neurons overlapping with VGLUT2 mRNA. Using Cre-dependent viral vectors we confirm these &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization data, and demonstrate projection patterns of cholinergic and glutamatergic populations. These results demonstrate that most mesopontine cholinergic neurons may transiently express VGLUT2, but that a large majority of PBG neurons retain VGLUT2 expression throughout adulthood, and support a growing body of literature indicating that distinct cholinergic populations have differing potential for GABA or glutamate co-release.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The localization of distinct landmarks plays a crucial role in encoding new spatial memories. In mammals, this function is performed by hippocampal neurons that sparsely encode an animal’s location relative to surrounding objects. Similarly, the dorsolateral pallium (DL) is essential for spatial learning in teleost fish. The DL of weakly electric gymnotiform fish receives both electrosensory and visual input from the preglomerular nucleus (PG), which has been hypothesized to encode the temporal sequence of electrosensory or visual landmark/food encounters. Here, we show that DL neurons in the &lt;i&gt;Apteronotid&lt;/i&gt; fish and in the &lt;i&gt;Carassius auratus&lt;/i&gt; (goldfish) have a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) combined with a high and dynamic spike threshold that increases following each spike. Current-evoked spikes in DL cells are followed by a strong small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK)-mediated after-hyperpolarizing potential (AHP). Together, these properties prevent high frequency and continuous spiking. The resulting sparseness of discharge and dynamic threshold suggest that DL neurons meet theoretical requirements for generating spatial memory engrams by decoding the landmark/food encounter sequences encoded by PG neurons. Thus, DL neurons in teleost fish may provide a promising, simple system to study the core cell and network mechanisms underlying spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A critical aspect of behavior is that mobile organisms must be able to precisely determine where and when to move. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying precise movement timing and action planning is therefore crucial to understanding how we interact with the world around us. Recent evidence suggests that our experience of time is directly and intrinsically computed within the motor system, consistent with the theory of embodied cognition. To investigate the role of the motor system, we tested human subjects (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 40) on a novel task combining reaching and time estimation. In this task, subjects were required to move a robotic manipulandum to one of two physical locations to categorize a concurrently timed suprasecond. Critically, subjects were divided into two groups: one in which movement during the interval was unrestricted and one in which they were restricted from moving until the stimulus interval had elapsed. Our results revealed a higher degree of precision for subjects in the free-moving group. A further experiment (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 14) verified that these findings were not due to proximity to the target, counting strategies, bias, or movement length. A final experiment (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10) replicated these findings using a within-subjects design, performing a time reproduction task, in which movement during encoding of the interval led to more precise performance. Our findings suggest that time estimation may be instantiated within the motor system as an ongoing readout of timing judgment and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity, as estimated using resting state fMRI, has shown
potential in bridging the gap between pathophysiology and cognition. However,
clinical use of functional connectivity biomarkers is impeded by unreliable
estimates of individual functional connectomes and lack of generalizability of
models predicting cognitive outcomes from connectivity. To address these
issues, we combine the frameworks of connectome predictive modeling and
differential identifiability. Using the combined framework, we show that
enhancing the individual fingerprint of resting state functional connectomes
leads to robust identification of functional networks associated to cognitive
outcomes and also improves prediction of cognitive outcomes from functional
connectomes. Using a comprehensive spectrum of cognitive outcomes associated to
Alzheimer's disease, we identify and characterize functional networks
associated to specific cognitive deficits exhibited in Alzheimer's disease.
This combined framework is an important step in making individual level
predictions of cognition from resting state functional connectomes and in
understanding the relationship between cognition and connectivity.

 &lt;p&gt;Multi-view learning improves the learning performance by utilizing multi-view
data: data collected from multiple sources, or feature sets extracted from the
same data source. This approach is suitable for primate brain state decoding
using cortical neural signals. This is because the complementary components of
simultaneously recorded neural signals, local field potentials (LFPs) and
action potentials (spikes), can be treated as two views. In this paper, we
extended broad learning system (BLS), a recently proposed wide neural network
architecture, from single-view learning to multi-view learning, and validated
its performance in monkey oculomotor decision decoding from medial frontal LFPs
and spikes. We demonstrated that medial frontal LFPs and spikes in non-human
primate do contain complementary information about the oculomotor decision, and
that the proposed multi-view BLS is a more effective approach to classify the
oculomotor decision, than several classical and state-of-the-art single-view
and multi-view learning approaches.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;A class of spiking neuronal models with threshold 2 is considered. It is
defined by a set of conditions typical for basic threshold-type models, such as
the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) or the binding neuron model and also for
some artificial neurons. A neuron is stimulated with a Poisson stream of
excitatory impulses. Each output impulse is conveyed through the feedback line
to the neuron input after finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse is identical to
those delivered from the input stream. We have obtained a general relation
allowing calculating exactly the probability density function (PDF) $p(t)$ for
distribution of the first passage time of crossing the threshold, which is the
distribution of output interspike intervals (ISI) values for this neuron. The
calculation is based on known PDF $p^0(t)$ for that same neuron without
feedback, intensity of the input stream $\lambda$ and properties of the
feedback line. Also, we derive exact relation for calculating the moments of
$p(t)$ based on known moments of $p^0(t)$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obtained general expression for $p(t)$ is checked numerically using Monte
Carlo simulation for the case of LIF model. The course of $p(t)$ has a
$\delta$-function type peculiarity. This fact contributes to the discussion
about the possibility to model neuronal activity with Poisson process,
supporting the &quot;no&quot; answer.

 Synaptic computation is believed to underlie many forms of animal behaviour. A correct identification of synaptic transmission properties is thus crucial for a better understanding of how the brain processes information, stores memories and learns. Recently, a number of new statistical methods for inferring synaptic transmission parameters have been introduced. Here we review and contrast these developments, with a focus on methods aimed at inferring both synaptic release statistics and synaptic dynamics. Furthermore, based on recent proposals we discuss how such methods can be applied to data across different levels of investigation: from intracellular paired recordings to in vivo network-wide recordings. Overall, these developments open the window to reliably estimating synaptic parameters in behaving animals.</content>

 Viral vectors have become very popular to overexpress or downregulate proteins of interest in different cell types. They conveniently allow the precise targeting of well-defined tissue areas, which is particularly useful in complex organs like the brain. In theory, each vector should have its own cell specificity that can be obtained by using different strategies (e.g. using a cell-specific promoter). For the moment, there is few vectors that have been developed to alternatively target, using the same capsid, neurons and astrocytes in the central nervous system. There is even fewer examples of adeno-associated viral vectors able to efficiently transduce cells both in vitro and in vivo. The development of viral vectors allowing the cell-specific downregulation of a protein in cultured cells of the central nervous system as well as in vivo within a large brain area would be highly desirable to address several important questions in neurobiology. Here we report that the use of the AAV2/DJ viral vector associated to an hybrid CMV/chicken β-actin promoter (CBA) or to a modified form of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (G1B3) allows a specific transduction of neurons or astrocytes in more than half of the barrel field within the rat somatosensory cortex. Moreover, the use of the miR30E-shRNA technology led to an efficient downregulation of two proteins of interest related to metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to downregulate the expression of different protein isoforms in a cell-specific manner using a common serotype. It is proposed that such an approach could be extended to other cell types and used to target several proteins of interest within the same brain area.</content>

 Hyperglycemia, a key characteristic and risk factor for diabetes mellitus (DM), causes neuronal senescence. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a novel neuroprotectant. The present work was to investigate the potential effect of H2S on hyperglycemia-induced neuronal senescence and the underlying mechanisms. We found that NaHS, a donor of H2S, inhibited high glucose (HG)-induced cellular senescence in HT22 cells (an immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line), as evidenced by decrease in the number of SA-β-gal positive cells, increase in the cells growth, and down-regulations of senescence mark proteins, p16INK4a and p21CIP1. NaHS improved the autophagic flux, which is judged by decrease in the amount of intracellular autophagosome as well as up-regulations of LC3II/I and P62 in HG-exposed HT22 cells. Furthermore, blocked autophagic flux by chloroquine (CQ) significantly abolished NaHS-exerted improvement in the autophagic flux and suppression in the cellular senescence of GH-exposed HT22 cells, which indicated that H2S antagonizes HG-induced neuronal senescence by promoting autophagic flux. We also found that NaHS up-regulated the expression of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), an important anti-aging protein, in HG-exposed HT22 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by sirtinol reversed the protection of H2S against HG-induced autophagic flux blockade and cellular senescence in HT22 cells. These data indicated that H2S protects HT22 cells against HG-induced cellular senescence by improving autophagic flux via up-regulation of SIRT1, suggesting H2S as a potential treatment strategy for hyperglycemia-induced neuronal senescence and neurotoxicity.</content>

 Blindness is an ideal condition to study the role of visual input on the development of spatial representation. Studies have shown how audio space representation reorganizes in blindness. However, how spatial reorganization works is still unclear. A limit of the study on blindness is that it is a “stable” system and it does not allow studying the mechanisms that subtend the progress of this reorganization. To overcome this problem here we study, for the first time, audio spatial reorganization in 18 adults with Macular Degeneration for which the loss of vision due to scotoma is an ongoing progressive process. Our results show that the loss of vision produces immediate changes in the processing of spatial audio signals. In individuals with Macular Degeneration, the lateral sounds are “attracted” towards the central scotoma position resulting in a strong bias in the spatial auditory percept. This result suggests that the reorganization of audio space representation is a fast and plastic process occurring also later in life, after vision loss.</content>

 Learning and memorizing sequences of events is an important function of the human brain and the basis for forming expectations and making predictions. Learning is facilitated by repeating a sequence several times, causing rhythmic appearance of the individual sequence elements. This observation invites to consider the resulting multitude of rhythms as a spectral `fingerprint' which characterizes the respective sequence. Here we explore the implications of this perspective by developing a neurobiologically plausible computational model which captures this `fingerprint' by attuning an ensemble of neural oscillators. In our model, this attuning process is based on a number of oscillatory phenomena that have been observed in electrophysiological recordings of brain activity like synchronization, phase locking and reset as well as cross-frequency coupling. We compare the learning properties of the model with behavioral results from a study in human participants and observe good agreement of the errors for different levels of complexity of the sequence to be memorized. Finally, we suggest an extension of the model for processing sequences that extend over several sensory modalities.</content>

 Animal communication plays an essential role in triggering diverse behaviors. It is believed in this regard that signal production by a sender and its perception by a receiver is co-evolving in order to have beneficial effects such as to ensure that conspecifics remain sensitive to these signals. However, in order to give appropriate responses to a communication signal, the receiver has to first detect and interpret it in a meaningful way. The detection of communication signals can be limited under some circumstances, for example when the signal is masked by the background noise in which it occurs (e.g., the cocktail-party problem). Moreover, some signals are very alike despite having different meanings making it hard to discriminate between them. How the central nervous system copes with these tasks and problems is a central question in systems neuroscience. Gymnotiform weakly electric fish pose an interesting system to answer these questions for various reasons: 1) they use a variety of communication signals called “chirps” during different behavioral encounters; 2) the central physiology of the electrosensory system is well known; 3) most importantly, these fish give reliable behavioral responses to artificial stimuli that resemble natural communication signals, making it possible to uncover the neural mechanisms that lead to the observed behaviors.</content>

 Humans and animals can learn to order a list of items without relying on explicit spatial or temporal cues. To do so, they appear to make use of transitivity, a property of all ordered sets. Here, we summarize relevant research on the transitive inference (TI) paradigm and its relationship to learning the underlying order of an arbitrary set of items. We compare six computational models of TI performance, three of which are model-free (Q-learning, Value Transfer, and REMERGE) and three of which are model-based (RL-Elo, Sequential Monte Carlo, and Betasort). Our goal is to assess the ability of these models to produce empirically observed features of TI behavior. Model-based approaches perform better under a wider range of scenarios, but no single model explains the full scope of behaviors reported in the TI literature.</content>

 Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator that mainly exists in the nervous system. It plays a neuroprotective role in organisms and widely participates in the regulation of various physiological processes in vivo. Studies in both humans and animal models have been revealed that NPY levels are altered in some neurodegenerative and neuroimmune disorders. NPY plays various roles in these diseases, such as exerting a neuroprotective effect, increasing trophic support, decreasing excitotoxicity, regulating calcium homeostasis, and attenuating neuroinflammation. In this review, we will focus on the roles of NPY in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases, highlighting NPY as a potential therapeutic target in these diseases.</content>

 Cessation of blood flow leads to a complex cascade of pathophysiological events at the blood-vascular-parenchymal interface which evolves over time and space, and results in damage to neural cells and edema formation. Cerebral ischemic injury evokes a profound and deleterious upregulation in inflammation and triggers multiple cell death pathways, but it also induces a series of the events associated with regenerative responses, including vascular remodeling, angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic reprograming could play a pivotal role in ongoing post-stroke neurovascular unit changes and recovery. This review summarizes current knowledge about post-stroke recovery processes at the neurovascular unit, as well as epigenetic mechanisms and modifiers (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modifying enzymes and microRNAs) associated with stroke injury and neurovascular unit repair. It also discusses novel drug targets and therapeutic strategies for enhancing post-stroke recovery.</content>

 Objectives: Effects of resveratrol on autophagy in frontal cortex and hippocampus of CCH model rats were observed, and neuroprotective effects of resveratrol on CCH rats and the mechanism of action of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were researched. Method: The CCH model was made by permanently ligating the bilateral common carotid arteries. Neurological deficit scores and Morris water maze test were used to test the behavioral changes and the cognitive function of rats; HE and Tunel staining were used to detect pathological and neuronal apoptosis in frontal cortex and hippocampus. ELISA was used to detect oxidative stress factor and brain injury markers. Immunofluorescence and Western blot were used to detect the expression of apoptosis, autophagy and AKT/mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins in frontal cortex and hippocampus. Results: After resveratrol treatment, the neurological function scores of CCH rats were reduced, cognitive dysfunction caused by long-term hypoxia and hypoperfusion was improved, and the pathological damage in frontal cortex and hippocampus was reduced; The expression of oxidative stress and brain injury markers decreased the apoptotic rate of neurons in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The resveratrol can activate autophagy and inhibit the expression of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins. PI3K inhibitor reversed the protective effect of resveratrol. Conclusions: The resveratrol can improve the cognitive function damage of CCH model rats, and reduce the damage of oxidative stress on neurons in frontal cortex and hippocampus by activating autophagy and inhibit neuronal apoptosis. This effect may be regulated by the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00821"/>

		<content type="html">
 Due to the nature of fMRI acquisition protocols, slices cannot be acquired simultaneously, and as a result, are temporally misaligned from each other.  To correct from this misalignment, preprocessing pipelines often incorporate slice timing correction (STC). However, evaluating the benefits of STC is challenging because it 1) is dependent on slice acquisition parameters, 2) interacts with head movement in a non-linear fashion, and 3) significantly changes with other preprocessing steps, fMRI experimental design, and fMRI acquisition parameters. Presently, the interaction of STC with various scan conditions has not been extensively examined.  Here, we examine the effect of STC when it is applied with various other preprocessing steps such as motion correction (MC), motion parameter residualization (MPR), and spatial smoothing. Using 180 simulated and 30 real fMRI data, we quantitatively demonstrate that the optimal order in which STC should be applied depends on interleave parameters and motion level.  We also demonstrate the benefit STC on sub-second-TR scans and for functional connectivity analysis. We conclude that STC is a critical part of the preprocessing pipeline that can be extremely beneficial for fMRI processing. However, its effectiveness interacts with other preprocessing steps and with other scan parameters and conditions which may obscure its significant importance in the fMRI processing pipeline.</content>

 Transcrainal magnetic stimulation (TMS) has shown great promise as a medical treatment of depression. The effectiveness of TMS treatment at high frequency has been well investigated, however, the low-frequency TMS in depression treatment has rarely been investigated in depression-induced cognitive deficits. Herein, this study was carried out to assess the possible modulatory role of low-frequency pulsed magnetic field (LFPMF) on reversing cognitive impairment in a model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups as follow: a control group (CON), a control applied with LFPMF (CON+LFPMF), a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), and a CUS treated with LFPMF (CUS+LFPMF). During 8 weeks of CUS, comparing to those in CON group animals not only gained less weight, but also exhibited anhedonia, anxiety, and cognitive decline in behavioral tests. After two-week treatment of LFPMF, a 20mT, 1Hz magnetic stimulation, it reversed the impairment of spatial cognition as well as hippocampal synaptic function including long-term potentiation and related protein expression. Thus, LFPMF has shown effectively improvements on depressant behavior and cognitive dysfunction in CUS rats, possibly via regulating synaptic function.</content>

 3 Closed-loop or intelligent neuromodulation allows adjustable, personalised neuromodulation
4 which usually incorporates recording of some biomarker, followed by implementation of an
5 algorithm which decides the timing (when ?) and strength (how much ?) of stimulation.
6 Closed-loop neuromodulation has been shown to have greater benefits compared to open loop
7 neuromodulation, particularly for therapeutic applications such as pharmacoresistant epilepsy,
8 movement disorders and potentially for psychological disorders such as depression or drug
9 addiction. However, an important aspect of the technique is selection of an appropriate, preferably
10 neural biomarker. Neurochemical sensing can provide high resolution biomarker monitoring for
11 various neurological disorders as well as provide deeper insight into neurological mechanisms.
12 The chemicals of interest being measured, could be ions such as potassium (K+), sodium
13 (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl􀀀), hydrogen (H+) or neurotransmitters such as dopamine,
14 serotonin, glutamate. This review focusses on the different building blocks necessary for a
15 neurochemical, closed-loop neuromodulation system such as biomarkers, sensors and data
16 processing algorithms. Furthermore, it also highlights the merits and demerits of using this
17 biomarker modality.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective: The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is associated with the processing of negative emotions. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mental disorders. We aimed to determine the changes in GABA levels in the ACC of perimenopausal women with depression. Methods: We recruited 120 perimenopausal women, who were followed up for 18–24 months. After reaching menopause, the participants were divided into a control group (n = 71), an anxiety group (n = 30), and a depression group (n = 19). The participants were examined using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). TARQUIN software was used to calculate the GABA concentrations in the ACC before and after menopause. The relationship of the GABA levels with the patients’ scores on the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale and 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale was determined. Results: GABA decreased with time. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower in the depression group than in the anxiety group and were significantly lower in both these groups than in the normal group. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower than the premenopausal levels in the normal, anxiety, and depression groups (P = 0.014, &amp;lt;0.001, and &amp;lt;0.001, respectively). The premenopausal GABA levels did not significantly differ between the normal vs. anxiety group (P = 0.907), normal vs. depression group (P = 0.495), and anxiety vs. depression group. The postmenopausal GABA levels were significantly lower in the depression group than in the anxiety group and were significantly lower in both these groups than in the normal group, normal vs. anxiety group (P = 0.022), normal vs. depression group (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and anxiety vs. depression group (P = 0.047).
Conclusion: Changes in GABA concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex are related with the pathophysiological mechanism and symptoms of perimenopausal depression.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The brain’s ability to extract three-dimensional (3D) shape and orientation information from viewed objects is vital in daily life. Stereoscopic 3D surface perception relies on binocular disparity. Neurons selective to binocular disparity are widely distributed among visual areas, but the manner in these areas are involved in stereoscopic 3D surface representation is unclear. To address this, participants were instructed to observe random dot stereograms depicting convex and concave curved surfaces and the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal of visual cortices was recorded. Two surface types were (i) horizontally positioned surfaces defined by shear disparity and (ii) vertically positioned surfaces defined by compression disparity. The surfaces were presented at different depth positions per trial. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were classified from early visual areas to higher visual areas. We determined whether cortical areas were selective to shape and orientation by assessing same-type stimuli classification accuracies based on multi-voxel activity patterns per area. To identify whether some areas were related to a more generalized sign of curvature or orientation representation, transfer classification was used by training classifiers on one dataset type and testing classifiers on another type. Same-type stimuli classification results showed that most selected visual areas were selective to shape and all were selective to the orientation of disparity-defined 3D surfaces. Transfer classification results showed that in the dorsal visual area V3A, classification accuracies for the discriminate sign of surface curvature were higher than the baseline of statistical significance for all types of classifications, demonstrating that V3A is related to generalized shape representation. Classification accuracies for discriminating horizontal–vertical surfaces in higher dorsal areas V3A and V7 and ventral area lateral occipital complex as well as in some areas of intraparietal sulcus were higher than the baseline of statistical significance, indicating their relation to the generalized representation of 3D surface orientation.</content>

 Emotional recognition through EEG signals is becoming increasingly popular. However, It has been difficult to improve the emotional recognition effect of cross-subjects. In the exploration of cross-subjects proposed in previous works, the effect of the two-category cross-subject emotion recognition should be improved. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a method for improving the accuracy of binary classification emotion and the program runs faster. In response to this difficulty and the defects of related works in the past. We extracted multiple features to form high-dimensional features, and proposed a binary classification cross-subject emotion recognition method based on high-dimensional features, the Significance Test, the Sequential Backward Selection and Support Vector Machine fusion method (ST-SBSSVM). The effectiveness of the ST-SBSSVM was validated on a dataset (DEAP) using physiological signals for emotion analysis and an electroencephalogram dataset (SEED) using SJTU emotions. Results by using ST-SBSSVM have shown that in the case of high-dimensional features, ST-SBSSVM had an average of about 8% (DEAP) and 32% (SEED) improvement in the accuracy of cross-subject emotions compared with common emotion recognition methods. ST-SBSSVM improved the recognition accuracy of cross-subjects by 2% (DEAP) and 12% (SEED) and saved about 95% (DEAP) and 93% (SEED) of program runtime compared to the Sequential Backward Selection. Compared with recent similar works, the effect of this work on the emotion recognition of cross-subjects was obvious, and the accuracy of this work was 68% (DEAP) and 91% (SEED). After using ST-SBSSVM, we also found that nonlinear EEG features can promote emotion recognition more than linear EEG features.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting an estimated 1 in 59 children. ASD is highly genetically heterogeneous and may be caused by both inheritable and de novo gene variations. In the past decade, hundreds of genes have been identified that contribute to the serious deficits in communication, social cognition, and behavior that patients often experience. However, these only account for 10-20% of ASD cases, and patients with similar pathogenic variants may be diagnosed on very different levels of the spectrum. In this review, we will describe the genetic landscape of ASD and discuss how genetic modifiers such as copy number variation, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and epigenetic alterations likely play a key role in modulating the phenotypic spectrum of ASD patients. We also consider how genetic modifiers can alter convergent signaling pathways and lead to impaired neural circuitry formation. Lastly, we review sex-linked modifiers and clinical implications. Further understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for both comprehending ASD and for developing novel therapies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The development of the cerebral cortex relies on different types of progenitor cell. Among them, the recently described basal radial glial cell (bRG) is suggested to be of critical importance for the development of the brain in gyrencephalic species. These cells are highly numerous in primate and ferret brains, compared to lissencephalic species such as the mouse in which they are few in number. Their somata are located in basal subventricular zones in gyrencephalic brains and they generally possess a basal process extending to the pial surface. They may also have an apical process directed towards the ventricular surface, similar to apical radial glial cells (aRGs) from which they are derived, and whose somata are found more apically in the ventricular zone. bRGs share similarities with aRGs in terms of gene expression (SOX2, PAX6, NESTIN), whilst also expressing a range of more specific genes (such as HOPX). In primate brains, bRGs can divide multiple times, self-renewing and/or generating intermediate progenitors and neurons. They display a highly specific cytokinesis behavior termed mitotic somal translocation. We focus here on recently identified molecular mechanisms associated with the generation and amplification of bRGs, including bRG-like cells in the rodent. These include signaling pathways such as the FGF-MAPK cascade, SHH, PTEN/AKT, PDGF pathways, and proteins such as INSM, GPSM2, ASPM, TRNP1, ARHGAP11B, PAX6 and HIF1α. A number of these proteins were identified through transcriptome comparisons in human aRGs versus bRGs, and validated by modifying their activities or expression levels in the mouse. This latter experiment often revealed enhanced bRG-like cell production, even in some cases generating folds (gyri) on the surface of the mouse cortex. We compare the features of the identified cells and methods used to characterize them in each model. These important data converge to indicate pathways essential for the production and expansion of bRGs, which may help us understand cortical development in health and disease.</content>

 Schizophrenia (SZ) is associated with changes in the structure and function of several brain areas. Several findings suggest that these impairments are related to a dysfunction in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in brain areas such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the hippocampus (HPC) and the primary auditory cortex (A1); however, it is still unclear how the GABAergic system is disrupted in these brain areas. Here, we examined the effect of ketamine (Ket) administration during late adolescence in rats on inhibition in the mPFC-, ventral HPC (vHPC) and A1. We observe that Ket treatment reduced the expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) and the GABA-producing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) as well as decreased inhibitory synaptic efficacy in the mPFC. In addition, Ket-treated rats performed worse in executive tasks that depend on the integrity and proper functioning of the mPFC. Conversely, we do not find such changes in vHPC or A1. Together, our results provide strong experimental support for the hypothesis that during adolescence, the function of the mPFC is more susceptible than that of HPC or A1 to NMDAR hypofunction, showing apparent structure specificity. Thus, the impairment of inhibitory circuitry in mPFC could be a convergent primary site of SZ-like behavior during the adulthood.</content>

 The voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, encoded by 40 genes, repolarize all electrically excitable cells, including plant, cardiac and neuronal cells. Although these genes were fully sequenced decades ago, a comprehensive kinetic characterization of all Kv channels is still missing, especially near physiological temperature. Here, we present a standardized kinetic map of the 40 homomeric Kv channels systematically characterized at 15°C, 25°C and 35°C. Importantly, the Kv kinetics at 35°C differ significantly from commonly reported kinetics, usually performed at room temperature. We observed voltage-dependent Q10 for all active Kv channels and inherent heterogeneity in kinetics for some of them.  Kinetic properties are consistent across different host cell lines and conserved across mouse, rat and human. All electrophysiology data from all Kv channels are made available through public website (Channelpedia). This dataset provides a solid foundation for exploring kinetics of heteromeric channels, roles of auxiliary subunits, kinetic modulation, and for building accurate Kv models.</content>

 The detailed architectural examination of the neuronal nuclei in any brain region, using confocal microscopy, requires quantification of fluorescent signals in three-dimensional stacks of confocal images. An essential prerequisite to any quantification is the segmentation of the nuclei which are typically tightly packed in the tissue, the extreme being the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), in which nuclei frequently appear to overlap due to limitations in microscope resolution. Segmentation in DG is a challenging task due to the presence of a significant amount of image artifacts and densely packed nuclei. Accordingly, we established an algorithm based on continuous boundary tracing criterion aiming to reconstruct the nucleus surface and to separate the adjacent nuclei. The presented algorithm neither uses a pre-built nucleus model, nor performs image thresholding, which makes it robust against variations in image intensity and poor contrast. Further, the reconstructed surface is used to study morphology and spatial arrangement of the nuclear interior. The presented method is generally dedicated to segmentation of crowded, overlapping objects in 3D space. In particular, it allows us to study quantitatively the architecture of the neuronal nucleus using confocal-microscopic approach.</content>

 Human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold a large potential for disease modeling. hiPSC-derived human astrocyte and neuronal cultures permit investigations of neural signal-ing pathways with subcellular resolution. Combinatorial cultures, and three-dimensional (3-D) embryonic bodies enlarge the scope of investigations to multi-cellular phenomena. A the highest level of complexity, brain organoids that – in many aspects – recapitulate anatomical and functional features of the developing brain permit the study of developmental and morphological aspects of human disease. An ideal microscope for 3-D tissue imaging at these different scales would combine features from both confocal laser-scanning and light-sheet microscopes: a micrometric optical sectioning capacity and sub-micrometric spatial re-solution, a large field of view and high frame rate, and a low degree of invasiveness, i.e., ideally, a better photon efficiency than that of a confocal microscope. In the present work, we describe such an instrument that uses planar two-photon (2P) excitation. Its particularity is that – unlike two- or three-lens light-sheet microscopes – it uses a single, low-magnification, high-numerical aperture objective for the generation and scanning of a virtual light sheet. The microscope builds on a modified Nipkow-Petráň spinning-disk scheme for achieving wide-field excitation. However, unlike the Yokogawa design that uses a tandem disk, our concept combines micro lenses, dichroic mirrors and detection pinholes on a single disk. This new design, advantageous for 2P excitation, circumvents problems arising with the tandem disk from the large wavelength-difference between the infrared excitation light and visible fluorescence. 2P fluorescence excited by the light sheet is collected with the same objective and imaged onto a fast sCMOS camera. We demonstrate 3-D imaging of TO-PRO3-stained embryonic bodies and of brain organoids, uncleared and after rapid partial transparisation with triethanolamine formamide (RTF) and we compare the performance of our instrument to that of a confocal laser-scanning microscope having a similar numerical aperture. Our large-field 2P-spinning disk microscope permits one order of magnitude faster imaging, affords less photobleaching and permits better depth penetration than a confocal microscope with similar spatial resolution.</content>

 Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without preprocessing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as –omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.</content>

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients are known to have heterogeneous clinical presentation and pathologic patterns. We hypothesize that AD dementia can be categorized into subtypes based on multimodal imaging biomarkers such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tau positron emission tomography (PET), and amyloid PET. We collected 3T MRI, 18F-THK5351 PET, and 18F-flutemetamol (FLUTE) PET data from 83 patients with AD dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating ≤ 1) and 60 normal controls (NC), and applied surface-based analyses to measure cortical thickness, THK5351 SUVR and FLUTE SUVR for each participant. For the patient group, we performed an agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis using the three multimodal imaging features on the vertices (n = 3 × 79,950). The identified AD subtypes were compared to NC using general linear models adjusting for age, sex, and years of education. We mapped the effect size within significant cortical regions reaching a corrected p-vertex &amp;lt; 0.05 (random field theory). Our surface-based multimodal framework has revealed three distinct subtypes among AD patients: medial temporal-dominant subtype (MT, n = 44), parietal-dominant subtype (P, n = 19), and diffuse atrophy subtype (D, n = 20). The topography of cortical atrophy and THK5351 retention differentiates between the three subtypes. In the case of FLUTE, three subtypes did not show distinct topographical differences, although cortical composite retention was significantly higher in the P type than in the MT type. These three subtypes also differed in demographic and clinical features. In conclusion, AD patients may be clustered into three subtypes with distinct topographical features of cortical atrophy and tau deposition, although amyloid deposition may not differ across the subtypes in terms of topography.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The mechanisms that regulate pluripotency are still largely unknown. Here, we show that Telomere Repeat Binding Factor 1 (TRF1), a component of the shelterin complex, regulates the genome-wide binding of polycomb and polycomb H3K27me3 repressive marks to pluripotency genes, thereby exerting vast epigenetic changes that contribute to the maintenance of mouse ES cells in a naïve state. We further show that TRF1 mediates these effects by regulating TERRA, the lncRNAs transcribed from telomeres. We find that TERRAs are enriched at polycomb and stem cell genes in pluripotent cells and that TRF1 abrogation results in increased TERRA levels and in higher TERRA binding to those genes, coincidental with the induction of cell-fate programs and the loss of the naïve state. These results are consistent with a model in which TRF1-dependent changes in TERRA levels modulate polycomb recruitment to pluripotency and differentiation genes. These unprecedented findings explain why TRF1 is essential for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency.</content>

 Inhibitory control matures through adolescence and into early adulthood, impacting decision-making. Impairments in inhibitory control are associated with various psychopathologies, many of which emerge during adolescence. In this review, we examine the neural basis of developmental improvements in inhibitory control by integrating findings from humans and non-human primates, identifying the structural and functional specialization of executive brain systems that mediates cognitive maturation. Behavioral manifestations of response inhibition suggest that adolescents are capable of producing adult level responses on occasion, but lack the ability to engage systems mediating response inhibition in a consistent fashion.</content>

The strength and breadth of an individual’s antibody repertoire is an important predictor of their response to influenza infection or vaccination. Although progress has been made in understanding qualitatively how repeated exposures shape the antibody mediated immune response, quantitative understanding remains limited. We developed a set of mathematical models describing short-term antibody kinetics following influenza infection or vaccination and fit them to haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres from 5 groups of ferrets which were exposed to different combinations of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV with or without adjuvant), A/H3N2 priming inoculation and post-vaccination A/H1N1 inoculation. We fit models with various immunological mechanisms that have been empirically observed but have not previously been included in mathematical models of antibody landscapes, including; titre ceiling effects, antigenic seniority and exposure-type specific cross reactivity. Based on the parameter estimates of the best supported models, we describe a number of key immunological features. We found quantifiable differences in the degree of homologous and cross-reactive antibody boosting elicited by different exposure types. Infection and adjuvanted vaccination generally resulted in strong, broadly reactive responses whereas unadjuvanted vaccination resulted in a weak, narrow response. We found that the order of exposure mattered: priming with A/H3N2 improved subsequent vaccine response, and the second dose of adjuvanted vaccination resulted in substantially greater antibody boosting than the first. Either antigenic seniority or a titre ceiling effect were included in the two best fitting models, suggesting a role for a mechanism describing diminishing antibody boosting with repeated exposures. Although there was considerable uncertainty in our estimates of antibody waning parameters, our results suggest that both short and long term waning were present and would be identifiable with a larger set of experiments. These results highlight the potential use of repeat exposure animal models in revealing short-term, strain-specific immune dynamics of influenza.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/of7eQ7vA7z4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The Long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) is a primary source of genetic variation in humans and other mammals. Despite its importance, LINE-1 activity remains difficult to study because of its highly repetitive nature. Here, we developed and validated a method called TeXP to gauge LINE-1 activity accurately. TeXP builds mappability signatures from LINE-1 subfamilies to deconvolve the effect of pervasive transcription from autonomous LINE-1 activity. In particular, it apportions the multiple reads aligned to the many LINE-1 instances in the genome into these two categories. Using our method, we evaluated well-established cell lines, cell-line compartments and healthy tissues and found that the vast majority (91.7%) of transcriptome reads overlapping LINE-1 derive from pervasive transcription. We validated TeXP by independently estimating the levels of LINE-1 autonomous transcription using ddPCR, finding high concordance. Next, we applied our method to comprehensively measure LINE-1 activity across healthy somatic cells, while backing out the effect of pervasive transcription. Unexpectedly, we found that LINE-1 activity is present in many normal somatic cells. This finding contrasts with earlier studies showing that LINE-1 has limited activity in healthy somatic tissues, except for neuroprogenitor cells. Interestingly, we found that the amount of LINE-1 activity was associated with the with the amount of cell turnover, with tissues with low cell turnover rates (e.g. the adult central nervous system) showing lower LINE-1 activity. Altogether, our results show how accounting for pervasive transcription is critical to accurately quantify the activity of highly repetitive regions of the human genome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fVCUaG21g3A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

RNA-protein interaction plays important roles in post-transcriptional regulation. Recent advancements in cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq) technologies make it possible to detect the binding peaks of a given RNA binding protein (RBP) at transcriptome scale. However, it is still challenging to predict the functional consequences of RBP binding peaks. In this study, we propose the Protein-RNA Association Strength (PRAS), which integrates the intensities and positions of the binding peaks of RBPs for functional mRNA targets prediction. We illustrate the superiority of PRAS over existing approaches on predicting the functional targets of two related but divergent CELF (CUGBP, ELAV-like factor) RBPs in mouse brain and muscle. We also demonstrate the potential of PRAS for wide adoption by applying it to the enhanced CLIP-seq (eCLIP) datasets of 37 RNA decay related RBPs in two human cell lines. PRAS can be utilized to investigate any RBPs with available CLIP-seq peaks.

Astrocytes, a glial cell type of the central nervous system, have emerged as detectors and regulators of neuronal information processing. Astrocyte excitability resides in transient variations of free cytosolic calcium concentration over a range of temporal and spatial scales, from sub-microdomains to waves propagating throughout the cell. Despite extensive experimental approaches, it is not clear how these signals are transmitted to and integrated within an astrocyte. The localization of the main molecular actors and the geometry of the system, including the spatial organization of calcium channels &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;, are deemed essential. However, as most calcium signals occur in astrocytic ramifications that are too fine to be resolved by conventional light microscopy, most of those spatial data are unknown and computational modeling remains the only methodology to study this issue. Here, we propose an &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-mediated calcium signaling model for dynamics in such small sub-cellular volumes. To account for the expected stochasticity and low copy numbers, our model is both spatially explicit and particle-based. Extensive simulations show that spontaneous calcium signals arise in the model via the interplay between excitability and stochasticity. The model reproduces the main forms of calcium signals and indicates that their frequency crucially depends on the spatial organization of the &lt;i&gt;IP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; channels. Importantly, we show that two processes expressing exactly the same calcium channels can display different types of calcium signals depending on the spatial organization of the channels. Our model with realistic process volume and calcium concentrations successfully reproduces spontaneous calcium signals that we measured in calcium micro-domains with confocal microscopy and predicts that local variations of calcium indicators might contribute to the diversity of calcium signals observed in astrocytes. To our knowledge, this model is the first model suited to investigate calcium dynamics in fine astrocytic processes and to propose plausible mechanisms responsible for their variability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NfQm5wwQpeI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Compromise in inspiratory breathing following cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) is caused by damage to descending bulbospinal axons originating in the rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG) and consequent denervation and silencing of phrenic motor neuron (PhMNs) that directly control diaphragm activation. In a rat model of high-cervical hemisection SCI, we performed systemic administration of an antagonist peptide directed against phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a central inhibitor of neuron-intrinsic axon growth potential. PTEN antagonist peptide (PAP4) robustly restored diaphragm function, as determined with electromyography recordings in living SCI animals. PAP4 promoted substantial, long-distance regeneration of injured rVRG axons through the lesion and back toward PhMNs located throughout the C3-C5 spinal cord. These regrowing rVRG axons also formed putative excitatory synaptic connections with PhMNs, demonstrating reconnection of rVRG-PhMN-diaphragm circuitry. Lastly, re-lesion through the hemisection site completely ablated functional recovery induced by PAP4. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that axon regeneration in response to systemic PAP4 administration promoted recovery of diaphragmatic respiratory function after cervical SCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using non-invasive and only transient systemic delivery of an antagonist peptide that targets PTEN, we promoted significant regeneration of bulbospinal respiratory axons into and through a large lesion site in a rat model of cervical SCI, as well as growth of these axons back into the intact distal spinal cord for several spinal segments. We also found that these regenerating axons synaptically reconnected with their appropriate post-synaptic respiratory motor neuron targets, resulting in reconnection of the damaged neural circuit. Furthermore, by showing that re-lesion of regenerating axons resulted in complete loss of PTEN peptide-induced diaphragm recovery, we demonstrate that long-distance axon regeneration can drive recovery of respiratory function following cervical SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Naturalistic stimuli can elicit highly similar brain activity across viewers. How do naturalistic educational materials engage human brains and evoke learning desire? Here, we presented 15 audiovisual course clips (each lasting about 120 s) to university students and recorded their neural activity through electroencephalography (EEG). Upon finishing all the video viewings, subjects ranked 15 courses in order of learning desire and reported the reasons of high learning desire (i.e., &quot;value&quot; and &quot;interest&quot;). The brain activity during the video viewing was measured as the neural similarity via inter-subject correlation (ISC), that is, correlation between each subject’s neural responses and others’. Based on averaged learning desire rankings across subjects, course clips were classified with high vs. medium vs. low motivational effectiveness. We found that ISC of high effective course clips was larger than that of low effective ones. The ISC difference (high vs. low) was positively associated with subjects’ learning desire difference (high vs. low). Such an association occurred when viewing time accumulated to about 80 s. Moreover, ISC was correlated with &quot;interest-based&quot; rather than &quot;value-based&quot; learning desire. These findings advance our understanding of learning motivation via the neural similarity in the context of online education and provide potential neurophysiological suggestions for pedagogical practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This study shows that naturalistic educational materials with high motivational effectiveness elicit larger neural similarity across learners than less effective ones. Importantly, the neural similarity serves as a sensitive predictor of learners’ course-learning desire. It is suggested that the use of emerging electroencephalography-derived inter-subject correlation approach works with evaluating the quality of audiovisual educational materials. Hence, such a novel approach is promising to provide neurophysiological information for pedagogical practices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating post-injury neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus remain undefined. We have previously demonstrated that pre-injury treatment with anti-microRNA-181a preserved neurons and prevented astrocyte dysfunction in the hippocampal CA1 following transient forebrain ischemia. In the present study we assessed post-injury treatment with anti-miR-181a on recovery of CA1 neurons following transient forebrain ischemia in rats. Stereotactic CA1 injection of miR-181a antagomir at either 2h or 7d post-injury resulted in improved restoration of CA1 measured at 28d post-injury. Treatment with antagomir was associated with overexpression of the mir-181a target cell-adhesion associated/related oncogene (CDON) protein and enhanced expression of the neuroprogenitor cell marker doublecortin (DCX) in the CA1. Assessment of GFAP+ cell fate by Cre/Lox-mediated deletion demonstrated that some GFAP+ cells in CA1 exhibited &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; DCX expression in response to injury. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments using primary neuronal stem cells confirmed that miR-181a inhibition augmented expression of DCX and directed cellular differentiation towards a neuronal fate. These results suggest that miR-181a inhibition plays a central role in restoration of CA1 neurons &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; augmentation of early latent neurogenic gene activation in neuralprogenitor cells, including some reactive astrocytes. Therapeutic interventions targeting this restorative process may represent a novel post-injury approach to improve clinical outcomes in survivors of forebrain ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Persistent cognitive impairment is a major source of decreased quality of life for survivors of cardiac arrest, with impaired memory cited as the most severe long-term deficit (Moulaert et al., 2009). Interruptions in cerebral blood flow result in delayed death of hippocampal CA1 neurons (Horn and Schlote, 1992). Pharmaceutical therapies given during this two-week therapeutic window could drastically reduce the cognitive deficits experienced by survivors of forebrain ischemia. However, interventions that have attempted to directly target neurons after forebrain ischemia have so far failed to translate to effective therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel treatments that either provide protection against loss or hasten functional recovery of CA1 neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and although its etiology remains unclear, it seems that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other prediabetic states of insulin resistance could contribute to the appearance of sporadic AD. As such, we have assessed whether tau and β‐amyloid (Aβ) deposits might be present in pancreatic tissue of subjects with AD, and whether amylin, an amyloidogenic protein deposited in the pancreas of T2DM patients, might accumulate in the brain of AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied pancreatic and brain tissue from 48 individuals with no neuropathological alterations and from 87 subjects diagnosed with AD. We examined Aβ and tau accumulation in the pancreas as well as that of amylin in the brain. Moreover, we performed proximity ligation assays to ascertain whether tau and/or Aβ interact with amylin in either the pancreas or brain of these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytoplasmic tau and Aβ protein deposits were detected in pancreatic β cells of subjects with AD as well as in subjects with a normal neuropathological examination but with a history of T2DM and in a small cohort of control subjects without T2DM. Furthermore, we found amylin deposits in the brain of these subjects, providing histological evidence that amylin can interact with Aβ and tau in both the pancreas and hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of both tau and Aβ inclusions in pancreatic β cells, and of amylin deposits in the brain, provides new evidence of a potential overlap in the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of T2DM and AD. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials targeting β‐amyloid peptides (Aβ) for Alzheimer disease (AD) failed for arguable reasons that include selecting the wrong stages of AD pathophysiology or Aβ being the wrong target. Targeting Aβ to prevent cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has not been rigorously followed, although the causal role of Aβ for CAA and related hemorrhages is undisputed. CAA occurs with normal aging and to various degrees in AD, where its impact and treatment is confounded by the presence of parenchymal Aβ deposition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APPDutch mice develop CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid, mimicking hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch type (HCHWA‐D). Mice were treated with a β‐site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitor. We used 3‐dimensional ultramicroscopy and immunoassays for visualizing CAA and assessing Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAA onset in mice was at 22 to 24 months, first in frontal leptomeningeal and superficial cortical vessels followed by vessels penetrating the cortical layers. CSF Aβ increased with aging followed by a decrease of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 upon CAA onset, supporting the idea that combined reduction of CSF Aβ40 and Aβ42 is a specific biomarker for vascular amyloid. BACE1 inhibitor treatment starting at CAA onset and continuing for 4 months revealed a 90% Aβ reduction in CSF and largely prevented CAA progression and associated pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study showing that Aβ reduction at early disease time points largely prevents CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid. Our observation provides a preclinical basis for Aβ‐reducing treatments in patients at risk of CAA and in presymptomatic HCHWA‐D. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One of the basic frameworks in science views behavioral products as a process
within a dynamic system. The mechanism might be seen as a representation of
many instances of centralized control in real time. Many real systems, however,
exhibit autonomy by denying statically treated mechanisms. This study addresses
the issues related to the identification of dynamic systems and suggests how
determining the basic principles of a collective structure may be key to
understanding complex behavioral processes. A fundamental model is derived to
assess the advantages of this perspective using a basic methodology. The
connection between perspective and technique demonstrates certain aspects
within their actual context, while also clearly including the framework of
actual dynamic system identification.

 &lt;p&gt;There is an increasing interest in the systematic disagreement about
profoundly ambiguous stimuli in the color domain. However, this research has
been hobbled by the fact that we could not create such stimuli at will. Here,
we describe a design principle that allows the creation of such stimuli and
apply this principle to create one such stimulus set - the crocs and socks.
Using this set, we probed the color perception of a large sample of observers,
showing that these stimuli are indeed categorically ambiguous and that we can
predict the percept from fabric priors resulting from experience. We also
relate the perception of these crocs to other color-ambiguous stimuli - the
dress and the sneaker and conclude that differential priors likely underlie
polarized disagreement in cognition more generally.

 OBJECTIVE： To assist clinicians to operate repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) precisely based on the coil magnetic field spatial distribution with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Navigation.
METHODS: A fast method for calculating electromagnetic fields in layered brain structures in frequency domain was proposed. By approaching Bessel function in different intervals, the integral with a highly oscillatory kernel was transformed into two parts: a definite integral and a weakened oscillatory one. The distribution of induced current density and magnetic field intensity of rTMS stimulation effect on brain was quantitatively calculated, so that clinicians could intuitively grasp the safe range of coil stimulation on brain. Then, the crucial factor of the stimulation effect of rTMS was determined, and an accurate coil positioning of the rTMS efficiently was completed.            
Result: The maximal attenuation of induced electric field and magnetic induction intensity was 72.20% and 86.867% at 3 cm away from the skin in the brain layered model. The clinical examination results of electric field intensity distribution, magnetic field intensity distribution, current density distribution, layered brain modeling and coil location speed in the brain model teaching group were significantly higher than those in the traditional teaching group (P &amp;lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: It is suitable for clinicians to quickly complete the precise positioning of rTMS, master the adjustment of coil stimulation therapeutic parameters, and realize the precise positioning operation of rTMS with MRI navigation in intracranial.</content>

		<content type="html">
 According to the prevailing ‘clock’ model, chromosome decondensation and nuclear envelope reformation when cells exit mitosis are byproducts of Cdk1 inactivation at the metaphase-anaphase transition, controlled by the spindle assembly checkpoint. However, mitotic exit was recently shown to be a function of chromosome separation during anaphase, assisted by a midzone Aurora B phosphorylation gradient - the ‘ruler’ model. Here we found that Cdk1 remains active during anaphase due to ongoing APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdc20&lt;/sup&gt;- and APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated degradation of B-type Cyclins in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and human cells. Failure to degrade B-type Cyclins during anaphase prevented mitotic exit in a Cdk1-dependent manner. Cyclin B1-Cdk1 localized at the spindle midzone in an Aurora B-dependent manner, with incompletely separated chromosomes showing the highest Cdk1 activity. Slowing down anaphase chromosome motion delayed Cyclin B1 degradation and mitotic exit in an Aurora B-dependent manner. Thus, a crosstalk between molecular ‘rulers’ and ‘clocks’ licenses mitotic exit only after proper chromosome separation.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have only investigated age-related differences in emotional processing and encoding in response to, not in anticipation of, emotional stimuli. In the current study, we investigated age-related differences in the impact of emotional anticipation on affective responses and episodic memory for emotional images. Young and older adults were scanned while encoding negative and neutral images preceded by cues that were either valid or invalid predictors of image valence. Participants were asked to rate the emotional intensity of the images and to complete a recognition task. Using multivariate behavioral partial least squares (PLS) analysis, we found that greater anticipatory recruitment of the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and hippocampus in older adults predicted reduced memory for negative than neutral images and the opposite for young adults. Seed PLS analysis further showed that following negative cues older adults, but not young adults, exhibited greater activation of vmPFC, reduced activation of amygdala, and worse memory for negative compared with neutral images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that the “positivity effect” seen in older adults’ memory performance may be related to the spontaneous emotional suppression of negative affect in anticipation of, not just in response to, negative stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Understanding the molecular function of MeCP2 will not only provide insights into the pathogenesis of MeCP2-related disorders, but will also shed light on the epigenetic regulation of neuronal function. In the past few years, a number of studies have provided mechanistic evidence that MeCP2 recruits co-repressor complexes to particular sequences of methylated DNA. Additionally, innovative design and high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided opportunities to study the effects of MeCP2 on the neuronal transcriptome at an unprecedented level of detail, demonstrating that MeCP2 modulates gene expression in a context-specific manner. These findings have raised new questions and challenged current models of MeCP2 function. In this review, we describe several recent developments, highlight future challenges, and articulate a model by which MeCP2 functions as an organizer of chromatin architecture to modulate global gene expression in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Recent developments in neural recording technologies are providing unprecedented access to the activity of such populations during increasingly complex experimental contexts; however, extracting scientific insights from such recordings requires the concurrent development of analytical tools that relate this population activity to system-level function. This is a primary motivation for latent variable models, which seek to provide a low-dimensional description of population activity that can be related to experimentally controlled variables, as well as uncontrolled variables such as internal states (e.g. attention and arousal) and elements of behavior. While deriving an understanding of function from traditional latent variable methods relies on low-dimensional visualizations, new approaches are targeting more interpretable descriptions of the components underlying system-level function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Most biological systems are difficult to analyse due to a multitude of interacting components and the concomitant lack of information about the essential dynamics. Finding appropriate models that provide a systematic description of such biological systems and that help to identify their relevant factors and processes can be challenging given the sheer number of possibilities. Model selection algorithms that evaluate the performance of a multitude of different models against experimental data provide a useful tool to identify appropriate model structures. However, many algorithms addressing the analysis of complex dynamical systems, as they are often used in biology, compare a preselected number of models or rely on exhaustive searches of the total model space which might be unfeasible dependent on the number of possibilities. Therefore, we developed an algorithm that is able to perform model selection on complex systems and searches large model spaces in a dynamical way. Our algorithm includes local and newly developed non-local search methods that can prevent the algorithm from ending up in local minima of the model space by accounting for structurally similar processes. We tested and validated the algorithm based on simulated data and showed its flexibility for handling different model structures. We also used the algorithm to analyse experimental data on the cell proliferation dynamics of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells that were cultured under different conditions. Our analyses indicated dynamical changes within the proliferation potential of cells that was reduced within tissue-like 3D &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; cultures compared to suspension. Due to the flexibility in handling various model structures, the algorithm is applicable to a large variety of different biological problems and represents a useful tool for the data-oriented evaluation of complex model spaces.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/chXjj93krjA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anticoagulation reversal, intensive blood pressure lowering, neurosurgery, and access to critical care might all be beneficial in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We combined and implemented these as the “ABC” hyperacute care bundle and sought to determine whether the implementation was associated with lower case fatality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABC bundle was implemented from June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016. Key process targets were set, and a registry captured consecutive patients. We compared 30‐day case fatality before, during, and after bundle implementation with multivariate logistic regression and used mediation analysis to determine which care process measures mediated any association. Difference‐in‐difference analysis compared 30‐day case fatality with 32,295 patients with ICH from 214 other hospitals in England and Wales using Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 973 ICH patients were admitted in the study period. Compared to before implementation, the adjusted odds of death by 30 days were lower in the implementation period (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–0.97, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03), and this was sustained after implementation (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24–0.61, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Implementation of the bundle was associated with a 10.8 percentage point (95% CI = −17.9 to −3.7, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003) reduction in 30‐day case fatality in difference‐in‐difference analysis. The total effect of the care bundle was mediated by a reduction in do‐not‐resuscitate orders within 24 hours (52.8%) and increased admission to critical care (11.1%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation of the ABC care bundle was significantly associated with lower 30‐day case fatality after ICH. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Hypersynchronous network activity is the defining hallmark of epilepsy and manifests in a wide spectrum of phenomena of which electrographic activity during seizures is only one extreme. The aim of this study was to differentiate between different types of epileptiform activity patterns and investigate their temporal succession and interactions. We analyzed local field potentials from freely behaving male mice that had received an intrahippocampal kainate injection to model mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Epileptiform spikes occurred in distinct bursts. Using machine learning, we derived a scale reflecting the spike load of bursts and three main burst categories that we labeled high-load, medium-load and low-load bursts. We found that bursts of these categories were non-randomly distributed in time. High-load bursts formed clusters and were typically surrounded by transition phases with increased rates of medium-load and low-load bursts. In apparent contradiction to this, increased rates of low-load bursts were also associated with elongated background phases, i.e. periods lacking high-load bursting. Furthermore, the rate of low-load bursts was more strongly correlated with the duration of background phases than the overall rate of epileptiform spikes. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low-level epileptiform activity could promote network stability but could also participate in transitions towards major epileptiform events, depending on the current state of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; It is a major challenge in epilepsy research to understand how different types of epileptiform activity interact and whether epileptiform spikes prevent or promote major epileptic events. In our mouse model for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, epileptiform spikes occurred in bursts. Increased rates of bursts with low spike load were clearly associated with extended phases lacking high-load bursts, which is in line with the view that low-level activity could promote network stability in epilepsy. Low-load bursts, however, also occurred during transition phases to clusters of high-load bursts. Both findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low-level epileptiform activity could reduce the excitability of the network but that its impact depends on the current state of the network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Modern neuroimaging technologies, combined with state-of-the-art data
processing pipelines, have made it possible to collect longitudinal
observations of an individual's brain connectome at different ages. It is of
substantial scientific interest to study how brain connectivity varies over
time in relation to human cognitive traits. In brain connectomics, the
structural brain network for an individual corresponds to a set of
interconnections among brain regions. We propose a symmetric bilinear logistic
regression to learn a set of small subgraphs relevant to a binary outcome from
longitudinal brain networks as well as estimating the time effects of the
subgraphs. We enforce the extracted signal subgraphs to have clique structure
which has appealing interpretations as they can be related to neurological
circuits. The time effect of each signal subgraph reflects how its predictive
effect on the outcome varies over time, which may improve our understanding of
interactions between the aging of brain structure and neurological disorders.
Application of this method on longitudinal brain connectomics and cognitive
capacity data shows interesting discovery of relevant interconnections among a
small set of brain regions in frontal and temporal lobes with better predictive
performance than competitors.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis-associated joint pain is frequently observed independent
of disease activity, suggesting unidentified pain mechanisms. We demonstrate
that antibodies binding to cartilage, specific for collagen type II (CII) or
cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), elicit mechanical hypersensitivity
in mice, uncoupled from visual, histological and molecular indications of
inflammation. Cartilage antibody-induced pain-like behavior does not depend on
complement activation or joint inflammation, but instead on tissue antigen
recognition and local immune complex (IC) formation. smFISH and IHC suggest
that neuronal Fcgr1 and Fcgr2b mRNA are transported to peripheral ends of
primary afferents. CII-ICs directly activate cultured WT but not FcR{\gamma}
chain-deficient DRG neurons. In line with this observation, CII-IC does not
induce mechanical hypersensitivity in FcR{\gamma} chain-deficient mice.
Furthermore, injection of CII antibodies does not generate pain-like behavior
in FcR{\gamma} chain-deficient mice or mice lacking activating Fc{\gamma}Rs in
neurons. In summary, this study defines functional coupling between
autoantibodies and pain transmission that may facilitate the development of new
disease-relevant pain therapeutics.

 &lt;p&gt;Networks in the brain consist of different types of neurons. Here we
investigate the influence of neuron diversity on the dynamics, phase space
structure and computational capabilities of spiking neural networks. We find
that already a single neuron of a different type can qualitatively change the
network dynamics and that mixed networks may combine the computational
capabilities of ones with a single neuron type. We study inhibitory networks of
concave leaky (LIF) and convex &quot;anti-leaky&quot; (XIF) integrate-and-fire neurons
that generalize irregularly spiking non-chaotic LIF neuron networks. Endowed
with simple conductance-based synapses for XIF neurons, our networks can
generate a balanced state of irregular asynchronous spiking as well. We
determine the voltage probability distributions and self-consistent firing
rates assuming Poisson input with finite size spike impacts. Further, we
compute the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and the covariant
Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) specifying the corresponding perturbation directions.
We find that there is approximately one positive LE for each XIF neuron. This
indicates in particular that a single XIF neuron renders the network dynamics
chaotic. A simple mean-field approach, which can be justified by properties of
the CLVs, explains the finding. As an application, we propose a spike-based
computing scheme where our networks serve as computational reservoirs and their
different stability properties yield different computational capabilities.

 Cystatin B (CSTB) is a ubiquitous protein belonging to a superfamily of protease inhibitors. CSTB may play critical role in brain physiology because its mutations cause progressive myoclonic epilepsy-1A (EPM1A), the most common form of progressive myoclonic epilepsy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of CSTB role in the Central Nervous System (CNS) are largely unknown. To investigate the possible involvement of CSTB in the synaptic plasticity, we analyzed its expression in synaptosomes as model system in studying the physiology of the synaptic regions of the CNS. We found that CSTB is not only present in the synaptosomes isolated from rat and mouse brain cortex, but also secreted into the medium in a depolarization-controlled manner. In addition, using BONCAT (biorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging) procedure, we demonstrated, for the first time, that CSTB is locally synthesized in the synaptosomes. The synaptic localization of CSTB was confirmed in a human 3D model of cortical development, namely cerebral organoids. Altogether these results suggest that CSTB may play a role in the brain plasticity and open a new perspective in studying the involvement of CSTB deregulation in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.</content>

 Recently, we reported that ALWPs, which we developed by combining Liuwei Dihuang pills (LWPs) with antler, regulates the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory response and rescues LPS-induced short- and long-term memory impairment in wild-type (WT) mice. In the present study, we examined the effects of ALWPs on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and cognitive function in WT mice as well as 5×FAD mice (a mouse model of AD). Here, we found that administration of ALWPs significantly reduced amyloid plaque levels in 5×FAD mice and significantly decreased amyloid beta (Abeta) levels in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing H4 cells. In addition, ALWP administration significantly suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation in 5×FAD mice. Oral administration of ALWPs significantly improved long-term memory in scopolamine (SCO)-injected WT mice and 5×FAD mice by altering dendritic spine density. Importantly, ALWPs promoted spinogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons and WT mice and modulated the dendritic spine number in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that ALWPs are a candidate therapeutic drug for AD that can modulate amyloid plaque load, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic/cognitive function.</content>

 The advances in medicine, together with lifestyle modifications, led to a rising life expectancy. Unfortunately, however, aging is accompanied by an alarming boost of age-associated chronic pathologies, including neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Interestingly, a non-negligible interplay between alterations of glucose homeostasis and brain dysfunction has clearly emerged. In particular, epidemiological studies have pointed out a possible association between Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Insulin resistance, one of the major hallmark for etiology of T2D, has a detrimental influence on PD, negatively affecting PD phenotype, accelerating its progression and worsening cognitive impairment. This review aims to provide an exhaustive analysis of the most recent evidences supporting the key role of insulin resistance in PD pathogenesis. It will focus on the relevance of insulin in the brain, working as pro-survival neurotrophic factor and as a master regulator of neuronal mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Insulin action as a modulator of dopamine signaling and of alpha-synuclein degradation will be described in details, too. The intriguing idea that shared deregulated pathogenic pathways represent a link between PD and insulin resistance has clinical and therapeutic implications. Thus, ongoing studies about the promising healing potential of common antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, exenatide, DPP IV inhibitors, thiazolidinediones and bromocriptine, will be summarized and the rationale for their use to decelerate neurodegeneration will be critically assessed.</content>

 Sustained inflammation in the injured cortex is a promising therapeutic target for disease-modification after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, its extent and dynamics of expansion are incompletely understood which challenges the timing and placement of therapeutics to lesioned area. Our aim was to characterize the evolution of chronic inflammation during lesion expansion in lateral fluid-percussion injury (FPI) rat model with focus on the MRI-negative perilesional cortex. T2-weighted MR imaging (T2w MRI) and localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were performed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-injury. End-point histology, including Nissl for neuronal death, GFAP for astrogliosis, and Prussian Blue for iron were used to assess perilesional histopathology. An additional animal cohort was imaged with a positron emission tomography (PET) using translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) radiotracer [18F]-FEPPA. T2w MRI assessed lesion growth and detected chronic inflammation along the lesion border while rest of the ipsilateral cortex was MRI-negative (MRI-). Instead, myoinositol that is an inflammatory MRS marker for gliosis, glutathione for oxidative stress, and choline for membrane turnover were elevated throughout the 6-months follow-up in the MRI- perilesional cortex (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). MRS markers revealed chronically sustained inflammation across the ipsilateral cortex but did not indicate the upcoming lesion expansion. Instead, the rostral expansion of the cortical lesion was systematically preceded by a hyperintense band in T2w images months earlier. Histologic analysis of the hyperintensity indicated scattered astrocytes, incomplete glial scar, and intracellularly packed and free iron. Yet, the band was negative in [18F]-FEPPA-PET. [18F]-FEPPA also showed no cortical TSPO expression within the MRS voxel in MRI- perilesional cortex or anywhere along glial scar when assessed at 2 months post-injury. However, [18F]-FEPPA showed a robust signal increase, indicating reactive microgliosis in the ipsilateral thalamus at 2 months post-TBI. We present evidence that MRS reveals chronic posttraumatic inflammation in MRI-negative perilesional cortex. The mismatch in MRS, MRI and PET measures may allow noninvasive endophenotyping of beneficial and detrimental inflammatory processes to aid targeting and timing of anti-inflammatory therapeutics.</content>

 Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies. Accurate and robust tumor segmentation and prediction of patients' overall survival are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and risk factor identification. Here we present a deep learning-based framework for brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction in glioma using multimodal MRI scans. For tumor segmentation, we use ensembles of three different 3D CNN architectures for robust performance through majority rule. This approach can effectively reduce model bias and boost performance. For survival prediction, we extract 4524 radiomic features from segmented tumor region. Then decision tree and cross validation are used to select potent features. Finally, a random forest model is trained to predict the overall survival of patients. On 2018 MICCAI Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS), our method ranks at second place and 5th place out of 60+ participating teams on survival prediction task and segmentation task respectively, achieving a promising 61.0% accuracy on classification of short-survivors, mid-survivors and long-survivors.</content>

 The elite sports environment provides a unique setting for studying human performance, where both cognitive and physical demands are high. Successful performance in sport is contingent upon key cognitive skills such as attention, perception, working memory and decision-making. The demands of competitive sport also increase loading on the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) offer the potential to investigate the cognitive demands of sport, neuroplasticity of athletes, and biofeedback training. However, practical and technical limitations of these methods have generally limited their use to laboratory-based studies of athletes during simulated sporting tasks. This review provides a brief overview of research that has applied neuroimaging technology to study various aspects of cognitive function during sports performance in athletes, alternative methods for measuring CNS loading (e.g., direct current potential), possible solutions and avenues of focus for future neuroergonomics research in sport.</content>

 Background: It has been argued that prosocial behaviors and momentary rewards activate the similar reward systems. However, a recent theoretical hypothesis encourages a fundamentally different view. Specifically, the social heuristic hypothesis posits that individuals internalize prosocial behaviors that are advantageous in their daily social life. These advantageous behaviors are fundamentally different from tangible and immediate reward. 
Objectives: Our objectives are to test a hypothesis that these advantageous prosocial behaviors are so critical to survival that it is necessary to have a neural system in the brain that leads people to maintain repeated social interactions. These neural systems are different from the computations of rewards because prosocial behaviors are not advantageous if only considering the computations of rewards.
Methods: To deepen the understanding of the neural systems of prosocial behaviors and reward, we conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to examine brain activation in prosocial behaviors and reward tasks.
Results: Prosocial behaviors specifically activated distinct brain systems to a greater degree than reward. These systems were implicated in the processing of social behaviors and included the insula, temporal lobe and superior temporal gyrus. By contrast, reward specifically activated the lentiform nucleus, thalamus, caudate nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex, which are associated with the brain reward system. 
Conclusions: These findings suggest that prosocial behaviors are different from reward and involve specific brain mechanisms.</content>

 The avian retina is composed of different types of photoreceptors responsible for image and non-image forming tasks: the visual photoreceptor cells (cones and rods), the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photoresponsive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and horizontal cells. Furthermore, the nonvisual opsins Opn3 (encephalopsin/panaopsin) and Opn5 (neuropsin) have been shown to be expressed in the vertebrate inner retina, responding to blue (BL) and UV light, respectively. Here we investigated the expression and localization of Opn3 and Opn5 in the developing chick retina at different embryonic days (E) as well as in primary cultures of retinal Müller glial cells (MC). Opn3 and Opn5 mRNAs and proteins appeared as early as E10 although traces of Opn3- and Opn5-like proteins were seen earlier by E7 in the forming RGC layer and in glial cells extending throughout the developing nuclear layer. Later on, at postnatal days 1-10 (PN1-10) a significant expression of Opn3 was observed in inner retinal cells and processes in plexiform layers, together with expression of the glial markers glutamine synthetase (GS) and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Opn3 and Opn5 were found to be expressed in primary MC cultures prepared at E8 and kept for two weeks.  In addition, significant effects of BL exposure on Opn3 expression and subcellular localization were observed in MCs as BL significantly increased its levels and modified its nuclear location when compared with dark-controls, through a mechanism dependent on protein synthesis. More importantly, a subpopulation of MCs responded to brief BL pulses by increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels; whereas light-responses were completely abolished with the retinal bleacher hydroxylamine pretreatment. Taken together, our findings show that these two opsins are expressed in inner retinal cells and MCs of the chicken retina at early developmental phases and remain expressed in the mature retina at postnatal days. In addition, the novel photic responses seen in MCs may suggest another important role for the glia in retinal physiology.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Spinal cord injury is a devastating neurological disorder that damages motor, sensory, and autonomic pathways. Recent advances in stem cell therapy have allowed for the in vitro generation of motor neurons showing electrophysiological and synaptic activity, expression of canonical motor neuron biomarkers, and the ability to graft into spinal lesions. Clinical translation, especially the transplantation of motor neuron precursors in spinal lesions, has thus far been elusive because of stem cell heterogeneity and protocol variability, as well as a hostile microenvironment such as inflammation and scarring, which yield inconsistent pre-clinical results without a consensus best-practice therapeutic strategy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in particular have lower ethical and immunogenic concerns than other stem cells, which could make them more clinically applicable. In this review, we focus on the differentiation of iPSCs into neural precursors, motor neuron progenitors, mature motor neurons, and motor neuron subtype fates. Previous reviews have summarized motor neuron development and differentiation, but an up-to-date summary of technological and experimental advances holding promise for bench-to-bedside translation, especially those targeting individual motor neuron subtypes in spinal cord injury, is currently lacking. We discuss biological mechanisms of motor neuron lineage, recent experimental protocols and techniques for motor neuron differentiation from iPSCs, and  transplantation of neural precursors and motor neuron lineage cells in spinal cord lesions to restore motor function. We emphasize efficient, clinically safe, and personalized strategies for the application of motor neurons and their subtypes as therapy in spinal lesions.</content>

 BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is a significant public health concern in older adults. Identifying new ways to maintain cognitive and brain health throughout the lifespan is of utmost importance. Simultaneous exercise and cognitive engagement has been shown to enhance brain function in animal and human studies. Virtual reality (VR) may be a promising approach for conducting simultaneous exercise and cognitive studies. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of cycling in a cognitively enriched and immersive spatial navigation VR environment in younger and older adults.

METHODS: 20 younger (25.9±3.7 years) and 20 older (63.6±5.6 years) adults participated in this study. Participants completed four trials (2 learning, 2 recall) of cycling while wearing a head-mounted device and navigating a VR park environment. Questionnaires were administered to assess adverse effects, mood, presence, and physical exertion levels associated with cycling in the VR environment.

RESULTS: 4 subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse effects, yielding a 90% completion rate. Simulator sickness levels were enhanced in both age groups with exposure to the VR environment but were within an acceptable range. Exposure to the virtual environment was associated with high arousal and low stress levels, suggesting a state of excitement, and most participants reported enjoyment of the spatial navigation task and VR environment. No association was found between physical exertion levels and simulator sickness levels. 

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that spatial navigation while cycling is feasible and that older adults report similar experiences to younger adults. VR may be a powerful tool for engaging physical and cognitive activity in older adults with acceptable adverse effects and with reports of enjoyment. Future studies are needed to assess the efficacy of a combined exercise and cognitive VR program as an intervention for promoting healthy brain aging, especially in older adults with increased risk of age-related cognitive decline.</content>

 Background: With increasing aging populations worldwide, developing interventions against age-associated cognitive decline is particularly important. Evidence suggests that combination of brain stimulation with cognitive training intervention may enhance training effects in terms of performance gain or transfer to untrained domains. This protocol describes a Phase IIb clinical trial that investigates the intervention effects of training combined with brain stimulation in older adults. 

Methods: The TrainStim study is a monocentric, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled intervention. The study will investigate cognitive training with concurrent anodal tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (target intervention) compared to cognitive training with sham stimulation (control intervention) over nine sessions in three weeks, consisting of a letter updating task and a three-stage Markov decision-making task. Fifty-six older adults will be recruited from the general population. Baseline assessment will be performed including neuropsychological screening and performance on training tasks. Participants will be allocated to one of the two study arms using block-wise randomization stratified by age and baseline performance with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Primary outcome is performance in the letter updating task after training under anodal tDCS compared to sham stimulation. Secondary outcomes include performance changes in the decision-making task and transfer tasks, as well as brain structure and functional networks assessed by structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging that are acquired pre- and post-intervention.

Significance: The main aim of the TrainStim study is to provide evidence for behavioral and neuronal effects of tDCS-accompanied cognitive training and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in older adults. Our findings will contribute towards developing efficient interventions for age-associated cognitive decline.

Trial registration: This trial was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the Identifier: NCT03838211 at February 12, 2019. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03838211

The coding space of protein sequences is shaped by evolutionary constraints set by requirements of function and stability. We show that the coding space of a given protein family—the total number of sequences in that family—can be estimated using models of maximum entropy trained on multiple sequence alignments of naturally occuring amino acid sequences. We analyzed and calculated the size of three abundant repeat proteins families, whose members are large proteins made of many repetitions of conserved portions of ∼30 amino acids. While amino acid conservation at each position of the alignment explains most of the reduction of diversity relative to completely random sequences, we found that correlations between amino acid usage at different positions significantly impact that diversity. We quantified the impact of different types of correlations, functional and evolutionary, on sequence diversity. Analysis of the detailed structure of the coding space of the families revealed a rugged landscape, with many local energy minima of varying sizes with a hierarchical structure, reminiscent of fustrated energy landscapes of spin glass in physics. This clustered structure indicates a multiplicity of subtypes within each family, and suggests new strategies for protein design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HRfB4RWoXCc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Recent developments in cardiovascular modelling allow us to simulate blood flow in an entire human body. Such model can also be used to create databases of virtual subjects, with sizes limited only by computational resources. In this work, we study if it is possible to estimate cardiovascular health indices using machine learning approaches. In particular, we carry out theoretical assessment of estimating aortic pulse wave velocity, diastolic and systolic blood pressure and stroke volume using pulse transit/arrival timings derived from photopletyshmography signals. For predictions, we train Gaussian process regression using a database of virtual subjects generated with a cardiovascular simulator. Simulated results provides theoretical assessment of accuracy for predictions of the health indices. For instance, aortic pulse wave velocity can be estimated with a high accuracy (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.9) when photopletyshmography is measured from left carotid artery using a combination of foot-to-foot pulse transmit time and peak location derived for the predictions. Similar accuracy can be reached for diastolic blood pressure, but predictions of systolic blood pressure are less accurate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.75) and the stroke volume predictions are mostly contributed by heart rate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iycbvHbfhig&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mutational robustness quantifies the effect of random mutations on fitness. When mutational robustness is high, most mutations do not change fitness or have only a minor effect on it. From the point of view of fitness landscapes, robust genotypes form neutral networks of almost equal fitness. Using deterministic population models it has been shown that selection favors genotypes inside such networks, which results in increased mutational robustness. Here we demonstrate that this effect is massively enhanced by recombination. Our results are based on a detailed analysis of mesa-shaped fitness landscapes, where we derive precise expressions for the dependence of the robustness on the landscape parameters for recombining and non-recombining populations. In addition, we carry out numerical simulations on different types of random holey landscapes as well as on an empirical fitness landscape. We show that the mutational robustness of a genotype generally correlates with its recombination weight, a new measure that quantifies the likelihood for the genotype to arise from recombination. We argue that the favorable effect of recombination on mutational robustness is a highly universal feature that may have played an important role in the emergence and maintenance of mechanisms of genetic exchange.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oDNy7X1iT6k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Syringe pumps are a necessary piece of lab equipment used for fluid delivery in behavioral neuroscience labs. Many experiments provide rodents and primates with fluid rewards such as juice, water, or liquid sucrose. Current commercialized syringe pumps are not customizable and do not have the ability to deliver multiple volumes of fluid based on different inputs to the pump. Additionally, many syringe pumps are expensive and cannot be used in experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings due to electrical noise. We developed an open source syringe pump controller using commonly available parts. The controller adjusts the acceleration and speed of the motor to deliver three different volumes of fluid reward within one common time epoch. This syringe pump controller is cost-effective and has been successfully implemented in rodent behavioral experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings in the rat frontal cortex while rats lick for different volumes of liquid sucrose rewards. Our syringe pump controller will enable new experiments to address the potential confound of temporal information in studies of reward signaling by fluid magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The neural basis of reward processing is a major topic in neuroscience. Many studies examine reward coding by varying the amount of fluid given to experimental animals as they perform a behavioral task. Most devices used in these studies are not capable of delivering different volumes over a common period of time. As such, reward coding is confounded by temporal information. To resolve this issue, we developed a syringe pump controller that is capable of delivering different fluid volumes, in the range used in behavioral studies, over common periods of time. Here, we report the designs of all components of the pump and the protocols needed to create and use it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To longitudinally evaluate the role of depression in the development of impulse control disorders (ICD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) we included PD patients without ICD at baseline according to the Questionnaire for Impulsive‐Compulsive Disorders in PD (QUIP). Patients were prospectively evaluated first quarterly and then biannually. Development of ICD was defined as an increase in QUIP scores during follow up. Using survival proportional hazard models we studied the effect of baseline depression on ICD risk. We also evaluated this effect controlling for dopamine agonist use as a time‐dependent variable and for other potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 354 patients, 68 were depressed at baseline. The median follow up was 4.08 years. Depression at baseline was associated with higher ICD risk (hazard ratio, HR: 1.96, 95% CI 1.32‐2.9, p&amp;lt;0.001). This risk remained significant after controlling for dopamine agonists use (HR: 1.97, 95% CI 1.33‐2.9, p&amp;lt;0.001), which was also independently linked to ICD development (HR: 1.87 95% CI 1.3‐2.7, p&amp;lt;0.001). Therefore, depressed patients faced an even higher ICD risk when receiving dopamine agonists. Controlling for multiple potential confounders did not alter these results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression predisposes to the development of ICD in PD. This risk is magnified by dopamine agonists. Dopamine agonists should thus be used cautiously in depressed PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited evidence is available to guide treatment of depression for persons with epilepsy. We evaluated the comparative effectiveness of sertraline and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for depression, quality of life, seizures, and adverse treatment effects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We randomly assigned 140 adult outpatients with epilepsy and current major depressive disorder to sertraline or weekly CBT for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was remission from depression based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Secondary outcomes included the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory‐89 (QOLIE‐89) seizure rates, the Adverse Events Profile (AEP), the Beck Depression Inventory, and MINI Suicide Risk Module.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intention‐to‐treat analysis, 38 (52.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = ±12) of the 72 subjects assigned to sertraline and 41 (60.3%; 95% CI = ±11.6) of the 68 subjects in the CBT group achieved remission; the lower bound of efficacy for both groups was greater than our historical placebo control group upper bound of 33.7%. Difference in time to remission between groups was 2.8 days (95% CI = ±0.43; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.79). The percent improvement of mean QOLIE‐89 scores was significant for both the CBT (25.7%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and sertraline (28.3%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) groups. The difference in occurrence of generalized tonic–clonic seizures between groups was 0.3% (95% CI = ±8.6; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.95). Suicide risk at final assessment was associated with persistent depression (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) but not seizures or sertraline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression remitted in just over one‐half of subjects following sertraline or CBT. Despite the complex psychosocial disability associated with epilepsy, improving depression benefits quality of life. Serotonin reuptake inhibition does not appear to increase seizures or suicidality in persons with epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To describe early functional outcomes of nerve transfer surgery in a relatively large cohort of patients with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retrospective case analysis was made of patients with AFM treated with nerve transfer surgery between 2007 and 2018. Surgical criteria were persistent motor deficits after 6 months from onset and available donor nerves. Thirty‐two patients with AFM were evaluated; 16 underwent nerve transfer surgeries. Motor function was evaluated by a licensed occupational therapist using the Active Movement Scale preoperatively and during follow‐up examinations. Patients with 6 or more months of follow‐up were included in the analysis. Patients with procedures other than nerve transfers were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients with AFM had nerve transfers, with a male predominance (75%) and median age of 2.5 years (range = 4 months–12 years). Eleven patients had a minimum 6 months of follow‐up. Nerve transfers to restore elbow function had 87% excellent recovery for elbow flexion and 67% for elbow extension. Finger and thumb extension were full against gravity in 1 patient (100%). Shoulder external rotation was excellent in 50% of patients and shoulder abduction in only 20%. Nine of 10 patients (90%) had resolution of shoulder pseudosubluxation following nerve transfer to the suprascapular nerve.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with AFM with persistent motor deficits 6 to 9 months after onset benefit from nerve transfer surgery. Restoration of elbow function was more reliable than restoration of shoulder function. We recommend early referral of patients with incomplete recovery to a center experienced in nerve transfers for timely evaluation and treatment. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery can result in neurodegeneration and parkinsonism. Recent evidence suggests that immune responses in Parkinson disease patients are dysregulated, leading to an increased inflammatory reaction to unspecific triggers. Although α‐synuclein pathology is the hallmark of Parkinson disease, it has not been investigated whether pathologic α‐synuclein is a specific trigger for excessive inflammatory responses in Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the immune response of primary human monocytes and a microglial cell line to pathologic forms of α‐synuclein by assessing cytokine release upon exposure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that pathologic α‐synuclein (mutations, aggregation) results in a robust inflammatory activation of human monocytes and microglial BV2 cells. The activation is conformation‐ dependent, with increasing fibrillation and early onset mutations having the strongest effect on immune activation. We also found that activation of immune cells by extracellular α‐synuclein is potentiated by extracellular vesicles, possibly by facilitating the uptake of α‐synuclein. Blood extracellular vesicles from Parkinson disease patients induce a stronger activation of monocytes than blood extracellular vesicles from healthy controls. Most importantly, monocytes from Parkinson disease patients are dysregulated and hyperactive in response to stimulation with pathologic α‐synuclein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that α‐synuclein pathology in the CNS is sufficient to induce the monocyte dysregulation in the periphery of a mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our data suggest that α‐synuclein pathology and dysregulation of monocytes in Parkinson disease can act together to induce excessive inflammatory responses to α‐synuclein. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Expressional changes of pain-associated genes in primary sensory neurons of DRG are critical for neuropathic pain genesis. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)-triggered DNA methylation silences gene expression. We show here that DNMT1, a canonical maintenance methyltransferase, acts as the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; DNMT and is required for neuropathic pain genesis likely through repressing at least DRG &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in male mice. Peripheral nerve injury upregulated DNMT1 expression in the injured DRG through the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein-triggered transcriptional activation of &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; gene. Blocking this upregulation prevented nerve injury-induced DNA methylation within the promoter and 5'-untranslated region of &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene, rescued &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; expression and total Kv current, attenuated hyperexcitability in the injured DRG neurons, and alleviated nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivities. Given that &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; is a key player in neuropathic pain, our findings suggest that DRG DNMT1 may be a potential target for neuropathic pain management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the present study, we reported that DNMT1, a canonical DNA maintenance methyltransferase, is upregulated via the activation of the transcription factor CREB in the injured DRG after peripheral nerve injury. This upregulation was responsible for nerve injury-induced &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; DNA methylation within the promoter and 5'-untranslated region of the &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene, reductions in &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; expression and Kv current and increases in neuronal excitability in the injured DRG. Since pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of DRG DNMT1 alleviated nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivities, DRG DNMT1 contributes to neuropathic pain genesis partially through repression of DRG &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Cell transplantation therapy provides a regenerative strategy for neural repair. We tested the hypothesis that selective excitation of transplanted induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPS-NPCs) could recapitulate an activity-enriched microenvironment that confers regenerative benefits for the treatment of stroke. Mouse iPS-NPCs were transduced with a novel optochemogenetics fusion protein, luminopsin 3 (LMO3), which consisted of a bioluminescent luciferase, &lt;i&gt;Gaussia&lt;/i&gt; luciferase, and an opsin, &lt;i&gt;Volvox&lt;/i&gt; Channelrhodopsin 1. These LMO3-iPS-NPCs can be activated by either photostimulation using light or by the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; stimulations of LMO3-iPS-NPCs increased expression of synapsin-1, postsynaptic density 95, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and stromal cell-derived factor 1 and promoted neurite outgrowth. After transplantation into the ischemic cortex of mice, LMO3-iPS-NPCs differentiated into mature neurons. Synapse formation between implanted and host neurons was identified using immunogold electron microscopy and patch-clamp recordings. Stimulation of transplanted cells with daily intranasal administration of CTZ enhanced axonal myelination, synaptic transmission, improved thalamocortical connectivity, and functional recovery. Patch-clamp and multielectrode array recordings in brain slices showed that CTZ or light stimulation facilitated synaptic transmission and induced neuroplasticity mimicking the LTP of EPSPs. Stroke mice received the combined LMO3-iPS-NPC/CTZ treatment, but not cell or CTZ alone, showed enhanced neural network connections in the peri-infarct region, promoted optimal functional recoveries after stroke in male and female, young and aged mice. Thus, excitation of transplanted cells via the noninvasive optochemogenetics treatment provides a novel integrative cell therapy with comprehensive regenerative benefits after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural network reconnection is critical for repairing damaged brain. Strategies that promote this repair are expected to improve functional outcomes. This study pioneers the generation and application of an optochemogenetics approach in stem cell transplantation therapy after stroke for optimal neural repair and functional recovery. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPS-NPCs) expressing the novel optochemogenetic probe luminopsin (LMO3), and intranasally delivered luciferase substrate coelenterazine, we show enhanced regenerative properties of LMO3-iPS-NPCs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and after transplantation into the ischemic brain of different genders and ages. The noninvasive repeated coelenterazine stimulation of transplanted cells is feasible for clinical applications. The synergetic effects of the combinatorial cell therapy may have significant impacts on regenerative approach for treatments of CNS injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The human cerebral cortex is a complex structure with tightly interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks. In order to study human cortical function, we recently developed a method to generate cortical neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that form both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks resembling the composition of the human cortex. These cultures and organoids recapitulate neuronal populations representative of the six cortical layers and a balanced excitatory and inhibitory network that is functional and homeostatically stable. To determine if hiPSC-derived neurons can integrate and retain physiologic activities &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we labeled hiPSCs with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and introduced hiPSC-derived neural progenitors to rat brains. Efficient neural induction, followed by differentiation resulted in a RFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neural population with traits of forebrain identity and a balanced synaptic activity composed of both excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Ten weeks after transplantation, grafted cells structurally integrated into the rat forebrain. Remarkably, these hiPSC-derived neurons were able to fire, exhibiting both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which culminates in the establishment of neuronal connectivity with the host circuitry. This study demonstrates that neural progenitors derived from hiPSCs can differentiate into functional cortical neurons and can participate in neural network activity through functional synaptic integration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, thereby contributing to information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We recently developed a differentiation method based on rosette neural aggregates (termed RONAs) to generate balanced excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). It is not yet known whether human neurons derived from this method can survive and function following transplantation into an intact rat brain. To address this question, we studied the properties of grafted hiPSC-derived neurons labeled with RFP, which display stereotypical neuronal behavior, including firing, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity, and receive synaptic inputs from host neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) are pentameric ionotropic channels. Subunit composition of the receptors is associated with the affinity of GABA binding and its downstream inhibitory actions. Fluctuations in subunit expression levels with increasing age have been demonstrated in animal and human studies. However, our knowledge regarding the age-related hippocampal GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R expression changes is limited and based on rat studies. This study is the first analysis of the aging-related changes of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R subunit expression in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus regions of the mouse hippocampus. Using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry we found that the GABAergic system is robust, with no significant age-related differences in GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α1, α2, α3, α5, β3, and 2 subunit expression level differences found between the young (6 months) and old (21 months) age groups in any of the hippocampal regions examined. However, we detected a localized decrease of α2 subunit expression around the soma, proximal dendrites, and in the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions that is accompanied by a pronounced upregulation of the α2 subunit immunoreactivity in the neuropil of aged mice. In summary, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs are well preserved in the mouse hippocampus during normal aging although GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs in the hippocampus are severely affected in age-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as focal neurological deficit caused by ischemia resolving within 24 hours. In a secondary analysis of a large monocentric cohort of 446 TIA patients, we explored the frequency and determinants of diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) lesions on high‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, 240 (54%) of all TIA patients presented with DWI lesions. These patients had higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and ABCD2 scores and presented more frequently with vessel occlusion and perfusion deficits, but had similar functional outcome at 3 months. Taken together, high‐resolution DWI provides evidence of ischemic brain injury in the majority of TIA patients. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:452–457&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) starts in early childhood with loss of visual acuity and color vision deficits. &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are responsible for the majority of cases, but in a portion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of ADOA, the cause remains unknown. This study aimed to identify novel ADOA‐associated genes and explore their causality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage analysis and sequencing were performed in multigeneration families and unrelated patients to identify disease‐causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated in silico and confirmed experimentally using the zebrafish model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We defined a new ADOA locus on 7q33‐q35 and identified 3 different missense variants in &lt;i&gt;SSBP1&lt;/i&gt; (NM_001256510.1; c.113G&amp;gt;A [p.(Arg38Gln)], c.320G&amp;gt;A [p.(Arg107Gln)] and c.422G&amp;gt;A [p.(Ser141Asn)]) in affected individuals from 2 families and 2 singletons with ADOA and variable retinal degeneration. The mutated arginine residues are part of a basic patch that is essential for single‐strand DNA binding. The loss of a positive charge at these positions is very likely to lower the affinity of SSBP1 for single‐strand DNA. Antisense‐mediated knockdown of endogenous &lt;i&gt;ssbp1&lt;/i&gt; messenger RNA (mRNA) in zebrafish resulted in compromised differentiation of retinal ganglion cells. A similar effect was achieved when mutated mRNAs were administered. These findings point toward an essential role of &lt;i&gt;ssbp1&lt;/i&gt; in retinal development and the dominant‐negative nature of the identified human variants, which is consistent with the segregation pattern observed in 2 multigeneration families studied.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSBP1 is an essential protein for mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance. Our data have established pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SSBP1&lt;/i&gt; as a cause of ADOA and variable retinal degeneration. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:368–383&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 0 is the most severe form of SMA, associated with the &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; gene and manifesting at birth. Most patients die in the first weeks of life. In this work, we present 3 patients with SMA type 0 who survived &amp;gt;1 year and presented diffuse and progressive brain abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging, which are not usually seen in patients with SMA. Thus, severe brain involvement may likely be the full end manifestation of an already extreme SMA phenotype caused by substantial reduction of the SMN protein in the brain.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantification of gait with wearable technology is promising; recent cross‐sectional studies showed that gait characteristics are potential prodromal markers for Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of this longitudinal prospective observational study was to establish gait impairments and trajectories in the prodromal phase of PD, identifying which gait characteristics are potentially early diagnostic markers of PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 696 healthy controls (mean age = 63 ± 7 years) recruited in the Tubingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration study were included. Assessments were performed longitudinally 4 times at 2‐year intervals, and people who converted to PD were identified. Participants were asked to walk at different speeds under single and dual tasking, with a wearable device placed on the lower back; 14 validated clinically relevant gait characteristics were quantified. Cox regression was used to examine whether gait at first visit could predict time to PD conversion after controlling for age and sex. Random effects linear mixed models (RELMs) were used to establish longitudinal trajectories of gait and model the latency between impaired gait and PD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen participants were diagnosed with PD on average 4.5 years after first visit (converters; PDC). Higher step time variability and asymmetry of all gait characteristics were associated with a shorter time to PD diagnosis. RELMs indicated that gait (lower pace) deviates from that of non‐PDC approximately 4 years prior to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with other prodromal markers, quantitative gait characteristics can play an important role in identifying prodromal PD and progression within this phase. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:357–367&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Publication date: October 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Alexandre Payeur, Jean-Claude Béïque, Richard Naud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dendrites are much more than passive neuronal components. Mounting experimental evidence and decades of computational work have decisively shown that dendrites leverage a host of nonlinear biophysical phenomena and actively participate in sophisticated computations, at the level of the single neuron and at the level of the network. However, a coherent view of their processing power is still lacking and dendrites are largely neglected in neural network models. Here, we describe four classes of dendritic information processing and delineate their implications at the algorithmic level. We propose that beyond the well-known spatiotemporal filtering of their inputs, dendrites are capable of selecting, routing and multiplexing information. By separating dendritic processing from axonal outputs, neuron networks gain a degree of freedom with implications for perception and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 General anesthesia reversibly alters consciousness, without shutting down the brain globally. Depending on the anesthetic agent and dose, it may produce different consciousness states including a complete absence of subjective experience (unconsciousness), a conscious experience without perception of the environment (disconnected consciousness, like during dreaming), or episodes of oriented consciousness with awareness of the environment (connected consciousness). Each consciousness state may potentially be followed by explicit or implicit memories after the procedure. In this respect, anesthesia can be considered as a proxy to explore consciousness. During the recent years, progress in the exploration of brain function has allowed a better understanding of the neural correlates of consciousness, and of their alterations during anesthesia. Several changes in functional and effective between-region brain connectivity, consciousness network topology, and spatio-temporal dynamics of between-region interactions have been evidenced during anesthesia. Despite a set of effects that are common to many anesthetic agents, it is still uneasy to draw a comprehensive picture of the precise cascades during general anesthesia. Several questions remain unsolved, including the exact identification of the neural substrate of consciousness and its components, the detection of specific consciousness states in unresponsive patients and their associated memory processes, the processing of sensory information during anesthesia, the pharmacodynamic interactions between anesthetic agents, the direction-dependent hysteresis phenomenon during the transitions between consciousness states, the mechanisms of cognitive alterations that follow an anesthetic procedure, the identification of an eventual unitary mechanism of anesthesia-induced alteration of consciousness, the relationship between network effects and the biochemical or sleep-wake cycle targets of anesthetic agents, as well as the vast between-studies variations in dose and administration mode, leading to difficulties in between-studies comparisons. In this narrative review, we draw the picture of the current state of knowledge in anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, from insights gathered on propofol, halogenated vapors, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines and xenon. We also describe how anesthesia can help understanding consciousness, we develop the above-mentioned unresolved questions, and propose tracks for future research.</content>

 Properties of synaptic release dictates the core of information transfer in neural circuits. 
Despite decades of technical and theoretical advances, distinguishing bona fide information content from the multiple sources of synaptic variability remains a challenging problem. Here, we employed a combination of computational approaches with cellular electrophysiology, two-photon uncaging of MNI-Glutamate and imaging at single synapses. We describe and calibrate the use of the fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR  and  found that its kinetic profile is close to that of AMPA receptors, therefore providing several distinct advantages over slower methods relying on NMDA receptor activation (i.e., chemical or genetically encoded Calcium indicators). Using an array of statistical methods, we further developed, and validated on surrogate data, an expectation-maximization algorithm that, by biophysically constraining release variability, extracts the quantal parameters n (maximum number of released vesicles) and p (unitary probability of release) from single-synapse iGluSnFR-mediated transients. Together, we present a generalizable mathematical formalism which, when applied to optical recordings, paves the way to an increasingly precise investigation of information transfer at central synapses.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Secreted amyloid precursor protein-α (sAPPα) is a neuroprotective and memory-enhancing molecule, however the mechanisms through which sAPPα promotes these effects are not well understood. Recently, we have shown that sAPPα enhances cell-surface expression of glutamate receptors. Activity-related cytoskeletal-associated protein Arc (Arg3.1) is an immediate early gene capable of modulating long-term potentiation, long-term depression and homeostatic plasticity through regulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor localization. Accordingly, we hypothesized that sAPPα may enhance synaptic plasticity, in part, by the de novo synthesis of Arc. Using primary cortical and hippocampal neuronal cultures we found that sAPPα (1 nM, 2 h) enhances levels of Arc mRNA and protein. Arc protein levels were increased in both the neuronal somata and dendrites in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent manner. Additionally, dendritic Arc expression was dependent upon activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase G. The enhancement of dendritic Arc protein was significantly reduced by antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptors, and fully eliminated by dual application of these antagonists. This effect was further corroborated in area CA1 of acute hippocampal slices. These data suggest sAPPα-regulated plasticity within hippocampal neurons is mediated by cooperation of NMDA and α7nACh receptors to engage a cascade of signal transduction molecules to enhance the transcription and translation of Arc.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00846"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00846</id>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Since subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was standardized in 2014, there have been few studies reporting the risk factors and neuropsychological assessment characteristics of SCD (plus) in memory clinic.
Objective: To characterize SCD (plus) by comparing it with normal control (NC), amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and Alzheimer Disease (AD) regarding their demographics, lifestyle, family history of dementia, multimorbidity and the neuropsychological assessments.
Methods: A total of 135 participants were recruited, including 23 NC, 30 SCD (plus), 45 aMCI and 37 AD. Descriptive statistics were provided. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the affecting factors of SCD (plus), and finally the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to distinguish between SCD (plus) and NC.
Results: (1) SCD (plus) group was younger than both the aMCI group and AD group. It consisted of more participants with mental work and higher body mass index (BMI) than the AD group. (2) Scores of Auditory Verbal Learning Test - Immediate recall (AVLT-IR) and AVLT-Long delayed recall (AVLT-LR) decreased in the following order: NC→SCD (plus)→aMCI→AD. (3) The Area Under Curve (AUC) for discriminating SCD (plus) and NC group was from 0.673 to 0.838.
Conclusions: Ageing is an important risk factor of both NC progressing to SCD (plus), and SCD (plus) progressing to aMCI or AD. In addition to ageing, lower education level and lower BMI were significantly associated with greater odds of SCD (plus) progressing to aMCI or AD patients, whereas mental work was a protective factor of SCD (plus) progressing to AD. Finally, AVLT is a sensitive indicator of the cognitive decline and impairment in SCD (plus) in relative to normal controls.</content>

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common memory-impairment disorder frequently accompanied by olfactory identification (OI) impairments. In fact, OI is a valuable marker for distinguishing AD from normal age-related cognitive impairment and may predict the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-AD transition. However, current olfactory tests were developed based on Western social and cultural conditions, and are not very suitable for Chinese patients. Moreover, the neural substrate of OI in AD is still unknown. The present study investigated the utility of a newly developed Chinese Smell Identification Test (CSIT) for OI assessment in Chinese AD and MCI patients. We then performed a correlation analysis of gray matter volume (GMV) at the voxel and region-of-interest (ROI) levels to reveal the neural substrates of OI in AD. Thirty-seven AD, 27 MCI, and 30 normal controls (NCs) completed the CSIT and MRI scans. Patients (combined AD plus MCI) scored significantly lower on the CSIT compared to NCs (F (2, 91) = 62.597, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Voxel-level GMV analysis revealed strong relationships between CSIT score and volumes of the left precentral gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG). In addition, ROI-level GMV analysis revealed associations between CSIT score and left amygdala volumes. Our results suggest the following: 1) OI, as measured by the CSIT, is impaired in AD and MCI patients compared with healthy controls in the Chinese population; 2) the severity of OI dysfunction can distinguish patients with cognitive impairment from controls and AD from MCI patients; and 3) the left-precentral cortex and L-IFG may be involved in the processing of olfactory cues.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in probing cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor excitability can be induced using a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which TMS stimulation over the primary motor cortex is conditioned with an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand. PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effects in cortical excitability. However, the response to a PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across individuals. In this study, we used univariate and multivariate data-driven methods to investigate various previously proposed determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures. 
Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 19 healthy controls, underwent the PAS protocol. Prior to stimulation, demographic, genetic, clinical, as well as structural and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in any of the variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed that only 61 % of all participants were classified as PAS responders, irrespective of a group membership. Higher PAS response was associated with lower TMS intensity and with higher resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but only in responders, as opposed to non-responders. We also found an overall positive correlation between PAS response and structural connectivity within the corticospinal tract, which did not differ between groups. 
A multivariate random forest (RF) model identified age, gender, education, IQ, global cognitive status, sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and neuroimaging measures (functional and structural connectivity, grey matter volume, and cortical thickness) as poor predictors of PAS response. The model resulted in low accuracy of the RF classifier (58 %; 95% CI: 42% - 74%), with a higher relative importance of brain connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that PAS variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to influence PAS efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication studies.</content>

 Advances in fMRI acquisition have improved signal to noise to the point where the physiology of the subject is the dominant noise source in resting state fMRI data (rsfMRI).  Among these systemic, non-neuronal physiological signals, respiration and to some degree cardiac fluctuations can be removed through modeling, or in the case of newer, faster acquisitions such as simultaneous multislice acquisition, simple spectral filtering. However, significant low frequency physiological oscillation (~0.01-0.15 Hz) remains in the signal. This is problematic, as it is the precise frequency band occupied by the neuronally modulated hemodynamic responses used to study brain connectivity, precluding its removal by spectral filtering.
The source of this signal, and its method of production and propagation in the body, have not been conclusively determined.  Here we summarize the defining characteristics of the systemic low frequency noise signal, and review some current theories about the signal source and the evidence supporting them. 
The strength and distribution of the systemic LFO signal make characterizing and removing it essential for accurate quantification, especially for resting state connectivity, when no stimulation can be compared with the signal. Widespread correlated non-neuronal signals obscure and distort the more localized patterns of neuronal correlations between interacting brain regions; they may even cause apparent connectivity between regions with no neuronal interaction. Here we discuss a simple method we have developed to parse the global, moving, blood-borne signal from the stationary, neuronal connectivity signals, substantially reducing the negative correlations that result from global signal regression.	
Finally, we will discuss some of the uses to which the moving systemic low frequency oscillation can be put if we consider it a “signal” carrying information, rather than simply “noise” complicating the interpretation of resting state connectivity. Properly utilizing this signal may offer insights into subtle hemodynamic alterations that can be used as early indicators of circulatory dysfunction in a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as prodromal stroke, moyamoya, and Alzheimer’s disease.</content>

 Spexin (SPX) is an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide that is expressed in the mammalian brain and peripheral tissue. Two orthologues are present in the teleost, SPX1 and SPX2. SPX1 is involved in reproduction and food intake. Recently, SPX1 neurons have been found to be located in the specific nuclei of dorsal habenula (dHb) and to project into the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), in which galanin receptor 2a/2b (GALR2a/2b) expression was also observed. This indicates that habenula SPX1 neurons may interact with GALR2a/2b in the IPN; however, the function of SPX1 in the dHb-IPN neuronal circuit remains unknown. To determine the role of SPX1 in the dHb-IPN neural circuit, we generated transgenic zebrafish overexpressing SPX1 specifically in the dHb. We found that transgenic zebrafish overexpressing SPX1 in the dHb had anxiolytic behaviors compared with their wildtype siblings. Furthermore, quantitative PCR revealed that mRNA expression of galr2a and galr2b in the IPN and serotonin-related genes in the raphe was upregulated in the brains of transgenic zebrafish. Taken together, our data suggest that SPX1 function in the dHb-IPN neural circuits is implicated in the regulation of anxiety behaviors via modulation of the serotoninergic system in zebrafish.</content>

 Previous studies have reported the possible neuroprotective effects of xenon treatment. The purpose of this study was to define the range of effective xenon ratio, most effective xenon ratio, and time-window for intervention in the kainic acid (KA)- induced status epilepticus (SE) rat model. Different ratios of xenon (35% xenon/21% oxygen/44% nitrogen, 50% xenon/21% oxygen/29% nitrogen, and 70% xenon/21% oxygen/9% nitrogen) were used to treat the KA-induced SE. Our results confirmed the anti-seizure role of 50% and 70% xenon mixture, with a stronger effect from the latter. Further, 70% xenon mixture was dispensed at three time points (0 min, 15 min delayed, and 30 min delayed) after KA administration, and the results indicated the anti-seizure effect at all treated time points. The results also established that the neuronal injury, assessed using Fluoro-Jade B staining, in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) were reversed by the xenon inhalation and within 30 min after KA administration. Our study, therefore, indicates the appropriate effective xenon ratio and time-window for intervention that can depress seizures. The prevention of neuronal injury and further reversal of the loss of effective control of depress network in the hippocampus and EC may be the mechanisms underlying the anti-seizure effect of xenon.</content>

 LIS1 is the main causative gene for lissencephaly, while MeCP2 is the main causative gene for Rett syndrome, both of which are neurodevelopmental diseases. Here we report nuclear functions for LIS1 and identify previously unrecognized physical and genetic interactions between the products of these two genes in the cell nucleus, that has implications on MeCP2 organization, neuronal gene expression and mouse behavior. Reduced LIS1 levels affect the association of MeCP2 with chromatin. Transcriptome analysis of primary cortical neurons derived from wild type, Lis1+/-, MeCP2-/y, or double mutants mice revealed a large overlap in the differentially expressed (DE) genes between the various mutants.  Overall, our findings are important for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the neurodevelopmental disorders lissencephaly and Rett syndrome caused by dysfunction of LIS1 and MeCP2, respectively.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Introduction: Age-related health, brain and cognitive impairment is a great challenge in current society. Cognitive training, aerobic exercise and their combination have been shown to benefit health, brain, cognition and psychological status in healthy older adults. Inconsistent results across studies may be related to several variables. We need to better identify cognitive changes, individual variables that may predict the effect of these interventions and changes in structural and functional brain outcomes as well as physiological molecular correlates that may be mediating these effects. Projecte Moviment is a multi-domain randomized trial examining the effect of these interventions applied 5 days per week for 3 months compared to a passive control group. The aim of this paper is to describe the sample, procedures and planned analyses.
Methods: 140 healthy physically inactive older adults will be randomly assigned to computerized cognitive training (CCT), aerobic exercise (AE), combined training (COMB) or a control group. The intervention consists of a 3-month home-based program 5 days per week in sessions of 45 minutes. Data from cognitive, physical and psychological tests, cardiovascular risk factors, structural and functional brain scans and blood samples will be obtained before and after the intervention.
Results: Effects of the interventions on cognitive outcomes will be described in intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses. We will also analyze potential genetic, demographic, brain and physiological molecular correlates that may predict the effects of intervention as well as the association between cognitive effects and changes in these variables using the per protocol sample. 
Discussion: Projecte Moviment is a multi-domain intervention trial based on prior evidence that aims to understand the effects of CCT, AE and COMB on cognitive and psychological outcomes compared to a passive control group and to determine related biological correlates and predictors of the intervention effects.

		<content type="html">
 Objectives: To explore the transfer effects of cognitive training on working memory among Chinese older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Methods: 62 MCI participants aged more than 60 years old were recruited by holding recruitment sessions at communities in China (33 for cognitive training, and 29 for mental leisure activities (MLA) control). Cognitive functions, including working memory, execution function, reasoning ability, verbal ability, ability of daily living, were measured at 3 time-points (baseline, post-training and three months after training). 
Results: Compared to the MLA control, the cognitive training group showed significant effects on both the trained (working memory) and untrained (execution function and ability of daily living) domains. The effects of cognitive training on overall cognitive function, working memory and daily life ability of daily living of MCI could be maintained for at least three months even without the cognitive training. Besides, complete mediating effects of cognitive training were found on executive function through working memory and working memory on ability of daily living though executive function which suggested the presence of transfer effect of cognitive training.
Conclusions: The present study supported that cognitive training could effectively improve working memory in elders with MCI. The training effects on working memory could transfer to other untrained areas (such as executive function), which also improved the comprehensive ability (ability of daily living). And the effects of training could largely persist for three months.

 This study investigates the association between intelligence and brain power responses to a passive audiovisual stimulation. We measure the power of gamma-range steady-state responses (SSRs) as well as intelligence and other aspects of neurocognitive function in 40 healthy males born in 1953. The participants are a part of a Danish birth cohort study and the data therefore include additional information measured earlier in life. Our main power measure is the difference in power between a visual stimulation and a combined audiovisual stimulation. We hypothesize and establish empirically that the power measure is associated with intelligence. In particular, we find a highly significant correlation between the power measure and present intelligence scores. The association is robust to controlling for size-at-birth measures, length of education, speed of processing as well as a range of other potentially confounding factors. Interestingly, we find that intelligence scores measured earlier in life (childhood, youth, late midlife), are also correlated with the present-day power measure, suggesting a deep connection between intelligence and the power measure. Finally, we find that the power measure has a high sensitivity for detection of an intelligence score below the average.</content>

 Multiple features distinguish the mitochondria of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients from those of unaffected individuals. The causes and consequences of these differences are informed by the recent finding by Fleck et al. (J. Neurosci., 2019) that pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein 1 (PTCD1) gene variants associate with AD. This suggests a proximal or initiating role for mitochondria in AD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Individuals differ in their vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence, which is determined by innate and environmental factors. The corticostriatal circuit is heavily involved in the development of alcohol dependence and may contain neural information regarding vulnerability to drink excessively. In the current experiment, we hypothesized that we could characterize high and low alcohol-drinking rats (HD and LD, respectively) based on corticostriatal oscillations, and that these subgroups would differentially respond to corticostriatal brain stimulation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 13) were trained to drink 10% alcohol in a limited access paradigm. In separate sessions, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Based on training alcohol consumption levels, we classified rats using a median split as HD or LD. Then, using machine-learning, we built predictive models to classify rats as HD or LD by corticostriatal LFPs and compared the model performance from real data to the performance of models built on data permutations. Additionally, we explored the impact of NAcSh or mPFC stimulation on alcohol consumption in HD vs. LD. Corticostriatal LFPs were able predict HD vs. LD group classification with greater accuracy than expected by chance (&amp;gt;80% accuracy). Moreover, NAcSh stimulation significantly reduced alcohol consumption in HD, but not LD (p&amp;lt;0.05), while mPFC stimulation did not alter drinking behavior in either HD or LD (p&amp;gt;0.05). These data collectively show that the corticostriatal circuit is differentially involved in regulating alcohol intake in HD vs. LD rats, and suggests that corticostriatal activity may have the potential to predict a vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence in a clinical population.</content>

 Despite recent extensive genomic and genetic studies on behavioral responses to ethanol, relatively few new therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder have been validated. Here we describe a cross-species genomic approach focused on identifying gene networks associated with chronic ethanol consumption. To identify brain mechanisms underlying a chronic ethanol consumption phenotype highly relevant to human alcohol use disorder, and to elucidate potential future therapeutic targets, we conducted a genomic study in a nonhuman primate model of chronic open-access ethanol consumption. Microarray analysis of RNA expression in anterior cingulate and subgenual cortices from rhesus macaques was performed across multiple cohorts of animals. Gene networks correlating with ethanol consumption or showing enrichment for ethanol-regulated genes were identified, as were major ethanol-related hub genes within these networks.  A subsequent consensus module analysis was used to co-analyze monkey data with expression data from a chronic intermittent ethanol vapor-exposure and consumption model in C57BL/6J mice. Ethanol-related gene networks conserved between primates and rodents were enriched for genes involved discrete biological functions, including; myelination, synaptic transmission, chromatin modification, Golgi apparatus function, translation, cellular respiration, and RNA processing.  The myelin-related network, in particular, showed strong correlations with ethanol consumption behavior and displayed marked network reorganization between control and ethanol-drinking animals. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that these networks also showed highly significant overlap with other ethanol-regulated gene sets. Altogether, these studies provide robust primate and rodent cross-species validation of gene networks associated with chronic ethanol consumption. Our results also suggest potential novel focal points for future therapeutic interventions in alcohol use disorder.</content>

 Hyperglycemia-induced neuronal apoptosis is one of the important reasons for diabetic neuropathy. Long time exposure to high glucose accelerates many aberrant glucose metabolic pathways and eventually leads to neuronal injury. However, the underlying mechanisms of metabolic alterations remain unknown. TP53 inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) is an endogenous inhibitor of glycolysis and increases the flux of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by regulating glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). TIGAR is highly expressed in neuron. But the role of TIGAR in hyperglycemia-induced neuronal injury is still unclear. In this study, we observed that TIGAR and G6PD are decreased in the hippocampus of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Correspondingly, in cultured primary neurons and Neuro-2a cell line, stimulation with high glucose induced significant neuronal apoptosis and down-regulation of TIGAR expression. Overexpression of TIGAR reduced the number of TUNEL-positive neurons and prevented the activation of Caspase-3 in cultured neurons. Furthermore, enhancing the expression of TIGAR rescued high glucose-induced autophagy impairment and the decrease of G6PD. Nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), a negative regulator of autophagy, is also inhibited by overexpression of TIGAR. Inhibition of autophagy abolished the protective effect of TIGAR in neuronal apoptosis in Neuro-2a. Importantly, overexpression of TIGAR in the hippocampus ameliorated STZ-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Therefore, our data demonstrated that TIGAR may play anti-apoptosis effect via up-regulation of autophagy in diabetic neuropathy.</content>

 GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission contributes to diverse aspects of brain development and adult plasticity, including the expression of complex cognitive processes. This is afforded for in part by the dynamic adaptations occurring at inhibitory synapses, which show great heterogeneity both in terms of upstream signalling and downstream effector mechanisms. Single-particle tracking and live imaging have revealed that complex receptor-scaffold interactions critically determine adaptations at GABAergic synapses. Super-resolution imaging studies have shown that protein interactions at synaptic sites contribute to nano-scale scaffold re-arrangements through post-translational modifications, facilitating receptor and scaffold recruitment to synaptic sites. Additionally plasticity mechanisms may be affected by the protein composition at individual synapses and the type of pre-synaptic input. This mini-review examines recent discoveries of plasticity mechanisms that are operational within GABAergic synapses, and discusses their contribution towards functional heterogeneity in inhibitory neurotransmission.</content>

 Social behavior exhibits a wide diversity among vertebrates though it is controlled by a conserved neural network, the social behavior network (SBN). The activity of the SBN is shaped by hypothalamic nonapeptides of the vasopressin-oxytocin family. The weakly electric fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio emits social electrical signals during courtship. Three types of vasotocin (AVT) cells occur in the preoptic area (POA), one of the SBN nodes. In this study, we aimed to test if POA neurons of the nucleus preopticus ventricularis anterior (PPa) and posterior (PPp), and in particular AVT+ cells, were activated by social stimuli using a 2-day behavioral protocol. During the first night, male-female dyads were recorded to identify courting males. During the second night, these males were divided in two experimental conditions: isolated and social (male with a female). Both AVT cells and the cellular activation of the POA neurons (measured by FOS) were identified.  We found that the PPa of social males showed more FOS+ cells than the PPa of isolated males, and that the PPa had more AVT+ cells in social males than in isolated males. The double-immunolabeling for AVT and FOS indicated the activation of AVT+ neurons. No significant differences in the activation of AVT+ cells were found between conditions, but a clear association was observed between the number of AVT+ cells and certain behavioral traits. In addition, a different activation of AVT+ cell-types was observed for social versus isolated males. We conclude that the POA of B. gauderio exhibits      changes induced by social stimuli in reproductive context, involving an increase in AVT production and a different profile activation among AVT+ cell populations.</content>

 The transition of tau proteins from its soluble physiological conformation to the pathological aggregate forms found in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, is poorly understood.  Therefore, understanding the process that modulates the formation of toxic tau oligomers and their conversion to putative neuroprotective neurofibrillary tangles will lead to better therapeutic strategies.  We previously identified that EFhd2 is associated with aggregated tau species in AD brains and the coiled-coil domain in EFhd2 mediates the interaction with tau. To further characterize the association between EFhd2 and tau, we examined whether EFhd2 could affect the liquid-liquid phase separation properties of tau under molecular crowding conditions.  We demonstrate that EFhd2 alters tau liquid phase behavior in a calcium and coiled-coil domain dependent manner.  Co-incubation of EFhd2 and tau in the absence of calcium leads to the formation of solid-like structures containing both proteins, while in the presence of calcium these two proteins phase separate together into liquid droplets.  EFhd2’s coiled-coil domain is necessary to alter tau’s liquid phase separation, indicating that protein-protein interaction is required.  The results demonstrate that EFhd2 affects the liquid-liquid phase separation of tau proteins in vitro, suggesting that EFhd2 modulates the structural dynamics of tau proteins.</content>

 Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become an indispensable tool in neuroscience research. Despite this, rs-fMRI signals are easily contaminated by artifacts arising from movement of the head during data collection. The artifacts can be problematic even for motions on the millimetre scale, with complex spatiotemporal properties that can lead to substantial errors in functional connectivity estimates. Effective correction methods must be employed, therefore, to distinguish true functional networks from motion-related noise. Research over the last three decades has produced numerous correction methods, many of which must be applied in combination to achieve satisfactory data quality. Subject instruction, training and mild restraints are helpful at the outset, but usually insufficient. Improvements come from applying multiple motion correction algorithms retrospectively after rs-fMRI data are collected, although residual artifacts can still remain in cases of elevated motion, which are especially prevalent in patient populations. Although not commonly adopted at present, &quot;real-time&quot; correction methods are emerging that can be combined with retrospective methods and that promise better correction and increased rs-fMRI signal sensitivity. While the search for the ideal motion correction protocol continues, rs-fMRI research will benefit from good disclosure practices, such as: 1) reporting motion-related quality control metrics to provide better comparison between studies; and 2) including motion covariates in group-level analyses to limit the extent of motion-related confounds when studying group differences.</content>

 Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia, represents a common cause of disability and one of the most relevant challenges in the health world. In addition, this condition does not have, at moment, a pharmacological treatment that can stop the pathological progress. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined as the borderline between normal aging and early dementia, represents a meaningful field of study because, in the transition to dementia, clinicians have defined a useful therapeutic window. Additionally, due to the lack of effective pharmacological interventions, recent years have seen an increase in research into new technological solutions to assess, stimulate, and assist patients afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease. This review aims to outline the use of information and communication technologies in the field studying MCI. Particularly, attention was focused on the use of sensors, both wearable and environmental; personal devices, including TV, PC, tablet, and smartphone; and finally, robots, both standalone and cloud networked. The idea is to depict the framework and describe the most meaningful research efforts in this field of study to display the current technologies available, describe the research objectives, and depict prospective future research. Regarding data sources, the research was conducted within three databases, PubMed Central, Web of Science, and Scopus, between January 2009 and December 2017. A total of 646 articles were found in the initial search. Accurate definition of the exclusion criteria and selection strategy allowed identification of the most relevant papers to use for the study. Finally, 56 papers were fully evaluated and included in this review.</content>

 In our daily life, we frequently need to make decisions between competing behavioral options while we are exposed to various contextual factors containing emotional/social information. We examined how changes in emotional/arousal state influence resolving conflict between behavioural rules. Visual stimuli with emotional content (positive, negative and neutral) and music, which could potentially alter emotional/arousal states, were included in the task context while participants performed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The WCST requires the application of abstract matching rules, to resolve conflict between competing behavioural options. We found that conflict influenced both accuracy and response time in implementing rules. Measuring event-related autonomic responses indicated that these behavioural effects were accompanied by concomitant alterations in arousal levels. Performance in the WCST was modulated by the emotional content of visual stimuli and appeared as a faster response and higher accuracy when trials commenced with negative emotional stimuli. These effects were dependent on the level of conflict but were not accompanied by changes in arousal levels. Here, we report that conflict-induced behavioural alterations are accompanied by concomitant changes in participants’ arousal/emotional state. Visual stimuli with emotional content influence conflict resolution and conflict-induced behavioural adjustments without trial-by-trial changes in arousal level. Our findings indicate intricate interactions between emotional context and various aspects of executive control such as conflict resolution and suggest that these interactions are not necessarily mediated through alterations in arousal level.</content>

 Trust and reciprocity are cornerstones of human nature, both at the levels of close interpersonal relationships and economic/societal structures. Being able to both place trust in others and decide whether to reciprocate trust placed in us is rooted in implicit and explicit processes that guide expectations of others, help reduce social uncertainty and build relationships. This review will highlight neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity, through the lens of implicit and explicit social appraisal and learning processes.  Significant consideration will be given to the neural underpinnings of these implicit and explicit processes, and special focus will center on the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms facilitating the integration of implicit and explicit signals supporting trust and reciprocity. Finally, this review will conclude with discussion of how we can leverage findings regarding the neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity to better inform our understanding of mental health disorders characterized by social dysfunction.</content>

 Automatic segmentation of brain tumors from medical images is important for clinical assessment and treatment planning of brain tumors. Recent years have seen an increasing use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task, but most of them use either 2D networks with relatively low memory requirement while ignoring 3D context, or 3D networks exploiting 3D features while with large memory consumption. In addition, existing methods rarely provide uncertainty information associated with the segmentation result. We propose a cascade of CNNs to segment brain tumors with hierarchical subregions from multi-modal Magnetic Resonance images (MRI), and introduce a 2.5D network that is a trade-off between  memory consumption, model complexity and receptive field. In addition, we employ test-time augmentation to achieve improved segmentation accuracy, which also provides voxel-wise and structure-wise uncertainty information of the segmentation result. Experiments with BraTS 2017 dataset showed that our cascaded framework with 2.5D CNNs was one of the top performing methods (second-rank) for the BraTS challenge. We also validated our method with BraTS 2018 dataset and found that test-time augmentation improves brain tumor segmentation accuracy and that the resulting uncertainty information can indicate potential mis-segmentations and help to improve segmentation accuracy.</content>

 Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are important building blocks in technical applications. They rely on noiseless continuous signals in stark contrast to the discrete action potentials stochastically exchanged among the neurons in real brains. We propose to bridge this gap with Spike-by-Spike (SbS) networks which represent a compromise between non-spiking and spiking versions of generative models. What is missing, however, are algorithms for finding weight sets that would optimize the output performances of deep SbS networks with many layers.

Here, a learning rule for feed-forward SbS networks is derived. The properties of this approach are investigated and its functionality is demonstrated by simulations. In particular, a Deep Convolutional SbS network for classifying handwritten digits achieves a classification performance of roughly 99.3% on the MNIST test data when the learning rule is applied together with an optimizer. Thereby it approaches the benchmark results of ANNs without extensive parameter optimization. We envision this learning rule for SBS networks to provide a new basis for research in neuroscience and for technical applications, especially when they become implemented on specialized computational hardware.</content>

 Introduction. While the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases, our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms, outcome predictors, or therapeutic targets is limited. In this work, we demonstrate how computational multi-scale brain modelling links phenomena of different scales and therefore identifies potential disease mechanisms leading the way to improved diagnostics and treatment. Methods. The Virtual Brain (TVB; thevirtualbrain.org) neuroinformatics platform allows standardized large-scale structural connectivity-based simulations of whole brain dynamics. We provide proof of concept for a novel approach that quantitatively links the effects of altered molecular pathways onto neuronal population
1
dynamics. As a novelty, we connect chemical compounds measured with positron emission tomography (PET) with neural function in TVB addressing the phenomenon of hyperexcitability in AD related to the protein amyloid beta (Abeta). We construct personalized virtual brains based on an averaged healthy connectome and individual PET derived distributions of Abeta in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N=8) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD, N=10) and in age-matched healthy controls (HC, N=15) using data from ADNI-3 data base (http://adni.lni.usc.edu). In the personalized virtual brains, individual Abeta burden modulates regional Excitation-Inhibition balance, leading to local hyperexcitation with high Abeta loads. We analyze simulated regional neural activity and electroencephalograms (EEG). Results. Known empirical alterations of EEG in patients with AD compared to HCs were reproduced by simulations. The virtual AD group showed slower frequencies in simulated local field potentials and EEG compared to MCI and HC groups. The heterogeneity of the Abeta load is crucial for the virtual EEG slowing which is absent for control models with homogeneous Abeta distributions. Slowing phenomena primarily affect the network hubs, independent of the spatial distribution of Abeta. Modeling the N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism of memantine in local population models, reveals potential functional reversibility of the observed large-scale alterations (reflected by EEG slowing) in virtual AD brains. Discussion. We demonstrate how TVB enables the simulation of systems effects caused by pathogenetic molecular candidate mechanisms in human virtual brains.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;To understand the pathogenesis of specific neuronal circuit dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we investigated the fate of three subclasses of “modulatory interneurons” in hippocampal CA1 using the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;AppNL-F/NL-F&lt;/span&gt; knock-in mouse model of AD. Cholecystokinin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons were aberrantly hyperactive preceding the presence of the typical AD hallmarks: neuroinflammation and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. These interneurons showed an age-dependent vulnerability to Aβ penetration and a reduction in density and coexpression of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA synthesis enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), suggesting a loss in their inhibitory function. However, calretinin (CR) interneurons—specialized to govern &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; inhibition, showed resilience to Aβ accumulation, preservation of structure, and displayed synaptic hyperinhibition, despite the lack of inhibitory control of CA1 excitatory pyramidal cells from midstages of the disease. This aberrant inhibitory homeostasis observed in CA1 CR cells and pyramidal cells was “normalized” by blocking P2Y1 purinoreceptors, which were “upregulated” and strongly expressed in CR cells and astrocytes in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;AppNL-F/NL-F&lt;/span&gt; mice in the later stages of AD. In summary, AD-associated cell-type selective destruction of inhibitory interneurons and disrupted inhibitory homeostasis rectified by modulation of the upregulated purinoreceptor system may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to normalize selective dysfunctional synaptic homeostasis during pathogenesis of AD.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While the hippocampus (HPC) is a prime candidate combining object identity and location due to its strong connections to the ventral and dorsal pathways via surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas, recent physiological studies have reported spatial information in the ventral pathway and its downstream target in MTL. However, it remains unknown whether the object–location association proceeds along the ventral MTL pathway before HPC. To address this question, we recorded neuronal activity from MTL and area anterior inferotemporal cortex (TE) of two macaques gazing at an object to retain its identity and location in each trial. The results showed significant effects of object–location association at a single-unit level in TE, perirhinal cortex (PRC), and HPC, but not in the parahippocampal cortex. Notably, a clear area difference emerged in the association form: 1) representations of object identity were added to those of subjects’ viewing location in TE; 2) PRC signaled both the additive form and the conjunction of the two inputs; and 3) HPC signaled only the conjunction signal. These results suggest that the object and location signals are combined stepwise at TE and PRC each time primates view an object, and PRC may provide HPC with the conjunctional signal, which might be used for encoding episodic memory.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Electrical activity is important for brain development. In brain slices, human subplate neurons exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that is highly sensitive to lanthanum. Based on the results of pharmacological experiments in human fetal tissue, we hypothesized that hemichannel-forming connexin (Cx) isoforms 26, 36, and 45 would be expressed on neurons in the subplate (SP) zone. RNA sequencing of dissected human cortical mantles at ages of 17–23 gestational weeks revealed that Cx45 has the highest expression, followed by Cx36 and Cx26. The levels of Cx and pannexin expression between male and female fetal cortices were not significantly different. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Cx45- and Cx26-expressing neurons in the upper segment of the SP zone. Cx45 was present on the cell bodies of human SP neurons, while Cx26 was found on both cell bodies and dendrites. Cx45, Cx36, and Cx26 were strongly expressed in the cortical plate, where newborn migrating neurons line up to form cortical layers. New information about the expression of 3 “neuronal” Cx isoforms in each cortical layer/zone (e.g., SP, cortical plate) and pharmacological data with cadmium and lanthanum may improve our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal development in human fetuses and potential vulnerabilities.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain asymmetry is inherent to cognitive processing and seems to reflect processing efficiency. Lower frontal asymmetry is often observed in older adults during memory retrieval, yet it is unclear whether lower asymmetry implies an age-related increase in contralateral recruitment, whether less asymmetry reflects compensation, is limited to frontal regions, or predicts neurocognitive stability or decline. We assessed age-related differences in asymmetry across the entire cerebral cortex, using functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 89 young and 76 older adults during successful retrieval, and surface-based methods allowing direct homotopic comparison of activity between cortical hemispheres 
. An extensive left-asymmetric network facilitated retrieval in both young and older adults, whereas diverse frontal and parietal regions exhibited lower asymmetry in older adults. However, lower asymmetry was not associated with age-related increases in contralateral recruitment but primarily reflected either less deactivation in contralateral regions reliably signaling retrieval failure in the young or lower recruitment of the dominant hemisphere—suggesting that functional deficits may drive lower asymmetry in older brains, not compensatory activity. Lower asymmetry predicted neither current memory performance nor the extent of memory change across the preceding ~ 8 years in older adults. Together, these findings are inconsistent with a compensation account for lower asymmetry during retrieval and aging.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The aim of this study was to develop and validate a method of disease classification for bipolar disorder (BD) by functional activity and connectivity using radiomics analysis. Ninety patients with unmedicated BD II as well as 117 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). A total of 4 types of 7018 features were extracted after preprocessing, including mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Then, predictive features were selected by Mann–Whitney &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt; test and removing variables with a high correlation. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was further used to select features. At last, support vector machine (SVM) model was used to estimate the state of each subject based on the selected features after LASSO. Sixty-five features including 54 RSFCs, 7 mALFFs, 1 mReHo, and 3 VMHCs were selected. The accuracy and area under curve (AUC) of the SVM model built based on the 65 features is 87.3% and 0.919 in the training dataset, respectively, and the accuracy and AUC of this model validated in the validation dataset is 80.5% and 0.838, respectively. These findings demonstrate a valid radiomics approach by rs-fMRI can identify BD individuals from healthy controls with a high classification accuracy, providing the potential adjunctive approach to clinical diagnostic systems.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The pulvinar is the largest extrageniculate visual nucleus in mammals. Given its extensive reciprocal connectivity with the visual cortex, it allows the cortico-thalamocortical transfer of visual information. Nonetheless, knowledge of the nature of the pulvinar inputs to the cortex remains elusive. We investigated the impact of silencing the pulvinar on the contrast response function of neurons in 2 distinct hierarchical cortical areas in the cat (areas 17 and 21a). Pulvinar inactivation altered the response gain in both areas, but with larger changes observed in area 21a. A theoretical model was proposed, simulating the pulvinar contribution to cortical contrast responses by modifying the excitation-inhibition balanced state of neurons across the cortical hierarchy. Our experimental and theoretical data showed that the pulvinar exerts a greater modulatory influence on neuronal activity in area 21a than in the primary visual cortex, indicating that the pulvinar impact on cortical visual neurons varies along the cortical hierarchy.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Behavioral change studies and interventions focus on self-control and external reinforcements to influence preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) has been shown to induce preference changes lasting months by merely associating items with neutral cues and speeded responses. We utilized this paradigm to study neural representation of preferences and their modification without external reinforcements. We scanned 36 participants with fMRI during a novel passive viewing task before, after and 30 days following CAT. We preregistered the predictions that activity in memory, top-down attention, and value-processing regions will underlie preference modification. While most theories associate preferences with prefrontal regions, we found that “bottom-up” perceptual mechanisms were associated with immediate change, whereas reduced “top-down” parietal activity was related to long-term change. Activity in value-related prefrontal regions was enhanced immediately after CAT for trained items and 1 month after for all items. Our findings suggest a novel neural mechanism of preference representation and modification. We suggest that nonreinforced change of preferences occurs initially in perceptual representation of items, putatively leading to long-term changes in “top-down” processes. These findings offer implementation of bottom-up instead of top-down targeted interventions for long-lasting behavioral change.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Measuring brain morphology with non-invasive structural magnetic resonance imaging is common practice, and can be used to investigate neuroplasticity. Brain morphology changes have been reported over the course of weeks, days, and hours in both animals and humans. If such short-term changes occur even faster, rapid morphological changes while being scanned could have important implications. In a randomized within-subject study on 47 healthy individuals, two high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired (á 263 s) per individual. The images were acquired during passive viewing of pictures or a fixation cross. Two common pipelines for analyzing brain images were used: voxel-based morphometry on gray matter (GM) volume and surface-based cortical thickness. We found that the measures of both GM volume and cortical thickness showed increases in the visual cortex while viewing pictures relative to a fixation cross. The increase was distributed across the two hemispheres and significant at a corrected level. Thus, brain morphology enlargements were detected in less than 263 s. Neuroplasticity is a far more dynamic process than previously shown, suggesting that individuals’ current mental state affects indices of brain morphology. This needs to be taken into account in future morphology studies and in everyday clinical practice.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Accurately predicting and testing the types of Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) of each patient using cost-effective microarray-based expression data and machine learning algorithms could greatly help either identifying the most targeting medicine or adopting other therapeutic measures that could correct/restore defective genetic signaling at the early stage. Furthermore, the prediction model construction processes can also help identifying highly informative genes controlling PAH, leading to enhanced understanding of the disease etiology and molecular pathways. In this study, we used several different gene filtering methods based on microarray expression data obtained from a high-quality patient PAH dataset. Following that, we proposed a novel feature selection and refinement algorithm in conjunction with well-known machine learning methods to identify a small set of highly informative genes. Results indicated that clusters of small-expression genes could be extremely informative at predicting and differentiating different forms of PAH. Additionally, our proposed novel feature refinement algorithm could lead to significant enhancement in model performance. To summarize, integrated with state-of-the-art machine learning and novel feature refining algorithms, the most accurate models could provide near-perfect classification accuracies using very few (close to ten) low-expression genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P1OQe1SrVTc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The cortical code that underlies perception must enable subjects to perceive the world at time scales relevant for behavior. We find that mice can integrate visual stimuli very quickly (&amp;lt;100 ms) to reach plateau performance in an orientation discrimination task. To define features of cortical activity that underlie performance at these time scales, we measured single-unit responses in the mouse visual cortex at time scales relevant to this task. In contrast to high-contrast stimuli of longer duration, which elicit reliable activity in individual neurons, stimuli at the threshold of perception elicit extremely sparse and unreliable responses in the primary visual cortex such that the activity of individual neurons does not reliably report orientation. Integrating information across neurons, however, quickly improves performance. Using a linear decoding model, we estimate that integrating information over 50–100 neurons is sufficient to account for behavioral performance. Thus, at the limits of visual perception, the visual system integrates information encoded in the probabilistic firing of unreliable single units to generate reliable behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Memory traces and associations between them are fundamental for cognitive brain function. Neuron recordings suggest that distributed assemblies of neurons in the brain serve as memory traces for spatial information, real-world items, and concepts. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding neural codes for associated memory traces. Some studies suggest the emergence of overlaps between assemblies during an association, while others suggest that the assemblies themselves remain largely unchanged and new assemblies emerge as neural codes for associated memory items. Here we study the emergence of neural codes for associated memory items in a generic computational model of recurrent networks of spiking neurons with a data-constrained rule for spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The model depends critically on 2 parameters, which control the excitability of neurons and the scale of initial synaptic weights. By modifying these 2 parameters, the model can reproduce both experimental data from the human brain on the fast formation of associations through emergent overlaps between assemblies, and rodent data where new neurons are recruited to encode the associated memories. Hence, our findings suggest that the brain can use both of these 2 neural codes for associations, and dynamically switch between them during consolidation.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Theoretical works suggested a wide array of possible mechanisms for rhythmogenesis ranging from the regulation of cellular properties to top–down control. Here we discuss theories of rhythmogenesis with an emphasis on spike timing-dependent plasticity. We argue that even though the specifics of different mechanisms vary greatly they all share certain key features. Namely, rhythmogenesis can be described as a flow on the phase diagram leading the system into a rhythmic region and stabilizing it on a specific manifold characterized by the desired rhythmic activity. Functionality is retained despite biological diversity by forcing the system into a specific manifold, but allowing fluctuations within that manifold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 Background: Nrf2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2) is believed to play a major role in neurodegenerative diseases. The present study attempted to investigate the hippocampal circRNA and lncRNA expression profiles associated with Nrf2-mediated neuroprotection.
Methods: The hippocampal mRNA, circRNA and lncRNA expression profiles of Nrf2 (-/-) mice were determined by microarray analysis. Bioinformatics analyses, including identification of differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), DEcircRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA interaction network construction, DElncRNA-DEmRNA co-expression network construction, and biological function annotation, were conducted. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the dysregulated expression of circRNAs and lncRNAs derived from the microarray data of the hippocampus of Nrf2 (-/-) mice.
Results: Compared to wild-type Nrf2 (+/+) mice, 412 DEmRNAs (109 up- and 303 down-regulated mRNAs), 1279 DEcircRNAs (632 up- and 647 down-regulated circRNAs), and 303 DElncRNAs (50 up- and 253 down-regulated lncRNAs) were identified in the hippocampus of Nrf2 (-/-) mice. Additionally, in qRT-PCR validation results, the expression patterns of selected DEcircRNAs and DElncRNAs were generally consistent with results in the microarray data. The DEcircRNA-miRNA-DEmRNA interaction networks revealed that mmu_circRNA_44531, mmu_circRNA_34132, mmu_circRNA_000903, mmu_circRNA_018676, mmu_circRNA_45901, mmu_circRNA_33836, mmu_circRNA_34137, mmu_circRNA_34106, mmu_circRNA_008691, and mmu_circRNA_003237 were predicted to compete with 47, 54, 45, 57, 63, 81, 121, 85, 181, and 43 DEmRNAs, respectively. ENSMUST00000125413, NR_028123, uc008nfy.1, AK076764, AK142725, AK080547 and AK035903 were co-expressed with 178, 89, 149, 179, 142, 55 and 112 DEmRNAs in the Nrf2 (-/-) hippocampus, respectively.
Conclusions: In conclusion, our study might contribute to exploring the key circRNAs and lncRNAs associated with Nrf2-mediated neuroprotection.</content>

 Neurological deficits and cognitive dysfunctions caused by acute ischemic stroke pose enormous burden to the stroke families and the communities. Restoration of the normal function of the neurovascular unit following ischemic stroke is critical for improving neurological recovery and cognitive functions after stroke. Recent evidences suggest that the myeloid cells including both the resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils are highly plastic in response to the environmental cues. They intimately interact with multiple components of the neurovascular unit in response to the alarmins, danger associated pattern molecules (DAMPs) and other signals released from the ischemic brain. The aim of this review is to discuss the reciprocal interactions between the myeloid cells and the ischemic neurovascular unit during the late repair phase of cerebral ischemic stroke. We also summarize potential immunotherapeutic targets on myeloid cells and new therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, such as cell transplantation, mitochondrial dynamic and extracellular vesicles-based therapy and et al to enhance neurovascular repair for better stroke recovery.</content>

 Optical stimulation and imaging of neurons deep in the brain require implantable optical neural probes. External optical access to deeper regions of the brain is limited by scattering and absorption of light as it propagates through tissue. Implantable optoelectronic probes capable of high-resolution light delivery and high-density neural recording are needed for closed-loop manipulation of neural circuits. Micro-light-emitting diodes (µLEDs) have been used for optical stimulation, but predominantly on rigid silicon or sapphire substrates. Flexible polymer neural probes would be preferable for chronic applications since they cause less damage to brain tissue. Flexible LED neural probes have been recently implemented by flip-chip bonding of commercially available µLED chips onto flexible substrates. Here, we demonstrate a monolithic design for flexible optoelectronic neural interfaces with embedded gallium nitride µLEDs that can be microfabricated at wafer-scale. Parylene C is used as the substrate and insulator due to its biocompatibility, compliance, and optical transparency. We demonstrate one-dimensional and two-dimensional individually-addressable µLED arrays. Our µLEDs have sizes as small as 22 µm × 22 µm in arrays of up to 32 µLEDs per probe shank. These devices emit blue light at a wavelength of 445 nm, suitable for stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2, with output power greater than 200 µW at 2 mA. Our flexible optoelectronic probes are double-sided and can illuminate brain tissue from both sides of the flexible probe. Recording electrodes are co-fabricated with µLEDs on the front- and backside of the optoelectronic probes for electrophysiology recording of neuronal activity from the volumes of tissue on the front- and backside simultaneously with bi-directional optical stimulation.</content>

 Minimally-invasive monitoring of electrophysiological neural activities in real-time—that enables quantification of neural functions without a need for invasive craniotomy and the longer time constants of fMRI and PET—presents a very challenging yet significant task for neuroimaging. In this paper, we present in vivo functional PA (fPA) imaging of chemoconvulsant rat seizure model with intact scalp using a fluorescence quenching-based cyanine voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) characterized by a lipid vesicle model mimicking different levels of membrane potential variation. The framework also involves use of a near-infrared VSD delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Our normalized time-frequency analysis presented in vivo VSD response in the seizure group significantly distinguishable from those of the control groups at sub-mm spatial resolution. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that the near-infrared fPA VSD imaging is a promising tool for in vivo recording of brain activities through intact scalp, which would pave a way to its future translation.</content>

 In experimental psychology, subjects are confronted with computer-based
experimental paradigms. Creating such paradigms can require quite an effort.
PyParadigm is a newly developed Python library to ease the development of such
paradigms by employing a declarative approach to build user interfaces (UIs).
This approach is a highly code-efficient alternative to currently
available libraries. Although PyParadigm was initially developed for the
creation of experimental paradigms, it is generally suited to build UIs that
display or interact with 2D objects.</content>

 The purpose of this study is to clarify whether there is a learning effect on brain activity after writing with an ink pen vs. a digital pen. Previous studies have reported the superiority of handwriting to typing in terms of learning performance, but differences between the use of an ink pen vs. a digital pen remain unclear. In the present study, the participants learned to read difficult words by writing with an ink pen vs. a digital pen. After the learning period, electroencephalography signals were measured, while the participants underwent a repetition priming paradigm with the use of the learned words. The repetition priming effect of the N400 event-related potential was quantified as an index of the learning effect and the effects between pen types were compared. The groups were also subdivided according to whether a digital pen is frequently used (familiar vs. unfamiliar group). The number of writing repetitions for each word within 10 min during the learning activity and the post-learning test scores were not affected by the pen type or familiarity with a digital pen. However, the repetition priming effect of the N400 was greater for words written with a digital pen in the learning session, as compared with an ink pen, in the familiar group, but not the unfamiliar group. These results suggest that for those familiar with its use, writing with a digital pen may improve learning relative to the use of an ink pen.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, has tremendous social and economic impact worldwide. This study aimed to analyze global trends in Alzheimer's disease research and to investigate China’s contribution to this research. 
Methods: The quantity and influence of publications related to Alzheimer's disease in China and elsewhere were compared. The Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched from 1988 to 2017 using the terms “Alzheimer's disease” or “Alzheimers disease.” Global Alzheimer's disease publications were classified and analyzed. Keywords, countries, and institutions publishing articles on Alzheimer’s disease were analyzed, and citations of these articles were examined.
Results: A total of 181,116 articles regarding Alzheimer's disease research were identified and analyzed. Neuroscience and neurology were the main research categories both globally and in China. Basic research dominated Alzheimer’s publications, accounting for 30.93% of global publications and 95.31% of publications in China. A total of 8,935 journals published articles related to Alzheimer’s disease. The journal Neurobiology of Aging published the most Alzheimer’s disease-related articles, numbering 5,206 over the time period examined. The National Institutes of Health, the National Institute on Aging, and the Department of Health and Human Services jointly sponsored 11,809 articles, ranking first in the world. The National Natural Science Foundation of China funded the largest number of studies on Alzheimer's disease in China and recognized the importance of traditional Chinese medicine in Alzheimer’s disease research. 
Conclusions: The present study provides data for global researchers to understand research perspectives and develop future research directions. In recent years, Chinese researchers have contributed significantly to global Alzheimer’s research. Still, strengthening international cooperation could improve the quality and number of publications regarding Alzheimer’s disease.</content>

 The cerebellar involvement in cognitive functions such as attention, language, working memory, emotion, goal-directed behavior and spatial navigation is constantly growing. However, an exact connectivity map between the hippocampus and cerebellum in mice is still unknown. Here, we conducted a tracing study to identify the sequence of transsynaptic, cerebellar-hippocampal connections in the mouse brain using combinations of recombinant adeno-associated (rAAV) and pseudotyped deletion-mutant rabies (RABV) viruses. Stereotaxic injection of a primarily anterograde rAAV-WGA (wheat germ agglutinin)-Cre tracer virus in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter mouse resulted in strong tdTomato labeling in hippocampal CA1 neurons, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), rhinal cortex (RC) as well as thalamic and cerebellar areas. Whereas hippocampal injections with the retrograde tracer virus rAAV-TTC (tetanus toxin C fragment)-eGFP, displayed eGFP positive cells in the rhinal cortex and subiculum. To determine the sequence of mono-transsynaptic connections between the cerebellum and hippocampus, we used the retrograde tracer RABVΔG-eGFP(EnvA). The tracing revealed a direct connection from the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), RC and subiculum (S), which are monosynaptically connected to thalamic laterodorsal and ventrolateral areas. These thalamic nuclei are directly connected to cerebellar fastigial (FN), interposed (IntP) and lateral (Lat) nuclei, discovering a new projection route from the fastigial to the laterodorsal thalamic nucleus in the mouse brain. Collectively, our findings suggest a new cerebellar-hippocampal connection via the laterodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus to RSC, RC and S. These results strengthen the notion of the cerebellum’s involvement in cognitive functions such as spatial navigation via a polysynaptic circuitry.</content>

 The identification of biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important and urgent area of study, not only to aid in the early diagnosis of AD, but also to evaluate potentially new anti-AD drugs. The aim of this study was to explore cofilin 2 in serum as a novel biomarker for AD. The upregulation was observed in AD patients and different AD animal models compared to the controls, as well as in AD cell models. Memantine and donepezil can attenuate the upregulation of cofilin 2 expression in APP/PS1 mice. The serum levels of cofilin 2 in AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients were significantly higher compared to controls (AD: 167.9±35.3 pg/mL; MCI: 115.9±15.4 pg/mL; Control: 90.5±27.1 pg/mL; p&amp;lt;0.01). A significant correlation between cofilin 2 levels and cognitive decline was observed (r=–0.792; p&amp;lt;0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of cofilin 2 was 0.957, and the diagnostic accuracy was 80%, with 93% sensitivity and 87% specificity. The optimal cut-off value was 130.4 pg/ml. Our results indicate the possibility of serum cofilin 2 as a novel and non-invasive biomarker for AD. In addition, the expression of cofilin 2 was found to be significantly increased in AD compared to vascular dementia (VaD), and only an increased trend but not significant was detected in VaD compared to the controls. ROC analysis between AD and VaD showed that the AUC was 0.824, which could indicate a role of cofilin 2 as a biomarker in the differential diagnosis between AD and VaD.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The multiplex role of cadherin-based adhesion complexes during development of pallial excitatory neurons has been thoroughly characterized. In contrast, much less is known about their function during interneuron development. Here, we report that conditional removal of N-cadherin (Cdh2) from postmitotic neuroblasts of the subpallium results in a decreased number of Gad65-GFP-positive interneurons in the adult cortex. We also found that interneuron precursor migration into the pallium was already delayed at E14. Using immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay in the embryonic subpallium, we excluded decreased mitosis and elevated cell death as possible sources of this defect. Moreover, by analyzing the interneuron composition of the adult somatosensory cortex, we uncovered an unexpected interneuron-type-specific defect caused by &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Cdh2&lt;/span&gt;-loss. This was not due to a fate-switch between interneuron populations or altered target selection during migration. Instead, potentially due to the migration delay, part of the precursors failed to enter the cortical plate and consequently got eliminated at early postnatal stages. In summary, our results indicate that Cdh2-mediated interactions are necessary for migration and survival during the postmitotic phase of interneuron development. Furthermore, we also propose that unlike in pallial glutamatergic cells, Cdh2 is not universal, rather a cell type-specific factor during this process.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain aging is highly variable and represents a challenge to delimit aging from disease processes. Moreover, genetic factors may influence both aging and disease. Here we focused on this issue and investigated effects of multiple genetic loci previously identified to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) on brain structure of older adults from a population sample. We calculated a genetic risk score (GRS) using genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms from genome-wide association studies of AD and tested its effect on cortical thickness (CT). We observed a common pattern of cortical thinning (right inferior frontal, left posterior temporal, medial occipital cortex). To identify CT changes by specific biological processes, we subdivided the GRS effect according to AD-associated pathways and performed follow-up analyses. The common pattern from the main analysis was further differentiated by pathway-specific effects yielding a more bilateral pattern. Further findings were located in the superior parietal and mid/anterior cingulate regions representing 2 unique pathway-specific patterns. All patterns, except the superior parietal pattern, were influenced by apolipoprotein E. Our step-wise approach revealed atrophy patterns that partially resembled imaging findings in early stages of AD. Our study provides evidence that genetic burden for AD contributes to structural brain variability in normal aging.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 Depression is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a high rate of relapse and low rate of response to antidepressant treatment. However, there is a dearth of new drugs, attributed to our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in its etiopathology. Chronic stress appears to be one of the foremost underlying causes of depression. Using various animal models, efforts in the past decade has implicated epigenetic mechanisms in mediating the negative effects of chronic stressful events on the progression/manifestation of depression and other co-morbid neuropsychiatric disorders. However, non-coding RNAs, another layer of epigenetic regulation is relatively lesser studied in this context. Here, using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced depression model, we aimed to uncover dysregulation in miRNA-mRNA networks in the neurogenic dentate gyrus (DG) region of  male C57BL/6 mice. Among several dysregulated miRNAs, identified via miRNA arrays, the most striking finding was attenuated expression of miRNAs of the miR-30 family in stressed/defeated mice. To investigate miRNAs in the DG-resident neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs), we used the in vitro neurosphere culture, where proliferating NSCs/NPCs were subjected to differentiation. Among several differentially exprerssed miRNAs, we observed an upregulation of miR-30 miRNAs upon differentiation. To search for the gene targets of these miRNAs, we performed gene arrays followed by bioinformatics analysis, miRNA manipulations and luciferase assays. Our results suggest that miR-30 miRNAs mediate chronic stress-induced depression by altering hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity via controlling the epigenetic/transcription regulators such as Mll3 and Runx1 and cell signaling regulators like Socs3, Ppp3r1, Gpr125, and Nrp1.</content>

 Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), also known as NG2 glia, arise from neural progenitor cells in the embryonic ganglionic eminences that also generate inhibitory neurons. They are ubiquitously distributed in the central nervous system, remain proliferative through life, and generate oligodendrocytes in both gray and white matter. OPCs exhibit some lineage plasticity, and attempts have been made to reprogram them into neurons, with varying degrees of success. However, little is known about how epigenetic mechanisms affect the ability of OPCs to undergo fate switch and whether OPCs have a unique chromatin environment around neuronal genes that might contribute to their lineage plasticity. Our bioinformatic analysis of histone posttranslational modifications at interneuron genes in OPCs revealed that OPCs had significantly fewer bivalent and repressive histone marks at interneuron genes compared to astrocytes or fibroblasts. Conversely, OPCs had a greater degree of deposition active histone modifications at bivalently marked interneuron genes than other cell types, and this was correlated with higher expression levels of these genes in OPCs. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of interneuron genes in OPCs than in other cell types lacked the histone posttranslational modifications examined. These genes had a moderately high level of expression, suggesting that the “no mark” interneuron genes could be in a transcriptionally “poised” or “transitional” state. Thus, our findings suggest that OPCs have a unique histone code at their interneuron genes that may obviate the need for erasure of repressive marks during their fate switch to inhibitory neurons.</content>

 Progressive neurological deterioration poses enormous burden on the aging population with ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative disease patients, such as Alzheimers’ disease and Parkinson’s disease. The past two decades have witnessed remarkable advances in the research of neurovascular unit dysfunction, which is emerging as an important pathological feature that underlies these neurological disorders. Dysfunction of the unit allows penetration of blood-derived toxic proteins or leukocytes into the brain and contributes to white matter injury, disturbed neurovascular coupling and neuroinflammation, which all eventually lead to cognitive dysfunction. Recent evidences suggest that aging-related oxidative stress, accumulated DNA damage and impaired DNA repair capacities compromises the genome integrity not only in neurons, but also in other cell types of the neurovascular unit, such as endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Combating DNA damage or enhancing DNA repair capacities in the neurovascular unit represents a promising therapeutic strategy for vascular and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we focus on aging related mechanisms that underlie DNA damage and repair in the neurovascular unit and introduce several novel strategies that target the genome integrity in the neurovascular unit to combat the vascular and neurodegenerative disorders in the aging brain.</content>

 Background: Flow states are considered a positive, subjective experience during an optimal balance between skills and task demands. Previously, experimentally induced flow experiences have relied solely on adaptive tasks.
Objective: To investigate whether cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) area and anodal tDCS over the right parietal cortex area during video game play will promote an increased experience of flow states. 
Methods: Two studies had participants play Tetris or first-person shooter (FPS) video games while receiving either real tDCS or sham stimulation. Tetris recruited nineteen untrained players who infrequently played video games while the ten FPS participants played FPS frequently. Flow experience was assessed before and after stimulation.
Results: Compared to sham stimulation, real stimulation increased flow experience for both untrained Tetris and trained FPS players. No ceiling effects were noticed between trained and untrained groups.
Conclusion: Cathodal and anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC and right parietal areas respectively may encourage flow experiences in complex real-life motor tasks that occur during sports, games and everyday life.</content>

 In the study of human cognitive activity using electroencephalogram (EEG), the brain dynamics parameters and characteristics play a crucial role. They allow to investigate the changes in functionality depending on the environment and task performance process, and also to access the intensity of the brain activity in various locations of the cortex and its dependencies. Usually, the dynamics of activation of different brain areas during the cognitive tasks are being studied by spectral analysis based on power spectral density (PSD) estimation, and coherence analysis, which are de facto standard tools in quantitative characterization of brain activity. PSD and coherence reflect the strength of oscillations and similarity of the emergence of these oscillations in the brain, respectively, while the concept of stability of brain activity over time is not well defined and less formalized.   
We propose to employ the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) as a measure of the EEG persistence over time, and use the DFA scaling exponent as its quantitative characteristics. We applied DFA to the study of the changes in activation in brain dynamics during mental calculations and united it with PSD and coherence estimation. In the experiment, EEGs during resting state and mental serial subtraction from 36 subjects were recorded and analyzed in four frequency ranges: θ1 (4.1 - 5.8 Hz), θ2 (5.9 - 7.4 Hz), β1 (13 - 19.9 Hz), and β2 (20 - 25 Hz). PSD maps to access the intensity of cortex activation and coherence to quantify the connections between different brain areas were calculated, the distribution of DFA scaling exponent over the head surface was exploited to measure the time characteristics of the dynamics of brain activity.   
Obtained arrangements of DFA scaling exponent suggest that normal functioning of the brain is characterized by long-term temporal correlations in the cortex. Topographical distribution of the DFA scaling exponent was comparable for θ and β frequency bands, demonstrating the largest values of DFA scaling exponent during cognitive activation. The study shows that the long-term temporal correlations evaluated by DFA can be of great interest for diagnosis of the variety of brain dysfunctions of different etiology in future.</content>

 Cognitive decline is common in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and precise cognitive assessment is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. To date, there are no studies in PD investigating cultural bias on neuropsychological tests. Clinical practice in multicultural societies such as Toronto Canada, where nearly half of the population is comprised of first generation immigrants, presents important challenges as most neuropsychological tools were developed in Anglosphere cultures (e.g., USA, UK) and normed in more homogeneous groups. We examine total scores and rates of deficits on tests of visuoperceptual/visuospatial, attention, memory, and executive functions in Canadians with PD born in Anglosphere countries (n = 248) versus in Canadians with PD born in other regions (International group; n = 167). The International group shows lower scores and greater rates of deficits on all visuoperceptual and some executive function tasks, but not on attention or memory measures. These biases are not explained by demographic and clinical variables as groups were comparable. Age at immigration, years in Canada, and English proficiency also do not account for the observed biases. In contrast, group differences are strongly mediated by the Historical Index of Human Development of the participants’ country of birth, which reflects economic, health, and educational potential of a country at the time of birth. In sum, our findings demonstrate lasting biases on neuropsychological tests despite significant exposure to, and participation in, Canadian culture. These biases are most striking on visuoperceptual measures and non-verbal executive tasks which many clinicians still considered to be “culture-fair” despite the growing evidence from the field of cross-cultural neuropsychology to the contrary. Our findings also illustrate that socio-development context captures important aspects of culture that relate to cognition, and have important implications for clinical practice.</content>

 Transcranial direct current stimulation is a promising neuromodulation method for treating depression. However, compared with pharmacological treatment, previous studies have reported that a relatively limited proportion of patients respond to tDCS treatment. In addition, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tDCS treatment remain unclear, making it difficult to identify response predictors for tDCS treatment based on neurophysiological function. Because treatment effects are achieved by repetitive application of tDCS, studying the immediate effects of tDCS in depressive patients could extend understanding of its treatment mechanisms. However, immediate changes in a single session of tDCS are not well documented. Thus, in the current study, we focused on the immediate impact of tDCS and its association with pre-stimulus brain activity. 
To address this question, we applied anodal tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in 14 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 20 healthy controls, at an intensity of 1.5 mA for 20 minutes in a single session. To evaluate anxiety, the state trait anxiety inventory was completed before and after tDCS. We recorded resting electroencephalography before tDCS, and calculated electrical neuronal activity in the theta and alpha frequency bands using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. 
We found that, during application of left DLPFC tDCS to patients with MDD, the anxiety reduction effect of tDCS was related to higher baseline theta-band activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. For DMPFC stimulation in MDD, the anxiety reduction effect was associated with lower baseline alpha-band activity in the left inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, the anxiety reduction effect was associated with greater alpha activity in the left inferior parietal lobule during left DLPFC stimulation in healthy controls, whereas it was associated with lower baseline alpha activity in the precuneus during DMPFC stimulation.
The current results suggest that the association between pre-tDCS brain activity and the anxiety reduction effect of tDCS depends on psychopathology (depressed or non-depressed) as well as the site of stimulation (DMPFC or left DLPFC). Furthermore, the results suggest that tDCS response might be predicted by baseline resting state electrophysiological neural activity.</content>

 Abstract
Background/Aim: 
Using a within-subjects, within-wound care design, this pilot study tested for the first time, the whether immersive virtual reality (VR) can serve as an adjunctive non-opioid analgesic for children with large severe burn wounds during burn wound cleaning in the ICU, in a regional burn center in the United States. 

Methods: Participants included 48 children from 6 years old to 17 years of age with &amp;gt; 10% TBSA burn injuries reporting moderate or higher worst pain during no VR on Day 1. Forty-four of the 48 children were from developing Latin American countries. Patients played adjunctive SnowWorld, an interactive 3D snowy canyon in virtual reality during some portions of wound care, vs. No VR during comparable portions of the same wound care session (initial treatment condition randomized). Using Graphic Rating scales, children's worst pain ratings during “No VR” (treatment as usual pain medications) vs. their worst pain during “Yes VR” was measured during at least one day of wound care, and was measured for up to ten study days the patient used VR.  

Results: VR significantly reduced children’s “worst pain” ratings during burn wound cleaning procedures in the ICU on Day 1. Worst pain during No VR = 8.52 (SD = 1.75) vs. during Yes VR = 5.10 (SD = 3.27), t(47) = 7.11, p &amp;lt; .001, SD = 3.33, CI = 2.45 to 4.38, Cohen’s d = 1.21 (indicating large effect size). Patients continued to report the predicted pattern of lower pain and more fun during VR, during multiple sessions.
 
Conclusion:Immersive virtual reality can help reduce the pain of children with large severe burn wounds during burn wound cleaning in the Intensive Care Unit. . Additional research and development is recommended.</content>

 A better and non-invasive characterization of the preclinical phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is important to advance its diagnosis and obtain more effective benefits from potential treatments. The TgF344-AD rat model has been well characterized and shows molecular, behavioral and brain connectivity alterations that resemble the silent period of the pathology. Our aim was to longitudinally investigate functional brain connectivity in established resting-state networks (RSNs) obtained by independent component analysis (ICA) in a cohort of TgF344-AD and control rats every 3 months, from 5 to 18 months of age, to cover different stages of the disease. Before each acquisition, working memory performance was evaluated by the delayed non match-to-sample (DNMS) task.

Differences in the temporal evolution were observed between groups in the amplitude and shape of the somatosensorial and sensorimotor networks but not in the whole default mode network (DMN). Subsequent high dimensional ICA analysis showed early alterations in the anterior DMN subnetwork activity of TgF344-AD rats compared to controls. Performance of DNMS task was positively correlated with somatosensorial network at 5 months of age in the wild-type animals but not in the Tg-F344 rats. At different time points, DMN showed negative correlation with cognitive performance in the control group while in the transgenic group the correlation was positive. In addition, behavioral differences observed at 5 months of age correlated with alterations in the posterior DMN subnetwork.

We have demonstrated that functional connectivity using ICA represents a useful biomarker also in animal models of AD such as the TgF344AD rats, as it allows the identification of alterations associated with the progression of the disease, detecting differences in specific networks even at very early stages.</content>

 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between the cognitive changes in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which induces abnormalities in specific brain regions. Previous studies showed that paired helical filaments Tau (PHF-Tau) protein is a potential pathogenic protein which may cause abnormal brain function and structure in MCI and AD patients. However, the understanding of the PHF-Tau protein network in MCI patients is limited. In this study, 225 subjects with PHF-Tau PET images were divided into four groups based on whether they carried Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE 4) or abnormal cerebrospinal fluid Total-Tau (CSF T-Tau). They are two important pathogenic factors that might cause cognitive function impairment. The four groups were: individuals harboring CSF T-Tau pathology but no APOE 4 (APOE 4-T+); APOE 4 carriers with normal CSF T-Tau (APOE 4+T-); APOE 4 carriers with abnormal CSF T-Tau (APOE 4+T+); and APOE 4 noncarriers with abnormal CSF T-Tau (APOE 4-T-). We explored the topological organization of PHF-Tau networks in these four groups and calculated five kinds of network properties: clustering coefficient, shortest path length, Q value of modularity, nodal centrality and degree. Our findings showed that compared with APOE 4-T-group, the other three groups showed different alterations in the clustering coefficient, shortest path length, Q value of modularity, nodal centrality and degree. Simultaneously, voxel level analysis was conducted and the results showed that compared with APOE 4-T- group, the other three groups were found increased PHF-Tau distribution in some brain regions. For APOE 4+T+ group, positive correlation was found between the value of PHF-Tau distribution in altered regions and Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) score. Our results indicated that the effects of APOE 4 and abnormal CSF T-Tau may induce abnormalities of PHF-Tau protein and APOE 4 has a greater impact on PHF-Tau than abnormal CSF T-Tau. Our results may be particularly helpful in uncovering the pathophysiology underlying the cognitive dysfunction in MCI patients.</content>

 BACKGROUND: Aging population undergoing surgery are at risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Exploring effective and reliable early predictor of POCD is essential to identify high-risk patients and make prospective decisions. The purpose of this study was to examine whether preoperative insulin resistance, is an independent predictor of POCD.
METHODS: A total of 124 aged 60 years older patients for gastrointestinal surgery were enrolled in a prospective observational clinical study. All participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests before surgery and at 7 days afterwards. POCD was defined as a decline of at least 1.5 SD on two or more of neuropsychological tests. Plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), and S-100β protein were measured. The status of insulin resistance was assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment–Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). The relationship between HOMA-IR and POCD was assessed by Multivariable logistic regression models and the receiver operating characteristic curve.

RESULTS: 51 patients (41.1%) were diagnosed with POCD at 7 days after surgery. Preoperative HOMA-IR values of the POCD group were significantly higher than the non-POCD group, besides, CRP and TNF-α levels of the POCD group were significantly higher at each postoperative time point (P&amp;lt;0.05). Preoperative HOMA-IR value was an independent predictor of POCD (adjusted OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.18-2.99) even after adjust for confounding variables, and when dichotomized, individuals above the HOMA-IR threshold (HOMA-IR &amp;gt;2.6) had a three time’s higher risk of POCD (OR 3.26; 95% CI 1.07–9.91) compared individuals below the threshold. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of HOMA-IR was 0.804 (95% CI, 0.725–0.883; P &amp;lt;0 .001).The optimal cutoff value was found to be 0.583, with sensitivity of 84.3% and specificity of 74%. HOMA-IR value was positively associated with TNF-α concentration at baseline (R2= 0.43, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and 1 days after surgery (R2= 0.3861, P &amp;lt; 0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative insulin resistance is an effective predictor for the occurrence of POCD. Targeted prevention and treatment strategies of insulin resistance may be effective interventions of patients at risk for POCD.</content>

 Soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers have been shown to induce oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits which have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Administration of γ-glutamylcysteine (GGC), a precursor to glutathione (GSH) can replenish depleted GSH levels, by circumventing the regulation of GSH biosynthesis and providing the limiting substrate. In this study, we examined the effect of exogenous Aβ40 oligomers on biomarkers of apoptosis and cell death, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, in primary adult human astrocytes. Treatment with Aβ40 oligomers significantly reduced the cell viability and apoptosis of astrocyte brain cultures and decreased oxidative modifications of DNA, lipids, and protein after 24 hours. Co-treatment with GGC at 200µM also attenuated increased the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and led to significant increases in the levels of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and GSH and reduced the GSSG/GSH ratio. GGC also upregulated the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and reduced the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in Oligomeric Aβ40-treated astrocytes. Our data provides renewed insight on the beneficial effects of increased GSH levels by GGC in human astrocytes, and identifies yet another potential therapeutic strategy to attenuate the cytotoxic effects of Aβ oligomers in AD.</content>

Although Polycomb group proteins (PcG) are key factors for both temporary and persistent repression of the developmental genes, how the same group of proteins can differentially repress target genes remains unclarified. The identification of a variety of PcG complexes and activities sheds light on these issues. In this review, based on the recent findings including those with the use of interactome and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)-type analyses, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of PcG-mediated gene regulation and discuss how PcG regulates cell fate specification during neural development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS). GABAARs belong to the Cys-loop superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC) and are assembled from 19 different subunits. As dysfunctional GABAergic neurotransmission manifests itself in neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy and anxiety, GABAARs are key drug targets. The majority of synaptic GABA(A)Rs are anchored at the inhibitory postsynaptic membrane by the principal scaffolding protein gephyrin, which acts as the central organizer in maintaining the architecture of the inhibitory postsynaptic density (iPSD). This interaction is mediated by the long intracellular loop located in between transmembrane helices 3 and 4 (M3-M4 loop) of the receptors and the universal receptor-binding pocket residing in the C-terminal domain of gephyrin. In 2014, the crystal structure of the beta3-homopentameric GABA(A)R provided crucial information regarding the architecture of the receptor; however, a clear understanding of the structure and assembly of heteropentameric receptors, as well as the mechanism of action of these receptors, remained enigmatic. This review will highlight recent advances in understanding the structure of heteropentameric synaptic GABA(A)Rs and how these structures have provided fundamental insights into the assembly of these multi-subunit receptors as well as their modulation by diverse ligands including the physiological agonist GABA. We will further discuss the role of gephyrin in anchoring of synaptic GABAARs and also glycine receptors, thus maintaining the architecture of the iPSD. Finally, we will also summarize how anti-malarial artemisinin drugs modulate gephyrin-specific inhibitory neurotransmission.</content>

 Extracellular adenine nucleotides play important roles in cell-cell communication and tissue homeostasis. High concentrations of extracellular ATP released by dying cells are sensed as a danger signal by the P2X7 receptor, a non-specific cation channel. Studies in P2X7 knockout mice and numerous disease models have demonstrated an important role of this receptor in inflammatory processes. P2X7 activation has been shown to induce a variety of cellular responses that are not usually associated with ion channel function, for example changes in the plasma membrane composition and morphology, ectodomain shedding, activation of lipases, kinases, and transcription factors, as well as cytokine release and apoptosis. In contrast to all other P2X family members, the P2X7 receptor contains a long intracellular C-terminus that constitutes 40% of the whole protein and is considered essential for most of these effects. So far, over 50 different proteins have been identified to physically interact with the P2X7 receptor. However, few of these interactions have been confirmed in independent studies and for the majority of these proteins, the interaction domains and the physiological consequences of the interactions are only poorly described. Also, while the structure of the P2X7 extracellular domain has recently been resolved, information about the organisation and structure of its C-terminal tail remains elusive. After shortly describing the structure and assembly of the P2X7 receptor, this review gives an update of the identified or proposed interaction domains within the P2X7 C-terminus, describes signalling pathways in which this receptor has been involved, and provides an overlook of the identified interaction partners.</content>

 The high mortality and morbidity rate of stroke has been a chronic problem plaguing human society. The activation of microglia is one of the principal reasons why neuroinflammation induces cerebral dysfunction. Because of their vital functions in the regulation of neuroinflammation, microglia constitute an important target for stroke. Given that there is an innate self-preservation mechanism between neurons and microglia, the transmembrane glycoproteins on the surface of their membranes, namely CD200 and CD200R, have become a popular topic of research. Numerous studies have demonstrated that CD200-CD200R interaction, microglial activation, and poststroke neuroinflammatory damage are inextricably linked. In this review, we describe the above relationship from a new perspective. Specifically, we will focus on neuroinflammation after stroke. The role of crosstalk of CD200-CD200R inhibitory immune ligand receptors in immune regulation will also be illustrated.  Thus, we will see how poststroke injury can be influenced by the CD200-CD200R crosstalk. Finally, we will discuss the possibility of clinical application of the result of CD200-CD200R interaction to manage the neuroinflammatory injury after stroke.</content>

 The interaction between the gut microbiota and alpha-synuclein (Syn) aggregation in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is receiving increasing attention. The objective of this study was to investigate gut microbiota, and effects of an inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) trigger in a human Syn over-expressing mouse model of PD (Thy1-αSyn). Stool samples from patients with confirmed PD and Thy1-Syn mice were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing.  Compared to healthy controls, the relative abundance of mucin-degrading Verrucomicrobiae and LPS-producing Gammaproteobacteria were greater in PD patients. In mice, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was negligible in both Thy1-αSyn and wild-type (WT) animals, while Verrucomicrobiae were reduced in Thy1-αSyn mice. The effect of LPS on intestinal barrier function was investigated in vitro using intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells, and in vivo via administration of LPS in drinking water to Thy1-Syn mice. Acute exposure to LPS in vitro resulted in a reduction and altered distribution of the tight junction markers ZO-1 and e-Cadherin around the cell membrane in IEC-6 cells, as shown by immunohistochemistry. LPS administration in Thy1-Syn mice resulted in the emergence of early motor manifestations at 10 weeks, compared to untreated mice who were still asymptomatic at this age. This study reaffirms that an altered microbiome exists in patients with PD, and supports the notion of  a proinflammatory gut microbiome environment as a trigger for PD pathogenesis.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00822"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00822</id>

		<content type="html">
 In recent years, electroencephalography (EEG) measured around the ears, called ear-EEG, has been introduced to develop unobtrusive and ambulatory EEG-based applications. When measuring ear-EEGs, the availability of a reference site is restricted due to the miniaturized device structure, and therefore a reference electrode is generally placed near the recording electrodes. As the electrical brain activity recorded at a reference electrode closely placed to recording electrodes may significantly cancel or influence the brain activity recorded by the recording electrodes, an appropriate re-referencing method is often required to mitigate the impact of the reference brain activity. In this study, therefore, we systematically investigated the impact of different re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs spontaneously generated from endogenous paradigms. To this end, we used two ear-EEG datasets recorded behind both ears while subjects performed an alpha modulation task (eyes-closed and eyes-open) and two mental tasks (mental arithmetic and mental singing). The measured ear-EEGs were independently re-referenced using five different methods: i) all-mean, ii) contralateral-mean, iii) ipsilateral-mean, iv) contralateral-bipolar, and v) ipsilateral-bipolar. We investigated the changes in alpha power during eyes-open and eyes-closed tasks, as well as event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) during mental arithmetic and mental singing. To evaluate the effects of re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs, we also estimated the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the two ear-EEG datasets, as well as assessed the classification performance of the two mental tasks (mental arithmetic vs. mental singing). Overall patterns of changes in alpha power and ERD/ERS were similar among the five re-referencing methods, but the contralateral-mean method showed statistically higher SNRs than did the other methods for both ear-EEG datasets, except in the contralateral-bipolar method for the two mental tasks. In concordance with the SNR results, classification performance was also statistically higher for the contralateral-mean method than it was for the other re-referencing methods. The results suggest that employing contralateral mean information can be an efficient way to re-reference spontaneously generated ear-EEGs, thereby maximizing the reliability of ear-EEG-based applications in endogenous paradigms.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00783"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00783</id>

		<content type="html">
 Background
While alternating current stimulation (ACS) is gaining relevance as a tool in research and approaching clinical applications, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. A review by Schutter and colleagues argues for a retinal origin of transcranial ACS’ neuromodulatory effects. Interestingly, there is an alternative application form of ACS specifically targeting α-oscillations in the visual cortex via periorbital electrodes (retinofugal alternating current stimulation, rACS). To further compare these two methods and investigate retinal effects of ACS, we first aim to establish the safety and tolerability of rACS. 

Objective
The goal of our research was to evaluate the safety of retinofugal alternating current stimulation (rACS) via finite-element modeling, theoretical safety limits and subjective report.

Methods
20 healthy subjects were stimulated with rACS as well as photic stimulation and reported adverse events following stimulation. We analyzed stimulation parameters at electrode level as well as distributed metric estimates from an ultra-high spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived finite element human head model and compared them to existing safety limits.

Results
Topographical modeling revealed the highest current densities in the anterior visual pathway, particularly retina and optic nerve. Stimulation parameters and finite element modeling estimates of rACS were found to be well below existing safety limits. No serious adverse events occurred. 
 
Conclusion
Our findings are in line with existing safety guidelines for retinal and neural damage and establish the tolerability and feasibility of rACS. In comparison to tACS, retinofugal stimulation of the visual cortex provides an anatomically circumscribed model to systematically study the mechanisms of action of ACS.</content>

 Background: Tumor necrosis factor, which exists both as a soluble (solTNF) and a transmembrane (tmTNF) protein, plays an important role in post-stroke inflammation. The objective of the present study was to test the effect of topical versus intracerebroventricular administration of XPro1595 (a solTNF inhibitor) and etanercept (a solTNF and tmTNF inhibitor) compared to saline on output measures such as infarct volume and post-stroke inflammation in mice.
Methods: Adult male C57BL/6 mice were treated topically (2.5 mg/ml/1µl/hr for 3 consecutive days) or intracerebroventricularly (1.25 mg/kg/0.5 ml, once) with saline, XPro1595, or etanercept immediately after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Mice were allowed to survive 1 or 3 days. Infarct volume, microglial and leukocyte profiles, and inflammatory markers were evaluated.
Results: We found that topical, and not intracerebroventricular, administration of XPro1595 reduced infarct volume at both 1 day and 3 days after pMCAO. Etanercept showed no effect. We observed no changes in microglial or leukocyte populations. XPro1595 increased gene expression of P2ry12 at 1 day and Trem2 at 1 and 3 days, while decreasing Cx3cr1 expression at 1 and 3 days after pMCAO, suggesting a change in microglial activation towards a phagocytic phenotype.
Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that topical administration of XPro1595 for three consecutive days decreases infarct volumes after ischemic stroke, while modifying microglial activation and the inflammatory response post-stroke. This suggests that inhibitors of solTNF hold great promise for future neuroprotective treatment in ischemic stroke.</content>

 Despite extensive neuroimaging research of primary sensory cortices involved in auditory and visual functions, subcortical structures within these domains, such as the inferior and superior colliculi, the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei and the superior olivary complex, are currently understudied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in living humans. This is because a precise localization of these nuclei is hampered by the limited contrast and sensitivity of conventional neuroimaging methods for deep brain nuclei. In this work, we used 7 Tesla multi-modality (T2-weighted and diffusion fractional anisotropy) 1.1mm isotropic resolution MRI to achieve high sensitivity and contrast for single-subject brainstem and thalamic nuclei delineation. After precise coregistration to stereotactic space, we generated an in vivo human probabilistic atlas of auditory (medial geniculate nucleus, inferior colliculus, and superior olivary complex) and visual (lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus) subcortical nuclei. We foresee the use of this atlas as a tool to precisely identify the location and shape of auditory/visual deep nuclei in research as well as clinical studies.</content>

 Decades of research on neuromotor circuits and systems has provided valuable information on neuronal control of movement.  Computational models of several elements of the neuromotor system have been developed at various scales, from  sub-cellular to system.   While several small models abound, their structured integration is the key to building larger and more biologically realistic models which can predict the behavior of the system in different scenarios.  This effort calls for integration of elements across neuroscience and musculoskeletal biomechanics. There is also a need for development of methods and tools for structured integration that yield larger \textit{in silico} models demonstrating a set of desired system responses.  
We take a small step in this direction with the NEUROmotor integration and Design (NEUROiD) platform.  NEUROiD helps integrate results from motor systems anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics into an integrated neuromotor system model.  Simulation and visualization of the model across multiple scales is supported.  Standard electrophysiological operations such as slicing, current injection, recording of membrane potential and local field potential are part of NEUROiD. The platform allows traceability of model parameters to primary literature.  We illustrate the power and utility of NEUROiD by building a simple ankle model and its controlling neural circuitry by curating a set of published components. NEUROiD allows researchers to utilize remote high-performance computers for simulation, while controlling the model using a web browser.</content>

 Memory research remains focused on just a few brain structures – in particular, the hippocampal formation (the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex). Three key discoveries promote this continued focus:  the striking demonstrations of enduring anterograde amnesia after bilateral hippocampal damage; the realisation that synapses in the hippocampal formation are plastic e.g., when responding to short bursts of patterned stimulation (‘long-term potentiation’ or LTP); and the discovery of a panoply of spatially-tuned cells, principally surveyed in the hippocampal formation (place cells coding for position; head-direction cells, providing compass-like information; and grid cells, providing a metric for 3D space). Recent anatomical, behavioural, and electrophysiological work extends this picture to a growing network of subcortical brain structures, including the anterior thalamic nuclei, rostral midline thalamic nuclei, and the claustrum. There are, for example, spatially-tuned cells in all of these regions, including cells with properties similar to place cells of the hippocampus proper. These findings add new perspectives to what had been originally been proposed - but often overlooked - half a century ago: that damage to an extended network of structures connected to the hippocampal formation results in diencephalic amnesia. We suggest these new findings extend spatial signalling in the brain far beyond the hippocampal formation, with profound implications for theories of the neural bases of spatial and mnemonic functions.</content>

 Although the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease are diverse and unclear, the past 20 years have witnessed the unprecedented development of the AD inflammation theory. As a key inflammatory receptor family, the C-C chemokine receptor family is a remarkable participant in the cause of Alzheimer's disease; of this family, CCR5 is the most widely studied. CCR5 is an essential entrance when HIV infects immune cells and is also involved in other inflammatory and immune activities. New evidence on the inevitably intertwined link between Alzheimer's disease and CCR5 indicates that CCR5 accelerates the development of Alzheimer's disease, and few studies disputed it. The role of CCR5 in Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. However, as the research progresses, this intricate relationship will gradually be uncovered.</content>

 Microtubules (MTs) play a fundamental role in many vital processes such as cell division and neuronal activity. They are key structural and functional elements in axons, supporting neurite differentiation and growth, as well as transport along the axons by the motor proteins, which use MTs as support tracks. Tau is a stabilizing MT associated protein, whose functions are mainly regulated by phosphorylation. A disruption of the MT network, which might be caused by Tau loss of function, is observed in a group of related diseases called tauopathies, which includes Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Tau is found hyperphosphorylated in AD, which might account for its loss of MT stabilizing capacity. Since destabilization of MTs after dissociation of Tau could contribute to toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases, a molecular understanding of this interaction and its regulation, is essential.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Pathological aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies (LB) which play a central role in pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Differential expression of α-syn isoforms has been shown in PD. Isoform α-syn98 is generated by excision of exon-3 and exon-5 of the α-syn gene. In contrast to the canonical full-length α-syn isoform (α-syn140), little is known about function of the α-syn98 isoform. In the present study, to identify the potential role of α-syn98 protein in PD, we examined effects of exogenous recombinant insoluble α-syn98 aggregates on α-syn pathology and inflammatory responses in the midbrain. After injection of α-syn98 aggregates into the substantia nigra (SN), mice exhibited motor dysfunction accompanied by nigral dopaminergic neuron loss. In addition, α-syn98 aggregates injection resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylation of endogenous α-syn. Accumulations of α-syn were co-localized with p62 and ubiquitin, which suggests α-syn98 aggregates-induced pathology exhibits properties similar to human LB. Many glial cells were activated after α-syn98 aggregates injection. In addition, expression of NF-κB, interleukin 6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and levels of oxidative stress increased after α-syn98 aggregates injection. Our results suggest that α-syn98 may play a crucial role in pathogenesis of PD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Vulvodynia is an idiopathic chronic pain disorder and a leading cause of dyspareunia, or pain associated with sexual intercourse, for women. The key pathophysiological features of vulvodynia are vaginal hyperinnervation and nociceptor sensitization. These features have been described consistently by research groups over the past 30 years, but currently there is no first-line recommended treatment that targets this pathophysiology. Instead, psychological interventions, pelvic floor physiotherapy and surgery to remove painful tissue are recommended, as these are the few interventions that have shown some benefit in clinical trials. Recurrence of vulvodynia is frequent, even after vestibulectomy and questions regarding etiology remain. Vestibular biopsies from women with vulvodynia contain increased abundance of immune cells including macrophages as well as increased numbers of nerve fibers. Macrophages have multiple roles in the induction and resolution of inflammation and their function can be broadly described as pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory depending on their polarization state. This state is not fixed and can alter rapidly in response to the microenvironment. Essentially, M1, or classically activated macrophages, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote nociceptor sensitization and mechanical allodynia, whereas M2, or alternately activated macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and promote functions such as wound healing. Signaling between macrophages and neurons has been shown to promote axonal sprouting and nociceptor sensitization. This mini review considers emerging evidence that macrophages may play a role in nociceptor sensitization and hyperinnervation relevant to vulvodynia and considers the implications for development of new therapeutic strategies.</content>

 Background: Fall risk has increased among elders and young adult sequentially prior to any cause. Occult balance disorder may become one of the morbidity cause of fall in young adult and eventually to elders. Occult balance can be predicted by one leg stance test as an evidenced test to measure static balance function which leading to dynamic balance function. Treadmill exercise has been proven as a dynamic balance exercise aside from cardiopulmonary exercise. As inclination and speed are the components of treadmill exercise, supposingly increase the balance function through the the act of brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF).  Brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) was one of tropic hormones produced in neuron, muscle, hematopoietic tissue characterized in neurons morphology regulation and neuroplasticity. Material and method: 20 healthy young adult men were included, divided to inclination and speed treadmill exercise groups. We observed the immediate effect of serum BDNF in blood as first blood drawn for BDNF taken before exercise and 30 minutes after exercise at the first training, second blood drawn taken before exercise and  30 minutes after exercise at the last training in 2nd  week completion of treadmill exercise. Result: Significant increased of serum BDNF value in speed group before exercise first day and before exercise last day (p=0,001), after exercise first day and after exercise last day (p=0,001). No significant increase of BDNF serum at speed group before exercise first day and after exercise first day (p=0,159), before exercise last day and after exercise last day (p=0,892). There were no significant increase BDNF serum at inclination group at all parameters (p&amp;gt;0,05). BDNF serum was an actual neurotropic factor affect not only neuronal system, but also molecular energy and metabolism regulation. BDNF serum production depend on the aerobic capacity, lactate production, muscle calcium uptake, and muscle fiber type used in exercise. Treadmill exercise with gradual speed increase the BDNF serum in blood stream that also reflect the BDNF percentage in brain. Conclusion: Treadmill exercise with gradual escalation of speed increase the BDNF serum</content>

 Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a clinical syndrome that encompasses all forms of cognitive deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease, from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Vascular dementia (VD),the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), accounts for approximately 20% of dementia patients.Ferroptosis is a recently defined iron-dependent form of cell death, which is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and other forms of cell death. Emerging evidence suggested that ferroptosis has significant implications in neurological diseases such as stroke, traumatic brain injury and AD.And  ferroptosis inhibition have obvious neuroprotective effect and ameliorate cognitive impairment in various animals models . Here,we summarizes the underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis, and reviews the close relationship between ferroptosis and VCI.</content>

 Patients who survive brain injuries may develop Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) such as Coma,  Vegetative State (VS) or Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Unfortunately, the rate of misdiagnosis between VS and MCS due to clinical judgment is high. Therefore, diagnostic decision support systems aiming to correct any differentiation between VS and MCS are essential for the characterization of an adequate treatment and an effective prognosis. In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in the new EEG computational techniques. We have reviewed how resting-state EEG is computationally analyzed to support differential diagnosis between VS and MCS in view of applicability of these methods in clinical practice. The studies available so far have used different techniques and analyses; it is therefore hard to draw general conclusions. Studies using a discriminant analysis with a combination of various factors and reporting a cut-off are among the most interesting ones for a future clinical application.</content>

 Within the wide range of neurodegenerative brain diseases, the differential diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) frequently poses a challenge. Often, signs and symptoms are not characteristic of the disease and may instead reflect atypical presentations. Consequently, the use of disease biomarkers is of importance to correctly identify the patients.. 
Here, we describe how neuropsychological characteristics, neuroimaging and neurochemical biomarkers and screening for causal gene mutations can be used to differentiate FTD from other neurodegenerative diseases as well as to distinguish between FTD subtypes. Summarizing current evidence, we propose a stepwise approach in the diagnostic evaluation.
Clinical consensus criteria that take into account a full neuropsychological examination have relatively good accuracy (sensitivity [se] 75-95%, specificity [sp] 82-95%) to diagnose FTD, although misdiagnosis (mostly AD) is common. Structural brain MRI (se 70-94%, sp 89-99%) and FDG PET (se 47-90%, sp 68-98%) or SPECT (se 36-100%, sp 41-100%) brain scans greatly increase diagnostic accuracy, showing greater involvement of frontal and anterior temporal lobes, with sparing of hippocampi and medial temporal lobes. If these results are inconclusive, we suggest detecting amyloid and tau cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that can indicate the presence of AD with good accuracy (se 74-100%, sp 82-97%). The use of P-tau181 and the Aβ1–42/ Aβ1–40 ratio significantly increases the accuracy of correctly identifying FTD vs AD. Alternatively, an amyloid brain PET scan can be performed to differentiate FTD from AD.   
When autosomal dominant inheritance is suspected, or in early onset dementia, mutation screening of causal genes is indicated and may also be offered to at-risk family members. We have summarized genotype-phenotype correlations for several genes that are known to cause familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which is the neuropathological substrate of FTD. The genes most commonly associated with this disease (C9orf72, MAPT, GRN, TBK1) are discussed, as well as some less frequent ones (CHMP2B, VCP). 
Several other techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, tau PET imaging and measuring serum neurofilament levels, show promise for future implementation as diagnostic biomarkers.</content>

 The neural interface is a critical factor in governing efficient and safe charge transfer between a stimulating electrode and biological tissue. The interface plays a crucial role in the efficacy of electric stimulation in chronic implants and both electromechanical properties and biological properties shape this.  In the case of cochlear implants, it has long been recognized that neurotrophins can stimulate growth of the target auditory nerve fibers into a favorable apposition with the electrode array, and recently such arrays have been re-purposed to enable electrotransfer (electroporation)-based neurotrophin gene augmentation to improve the ‘bionic ear’. For both this acute bionic array-directed electroporation and for chronic conventional cochlear implant arrays, the electric fields generated in target tissue during pulse delivery are central to efficacy, but are challenging to map. We present a computational model for predicting electric fields generated by array-driven DNA electrotransfer in the cochlea. The anatomically-realistic model geometry was reconstructed from magnetic resonance images of the guinea pig cochlea and an eight-channel electrode array embedded within this geometry. The model incorporates a description of both Faradaic and non-Faradaic mechanisms occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface with frequency dependency optimized to match experiment impedance spectrometry measurements. Our simulations predict that a tandem electrode configuration with four ganged cathodes and four ganged anodes produces three- to four-fold larger area in target tissue where the electric field is within the range for successful gene transfer compared to an alternate paired anode-cathode electrode configuration. These findings matched in vivo transfection efficacy of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter following array-driven electrotransfer of the reporter-encoding plasmid DNA. This confirms utility of the developed model as a tool to optimize the safety and efficacy of electroporation protocols for delivery of neurotrophin growth factors, with the ultimate aim of using gene augmentation approaches to improve the characteristics of the electrode-neural interfaces in chronically-implanted neurostimulation devices.</content>

 Brain injuries causing chronic sensory or motor deficit, such as stroke, are among the leading causes of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization; furthermore, they carry heavy social and economic burdens due to decreased quality of life and need of assistance. Given the limited effectiveness of rehabilitation, novel therapeutic strategies are required to enhance functional recovery. Since cell-based approaches have emerged as an intriguing and promising strategy to promote brain repair, many efforts have been made to study the functional integration of neurons  derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), or fetal neurons, after grafting into the damaged host tissue. 
PSCs hold great promises for their clinical applications, such as cellular replacement of damaged neural tissues with autologous neurons. They also offer the possibility to create in vitro models to assess the efficacy of drugs and therapies. Notwithstanding these potential applications, PSC-derived transplanted neurons have to match the precise sub-type, positional and functional identity of the lesioned neural tissue. Thus, the requirement of highly specific and efficient differentiation protocols of PSCs in neurons with appropriate neural  identity constitutes the main challenge limiting the clinical use of stem cells in the near future.
In this Review, we discuss the recent advances in the derivation of telencephalic (cortical and hippocampal) neurons from PSCs, assessing specificity and efficiency of the differentiation protocols, with particular emphasis on the genetic  and molecular characterization of PSC-derived neurons. Second, we address the remaining challenges for cellular replacement therapies in cortical brain injuries, focusing on electrophysiological properties, functional integration and therapeutic effects of the transplanted neurons.</content>

		<content type="html">
 An imbalance of iron metabolism with consecutive aggregation of α-synuclein and an axonal degeneration of neurons has been postulated as main pathological feature in the development of Parkinson's disease. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a new imaging technique, which enables to measure structural changes caused by defective iron deposition in parkinsonian brains. Due to its novelty, its potential for disease specific characterisation of motor and non-motor symptoms (characterizing the individual parkinsonian phenotype) as new imaging technique remains elusive. Functional network changes associated with these symptoms are however frequently described for both, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and resting state functional magnetic imaging (rs-fMRI). 
Here, we performed a systematic review of the current literature about QSM imaging, MEG and rs-fMRI in order to collect existing data about structural and functional changes caused by motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
Whereas all three techniques provide an affection in the motor domain, the understanding of network changes caused by non-motor symptoms is much more lacking for MEG and rs-fMRI, and do not yet really exist for QSM imaging. 
In order to better understand the influence of pathological iron distribution onto the functional outcome, whole brain QSM analyses should be integrated in functional analyses (especially for the non-motor domain), to enable a proper pathophysiological interpretation of MEG and rs-fMRI network changes in Parkinson's disease. Herewith, a better understanding of the relationship between neuropathological changes, functional network changes and clinical phenotype might become possible.</content>

 Obtaining a catalog of cell-types is a fundamental building block for understanding the brain. The ideal classification of cell-types is based on the profile of molecules expressed by a cell, in particular the profile of genes expressed. One strategy is therefore to obtain as many single-cell transcriptomes as possible and isolate clusters of neurons with similar gene expression profiles. In this study, we explored an alternative strategy. We explored whether cell-types can be algorithmically derived by combining protein tissue stains with transcript expression profiles on 3D space. We developed an algorithm that aims to distribute cell-types in the different layers of a column of cortical tissue of the developing rat constrained by the tissue- and cellular level data. We found that the spatial distribution of major inhibitory cell types can be approximated using the available data. The result is a mini atlas of inhibitory cell-types of the rat somatosensory cortex. In principle, any data that constrains what can occur in a particular part of the brain can also strongly constrain the derivation of cell-types. This draft inhibitory cell-type mapping is therefore dynamic and can iteratively converge towards the ground truth as further data is integrated. It is made available as a public resource and open for collaborative improvement. The approach developed should scale to the whole brain. 
Neurons are known to express particular combinations of molecules, which can be used as markers to classify different cell types (Rudy et al. 2011). However, we still lack actual numbers of each type of interneuron through the cortical depth. This is largely due to the time-consuming methods classically used, which rely on large-scale sampling and characterization of cellular composition. To overcome these challenges and to systematically describe cellular composition throughout the cortical depth, we apply a marker-fitting method that combines immunohistochemistry data with RNA transcript expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) profiles of individual cells to predict interneuron cell types. We show the layer-dependent distribution of major inhibitory cell types can be predicted in P14 rat somatosensory cortex, based on protein and transcriptome markers.</content>

 Homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are abundantly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS, respectively), and spinal cord. In addition, expression and functional responses have been reported in non-neuronal tissue. In the nervous system, α7 nAChR subunit expression appears early during embryonic development and is often transiently upregulated, but little is known about their prenatal expression outside of the nervous system.  For understanding potential short-term and long-term effects of gestational nicotine exposure, it is important to know the temporal and spatial expression of α7 nAChRs throughout the body. To that end, we studied the expression of α7 nAChR subunit mRNA using highly sensitive isotopic in situ hybridization in embryonic and neonatal whole-body mouse sections starting at gestational day 13.  The results revealed expression of α7 mRNA as early as embryonic day 13 in the PNS, including dorsal root ganglia, parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia, with the strongest expression in the superior cervical ganglion, and low to moderate levels were detected in brain and spinal cord, respectively, which rapidly increased in intensity with embryonic age. In addition, robust α7 mRNA expression was detected in the adrenal medulla, and low to moderate expression in selected peripheral tissues during embryonic development, potentially related to cells derived from the neural crest. Little or no mRNA expression was detected in thymus or spleen, sites of immune cell maturation. The results suggest that prenatal nicotine exposure could potentially affect cells in neuronal tissue with limited effects in non-neural tissues.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The molecular basis of Parkinson’s (PD) disease is currently unknown. There is increasing evidence that fat metabolism is at the crossroad of key molecular pathways associated with the pathophysiology of PD. Fatty acid desaturases catalyze synthesis of saturated fatty acids from monounsaturated fatty acids thereby mediating several cellular mechanisms that are associated with diseases including cancer and metabolic disorders. The role of desaturases in modulating age related neurodegenerative manifestations such as PD is poorly understood. Here we investigated the effect of silencing Δ9 desaturase enzyme encoding fat-5 and fat-7 genes which are known to reduce fat content, on α-synuclein expression, neuronal morphology and dopamine related behaviors in transgenic PD-like models of C. elegans. The silencing of the fat-5 and fat-7 genes rescued both degeneration of dopamine neurons and deficits in dopamine-dependent behaviors, including basal slowing and ethanol avoidance in worm models of PD. Similarly, silencing of these genes also decreased the formation of protein aggregates in a nematode model of PD expressing α-synuclein in the body wall muscles and rescued deficits in resistance to heat and osmotic stress. On the contrary, silencing of nhr-49 and tub-1 genes that are known to increase total fat content did not alter behavioral and pathological endpoints in the PD worm strains. Interestingly, the genetic manipulation of all four selected genes resulted in differential fat levels in the PD models without having significant effect on the lifespan, further indicating a complex fat homeostasis unique to neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Overall, we provide a comprehensive understanding of how Δ9 desaturase can alter PD-like pathology due to environmental exposures and proteotoxic stress, suggesting new avenues in deciphering the disease etiology and possible therapeutic targets.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background and Purpose: Ambulatory blood pressure variability (ABPV), ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) are closely associated with  white matter hyperintensities (WMH), few studies focused on establishing  effective models based on ABP, ABPV and IMT to predict the WMH burden, we aimed to evaluate the value of predictive model based on metrics of ABP, ABPV and IMT which were independently associated with the WMH burden.
Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 140 hypertensive inpatients for physical examinations in Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine between February, 2018 to January, 2019. The basic clinical information of all subjects were recorded and we also collected the metrics of  ABP, ABPV and IMT.  Patients with Fazekas scale grade ≥2 were classified into heavy burden of WMH group.  Then we analyzed the association between all characteristics and the WMH burden. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess whether metrics of ABP, ABPV and IMT were independently associated with WMH and we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to evaluate the value of predictive model based on metrics of ABP, ABPV and IMT. 
Results: Higher WMH grade was associated with increasing age, diabetes mellitus, higher TC, higher LDL, higher IMT, higher 24-hSBP, higher daytime SBP, higher nocturnal SBP, 24-h and daytime SD of SBP, and 24-h SBP weight SD; 24-h SBP, 24-h SBP-SD and IMT were independently related to the burden of WMH even after adjusting for the clinical variables; In addition, we also established a model which has a higher predictive capacity using 24-h SBP, 24-h SBP-SD and IMT in ROC analysis to assess the WMH burden in hypertensive patients.
Conclusions: Higher 24-h SBP, higher 24-h SBP-SD, and larger IMT were independently associated with greater burden of WMH among elderly Asian primary hypertension patients, establishing a model based on these factors might provide a new approach for enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis of WMH using metrics in 24-h ABPM and carotid ultrasound.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Motor skills emerge when practicing individual movements enables the motor system to extract building instructions that facilitate the generation of future diverse movements. Here we asked how practicing stereotyped movements for minutes affects motor synergies that encode human motor skills acquired over years of training. Participants trained a kinematically highly constrained combined index-finger and thumb movement. Before and after training, finger movements were evoked at rest by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Post-training, the angle between posture vectors describing TMS-evoked movements and the training movements temporarily decreased, suggesting the presence of a short-term memory for the trained movement. Principal component analysis was used to identify joint covariance patterns in TMS-evoked movements. The quality of reconstruction of training or grasping movements from linear combinations of a small subset of these TMS-derived synergies was used as an index of neural efficiency of movement generation. The reconstruction quality increased for the trained movement but remained constant for grasping movements. These findings suggest that the motor system rapidly reorganizes to enhance the coding efficiency of a difficult movement without compromising the coding efficiency of overlearned movements. Practice of individual movements may drive an unsupervised bottom-up process that ultimately shapes synergistic neuronal organization by constant competition of action memories.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 When facing threats, animals not only innately freeze or flee, but can also learn to avoid harmful situations, a behaviour known as ‘active avoidance’. A recent study by Hormigo et al. (J. Neurosci., 2019) provides new insights into the neural circuit responsible for this behaviour, placing the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) at its centre.</content>

 There are three neural feedback pathways to the primary visual cortex (V1): corticocortical, pulvinocortical, and cholinergic. What are the respective functions of these three projections? Possible functions range from contextual modulation of stimulus processing and feedback of high-level information to predictive processing (PP). How are these functions subserved by different pathways and can they be integrated into an overarching theoretical framework? We propose that corticocortical and pulvinocortical connections are involved in all three functions, whereas the role of cholinergic projections is limited by their slow response to stimuli.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;To go beyond the disconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia, directed (effective) connectivity was measured between 94 brain regions, to provide evidence on the source of the changes in schizophrenia and a mechanistic model. Effective connectivity (EC) was measured in 180 participants with schizophrenia and 208 controls. For the significantly different effective connectivities in schizophrenia, on average the forward (stronger) effective connectivities were smaller, whereas the backward connectivities tended to be larger. Further, higher EC in schizophrenia was found from the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to areas such as the parahippocampal, hippocampal, temporal, fusiform, and occipital cortices. These are backward effective connectivities and were positively correlated with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower effective connectivities were found from temporal and other regions and were negatively correlated with the symptoms, especially the negative and general symptoms. Further, a signal variance parameter was increased for areas that included the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, consistent with the hypothesis that hippocampal overactivity is involved in schizophrenia. This investigation goes beyond the disconnectivity hypothesis by drawing attention to differences in schizophrenia between backprojections and forward connections, with the backward connections from the precuneus and PCC implicated in memory stronger in schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The striatum has long been associated with cognitive functions, but the mechanisms behind this are still unclear. Here we tested a new hypothesis that the striatum contributes to executive function (EF) by strengthening cortico-cortical connections. Striatal connectivity was evaluated by measuring the resting-state functional connectivity between ventral and dorsal striatum in 570 individuals, aged 3–20 years. Using structural equation modeling, we found that inter-individual differences in striatal connectivity had an indirect effect (via fronto-parietal functional connectivity) and a direct effect on a compound EF measure of working memory, inhibition, and set-shifting/flexibility. The effect of fronto-parietal connectivity on cognition did not depend on age: the influence was as strong in older as younger children. In contrast, striatal connectivity was closely related to changes in cognitive ability during childhood development, suggesting a specific role of the striatum in cognitive plasticity. These results support a new principle for striatal functioning, according to which striatum promotes cognitive development by strengthening of cortico-cortical connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Lorna A Farrelly, Ian Maze&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last two decades have witnessed explosive advances in our understanding as to how the organization of chromatin, the association of DNA with histones and vast numbers of non-histone regulatory proteins, controls the expression of specific genes in brain. Prominent among such regulatory mechanisms are modifications of histones, along with the ‘writers,’ ‘erasers,’ and ‘readers’ of these modifications. Much of the work delineating these mechanisms has contributed to the idea that a ‘histone code’ may be a central determinant of a gene’s activity and its potential to be activated or repressed in response to environmental perturbations (both beneficial and aberrant). Indeed, increasing evidence has demonstrated the significance of histone regulation in neurological plasticity and disease, although we are still at the earliest stages of examining all of the many potential chromatin changes involved. In this short review, we provide an emerging perspective on putative roles for histones, and their combinatorial readouts, in the context of neural plasticity, and we provide a conceptual framework for future mechanistic studies aimed at uncovering causal links between the neural ‘histone code’ and brain function/disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objectives: To test the hypothesis that there are differences in neuroradiological measures between single and repeated mild TBI using multimodal MRI.
Methods: A closed-head momentum exchange model was used to produce one or three mild head injuries in young adult male rats as compared to non-injured, age and weight-matched controls. Six-seven weeks post-injury, rats were studied for deficits in cognitive and motor function.  Seven-eight weeks post-injury changes in brain anatomy and function were evaluated through analysis of high resolution T2 weighted images, resting state BOLD functional connectivity, and diffusion weighted imaging with quantitative anisotropy. 
Results: Head injuries occurred without skull fracture or signs of intracranial bleeding or contusion. There were no significant differences in cognitive or motors behaviors between experimental groups. With a single mild hit, the affected areas were limited to the caudate/putamen and central amygdala.  Rats hit three times showed altered diffusivity in white matter tracts, basal ganglia, central amygdala, brainstem, and cerebellum.  Comparing three hits to one hit showed a similar pattern of change underscoring a dose effect of repeated head injury on the brainstem and cerebellum.  Disruption of functional connectivity was pronounced with three mild hits. The midbrain dopamine system, hippocampus, and brainstem/cerebellum showed hypoconnectivity. Interestingly, rats exposed to one hit showed enhanced functional connectivity (or hyperconnectivity) across brain sites, particularly between the olfactory system and the cerebellum.
Interpretation: Neuroradiological evidence of altered brain structure and function, particularly in striatal and midbrain dopaminergic areas, persists long after mild repetitive head injury. These changes may serve as biomarkers of neurodegeneration and risk for dementia later in life.</content>

 Background: Early identification and treatment of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) improves outcomes, but specific evidence needed to individualize treatment recommendations is lacking. Biomarkers that could be routinely measured within the clinical setting could potentially transform clinical care for patients with ASD. This demonstration project employed collection of biomarker data during regular autism specialty clinical visits and explored the relationship of biomarkers with clinical ASD symptoms. 
Methods: Eighty-three children with ASD, aged 5-10 years, completed a multi-site feasibility study integrating the collection of biochemical (blood serotonin, urine melatonin sulfate excretion) and clinical (head circumference, dysmorphology exam, digit ratio, cognitive and behavioral function) biomarkers during routine ASD clinic visits. Parents completed a demographic survey and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community. Cognitive function was determined by record review. Data analysis utilized Wilcoxon two-sample tests and Spearman correlations.
Results: Participants were 82% male, 63% White, 19% Hispanic, with a broad range of functioning. Group means indicated hyperserotonemia. In a single regression analysis adjusting for race and median household income, higher income was associated with higher levels of blood serotonin and urine melatonin sulfate excretion levels (p=.004 and p=.04, respectively). Melatonin correlated negatively with age (p= 0.048) and reported neurologic problems (p=0.02). Dysmorphic status correlated with higher reported stereotyped behavior (p=0.02) and inappropriate speech (p=0.04).
Conclusions: This demonstration project employed collection of multiple biomarkers, allowed for examination of associations between biochemical and clinical measures, and identified several findings that suggest direction for future studies. This clinical research model has promise for integrative biomarker research in individuals with complex, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.</content>

 Almost 50 million people in the world are affected by dementia; the most prevalent form of which is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although aging is considered to be the main risk factor for AD, growing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) increases the risk of dementia including AD. Defective brain insulin signaling has been suggested as an early event  in AD and other tauopathies but the mechanisms that link these diseases are largely unknown. Tau hyperphosphorylation is a hallmark of neurofibrillary pathology and insulin resistance increases the number of neuritic plaques particularly in AD. Utilizing a combination of our Drosophila models of tauopathy (expressing the 2N4R-Tau) and neuroblastoma cells, we have attempted to decipher the pathways downstream of the insulin signaling cascade that lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation and autophagic defects. Using cell-based, genetic and biochemical approaches we have demonstrated that tau phosphorylation at AT8 and PHF1 residues is enhanced in an insulin-resistant environment. We also show that insulin-induced changes in total and phospho-tau are mediated by the crosstalk of AKT, GSK-3β and ERK located downstream of the insulin receptor pathway. Finally, we demonstrate a significant change in the levels of the key proteins in the mTOR/autophagy pathway, implying an increased impairment of aggregated protein clearance in our transgenic Drosophila models and cultured neuroblastoma cells.</content>

 Despite advances in the field of dynamic connectivity, fixed sliding window approaches for the detection of fluctuations in functional connectivity are still widely used. The use of conventional connectivity metrics in conjunction with a fixed sliding window comes with the arbitrariness of the chosen window lengths. In this paper we use multivariate autoregressive and neural mass models with a-priori defined ground truths to systematically analyse the sensitivity of conventional metrics in combination with different window lengths to detect genuine fluctuations in connectivity for various underlying state durations. Metrics of interest are the coherence, imaginary coherence, phase lag index, phase locking value and the amplitude envelope correlation. We performed analysis for two nodes and at the network level. We demonstrate that these metrics show indeed higher variability for genuine temporal fluctuations in connectivity compared to a static connectivity state superimposed by noise. Overall, the error of the connectivity estimates themselves decreases for longer state durations (order of seconds). The reverse was true for the correlations of the connectivity fluctuations with the ground truth. In general, metrics, in combination with a sliding window, perform poorly for very short state durations. Increasing the SNR of the system only leads to a moderate improvement. A window length that matches the temporal duration of the underlying states usually leads to the highest correlation with the ground truth. This also indicates that a mismatch between underlying state duration and window length could lead to an underestimation of functional connectivity. In addition, at the network level, only longer window widths were sufficient to detect plausible resting state networks that matched the underlying ground truth, especially for the phase locking value, amplitude envelope correlation and coherence. We conclude that fixed sliding window approaches for connectivity can detect modulations of connectivity, but mostly if the underlying dynamics operate on moderate to slow timescales. In practice, this can be a drawback, as state durations can vary significantly in empirical data.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00792"/>

 Background &amp;amp; Purpose: The potential for adaptive plasticity in the post-stroke brain is difficult to estimate, as is the demonstration of central nervous system (CNS) target engagement of drugs that show promise in facilitating stroke recovery. We set out to determine if paired associative stimulation (PAS) can be used a) as an assay of CNS plasticity in patients with chronic stroke, and b) to demonstrate CNS engagement by memantine, a drug which has potential plasticity-modulating effects for use in motor recovery following stroke. 

Methods: We examined the effect of PAS in fourteen participants with chronic hemiparetic stroke at five time-points in a within-subjects repeated measures design study: baseline off-drug, and following a week of orally administered memantine at doses of 5, 10, 15, and 20mg, comprising a total of seventy sessions. Each week, MEP amplitude pre and post-PAS was assessed in the contralesional hemisphere as a marker of enhanced or diminished plasticity. Strength and dexterity were recorded each week to monitor motor-specific clinical status across the study period. 

Results: We found that MEP amplitude was significantly larger after PAS in baseline sessions off-drug, and responsiveness to PAS in these sessions was associated with increased clinical severity. There was no observed increase in MEP amplitude after PAS with memantine at any dose. Motor threshold, strength, and dexterity remained unchanged during the study.

Conclusions: PAS successfully induced corticospinal excitability enhancement in chronic stroke subjects at the group level. However, this response did not occur in all participants, and was associated with increased clinical severity. This could be an important way to stratify patients for future PAS-drug studies. PAS was suppressed by memantine at all doses, regardless of responsiveness to PAS off-drug, indicating CNS engagement.</content>

 Many cognitive, sensory and motor processes have correlates in oscillatory neural source activity, which is embedded as a subspace in the recorded brain signals. Decoding such processes from noisy magnetoencephalogram/electroencephalogram (M/EEG) signals usually requires data-driven analysis methods. The objective evaluation of such decoding algorithms on experimental raw signals, however, is a challenge: the amount of available M/EEG data typically is limited, labels can be unreliable, and raw signals often are contaminated with artifacts. To overcome some of these problems, simulation frameworks have been introduced which support the development of data-driven decoding algorithms and their benchmarking. For generating artificial brain signals, however, most of the existing frameworks make strong and partially unrealistic assumptions about brain activity. This limits the generalization of results observed in the simulation to real-world scenarios.

In the present contribution, we show how to overcome several shortcomings of existing simulation frameworks. We propose a versatile alternative, which allows for an objective evaluation and benchmarking of novel decoding algorithms using real neural signals. It allows to generate comparatively large datasets with labels being deterministically recoverable from the arbitrary M/EEG recordings.
A novel idea to generate these labels is central to this framework: we determine a subspace of the true M/EEG recordings and utilize it to derive novel labels. These labels contain realistic information about the oscillatory activity of some underlying neural sources. For two categories of subspace-defining methods, we showcase how such labels can be obtained---either by an exclusively data-driven approach  (independent component analysis---ICA), or by a method exploiting additional anatomical constraints (minimum norm estimates---MNE). We term our framework \textit{post-hoc labeling} of M/EEG recordings.
To support the adoption of the framework by practitioners, we have exemplified its use by benchmarking three standard decoding methods---i.e., common spatial patterns (CSP),  source power-comodulation (SPoC), and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)---wrt. Varied dataset sizes, label noise, and label variability. Source code and data are made available to the reader for facilitating the application of our post-hoc labeling framework.</content>

 The nature of abstract and concrete semantics and differences between them have remained a debated issue in psycholinguistic and cognitive studies for decades. Most of the available behavioral and neuroimaging studies reveal distinctions between these two types of semantics, typically associated with a so-called “concreteness effect”. Many attempts have been made to explain these differences using various approaches, from purely theoretical linguistic and cognitive frameworks to neuroimaging experiments. In this brief overview, we will try to provide a snapshot of these diverse views and relationships between them and highlight the crucial issues preventing this problem from being solved. We will argue that one potentially beneficial way forward is to identify the neural mechanisms underpinning acquisition of the different types of semantics (e.g., by using neurostimulation techniques to establish causal relationships), which may help explain the distinctions found between the processing of concrete and abstract semantics.</content>
