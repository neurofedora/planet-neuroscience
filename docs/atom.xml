Spatial organization is a characteristic of all cells, achieved in eukaryotic cells by utilizing both membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles. One of the key processes in eukaryotes is RNA splicing, which readies mRNA for translation. This complex and highly dynamical chemical process involves assembly and disassembly of many molecules in multiple cellular compartments and their transport among compartments. Our goal is to model the effect of spatial organization of membrane-less organelles (specifically nuclear speckles) and of organelle heterogeneity on splicing particle biogenesis in mammalian cells. Based on multiple sources of complementary experimental data, we constructed a spatial model of a HeLa cell to capture intracellular crowding effects. We then developed chemical reaction networks to describe the formation of RNA splicing machinery complexes and splicing processes within nuclear speckles (specific type of non-membrane-bound organelles). We incorporated these networks into our spatially-resolved human cell model and performed stochastic simulations for up to 15 minutes of biological time, the longest thus far for a eukaryotic cell. We find that an increase (decrease) in the number of nuclear pore complexes increases (decreases) the number of assembled splicing particles; and that compartmentalization is critical for the yield of correctly-assembled particles. We also show that a slight increase of splicing particle localization into nuclear speckles leads to a disproportionate enhancement of mRNA splicing and a reduction in the noise of generated mRNA. Our model also predicts that the distance between genes and speckles has a considerable effect on the mRNA production rate, with genes located closer to speckles producing mRNA at higher levels, emphasizing the importance of genome organization around speckles. The HeLa cell model, including organelles and sub-compartments, provides a flexible foundation to study other cellular processes that are strongly modulated by spatiotemporal heterogeneity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/svCIRJkhwKU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The role of individual case characteristics, such as symptoms or demographics, in norovirus transmissibility is poorly understood. Six nursing home norovirus outbreaks occurring in South Carolina, U.S. from 2014 to 2016 were examined. We aimed to quantify the contribution of symptoms and other case characteristics in norovirus transmission using the reproduction number (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ei&lt;/sub&gt;) as an estimate of individual case infectivity and to examine how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. Individual estimates of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ei&lt;/sub&gt; were calculated using a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the average number of secondary cases generated by each case. The associations between case characteristics and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ei&lt;/sub&gt; were estimated using a weighted multivariate mixed linear model. Outbreaks began with one to three index case(s) with large estimated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ei&lt;/sub&gt;’s (range: 1.48 to 8.70) relative to subsequent cases. Of the 209 cases, 155 (75%) vomited, 164 (79%) had diarrhea, and 158 (76%) were nursing home residents (vs. staff). Cases who vomited infected 2.12 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.68) times the number of individuals as non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.39 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.87) times the number of individuals as cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.53 (95% CI: 1.15, 2.02) times the number of individuals as staff-cases. Index cases tended to be residents (vs. staff) who vomited and infected considerably more secondary cases compared to non-index cases. Results suggest that individuals, particularly residents, who vomit are more infectious and tend to drive norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home norovirus outbreaks. While diarrhea also plays a role in norovirus transmission, it is to a lesser degree than vomiting in these settings. Results lend support for prevention and control measures that focus on cases who vomit, particularly if those cases are residents.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AJrYSDocqZk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The multitude of neuronal subtypes and extensive interconnectivity of the mammalian brain presents a substantial challenge to those seeking to decipher its functions. While the molecular mechanisms of several neuronal functions remain poorly characterized, advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and gene-editing technology have begun to close this gap. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas) system has emerged as a powerful genetic tool capable of manipulating the genome of essentially any organism and cell type. This technology has advanced our understanding of complex neurologic diseases by enabling the rapid generation of novel, disease-relevant &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and transgenic animal models. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the rapidly accelerating field of CRISPR-mediated genome engineering. We begin with an overview of the canonical function of the CRISPR platform, followed by a functional review of its many adaptations, with an emphasis on its applications for genetic interrogation of the normal and diseased nervous system. Additionally, we discuss limitations of the CRISPR editing system and suggest how future modifications to existing platforms may advance our understanding of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in cortical networks are coupled by gap junctions, forming a syncytium that supports propagating epileptiform discharges, induced by 4-aminopyridine. It remains unclear, however, whether these propagating events occur under more natural states, without pharmacological blockade. In particular, we investigated whether propagation also happens when extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rises, as is known to occur following intense network activity, such as during seizures. We examined how increasing [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; affects the likelihood of propagating activity away from a site of focal (200–400 μm) optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Activity was recorded using a linear 16-electrode array placed along layer V of primary visual cortex. At baseline levels of [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; (3.5 mm), induced activity was recorded only within the illuminated area. However, when [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; was increased above a threshold level (50th percentile = 8.0 mm; interquartile range = 7.5–9.5 mm), time-locked, fast-spiking unit activity, indicative of parvalbumin-expressing interneuron firing, was also recorded outside the illuminated area, propagating at 59.1 mm/s. The propagating unit activity was unaffected by blockade of GABAergic synaptic transmission, but it was modulated by glutamatergic blockers, and was reduced, and in most cases prevented altogether, by pharmacological blockade of gap junctions, achieved by any of the following three different drugs: quinine, mefloquine, or carbenoxolone. Washout of quinine rapidly re-established the pattern of propagating activity. Computer simulations show qualitative differences between propagating discharges in high [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and 4-aminopyridine, arising from differences in the electrotonic effects of these two manipulations. These interneuronal syncytial interactions are likely to affect the complex electrographic dynamics of seizures, once [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is raised above this threshold level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Oligophrenin-1 (Ophn1) encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein whose mutations cause X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) in humans. Loss of function of Ophn1 leads to impairments in the maturation and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, causing deficits in synaptic structure, function and plasticity. Epilepsy is a frequent comorbidity in patients with Ophn1-dependent XLID, but the cellular bases of hyperexcitability are poorly understood. Here we report that male mice knock-out (KO) for Ophn1 display hippocampal epileptiform alterations, which are associated with changes in parvalbumin-, somatostatin- and neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons. Because loss of function of Ophn1 is related to enhanced activity of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and protein kinase A (PKA), we attempted to rescue Ophn1-dependent pathological phenotypes by treatment with the ROCK/PKA inhibitor fasudil. While acute administration of fasudil had no impact on seizure activity, seven weeks of treatment in adulthood were able to correct electrographic, neuroanatomical and synaptic alterations of Ophn1 deficient mice. These data demonstrate that hyperexcitability and the associated changes in GABAergic markers can be rescued at the adult stage in Ophn1-dependent XLID through ROCK/PKA inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study we demonstrate enhanced seizure propensity and impairments in hippocampal GABAergic circuitry in Ophn1 mouse model of X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Importantly, the enhanced susceptibility to seizures, accompanied by an alteration of GABAergic markers were rescued by Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK)/protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor fasudil, a drug already tested on humans. Because seizures can significantly impact the quality of life of XLID patients, the present data suggest a potential therapeutic pathway to correct alterations in GABAergic networks and dampen pathological hyperexcitability in adults with XLID.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recurrent seizures, which define epilepsy, are transient abnormalities in the electrical activity of the brain. The mechanistic basis of seizure initiation, and the contribution of defined neuronal subtypes to seizure pathophysiology, remains poorly understood. We performed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium imaging in neocortex during temperature-induced seizures in male and female Dravet syndrome (&lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;+/–) mice, a neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent temperature-sensitive epilepsy. Mean activity of both putative principal cells and parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) was higher in &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;+/– relative to wild-type controls during quiet wakefulness at baseline and at elevated core body temperature. However, wild-type PV-INs showed a progressive synchronization in response to temperature elevation that was absent in PV-INs from &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;+/– mice. Hence, PV-IN activity remains intact interictally in &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;+/– mice, yet exhibits decreased synchrony immediately before seizure onset. We suggest that impaired PV-IN synchronization may contribute to the transition to the ictal state during temperature-induced seizures in Dravet syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder defined by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. However, basic mechanisms of seizure initiation and propagation remain poorly understood. We performed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium imaging in an experimental model of Dravet syndrome (&lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;+/– mice)—a severe neurodevelopmental disorder defined by temperature-sensitive, treatment-resistant epilepsy—and record activity of putative excitatory neurons and parvalbumin-positive GABAergic neocortical interneurons (PV-INs) during naturalistic seizures induced by increased core body temperature. PV-IN activity was higher in &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;+/– relative to wild-type controls during quiet wakefulness. However, wild-type PV-INs showed progressive synchronization in response to temperature elevation that was absent in PV-INs from &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt;+/– mice before seizure onset.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;During binocular viewing, visual inputs from the two eyes interact at the level of visual cortex. Here we studied binocular interactions in human visual cortex, including both sexes, using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials over a wide range of relative contrast between two eyes. The ROIs included areas V1, V3a, hV4, hMT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and lateral occipital cortex. Dichoptic parallel grating stimuli in each eye modulated at distinct temporal frequencies allowed us to quantify spectral components associated with the individual stimuli from monocular inputs (self-terms) and responses due to interaction between the inputs from the two eyes (intermodulation [IM] terms). Data with self-terms revealed an interocular suppression effect, in which the responses to the stimulus in one eye were reduced when a stimulus was presented simultaneously to the other eye. The suppression magnitude varied depending on visual area, and the relative contrast between the two eyes. Suppression was strongest in V1 and V3a (50% reduction) and was least in lateral occipital cortex (20% reduction). Data with IM terms revealed another form of binocular interaction, compared with self-terms. IM response was strongest at V1 and was least in hV4. Fits of a family of divisive gain control models to both self- and IM-term responses within each cortical area indicated that both forms of binocular interaction shared a common gain control nonlinearity. However, our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interaction along the cortical hierarchy, particularly in terms of excitatory and suppressive contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials and frequency-domain analysis of dichoptic stimuli, we measured two forms of binocular interactions: one is associated with the individual stimuli that represent interocular suppression from each eye, and the other is a direct measure of interocular interaction between inputs from the two eyes. We demonstrated that both forms of binocular interactions share a common gain control mechanism in striate and extra-striate cortex. Furthermore, our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interaction along the visual cortical hierarchy, particularly in terms of excitatory and suppressive contributions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Microinjections of a glutamate AMPA antagonist (DNQX) in medial shell of nucleus accumbens (NAc) can cause either intense appetitive motivation (i.e., 'desire') or intense defensive motivation (i.e., 'dread'), depending on site along a flexible rostrocaudal gradient and on environmental ambience. DNQX, by blocking excitatory AMPA glutamate inputs, is hypothesized to produce relative inhibitions of NAc neurons. However, given potential alternative explanations, it is not known whether neuronal inhibition is in fact necessary for NAc DNQX microinjections to generate motivations. Here we provide a direct test of whether local neuronal inhibition in NAc is necessary for DNQX microinjections to produce either desire or dread. We used optogenetic channelrhodopsin (ChR2) excitations at the same local sites in NAc as DNQX microinjections to oppose relative neuronal inhibitions induced by DNQX in female and male rats. We found that same-site ChR2 excitation effectively reversed the ability of NAc DNQX microinjections to generate appetitive motivation, and similarly reversed ability of DNQX microinjections to generate defensive motivation. Same-site NAc optogenetic excitations also attenuated recruitment of Fos expression in other limbic structures throughout the brain, which was otherwise elevated by NAc DNQX microinjections that generated motivation. However, to successfully reverse motivation generation, an optic fiber tip for ChR2 illumination needed to be located within &amp;lt;1 mm of the corresponding DNQX microinjector tip; that is, both truly at the same NAc site. Thus, we confirm that localized NAc neuronal inhibition is required for AMPA-blocking microinjections in medial shell to induce either positively-valenced 'desire' or negatively-valenced 'dread'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A major hypothesis posits neuronal inhibitions in nucleus accumbens generate intense motivation. Microinjections in nucleus accumbens of glutamate antagonist, DNQX, which might suppress local neuronal firing, generate either appetitive or defensive motivation, depending on site and environmental factors. Is neuronal inhibition in nucleus accumbens required for such pharmacologically-induced motivations? Here we demonstrate that neuronal inhibition is necessary to generate appetitive or defensive motivations, using local optogenetic excitations to oppose putative DNQX-induced inhibitions. We show that excitation at the same site prevents DNQX microinjections from recruiting downstream limbic structures into neurobiological activation, and simultaneously prevents generation of either appetitive or defensive motivated behaviors. These results may be relevant to roles of nucleus accumbens mechanisms in pathological motivations, including addiction and paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A recent proposal posits that humans might use the same neuronal machinery to support the representation of both spatial and nonspatial information, organizing concepts and memories using spatial codes. This view predicts that the same neuronal coding schemes characterizing navigation in the physical space (tuned to distance and direction) should underlie navigation of abstract semantic spaces, even if they are categorical and labeled by symbols. We constructed an artificial semantic environment by parsing a bidimensional audiovisual object space into four labeled categories. Before and after a nonspatial symbolic categorization training, 25 adults (15 females) were presented with pseudorandom sequences of objects and words during a functional MRI session. We reasoned that subsequent presentations of stimuli (either objects or words) referring to different categories implied implicit movements in the novel semantic space, and that such movements subtended specific distances and directions. Using whole-brain fMRI adaptation and searchlight model-based representational similarity analysis, we found evidence of both distance-based and direction-based responses in brain regions typically involved in spatial navigation: the medial prefrontal cortex and the right entorhinal cortex (EHC). After training, both regions encoded the distances between concepts, making it possible to recover a faithful bidimensional representation of the semantic space directly from their multivariate activity patterns, whereas the right EHC also exhibited a periodic modulation as a function of traveled direction. Our results indicate that the brain regions and coding schemes supporting relations and movements between spatial locations in mammals are &quot;recycled&quot; in humans to represent a bidimensional multisensory conceptual space during a symbolic categorization task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The hippocampal formation and the medial prefrontal cortex of mammals represent the surrounding physical space by encoding distances and directions between locations. Recent works suggested that humans use the same neural machinery to organize their memories as points of an internal map of experiences. We asked whether the same brain regions and neural codes supporting spatial navigation are recruited when humans use language to organize their knowledge of the world in categorical semantic representations. Using fMRI, we show that the medial prefrontal cortex and the entorhinal portion of the hippocampal formation represent the distances and the movement directions between concepts of a novel audiovisual semantic space, and that it was possible to reconstruct, from neural data, their relationships in memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Covert spatial attention has long been thought to speed visual processing. Psychophysics studies have shown that target information accrues faster at attended locations than at unattended locations. However, with behavioral evidence alone, it is difficult to determine whether attention speeds visual processing of the target or subsequent postperceptual stages of processing (e.g., converting sensory responses into decision signals). Moreover, although many studies have shown that attention can boost the &lt;i&gt;amplitude&lt;/i&gt; of visually evoked neural responses, no robust effect has been observed on the &lt;i&gt;latency&lt;/i&gt; of those neural responses. Here, we offer new evidence that may reconcile the neural and behavioral findings. We examined whether covert attention influenced the latency of the N2pc component, an electrophysiological marker of visual selection that has been linked with object individuation—the formation of an object representation that is distinct from the background and from other objects in the scene. To this end, we manipulated whether or not human observers (male and female) covertly attended the location of an impending search target. We found that the target evoked N2pc onset ~20 ms earlier when the target location was cued than when it was not cued. In a second experiment, we provided a direct replication of this effect, confirming that the effect of attention on N2pc latency is robust. Thus, although attention may not speed the earliest stages of sensory processing, attention does speed the critical transition between raw sensory encoding and the formation of individuated object representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Covert spatial attention improves processing at attended locations. Past behavioral studies have shown that information about visual targets accrues faster at attended than at unattended locations. However, it has remained unclear whether attention speeds perceptual analysis or subsequent postperceptual stages of processing. Here, we present robust evidence that attention speeds the N2pc, an electrophysiological signal that indexes the formation of individuated object representations. Our findings show that attention speeds a relatively early stage of perceptual processing while also elucidating the specific perceptual process that is speeded.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Representational Neural Mapping of Dexterous Grasping Before Lifting in Humans</title>
		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/13/2708?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The ability of humans to reach and grasp objects in their environment has been the mainstay paradigm for characterizing the neural circuitry driving object-centric actions. Although much is known about hand shaping, a persistent question is how the brain orchestrates and integrates the grasp with lift forces of the fingers in a coordinated manner. The objective of the current study was to investigate how the brain represents grasp configuration and lift force during a dexterous object-centric action in a large sample of male and female human subjects. BOLD activity was measured as subjects used a precision-grasp to lift an object with a center of mass (CoM) on the left or right with the goal of minimizing tilting the object. The extent to which grasp configuration and lift force varied between left and right CoM conditions was manipulated by grasping the object collinearly (requiring a non-collinear force distribution) or non-collinearly (requiring more symmetrical forces). Bayesian variational representational similarity analyses on fMRI data assessed the evidence that a set of cortical and cerebellar regions were sensitive to grasp configuration or lift force differences between CoM conditions at differing time points during a grasp to lift action. In doing so, we reveal strong evidence that grasping and lift force are not represented by spatially separate functionally specialized regions, but by the same regions at differing time points. The coordinated grasp to lift effort is shown to be under dorsolateral (PMv and AIP) more than dorsomedial control, and under SPL7, somatosensory PSC, ventral LOC and cerebellar control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Clumsy disasters such as spilling, dropping, and crushing during our daily interactions with objects are a rarity rather than the norm. These disasters are avoided in part as a result of our orchestrated anticipatory efforts to integrate and coordinate grasping and lifting of object interactions, all before the lift of an object even commences. How the brain orchestrates this integration process has been largely neglected by historical approaches independently and solely focusing on reaching and grasping and the neural principles that guide them. Here, we test the extent to which grasping and lifting are represented in a spatially or temporally distinct manner and identified strong evidence for the consecutive emergence of sensitivity to grasping, then lifting within the same region.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/13/2695?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Nonmuscle myosin II inhibition (NMIIi) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but not dorsal hippocampus (CA1), selectively disrupts memories associated with methamphetamine (METH) days after learning, without retrieval. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective vulnerability remain poorly understood. A known function of NMII is to transiently activate synaptic actin dynamics with learning. Therefore, we hypothesized that METH-associated learning perpetuates NMII-driven actin dynamics in synapses, leading to an extended window of vulnerability for memory disruption. We used time-lapse two-photon imaging of dendritic spine motility in acutely prepared brain slices from female and male mice following METH-associated learning as a readout of actin–myosin dynamics. Spine motility was persistently increased in the BLA, but not in CA1. Consistent with the memory disrupting effect of intra-BLA NMII inhibition, METH-induced changes to BLA spine dynamics were reversed by a single systemic injection of an NMII inhibitor. Intra-CA1 NMII inhibition, on the other hand, did not disrupt METH-associated memory. Thus, we report identification of a previously unknown ability for spine actin dynamics to persist days after stimulation and that this is under the control of NMII. Further, these perpetual NMII-driven spine actin dynamics in BLA neurons may contribute to the unique susceptibility of METH-associated memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; There are no Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapies to prevent relapse to the use of stimulants, such as methamphetamine (METH). Environmental cues become associated with drug use, such that the memories can elicit strong motivation to seek the drug during abstinence. We previously reported that the storage of METH-associated memories is uniquely vulnerable to immediate, retrieval-independent, and lasting disruption by direct actin depolymerization or by inhibiting the actin driver nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) in the BLA or systemically. Here we report a potential structural mechanism responsible for the unique vulnerability of METH-associated memories and METH-seeking behavior to NMII inhibition within the BLA.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The spinal cord can appropriately generate diverse movements, even without brain input and movement-related sensory feedback, using a combination of multifunctional and behaviorally specialized interneurons. The adult turtle spinal cord can generate motor patterns underlying forward swimming, three forms of scratching, and limb withdrawal (flexion reflex). We previously described turtle spinal interneurons activated during both scratching and swimming (multifunctional interneurons), interneurons activated during scratching but not swimming (scratch-specialized interneurons), and interneurons activated during flexion reflex but not scratching or swimming (flexion reflex-selective interneurons). How multifunctional and behaviorally specialized turtle spinal interneurons affect downstream neurons was unknown. Here, we recorded intracellularly from spinal interneurons activated during these motor patterns in turtles of both sexes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and filled each with dyes. We labeled motoneurons using choline acetyltransferase antibodies or earlier intraperitoneal FluoroGold injection and used immunocytochemistry of interneuron axon terminals to identify their neurotransmitter(s) and putative synaptic contacts with motoneurons. We found that multifunctional interneurons are heterogeneous with respect to neurotransmitter, with some glutamatergic and others GABAergic or glycinergic, and can directly contact motoneurons. Also, scratch-specialized interneurons are heterogeneous with respect to neurotransmitter and some directly contact motoneurons. Thus, scratch-specialized interneurons might directly excite motoneurons that are more strongly activated during scratching than forward swimming, such as hip-flexor motoneurons. Finally, and surprisingly, we found that some motoneurons are behaviorally specialized, for scratching or flexion reflex. Thus, either some limb muscles are only used for a subset of limb behaviors or some limb motoneurons are only recruited during certain limb behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Both multifunctional and behaviorally specialized spinal cord interneurons have been described in turtles, but their outputs are unknown. We studied responses of multifunctional interneurons (activated during swimming and scratching) and scratch-specialized interneurons, filled each with dyes, and used immunocytochemistry to determine their neurotransmitters and contacts with motoneurons. We found that both multifunctional and scratch-specialized interneurons are heterogeneous with respect to neurotransmitter, with some excitatory and others inhibitory. We found that some multifunctional and some scratch-specialized interneurons directly contact motoneurons. Scratch-specialized interneurons may excite motoneurons that are more strongly activated during scratching than swimming, such as hip-flexor motoneurons, or inhibit their antagonists, hip-extensor motoneurons. Surprisingly, we also found that some motoneurons are behaviorally specialized, for scratching or for flexion reflex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Thalamocortical posterior nucleus (Po) axons innervating the vibrissal somatosensory (S1) and motor (MC) cortices are key links in the brain neuronal network that allows rodents to explore the environment whisking with their motile snout vibrissae. Here, using fine-scale high-end 3D electron microscopy, we demonstrate in adult male C57BL/6 wild-type mice marked differences between MC versus S1 Po synapses in (1) bouton and active zone size, (2) neurotransmitter vesicle pool size, (3) distribution of mitochondria around synapses, and (4) proportion of synapses established on dendritic spines and dendritic shafts. These differences are as large, or even more pronounced, than those between Po and ventro-posterior thalamic nucleus synapses in S1. Moreover, using single-axon transfection labeling, we demonstrate that the above differences actually occur on the MC versus the S1 branches of individual Po cell axons that innervate both areas. Along with recently-discovered divergences in efficacy and plasticity, the synaptic structure differences reported here thus reveal a new subcellular level of complexity. This is a finding that upends current models of thalamocortical circuitry, and that might as well illuminate the functional logic of other branched projection axon systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many long-distance brain connections depend on neurons whose branched axons target separate regions. Using 3D electron microscopy and single-cell transfection, we investigated the mouse Posterior thalamic nucleus (Po) cell axons that simultaneously innervate motor and sensory areas of the cerebral cortex involved in whisker movement control. We demonstrate significant differences in the size of the boutons made in each area by individual Po axons, as well as in functionally-relevant parameters in the composition of their synapses. In addition, we found similarly large differences between the synapses of Po versus ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus axons in the whisker sensory cortex. Area-specific synapse structure in individual axons implies a new, unsuspected level of complexity in long-distance brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional coactivator is negatively regulated by the Hippo pathway and functions in controlling the size of multiple organs, such as liver during development. However, it is not clear whether YAP signaling participates in the process of the formation of glia scars after spinal cord injury (SCI). In this study, we found that YAP was upregulated and activated in astrocytes of C57BL/6 male mice after SCI in a Hippo pathway-dependent manner. Conditional knockout (KO) of &lt;i&gt;yap&lt;/i&gt; in astrocytes significantly inhibited astrocytic proliferation, impaired the formation of glial scars, inhibited the axonal regeneration, and impaired the behavioral recovery of C57BL/6 male mice after SCI. Mechanistically, the bFGF was upregulated after SCI and induced the activation of YAP through RhoA pathways, thereby promoting the formation of glial scars. Additionally, YAP promoted bFGF-induced proliferation by negatively controlling nuclear distribution of p27&lt;sup&gt;Kip1&lt;/sup&gt; mediated by CRM1. Finally, bFGF or XMU-MP-1 (an inhibitor of Hippo kinase MST1/2 to activate YAP) injection indeed activated YAP signaling and promoted the formation of glial scars and the functional recovery of mice after SCI. These findings suggest that YAP promotes the formation of glial scars and neural regeneration of mice after SCI, and that the bFGF-RhoA-YAP-p27&lt;sup&gt;Kip1&lt;/sup&gt; pathway positively regulates astrocytic proliferation after SCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glial scars play critical roles in neuronal regeneration of CNS injury diseases, such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we provide evidence for the function of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in the formation of glial scars after SCI through regulation of astrocyte proliferation. As a downstream of bFGF (which is upregulated after SCI), YAP promotes the proliferation of astrocytes through negatively controlling nuclear distribution of p27&lt;sup&gt;Kip1&lt;/sup&gt; mediated by CRM1. Activation of YAP by bFGF or XMU-MP-1 injection promotes the formation of glial scar and the functional recovery of mice after SCI. These results suggest that the bFGF-RhoA-YAP-p27&lt;sup&gt;Kip1&lt;/sup&gt; axis for the formation of glial scars may be a potential therapeutic strategy for SCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;An increasing number of studies supports the view that transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the spinal cord (TESS) promotes functional recovery in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the neural mechanisms contributing to these effects remain poorly understood. Here we examined motor-evoked potentials in arm muscles elicited by cortical and subcortical stimulation of corticospinal axons before and after 20 min of TESS (30 Hz pulses with a 5 kHz carrier frequency) and sham-TESS applied between C5 and C6 spinous processes in males and females with and without chronic incomplete cervical SCI. The amplitude of subcortical, but not cortical, motor-evoked potentials increased in proximal and distal arm muscles for 75 min after TESS, but not sham-TESS, in control subjects and SCI participants, suggesting a subcortical origin for these effects. Intracortical inhibition, elicited by paired stimuli, increased after TESS in both groups. When TESS was applied without the 5 kHz carrier frequency both subcortical and cortical motor-evoked potentials were facilitated without changing intracortical inhibition, suggesting that the 5 kHz carrier frequency contributed to the cortical inhibitory effects. Hand and arm function improved largely when TESS was used with, compared with without, the 5 kHz carrier frequency. These novel observations demonstrate that TESS influences cortical and spinal networks, having an excitatory effect at the spinal level and an inhibitory effect at the cortical level. We hypothesized that these parallel effects contribute to further the recovery of limb function following SCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Accumulating evidence supports the view that transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the spinal cord (TESS) promotes recovery of function in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we show that a single session of TESS over the cervical spinal cord in individuals with incomplete chronic cervical SCI influenced in parallel the excitability cortical and spinal networks, having an excitatory effect at the spinal level and an inhibitory effect at the cortical level. Importantly, these parallel physiological effects had an impact on the magnitude of improvements in voluntary motor output.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sensory hair cell losses underlie the vast majority of permanent hearing and balance deficits in humans, but many nonmammalian vertebrates can fully recover from hearing impairments and balance dysfunctions because supporting cells (SCs) in their ears retain lifelong regenerative capacities that depend on proliferation and differentiation as replacement hair cells. Most SCs in vertebrate ears stop dividing during embryogenesis; and soon after birth, vestibular SCs in mammals transition to lasting quiescence as they develop massively thickened circumferential F-actin bands at their E-cadherin-rich adherens junctions. Here, we report that treatment with EGF and a GSK3 inhibitor thinned the circumferential F-actin bands throughout the sensory epithelium of cultured utricles that were isolated from adult mice of either sex. That treatment also caused decreases in E-cadherin, β-catenin, and YAP in the striola, and stimulated robust proliferation of mature, normally quiescent striolar SCs. The findings suggest that E-cadherin-rich junctions, which are not present in the SCs of the fish, amphibians, and birds which readily regenerate hair cells, are responsible in part for the mammalian ear's vulnerability to permanent balance and hearing deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Millions of people are affected by hearing and balance deficits that arise when loud sounds, ototoxic drugs, infections, and aging cause hair cell losses. Such deficits are permanent for humans and other mammals, but nonmammals can recover hearing and balance after supporting cells regenerate replacement hair cells. Mammalian supporting cells lose the capacity to proliferate around the time they develop unique, exceptionally reinforced, E-cadherin-rich intercellular junctions. Here, we report the discovery of a pharmacological treatment that thins F-actin bands, depletes E-cadherin, and stimulates proliferation in long-quiescent supporting cells within a balance epithelium from adult mice. The findings suggest that high E-cadherin in those supporting cell junctions may be responsible, in part, for the permanence of hair cell loss in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Regulated secretion is controlled by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors with different affinities and subcellular distributions. Inactivation of &lt;i&gt;Syt1&lt;/i&gt; (synaptotagmin-1), the main Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor for synchronous neurotransmission in many neurons, enhances asynchronous and spontaneous release rates, suggesting that Syt1 inhibits other sensors with higher Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; affinities and/or lower cooperativities. Such sensors could include Doc2a and Doc2b, which have been implicated in spontaneous and asynchronous neurotransmitter release and compete with Syt1 for binding SNARE complexes. Here, we tested this hypothesis using triple-knock-out mice. Inactivation of Doc2a and Doc2b in Syt1-deficient neurons did not reduce the high spontaneous release rate. Overexpression of Doc2b variants in triple-knock-out neurons reduced spontaneous release but did not rescue synchronous release. A chimeric construct in which the C2AB domain of Syt1 was substituted by that of Doc2b did not support synchronous release either. Conversely, the soluble C2AB domain of Syt1 did not affect spontaneous release. We conclude that the high spontaneous release rate in synaptotagmin-deficient neurons does not involve the binding of Doc2 proteins to Syt1 binding sites in the SNARE complex. Instead, our results suggest that the C2AB domains of Syt1 and Doc2b specifically support synchronous and spontaneous release by separate mechanisms. (Both male and female neurons were studied without sex determination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurotransmission in the brain is regulated by presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations. Multiple Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor proteins contribute to synchronous (Syt1, Syt2), asynchronous (Syt7), and spontaneous (Doc2a/Doc2b) phases of neurotransmitter release. Genetic ablation of synchronous release was previously shown to affect other release phases, suggesting that multiple sensors may compete for similar release sites, together encoding stimulus–secretion coupling over a large range of synaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations. Here, we investigated the extent of functional overlap between Syt1, Doc2a, and Doc2b by reintroducing wild-type and mutant proteins in triple-knock-out neurons, and conclude that the sensors are highly specialized for different phases of release.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Coordinated long-term plasticity of nearby excitatory synaptic inputs has been proposed to shape experience-related neuronal information processing. To elucidate the induction rules leading to spatially structured forms of synaptic potentiation in dendrites, we explored plasticity of glutamate uncaging-evoked excitatory input patterns with various spatial distributions in perisomatic dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices from adult male rats. We show that (1) the cooperativity rules governing the induction of synaptic LTP depend on dendritic location; (2) LTP of input patterns that are subthreshold or suprathreshold to evoke local dendritic spikes (d-spikes) requires different spatial organization; and (3) input patterns evoking d-spikes can strengthen nearby, nonsynchronous synapses by local heterosynaptic plasticity crosstalk mediated by NMDAR-dependent MEK/ERK signaling. These results suggest that multiple mechanisms can trigger spatially organized synaptic plasticity on various spatial and temporal scales, enriching the ability of neurons to use synaptic clustering for information processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A fundamental question in neuroscience is how neuronal feature selectivity is established via the combination of dendritic processing of synaptic input patterns with long-term synaptic plasticity. As these processes have been mostly studied separately, the relationship between the rules of integration and rules of plasticity remained elusive. Here we explore how the fine-grained spatial pattern and the form of voltage integration determine plasticity of different excitatory synaptic input patterns in perisomatic dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells. We demonstrate that the plasticity rules depend highly on three factors: (1) the location of the input within the dendritic branch (proximal vs distal), (2) the strength of the input pattern (subthreshold or suprathreshold for dendritic spikes), and (3) the stimulation of neighboring synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Visuomotor feedback responses vary in intensity throughout a reach, commonly explained by optimal control. Here we show that the optimal control for a range of movements with the same goal can be simplified to a time-to-target dependent control scheme. We measure our human participants’ visuomotor responses in five reaching conditions, each with different hand or cursor kinematics. Participants only produced different feedback responses when these kinematic changes resulted in different times-to-target. We complement our experimental data with a range of finite and non-finite horizon optimal feedback control models, finding that the model with time-to-target as one of the input parameters best replicates the experimental data. Overall, this suggests that time-to-target is a critical control parameter in online feedback control. Moreover, we propose that for a specific task and known dynamics, humans can instantly produce a control signal without any additional online computation allowing rapid response onset and close to optimal control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Human behaviour has widely been explained using stochastic optimal feedback control (OFC), formulating movement control as a set of time-dependent feedback and control gains. However, OFC is computationally expensive leading to questions about whether such a theory could be implemented in real time. Here we show that optimal feedback control could be approximated by a simple relationship between feedback gains and the time-to-target over a variety of movement kinematics, matching the evolution of visuomotor feedback gains of our human participants during reaching. As this relationship to time-to-target is similar across a wide range of kinematics, this suggests that early stages of the OFC controlled movement could be approximated by a time-to-target control, saving computational costs and allowing for rapid execution.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Tractograms are virtual representations of the white matter fibers of the
brain. They are of primary interest for tasks like presurgical planning, and
investigation of neuroplasticity or brain disorders. Each tractogram is
composed of millions of fibers encoded as 3D polylines. Unfortunately, a large
portion of those fibers are not anatomically plausible and can be considered
artifacts of the tracking algorithms. Common methods for tractogram filtering
are based on signal reconstruction, a principled approach, but unable to
consider the knowledge of brain anatomy. In this work, we address the problem
of tractogram filtering as a supervised learning problem by exploiting the
ground truth annotations obtained with a recent heuristic method, which labels
fibers as either anatomically plausible or non-plausible according to
well-established anatomical properties. The intuitive idea is to model a fiber
as a point cloud and the goal is to investigate whether and how a geometric
deep learning model might capture its anatomical properties. Our contribution
is an extension of the Dynamic Edge Convolution model that exploits the
sequential relations of points in a fiber and discriminates with high accuracy
plausible/non-plausible fibers.

 &lt;p&gt;Quantification of brain morphology has become an important cornerstone in
understanding brain structure. Measures of cortical morphology such as
thickness and surface area are frequently used to compare groups of subjects or
characterise longitudinal changes. However, such measures are often treated as
independent from each other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recently described scaling law, derived from a statistical physics model of
cortical folding, demonstrates that there is a tight covariance between three
commonly used cortical morphology measures: cortical thickness, total surface
area, and exposed surface area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that assuming the independence of cortical morphology measures can
hide features and potentially lead to misinterpretations. Using the scaling
law, we account for the covariance between cortical morphology measures and
derive novel independent measures of cortical morphology. By applying these new
measures, we show that new information can be gained; in our example we show
that distinct morphological alterations underlie healthy ageing compared to
temporal lobe epilepsy, even on the coarse level of a whole hemisphere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thus provide a conceptual framework for characterising cortical morphology
in a statistically valid and interpretable manner, based on theoretical
reasoning about the shape of the cortex.

 &lt;p&gt;Fifty years have passed since David Marr, Masao Ito, and James Albus proposed
seminal models of cerebellar functions. These models share the essential
concept that parallel-fiber-Purkinje-cell synapses undergo plastic changes,
guided by climbing-fiber activities during sensorimotor learning. However, they
differ in several important respects, including holistic versus complementary
roles of the cerebellum, pattern recognition versus control as computational
objectives, potentiation versus depression of synaptic plasticity, teaching
signals versus error signals transmitted by climbing-fibers, sparse expansion
coding by granule cells, and cerebellar internal models. In this review, we
evaluate the different features of the three models based on recent
computational and experimental studies. While acknowledging that the three
models have greatly advanced our understanding of cerebellar control mechanisms
in eye movements and classical conditioning, we propose a new direction for
computational frameworks of the cerebellum. That is, hierarchical reinforcement
learning with multiple internal models.

 &lt;p&gt;This is a living document that will be updated when appropriate. MIIND [1, 2]
is a population-level neural simulator. It is based on population density
techniques, just like DIPDE [3]. Contrary to DIPDE, MIIND is agnostic to the
underlying neuron model used in its populations so any 1, 2 or 3 dimensional
model can be set up with minimal effort. The resulting populations can then be
grouped into large networks, e.g. the Potjans-Diesmann model [4]. The MIIND
website &lt;a href=&quot;http://miind.sf.net&quot;&gt;this http URL&lt;/a&gt; contains training materials, and helps to set up
MIIND, either by using virtual machines, a DOCKER image, or directly from

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We present a working model of the compensatory eye movement system in mice. We challenge the model with a data set of eye movements in mice (n =34) recorded in 4 different sinusoidal stimulus conditions with 36 different combinations of frequency (0.1–3.2 Hz) and amplitude (0.5–8°) in each condition. The conditions included vestibular stimulation in the dark (vestibular-ocular reflex, VOR), optokinetic stimulation (optokinetic reflex, OKR), and two combined visual/vestibular conditions (the visual-vestibular ocular reflex, vVOR, and visual suppression of the VOR, sVOR). The model successfully reproduced the eye movements in all conditions, except for minor failures to predict phase when gain was very low. Most importantly, it could explain the interaction of VOR and OKR when the two reflexes are activated simultaneously during vVOR stimulation. In addition to our own data, we also reproduced the behavior of the compensatory eye movement system found in the existing literature. These include its response to sum-of-sines stimuli, its response after lesions of the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi or the flocculus, characteristics of VOR adaptation, and characteristics of drift in the dark. Our model is based on ideas of state prediction and forward modeling that have been widely used in the study of motor control. However, it represents one of the first quantitative efforts to simulate the full range of behaviors of a specific system. The model has two separate processing loops, one for vestibular stimulation and one for visual stimulation. Importantly, state prediction in the visual processing loop depends on a forward model of residual retinal slip after vestibular processing. In addition, we hypothesize that adaptation in the system is primarily adaptation of this model. In other words, VOR adaptation happens primarily in the OKR loop.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is widely implicated in having an important role in adaptive motor control. Many of the computational studies on cerebellar motor control to date have focused on the associated architecture and learning algorithms in an effort to further understand cerebellar function. In this paper we switch focus to the signals driving cerebellar adaptation that arise through different motor behavior. To do this, we investigate computationally the contribution of the cerebellum to the optokinetic reflex (OKR), a visual feedback control scheme for image stabilization. We develop a computational model of the adaptation of the cerebellar response to the world velocity signals that excite the OKR (where world velocity signals are used to emulate head velocity signals when studying the OKR in head-fixed experimental laboratory conditions). The results show that the filter learnt by the cerebellar model is highly dependent on the power spectrum of the colored noise world velocity excitation signal. Thus, the key finding here is that the cerebellar filter is determined by the statistics of the OKR excitation signal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;We present a case of voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex antibody-positive limbic encephalitis (LE) harboring autoantibodies against Kv1.2. Since the patient responded well to immunotherapy, the autoantibodies were regarded as pathogenic. We aimed to characterize the pathophysiological role of this antibody in comparison to an antibody against the VGKC-associated protein contactin-associated protein-2 (CASPR2).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Stereotactic injection of patient sera (anti-Kv1.2-associated LE or anti-CASPR2 encephalopathy) and a control subject was performed into the hippocampus of the anesthetized rat in vivo, and hippocampal slices were prepared for electrophysiological purposes. Using extra- and intracellular techniques, synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation (LTP) and vulnerability to pro-epileptic conditions were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We observed that the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) was significantly increased at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in anti-Kv1.2-treated and anti-CASPR2-treated rats, but not at medial perforant path-dentate gyrus synapses. The increase of the fEPSP slope in CA1 was accompanied by a decrease of the paired-pulse ratio in anti-Kv1.2, but not in anti-CASPR2 tissue, indicating presynaptic site of anti-Kv1.2. In addition, anti-Kv1.2 tissue showed enhanced LTP in CA1, but dentate gyrus LTP remained unaltered. Importantly, LTP in slices from anti-CASPR2-treated animals did not differ from control values. Intracellular recordings from CA1 neurons revealed that the resting membrane potential and a single action potential were not different between anti-Kv1.2 and control tissue. However, when the depolarization was prolonged, the number of action potentials elicited was reduced in anti-Kv1.2-treated tissue compared to both control and anti-CASPR2 tissue. In contrast, polyspike discharges induced by removal of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; occurred earlier and more frequently in both patient sera compared to control.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patient serum containing anti-Kv1.2 facilitates presynaptic transmitter release as well as postsynaptic depolarization at the Schaffer-collateral-CA1 synapse, but not in the dentate gyrus. As a consequence, both synaptic transmission and LTP in CA1 are facilitated and action potential firing is altered. In contrast, anti-CASPR2 leads to increased postsynaptic potentials, but without changing LTP or firing properties suggesting that anti-Kv1.2 and anti-CASPR2 differ in their cellular effects. Both patient sera alter susceptibility to epileptic conditions, but presumably by different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms that gradually appear as a consequence of the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Currently, no treatment can slow Parkinson’s disease progression. Inasmuch, there is a need to develop animal models that can be used to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neuron death. The initial goal of this study was to determine if canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vectors are effective gene transfer tools in the monkey brain. A second objective was to explore the possibility of developing a large nonhuman primate that expresses one of the most common genetic mutations causing Parkinson’s disease. Our studies demonstrate the neuronal tropism, retrograde transport, biodistribution, and efficacy of CAV-2 vectors expressing GFP and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;G2019S&lt;/sup&gt;) in the Macaca fascicularis brain. Our data also suggest that following optimization CAV-2-mediated LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;G2019S&lt;/sup&gt; expression could help us model the neurodegenerative processes of this genetic subtype of Parkinson’s disease in monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In the past, determination of absolute values of cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlc) in clinical routine was rarely carried out due to the invasive nature of arterial sampling. With the advent of combined PET/MR imaging technology, CMRGlc values can be obtained non-invasively, thereby providing the opportunity to take advantage of fully quantitative data in clinical routine. However, CMRGlc values display high physiological variability, presumably due to fluctuations in the intrinsic activity of the brain at rest. To reduce CMRGlc variability associated with these fluctuations, the objective of this study was to determine whether functional connectivity measures derived from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) could be used to correct for these fluctuations in intrinsic brain activity. Methods: We studied 10 healthy volunteers who underwent a test-retest dynamic [18F]FDG-PET study using a fully integrated PET/MR system (Siemens Biograph mMR). To validate the non-invasive derivation of an image-derived input function based on combined analysis of PET and MR data, arterial blood samples were obtained. Using the arterial input function (AIF), parametric images representing CMRGlc were determined using the Patlak graphical approach. Both directed functional connectivity (dFC) and undirected functional connectivity (uFC) were determined between nodes in six major networks (Default mode network, Salience, L/R Executive, Attention, and Sensory-motor network) using either a bivariate-correlation (R coefficient) or a Multi-Variate AutoRegressive (MVAR) model. In addition, the performance of a regional connectivity measure, the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), was also investigated. Results: The average intrasubject variability for CMRGlc values between test and retest was determined as (14 ±8%) with an average inter-subject variability of 25% at test and 15% at retest. The average CMRGlc value (umol/100 g/min) across all networks was 39 ±10 at test and increased slightly to 43 ±6 at retest. The R, MVAR and fALFF coefficients showed relatively large test-retest variability in comparison to the inter-subjects variability, resulting in poor reliability (intraclass correlation in the range of 0.11–0.65). More importantly, no significant relationship was found between the R coefficients (for uFC), MVAR coefficients (for dFC) or fALFF and corresponding CMRGlc values for any of the six major networks. Discussion: Measurement of functional connectivity within established brain networks did not provide a means to decrease the inter- or intrasubject variability of CMRGlc values. As such, our results indicate that connectivity measured derived from rs-fMRI acquired contemporaneously with PET imaging are not suited for correction of CMRGlc variability associated with intrinsic fluctuations of resting-state brain activity. Thus, given the observed substantial inter- and intrasubject variability of CMRGlc values, the relevance of absolute quantification for clinical routine is presently uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an intractable adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that leads to the loss of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs). The long axons of MNs become damaged during the early stages of ALS. Genetic and pathological analyses of ALS patients have revealed dysfunction in the MN axon homeostasis. However, the molecular pathomechanism for the degeneration of axons in ALS has not been fully elucidated. This review provides an overview of the proposed axonal pathomechanisms in ALS, including those involving the neuronal cytoskeleton, cargo transport within axons, axonal energy supply, clearance of junk protein, neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), and aberrant axonal branching. To improve understanding of the global changes in axons, the review summarizes omics analyses of the axonal compartments of neurons in vitro and in vivo, including a motor nerve organoid approach that utilizes microfluidic devices developed by this research group. The review also discusses the relevance of intra-axonal transcription factors frequently identified in these omics analyses. Local axonal translation and the relationship among these pathomechanisms should be pursued further. The development of novel strategies to analyze axon fractions provides a new approach to establishing a detailed understanding of resilience of long MN and MN pathology in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mathematical models for excitable cells are commonly based on cable theory, which considers a homogenized domain and spatially constant ionic concentrations. Although such models provide valuable insight, the effect of altered ion concentrations or detailed cell morphology on the electrical potentials cannot be captured. In this paper, we discuss an alternative approach to detailed modeling of electrodiffusion in neural tissue. The mathematical model describes the distribution and evolution of ion concentrations in a geometrically-explicit representation of the intra- and extracellular domains. As a combination of the electroneutral Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) model and the Extracellular-Membrane-Intracellular (EMI) framework, we refer to this model as the KNP-EMI model. Here, we introduce and numerically evaluate a new, finite element-based numerical scheme for the KNP-EMI model, capable of efficiently and flexibly handling geometries of arbitrary dimension and arbitrary polynomial degree. Moreover, we compare the electrical potentials predicted by the KNP-EMI and EMI models. Finally, we study ephaptic coupling induced in an unmyelinated axon bundle and demonstrate how the KNP-EMI framework can give new insights in this setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reality monitoring is defined as the ability to distinguish internally self-generated information from externally-derived information. Functional imaging studies have consistently found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key brain region subserving reality monitoring. This study aimed to determine a causal role for mPFC in reality monitoring using navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS). In a subject-blinded sham-controlled crossover design, healthy individuals received either active or sham nrTMS targeting mPFC. Active modulation of mPFC using nrTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz, significantly improved identification of both self-generated and externally-derived information during reality monitoring, when compared to sham or baseline. Targeted excitatory modulation of mPFC also improved positive mood, reduced negative mood, and increased overall alertness/arousal. These results establish optimal nrTMS dosing parameters that maximized tolerability/comfort and induced significant neuromodulatory effects in the mPFC target. Importantly, this is a proof-of-concept study that establishes the mPFC as a novel brain target that can be stimulated with nrTMS to causally impact both higher-order reality monitoring and mood.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure exercises is considered as the gold-standard psychological intervention. New psychotherapeutic modalities have emerged in the last decade and, among them, mindfulness has been rapidly adopted by therapists. The adoption rate is slower for the use of virtual reality (VR) to conduct exposure. The goal of the present position paper is to contrast, for the treatment of anxiety disorders, the weight of empirical evidences supporting the use of exposure in VR with the use of mindfulness-based therapy (MBT). Based on the most recent meta-analyses, we found that CBT with exposure conducted in VR was more thoroughly researched and supported than MBT, receiving validation from roughly twice as many studies with high control (i.e., randomized, active controls with clinical samples). However, this conclusion is nuanced by reviewing gaps in the literature for both therapies. Potential factors influencing clinicians’ choice of treatment and suggestions for future research directions are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Archaerhodopsin (ArchT)-mediated photoinhibition of axon terminals is commonly used to test the involvement of specific long-range neural projections in behavior. Although sustained activation of this opsin in axon terminals has the unintended consequence of enhancing spontaneous vesicle release, it is unclear whether this desynchronized signaling is consequential for ArchT’s behavioral effects. Here, we compare axon terminal and cell body photoinhibition of nucleus accumbens (NAc) afferents to test the utility of these approaches for uncovering pathway-specific contributions of neural circuits to behavior. First, in brain slice recordings we confirmed that ArchT photoinhibition of glutamatergic axons reduces evoked synaptic currents and increases spontaneous transmitter release. A further consequence was increased interneuron activity, which served to broadly suppress glutamate input via presynaptic GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. In vivo, axon terminal photoinhibition increased feeding and reward-seeking behavior irrespective of the afferent pathway targeted. These behavioral effects are comparable to those obtained with broad inhibition of NAc neurons. In contrast, cell body inhibition of excitatory NAc afferents revealed a pathway-specific contribution of thalamic input to feeding behavior and amygdala input to reward-seeking under extinction conditions. These findings underscore the off-target behavioral consequences of ArchT-mediated axon terminal inhibition while highlighting cell body inhibition as a valuable alternative for pathway-specific optogenetic silencing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebral palsy (CP) is caused by a variety of factors attributed to early brain damage, resulting in permanently impaired motor control, marked by weakness and muscle stiffness. To find out if altered physiology of spinal motoneurons (MNs) could contribute to movement deficits, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp in neonatal rabbit spinal cord slices after developmental injury at 79% gestation. After preterm hypoxia-ischemia (HI), rabbits are born with motor deficits consistent with a spastic phenotype including hypertonia and hyperreflexia. There is a range in severity, thus kits are classified as severely affected, mildly affected, or unaffected based on modified Ashworth scores and other behavioral tests. At postnatal day (P)0–5, we recorded electrophysiological parameters of 40 MNs in transverse spinal cord slices using whole-cell patch-clamp. We found significant differences between groups (severe, mild, unaffected and sham control MNs). Severe HI MNs showed more sustained firing patterns, depolarized resting membrane potential, and fired action potentials at a higher frequency. These properties could contribute to muscle stiffness, a hallmark of spastic CP. Interestingly altered persistent inward currents (PICs) and morphology in severe HI MNs would dampen excitability (depolarized PIC onset and increased dendritic length). In summary, changes we observed in spinal MN physiology likely contribute to the severity of the phenotype, and therapeutic strategies for CP could target the excitability of spinal MNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Bioluminescence is a powerful biological signal that scientists have repurposed as a reporter for gene expression in plants and animals. However, there are downsides associated with the need to provide a substrate to these reporters, including its high cost and non-uniform tissue penetration. In this work we reconstitute a fungal bioluminescence pathway (FBP) &lt;i&gt;in planta &lt;/i&gt;using a composable toolbox of parts. We demonstrate that the FBP can create luminescence across various tissues in a broad range of plants without external substrate addition. We also show how our toolbox can be used to deploy the FBP &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt; to build auto-luminescent reporters for the study of gene-expression and hormone fluxes. A low-cost imaging platform for gene expression profiling is also described. These experiments lay the groundwork for future construction of programmable auto-luminescent plant traits, such as light driven plant-pollinator interactions or light emitting plant-based sensors.</content>

 Protein ubiquitination is a very diverse post-translational modification leading to protein degradation or delocalization, or altering protein activity. In &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, two E3 ligases, BIG BROTHER (BB) and DA2, activate the latent peptidases DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 by mono-ubiquitination at multiple sites. Subsequently, these activated peptidases destabilize various positive regulators of growth. Here, we show that two ubiquitin-specific proteases, UBP12 and UBP13, deubiquitinate DA1, DAR1 and DAR2, hence reducing their peptidase activity. Overexpression of &lt;i&gt;UBP12&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;UBP13&lt;/i&gt; strongly decreased leaf size and cell area, and resulted in lower ploidy levels. Mutants in which &lt;i&gt;UBP12&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;UBP13&lt;/i&gt; were downregulated produced smaller leaves that contained fewer and smaller cells. Remarkably, neither UBP12 nor UBP13 were found to be cleavage substrates of the activated DA1. Our results therefore suggest that UBP12 and UBP13 work upstream of DA1, DAR1 and DAR2 to restrict their protease activity and hence fine-tune plant growth and development.</content>

 To facilitate smoking genetics research we determined whether a screen of mutagenized zebrafish for nicotine preference could predict loci affecting smoking behaviour. From 30 screened F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sibling groups, where each was derived from an individual ethyl-nitrosurea mutagenized F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; fish, two showed increased or decreased nicotine preference. Out of 25 inactivating mutations carried by the F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; fish, one in the &lt;i&gt;slit3&lt;/i&gt; gene segregated with increased nicotine preference in heterozygous individuals. Focussed SNP analysis of the human &lt;i&gt;SLIT3&lt;/i&gt; locus in cohorts from UK (n=863) and Finland (n=1715) identified two variants associated with cigarette consumption and likelihood of cessation. Characterisation of &lt;i&gt;slit3&lt;/i&gt; mutant larvae and adult fish revealed decreased sensitivity to the dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonist amisulpride, known to affect startle reflex that is correlated with addiction in humans, and increased &lt;i&gt;htr1aa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in mutant larvae. No effect on neuronal pathfinding was detected. These findings reveal a role for SLIT3 in development of pathways affecting responses to nicotine in zebrafish and smoking in humans.</content>

 Protozoan parasites of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania donovani&lt;/i&gt; complex – &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. infantum&lt;/i&gt; – cause the fatal disease visceral leishmaniasis. We present the first comprehensive genome-wide global study, with 151 cultured field isolates representing most of the geographical distribution. &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; isolates separated into five groups that largely coincide with geographical origin but vary greatly in diversity. In contrast, the majority of &lt;i&gt;L. infantum&lt;/i&gt; samples fell into one globally-distributed group with little diversity. This picture is complicated by several hybrid lineages. Identified genetic groups vary in heterozygosity and levels of linkage, suggesting different recombination histories. We characterise chromosome-specific patterns of aneuploidy and identified extensive structural variation, including known and suspected drug resistance loci. This study reveals greater genetic diversity than suggested by geographically-focused studies, provides a resource of genomic variation for future work and sets the scene for a new understanding of the evolution and genetics of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania donovani&lt;/i&gt; complex.</content>

 After induction of synaptic plasticity at specific inputs, Field et al. found that coordinated changes occur across multiple inhibitory and excitatory inputs onto cortical pyramidal neurons. The relative timing and degree of heterosynaptic plasticity determines the overall excitatory-inhibitory correlation, i.e., the set point for excitatory-inhibitory balance.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (henceforth autism) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition with few effective treatments for core and associated features. To make progress we need to both identify and validate neural markers that help to parse heterogeneity to tailor therapies to specific neurobiological profiles. Atypical hemispheric lateralization is a stable feature across studies in autism, however its potential of lateralization as a neural stratification marker has not been widely examined. Methods: In order to dissect heterogeneity in lateralization in autism, we used the large EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project dataset comprising 352 individuals with autism and 233 neurotypical (NT) controls as well as a replication dataset from ABIDE (513 autism, 691 NT) using a promising approach that moves beyond mean-group comparisons. We derived grey matter voxelwise laterality values for each subject and modelled individual deviations from the normative pattern of brain laterality across age using normative modeling. Results: Results showed that individuals with autism had highly individualized patterns of both extreme right- and leftward deviations, particularly in language-, motor- and visuospatial regions, associated with symptom severity. Language delay (LD) explained most variance in extreme rightward patterns, whereas core autism symptom severity explained most variance in extreme leftward patterns. Follow-up analyses showed that a stepwise pattern emerged with individuals with autism with LD showing more pronounced rightward deviations than autism individuals without LD. Conclusion: Our analyses corroborate the need for novel (dimensional) approaches to delineate the heterogeneous neuroanatomy in autism, and indicate atypical lateralization may constitute a neurophenotype for clinically meaningful stratification in autism.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Insects find food, mates, and egg-laying sites by tracking odor plumes swept by complex wind patterns. Previous studies have shown that moths and flies localize plumes by surging upwind at odor onset and turning cross- or downwind at odor offset. Less clear is how, once within the expanding cone of the odor plume, insects use their brief encounters with individual odor packets, whose location and timing are random, to progress towards the source. Experiments and theory have suggested that the timing of odor encounters might assist navigation, but connecting behaviors to individual encounters has been challenging. Here, we imaged complex odor plumes simultaneous with freely-walking flies, allowing us to quantify how behavior is shaped by individual odor encounters. Combining measurements, dynamical models, and statistical inference, we found that within the plume cone, individual encounters did not trigger reflexive surging, casting, or counterturning. Instead, flies turned stochastically with stereotyped saccades, whose direction was biased upwind by the timing of prior odor encounters, while the magnitude and rate of saccades remained constant. Odor encounters did not strongly affect walking speed. Instead, flies used encounter timing to modulate the rate of transitions between walks and stops. When stopped, flies initiated walks using information from multiple odor encounters, suggesting that integrating evidence without losing position was part of the strategy. These results indicate that once within the complex odor plume, where odor location and timing are unpredictable, animals navigate with biased random walks shaped by the entire sequence of encounters.</content>

 Whereas humans and other adult mammals lack the ability to regain locomotor function after spinal cord injury, zebrafish are able to recover swimming behavior even after complete spinal cord transection. We have previously shown that zebrafish larvae regenerate lost neurons within 9 days post-injury (dpi), but the functional contribution of these neurons to motor recovery is unknown. Here we show that multiple interneuron subtypes known to play a role in locomotor circuitry are regenerated in injured spinal cord segments during the period of functional recovery. Further, we show that one subtype of newly-generated interneurons receives excitatory input and fires synchronously with motor output by 9 dpi. Taken together, our data show that regenerative neurogenesis in the zebrafish spinal cord produces interneurons with the physiological capacity to participate in the recovery of locomotor function.</content>

		<content type="html">
 When localising sounds in space the brain relies on internal models that specify the correspondence between the auditory input reaching the ears and initial head-position with coordinates in external space. These models can be updated throughout life, setting the basis for re-learning spatial hearing abilities in adulthood. This is particularly important for individuals who experience long-term auditory alterations (e.g., hearing loss, hearing aids, cochlear implants) as well as individuals who have to adapt to novel auditory cues when listening in virtual auditory environments. Until now, several methodological constraints have limited our understanding of the mechanisms involved in spatial hearing re-learning. In particular, the potential role of active listening and head-movements have remained largely overlooked. Here, we overcome these limitations by using a novel methodology, based on virtual reality and real-time kinematic tracking, to study the role of active multisensory-motor interactions with sounds in the updating of sound-space correspondences. Participants were immersed in a virtual reality scenario showing 17 speakers at ear-level. From each visible speaker a free-field real sound could be generated. Two separate groups of participants localised the sound source either by reaching or naming the perceived sound source, under binaural or monaural listening. Participants were free to move their head during the task and received audio-visual feedback on their performance. Results showed that both groups compensated rapidly for the short-term auditory alteration caused by monaural listening, improving sound localisation performance across trials. Crucially, compared to naming, reaching the sounds induced faster and larger sound localisation improvements. Furthermore, more accurate sound localisation was accompanied by progressively wider head-movements. These two measures were significantly correlated selectively for the Reaching group. In conclusion, reaching to sounds in an immersive visual VR context proved most effective for updating altered spatial hearing. Head movements played an important role in this fast updating, pointing to the importance of active listening when implementing training protocols for improving spatial hearing.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Human visual 3D perception is flawed by distortions, which are influenced by non-visual factors, such as gravitational vestibular signals. Distinct hypotheses regarding the sensory processing stage at which gravity acts may explain the influence of gravity: 1) a direct effect on the visual system, 2) a shaping of the internal representation of space that is used to interpret sensory signals, or 3) a role in the ability to build multiple, modality-specific, internal depictions of the perceived object. To test these hypotheses, we performed experiments comparing visual versus haptic 3D perception, and the effects of microgravity on these two senses. The results show that visual and haptic perceptual anisotropies reside in body-centered, and not gravity-centered, planes, suggesting an ego-centric encoding of the information for both sensory modalities. Although coplanar, the perceptual distortions of the two sensory modalities are in opposite directions: depth is visually underestimated, but haptically overestimated, with respect to height and width. Interestingly microgravity appears to amplify the 'terrestrial' distortions of both senses. Through computational modeling, we show that these findings are parsimoniously predicted only by a gravity facilitation of cross-modal sensory reconstructions, corresponding to Hypothesis 3. This theory is able to explain not only how gravity can shape egocentric perceptions, but also the unexpected opposite effect of gravity on visual and haptic 3D perception. Overall, these results suggest that the brain uses gravity as a stable reference cue to reconstruct concurrent, modality-specific internal representations of 3D objects even when they are sensed through only one sensory channel.</content>

		<content type="html">
 An error was made in including noise ceilings for human data in Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte (2014). For comparability with the macaque data, human data were averaged across participants before analysis. Therefore the noise ceilings indicating variability across human participants do not accurately depict the upper bounds of possible model performance and should not have been shown. Creating noise ceilings appropriate for the fitted models is not trivial. Below we present a method for doing this, and the results obtained with this new method. The corrected results differ from the original results in that the best-performing model (weighted combination of AlexNet layers and category readouts) does not reach the lower bound of the noise ceiling. However, the best-performing model is not significantly below the lower bound of the noise ceiling. The claim that the model &quot;fully explains&quot; the human IT data appears overstated. All other claims of the paper are unaffected.</content>

 Hippocampal cells are central to spatial and predictive representations, and experience replays by place cells are crucial for learning and memory. Nonetheless, how hippocampal replay patterns dynamically change during the learning process remains to be largely elucidated. We found that when rats updated their behavioral strategies in response to a novel salient location, place cells increased theta sequences and sharp wave ripple-associated synchronous spikes that preferentially replayed salient locations and reward-related contexts in reverse order. The directionality and contents of the replays progressively varied with learning, including an optimized path that had never been exploited by the animals. Realtime suppression of sharp wave ripples during learning inhibited the rapid stabilization of optimized behavior. Our results suggest that hippocampal replays prioritize salient experiences and support the reinforcement of new behavioral policies.</content>

 Successful segmentation of the total intracranial vault (ICV) and ventricles is of critical importance when studying neurodegeneration through neuroimaging. We present iCVMapper and VentMapper, robust algorithms that use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment the ICV and ventricles from both single contrast and multi-contrast MRI data. Our models were trained on a large dataset from two multi-site studies (N=528 subjects for ICV, N=501 for ventricular segmentation) consisting of older adults with varying degrees of cerebrovascular lesions and atrophy, posing significant challenges for most segmentation approaches. The models were tested on 132 participants, including subjects with high white matter hyperintensity burden from a third multi-site study not used in the training dataset. We assessed our algorithms relative to four state-of-the-art ICV extraction methods (MONSTR, BET, Deep Extraction, Freesurfer), as well as an open source ventricular segmentation tool (Freesurfer). Our multi-contrast models outperformed other methods across all evaluation metrics, with an average Dice coefficient of 0.98 and 0.94 for ICV and ventricular segmentation respectively. Both models were also the most time efficient, segmenting the structures in seconds; orders of magnitude faster than some of the other available methods. Our networks showed further improvement in accuracy with the use of a conditional random field (CRF) as a post-processing step. We further validated both segmentation models, highlighting their robustness to images with lower resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. The pipeline and models are available at: https://ventmapp3r.readthedocs.io and https://icvmapp3r.readthedocs.io to enable further investigation of the roles of ICV and ventricles in relation to normal aging and neurodegeneration in large multi-site studies.</content>

 Intermittent fasting (IF) is a lifestyle intervention comprising a dietary regimen in which energy intake is restricted via alternating periods of fasting and ad libitum food consumption, without compromising nutritional composition. While epigenetic modifications can mediate effects of environmental factors on gene expression, no information is yet available on potential effects of IF on the epigenome. In this study, we found that IF causes modulation of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) epigenetic mark in the cerebellum of male C57/BL6 mice, which in turn orchestrates a plethora of transcriptomic changes involved in the robust metabolic switching processes commonly observed during IF. Interestingly, both epigenomic and transcriptomic modulation continued to be observed after refeeding, suggesting that memory of the IF-induced epigenetic change is maintained at the locus. Notably though, we found that termination of IF results in a loss of H3K9me3 regulation of the transcriptome. Collectively, our study characterizes a novel mechanism of IF in the epigenetic-transcriptomic axis, which controls myriad metabolic process changes. In addition to providing a valuable and innovative resource, our systemic analyses reveal molecular framework for understanding how IF impacts the metaboloepigenetics axis of the brain.</content>

 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play important roles in cellular functions. However, their intracellular organization is largely unknown. Through investigation of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), we discovered periodically repeating clusters of CB1 hotspots within the axons of neurons. We observed these CB1 hotspots interact with the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS) forming a complex crucial in the regulation of CB1 signaling. Furthermore, we found that CB1 hotspot periodicity increased upon CB1 agonist application, and these activated CB1 displayed less dynamic movement compared to non-activated CB1. Our results suggest that CB1 forms periodic hotspots organized by the MPS as a mechanism to increase signaling efficacy when being activated.</content>

 The normalization model has been applied to explain neural activity in diverse neural systems including primary visual cortex (V1). The model's defining characteristic is that the response of each neuron is divided by a factor that includes a weighted sum of activity of a pool of neurons. In spite of the success of the normalization model, there are 3 unresolved issues. 1) Experimental evidence suggests that normalization in V1 operates via recurrent amplification, i.e., amplifying weak inputs more than strong inputs. It is unknown how normalization arises from recurrent amplification. 2) Experiments have demonstrated that normalization is weighted such each weight specifies how one neuron contributes to another's normalization pool. It is unknown how weighted normalization arises from a recurrent circuit. 3) Neural activity in V1 exhibits complex dynamics, including gamma oscillations, linked to normalization. It is unknown how these dynamics emerge from normalization. Here, a new family of recurrent circuit models is reported, each of which comprises coupled neural integrators to implement normalization via recurrent amplification with arbitrary normalization weights, some of which can recapitulate key experimental observations of the dynamics of neural activity in V1.</content>

Functional non-coding (fnc)RNAs are nucleotide sequences of varied lengths, structures, and mechanisms that ubiquitously influence gene expression and translation, genome stability and dynamics, and human health and disease. Here, to shed light on their functional determinants, we seek to exploit the evolutionary record of variation and divergence read from sequence comparisons. The approach follows the phylogenetic Evolutionary Trace (ET) paradigm, first developed and extensively validated on proteins. We assigned a relative rank of importance to every base in a study of 1070 functional RNAs, including the ribosome, and observed evolutionary patterns strikingly similar to those seen in proteins, namely, (1) the top-ranked bases clustered in secondary and tertiary structures. (2) In turn, these clusters mapped functional regions for catalysis, binding proteins and drugs, post-transcriptional modification, and deleterious mutations. (3) Moreover, the quantitative quality of these clusters correlated with the identification of functional regions. (4) As a result of this correlation, smoother structural distributions of evolutionary important nucleotides improved functional site predictions. Thus, in practice, phylogenetic analysis can broadly identify functional determinants in RNA sequences and functional sites in RNA structures, and reveal details on the basis of RNA molecular functions. As example of application, we report several previously undocumented and potentially functional ET nucleotide clusters in the ribosome. This work is broadly relevant to studies of structure-function in ribonucleic acids. Additionally, this generalization of ET shows that evolutionary constraints among sequence, structure, and function are similar in structured RNA and proteins. RNA ET is currently available as part of the ET command-line package, and will be available as a web-server.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BTEKcVM-3CA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;One characteristic of epilepsy is the variety of mechanisms leading to the epileptic state, which are still largely unknown. Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and depolarization block (DB) are other pathological brain activities linked to epilepsy, whose patterns are different and whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. In epileptogenic network modeling, the Epileptor is a generic phenomenological model that has been recently developed to describe the dynamics of seizures. Here, we performed a detailed qualitative analysis of the Epileptor model based on dynamical systems theory and bifurcation analysis, and investigate the dynamic evolution of &quot;normal&quot; activity toward seizures and to the pathological RSE and DB states. The mechanisms of the transition between states are called bifurcations. Our detailed analysis demonstrates that the generic model undergoes different bifurcation types at seizure offset, when varying some selected parameters. We show that the pathological and normal activities can coexist within the same model under some conditions, and demonstrate that there are many pathways leading to and away from these activities. We here archive systematically all behaviors and dynamic regimes of the Epileptor model to serve as a resource in the development of patient-specific brain network models, and more generally in epilepsy research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Magnocellular neurosecretory cells are intrinsically osmosensitive and can be activated by increases in blood osmolality, triggering the release of antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) to promote water retention. Hence, the activity of magnocellular VP neurons is one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of body fluid homeostasis in healthy organisms. Chronic exposure to high dietary salt leads to excessive activation of VP neurons, thereby elevating levels of circulating VP, which can cause increases in blood pressure contributing to salt-dependent hypertension. However, the molecular basis underlying high salt diet-induced hyperactivation of magnocellular VP neurons remains not fully understood. Previous studies suggest that magnocellular neurosecretory neurons contain a subcortical layer of actin filaments and pharmacological stabilization of this actin network potentiates osmotically-induced activation of magnocellular neurons. Using super-resolution imaging &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, we investigated the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in rat magnocellular neurosecretory cells under normal physiological conditions and after a chronic increase in blood osmolality following 7 days of salt-loading. We found that, in addition to the subcortical layer of actin filaments, magnocellular VP neurons are endowed with a unique network of cytoplasmic actin filaments throughout their somata. Moreover, we revealed that the density of both subcortical and cytoplasmic actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons is dramatically increased following salt-loading. These results suggest that increased osmo-responsiveness of VP neurons following chronic exposure to high dietary salt may be mediated by the modulation of unique actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons, possibly contributing to elevated blood pressure in this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement:&lt;/b&gt; Hypothalamic magnocellular neurons secrete antidiuretic hormone vasopressin into the circulation, promoting vasoconstriction and renal water retention. Regulation of vasopressin secretion is a key factor controlling body fluid homeostasis, and excessive vasopressin secretion contributes to fluid balance disorders such as salt-sensitive hypertension. Using super-resolution analysis of different areas of the rat brain, we show that vasopressin neurons feature a unique actin cytoskeleton comprising a subcortical actin layer and an array of cytoplasmic comet-like structures, which are not present in any other neuronal cell type. Moreover, the density of these unique actin structures is increased in a rodent model of salt-sensitive hypertension, and our findings suggest that this modification may contribute to excessive activation of vasopressin neurons in a model salt-sensitive hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the human brain, a (relative) functional asymmetry (i.e., laterality; functional and performance differences between the two cerebral hemispheres) exists for a variety of cognitive domains (e.g., language, visual-spatial processing, etc.). For numerical cognition, both bi-lateral and unilateral processing has been proposed with the retrieval of arithmetic facts postulated as being lateralized to the left hemisphere.
In this study, we aimed at evaluating this claim by investigating whether processing of multiplicatively related triplets in a number bisection task (e.g., 12_16_20) in healthy participants (n=23) shows a significant advantage when transmitted to the right hemisphere only as compared to transmission to the left hemisphere. 
As expected, a control task revealed that stimulus presentation to the left or both visual hemifields did not increase processing disadvantages of unit-decade incompatible number pairs in magnitude comparison. For the number bisection task, we replicated the multiplicativity effect. However, in contrast to the hypothesis deriving from the triple code model, we did not observe significant hemispheric processing asymmetries for multiplicative items. 
We suggest that participants resorted to keep number triplets in verbal working memory after perceiving them only very briefly for 150ms. Rehearsal of the three numbers was probably slow and time-consuming so allowing for interhemispheric communication in the meantime. We suggest that an effect of lateralized presentation may only be expected for early effects when the task is sufficiently easy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a novel approach that uses deep neural networks for
classifying imagined speech, significantly increasing the classification
accuracy. The proposed approach employs only the EEG channels over specific
areas of the brain for classification, and derives distinct feature vectors
from each of those channels. This gives us more data to train a classifier,
enabling us to use deep learning approaches. Wavelet and temporal domain
features are extracted from each channel. The final class label of each test
trial is obtained by applying a majority voting on the classification results
of the individual channels considered in the trial. This approach is used for
classifying all the 11 prompts in the KaraOne dataset of imagined speech. The
proposed architecture and the approach of treating the data have resulted in an
average classification accuracy of 57.15%, which is an improvement of around
35% over the state-of-the-art results.

 &lt;p&gt;This work proposes improvements in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording
protocols for motor imagery through the introduction of actual motor movement
and/or somatosensory cues. The results obtained demonstrate the advantage of
requiring the subjects to perform motor actions following the trials of
imagery. By introducing motor actions in the protocol, the subjects are able to
perform actual motor planning, rather than just visualizing the motor movement,
thus greatly improving the ease with which the motor movements can be imagined.
This study also probes the added advantage of administering somatosensory cues
in the subject, as opposed to the conventional auditory/visual cues. These
changes in the protocol show promise in terms of the aptness of the spatial
filters obtained on the data, on application of the well-known common spatial
pattern (CSP) algorithms. The regions highlighted by the spatial filters are
more localized and consistent across the subjects when the protocol is
augmented with somatosensory stimuli. Hence, we suggest that this may prove to
be a better EEG acquisition protocol for detecting brain activation in response
to intended motor commands in (clinically) paralyzed/locked-in patients.

 &lt;p&gt;This study extends the mathematical model of emotion dimensions that we
previously proposed (Yanagisawa, et al. 2019, Front Comput Neurosci) to
consider perceived complexity as well as novelty, as a source of arousal
potential. Berlyne's hedonic function of arousal potential (or the inverse
U-shaped curve, the so-called Wundt curve) is assumed. We modeled the arousal
potential as information contents to be processed in the brain after sensory
stimuli are perceived (or recognized), which we termed sensory surprisal. We
mathematically demonstrated that sensory surprisal represents free energy, and
it is equivalent to a summation of information gain (or information from
novelty) and perceived complexity (or information from complexity), which are
the collative variables forming the arousal potential. We demonstrated
empirical evidence with visual stimuli (profile shapes of butterfly) supporting
the hypothesis that the summation of perceived novelty and complexity shapes
the inverse U-shaped beauty function. We discussed the potential of free energy
as a mathematical principle explaining emotion initiators.

 &lt;p&gt;Recording simultaneous activity of hundreds of neurons is now possible.
Existing methods can model such population activity, but do not directly reveal
the computations used by the brain. We present a fully unsupervised method that
models neuronal activity and reveals the computational strategy. The method
constructs a topological model of neuronal dynamics consisting of
interconnected loops. Transitions between loops mark computationally-salient
decisions. We accurately model activation of 100s of neurons in the primate
cortex during a working memory task. Dynamics of a recurrent neural network
(RNN) trained on the same task are topologically identical suggesting that a
similar computational strategy is used. The RNN trained on a modified dataset,
however, reveals a different topology. This topology predicts specific novel
stimuli that consistently elicit incorrect responses with near perfect
accuracy. Thus, our methodology yields a quantitative model of neuronal
activity and reveals the computational strategy used to solve the task.

 &lt;p&gt;We provide here a general mathematical framework to model attitudes towards
ambiguity which uses the formalism of quantum theory as a ``purely mathematical
formalism, detached from any physical interpretation''. We show that the
quantum-theoretic framework enables modelling of the &quot;Ellsberg paradox&quot;, but it
also successfully applies to more concrete human decision-making (DM) tests
involving financial, managerial and medical decisions. In particular, we
elaborate a mathematical representation of various empirical studies which
reveal that attitudes of managers towards uncertainty shift from &quot;ambiguity
seeking&quot; to &quot;ambiguity aversion&quot;, and viceversa, thus exhibiting &quot;hope effects&quot;
and &quot;fear effects&quot;. The present framework provides a promising direction
towards the development of a unified theory of decisions in the presence of
uncertainty.

 &lt;p&gt;Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are pentameric channels that mediate fast transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and defects in receptor expression underlie neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Nicotinic receptor expression at the NMJ is tightly regulated and we previously identified novel Golgi-retention signals in the β and δ subunit cytoplasmic loops that regulate trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface. Here, we show that the Golgi retention motifs are localized in the MX-helix, a juxta-membrane alpha-helix present in the proximal cytoplasmic loop of receptor subunits, which was defined in recent crystal structures of cys-loop receptor family members. First, mutational analysis of CD4-MX-helix chimeric proteins showed that the Golgi retention signal was dependent on both the amphipathic nature of the MX-helix and on specific lysine residues (βK353 and δK351). Moreover, retention was associated with ubiquitination of the lysines, and βK353R and δK351R mutations reduced ubiquitination and increased surface expression of CD4-β and δ MX-helix chimeric proteins. Second, mutation of these lysines in intact β and δ subunits perturbed Golgi-based glycosylation and surface trafficking of the AChR. Notably, combined βK353R and δK351R mutations increased the amount of surface AChR with immature forms of glycosylation, consistent with decreased Golgi retention and processing. Third, we found that previously identified CMS mutations in the ε subunit MX-helix decreased receptor assembly and surface levels, as did an analogous mutation introduced into the β subunit MX-helix. Together, these findings indicate that the subunit MX-helix contributes to receptor assembly and is required for normal expression of the AChR and function of the NMJ. In addition, specific determinants in the β and δ subunit MX-helix contribute to quality control of AChR expression by intracellular retention and ubiquitination of unassembled subunits, and by facilitating the appropriate glycosylation of assembled surface AChR.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-related impairment of mitochondrial function may negatively impact energy-demanding processes such as synaptic transmission thereby triggering cognitive decline and processes of neurodegeneration. Here, we present a novel model for age-related mitochondrial impairment based on partial inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (Cox4) of complex IV of the respiratory chain. miRNA-mediated knockdown of Cox4 correlated with a marked reduction in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic marker densities in vitro and in vivo as well as an impairment of neuronal network activity in primary neuronal cultures. Transcriptome analysis identified the deregulation of gene clusters, which link induced mitochondrial perturbation to impaired synaptic function and plasticity as well as processes of aging. In conclusion, the model of Cox4 deficiency reflects aspects of age-related dementia and might, therefore, serve as a novel test system for drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stroke is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. About 87% of stroke cases are ischemic, which disrupt the physiological activity of the brain, thus leading to a series of complex pathophysiological events. Despite decades of research on neuroprotectants to probe for suitable therapies against ischemic stroke, no successful results have been obtained, and new alternative approaches are urgently required in order to combat this pathological torment. To address these problems, drug repositioning/reprofiling is explored extensively. Drug repurposing aims to identify new uses for already established drugs, and this makes it an attractive commercial strategy. Nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) is reported to be involved in many physiological and pathological conditions, such as neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of atorvastatin, cephalexin, and mycophenolate against the NF-κB in ischemic stroke, as compared to the standard NF-κB inhibitor caeffic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE). An in-silico docking analysis was performed and their potential neuroprotective activities in the in vivo transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) rat model was examined. The percent (%) infarct area and 28-point composite neuro score were examined, and an immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were further performed to validate the neuroprotective role of these compounds in stroke as well as their potential as antioxidants. Our results demonstrated that these novels NF-κB inhibitors could attenuate ischemic stroke-induced neuronal toxicity by targeting NF-κB, a potential therapeutic approach in ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In female rats, the first sexual experience under paced mating conditions increases the number of newborn cells that migrate into the granular layer of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Repeated paced mating has a potentiating effect on the number of new neurons that migrate to the AOB compared with a single session 15 days after paced mating. On the other hand, one paced mating session does no increases the survival of new cells 45 days after mating. In the present study, we evaluated if four paced mating sessions could increase the survival of new neurons in the AOB and main olfactory bulb (MOB) 45 days after females mated. Sexually naive female rats were ovariectomized, hormonally supplemented and randomly assigned to one of five groups: (1) Control, no sexual contact (C); (2) Four sessions in which females were exposed, without mating, to a sexually experience male rat (SE); (3) One session of paced mating (PM1); (4) Four sessions of paced mating (PM4); and (5) Four sessions of non-paced mating (NPM4). In the first behavioral test, females received the DNA synthesis marker 5-bromo-2′deoxyuridine and were euthanized 45 days later. Our data showed that the number of new cells that survived in the mitral cell layer of the AOB decreased when females were exposed to a sexually active male, in comparison to females that mated once pacing the sexual interaction. Repeated sexual behavior in pacing conditions did not increase the survival of new cells in other layers of the MOB and AOB. However, a significant increase in the percentage of new neurons in the granular and glomerular layers of the AOB and granular layer of the MOB was observed in females that mated in four sessions pacing the sexual interaction. In the group that paced the sexual interaction for one session, a significant increase in the percentage of neurons was observed in the glomerular layer of the AOB. Our data suggest that repeated paced mating increases the percentage of new neurons that survive in the olfactory bulb of female rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nix is located in the outer membrane of mitochondria, mediates mitochondrial fission and implicated in many neurological diseases. However, the association between Nix and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has not previously been reported. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the expression of Nix and its role in early brain injury (EBI) after SAH. Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to various time points for investigation after SAH. A rat model of SAH was induced by injecting 0.3 ml of autologous non-heparinized arterial blood into the prechiasmatic cistern. The expression of Nix was investigated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Next, Nix-specific overexpression plasmids and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were separately administered. Western blot, neurological scoring, Morris water maze, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and fluoro-jade B (FJB) staining were performed to evaluate the role of Nix in EBI following SAH. We found that Nix was expressed in neurons and its expression level in the SAH groups was higher than that in the Sham group, which peaked at 24 h after SAH. Overexpression of Nix following SAH significantly decreased the expression of translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOMM20, a marker of mitochondria), ameliorated neurological/cognitive deficits induced by SAH, and reduced the total number of apoptotic/neurodegenerative cells, whereas siRNA knockdown of Nix yielded opposite effects. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the expression of Nix is increased in neurons after experimental SAH in rats, and may play a neuroprotective role in EBI following SAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The tongue performs movements in all directions to subserve its diverse functions in chewing, swallowing, and speech production. Using task-based functional MRI in a group of 17 healthy young participants, we studied (1) potential differences in the cerebral control of frontal (protrusion), horizontal (side to side), and vertical (elevation) tongue movements and (2) inter-individual differences in tongue motor control. To investigate differences between different tongue movements, we performed voxel-wise multiple linear regressions. To investigate inter-individual differences, we applied a novel approach, spatio-temporal filtering of independent components. For this approach, individual functional data were decomposed into spatially independent components and corresponding time courses using independent component analysis. A temporal filter (correlation with the expected brain response) was used to identify independent components time-locked to the tongue motor tasks. A spatial filter (cross-correlation with established neurofunctional systems) was used to identify brain activity not time-locked to the tasks. Our results confirm the importance of an extended bilateral cortical and subcortical network for the control of tongue movements. Frontal (protrusion) tongue movements, highly overlearned movements related to speech production, showed less activity in the frontal and parietal lobes compared to horizontal (side to side) and vertical (elevation) movements and greater activity in the left frontal and temporal lobes compared to vertical movements (cluster-forming threshold of Z &amp;gt; 3.1, cluster significance threshold of p &amp;lt; 0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons). The investigation of inter-individual differences revealed a component representing the tongue primary sensorimotor cortex time-locked to the task in all participants. Using the spatial filter, we found the default mode network in 16 of 17 participants, the left fronto-parietal network in 16, the right fronto-parietal network in 8, and the executive control network in four participants (Pearson's r &amp;gt; 0.4 between neurofunctional systems and individual components). These results demonstrate that spatio-temporal filtering of independent components allows to identify individual brain activity related to a specific task and also structured spatiotemporal processes representing known neurofunctional systems on an individual basis. This novel approach may be useful for the assessment of individual patients and results may be related to individual clinical, behavioral, and genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Peripheral infections can potently exacerbate neuropathological conditions, though the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a viral mimetic, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIC) induces a robust generation of CXCL10 chemokine in the hippocampus. The hippocampus also features hyperexcitability of neuronal circuits following PIC challenge. The present study was undertaken to determine the role of CXCL10 in mediating the development of hyperexcitability in response to PIC challenge. Briefly, young female C57BL/6 mice were i.p. injected with PIC, and after 24 h, the brains were analyzed by confocal microscopy. CXCL10 staining of neuronal perikarya and a less intense staining of the neuropil was observed in the hippocampus and cortex. CXCL10 staining was also evident in a subpopulation of astrocytes, whereas microglia were CXCL10 negative. CXCR3, the cognate receptor of CXCL10 was present exclusively on neurons, indicating that the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis operates through an autocrine/paracrine neuronal signaling. Blocking cerebral CXCR3 through intracerebroventricular injection of a specific inhibitor, AMG487, abrogated PIC challenge-induced increase in basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as the reduction of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), in the hippocampus. The PIC-mediated abolishment of hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) was also restored after administration of AMG487. Moreover, CXCR3 inhibition attenuated seizure hypersensitivity induced by PIC challenge. The efficacy of AMG487 strongly strengthens the notion that CXCL10/CXCR3 axis mediates the induction of cerebral hyperexcitability by PIC challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) has not been explained. We aimed to investigate whether miR-let-7i participates in the PSCI and illuminates its underlying role in oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Blood samples from 36 subjects with PSCI and 38 with post-stroke cognitive normality (Non-PSCI) were collected to evaluate the differential expression of miR-let-7 family members, using qRT-PCT analysis. Spearman correlation was performed to estimate the correlation between the miR-1et-7i level and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with OGD was used to induce cell apoptosis in vitro. Effects of miR-let-7i on OGD-induced cell apoptosis was estimated after transfection. The target gene of miR-let-7i was analyzed by dual luciferase reporter gene assay.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The expression of miR-let-7i was up-regulated in PSCI patients compared with Non-PSCI (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and negatively correlated with MoCA score (r = −0.643, p &amp;lt; 0.001). When exposed to OGD, SH-SY5Y cells showed significant apoptosis accompanied by miR-let-7i up-regulation. In OGD-treated cells, miR-let-7i up-regulation was accompanied by cell apoptosis, while down-regulation showed the opposite effect. Luciferase reporter assay showed that Bcl-2 was a target gene of miR-let-7i. Western blot showed that miR-let-7i up-regulation promoted Bcl-2 expression, while qRT-PCR showed that miR-let-7i had no effect on Bcl-2 expression.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;miR-let-7i was overexpressed in PSCI patients and it could be used as a diagnostic biomarker for PSCI. We illuminated the potential mechanism that miR-let-7i alleviated OGD-induced cell damage by targeting Bcl-2 at the post-transcriptional level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Preclinical studies suggest that stem cells may be a valuable therapeutic tool in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). As it has been demonstrated that there are molecular changes at the end-plate during the early stages of motorneuron degeneration in animal models, we hypothesize that the local effect of this stem cell delivery method could slow the progressive loss of motor units (MUs) in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We designed a Phase I/II clinical trial to study the safety of intramuscularly implanting autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs), including stem cells, in ALS patients and their possible effects on the MU of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Twenty-two patients participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that consisted of a baseline visit followed by one intramuscular injection of BMNCs, follow-up visits at 30, 90, 180, and 360 days, and an additional year of clinical follow-up. In each patient, one TA muscle was injected with a single dose of BMMCs while the contralateral muscle was given a placebo; the sides were selected randomly. All visits included a complete EMG study of both TA muscles.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results show that (1) the intramuscular injection of BMMCs is a safe procedure; (2) ALS patients show heterogeneities in the degree of TA injury; (3) a comparison of placebo-injected muscles with BMMC-injected muscles showed significant differences in only one parameter, the D50 index used to quantify the Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) scan curve. This parameter was higher in the BMMC-injected TA muscle at both 90 days (placebo side: 29.55 ± 2.89, n = 20; experimental side: 39.25 ± 3.21, n = 20; p &amp;lt; 0.01) and 180 days (placebo side: 29.35 ± 3.29, n = 17; experimental side: 41.24 ± 3.34, n = 17; p &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This procedure had no effect on the TA muscle MU properties, with the exception of the D50 index. Finding differences in just this index supports the fact that it may be much more sensitive than other electrophysiological parameters when studying treatment effects. Given the low number of patients and their heterogeneity, these results justify exploring the efficacy of this procedure in further patients and other muscles, through Phase II trials.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT02286011); EudraCT number 2011-004801-25.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This study explored whether a Brief Form of the California Odor Learning Test 3 (COLT), an olfactory analog of the newly released Brief Form of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT 3), could retain the ability of the COLT to detect odor memory dysfunctions observed in normal aging. 52 participants, 28 young (18–30 years old) and 24 old (65 years of age and older), were administered the Brief Forms of the CVLT 3 and the COLT 3. Results indicated poorer performance in immediate and delayed odor recall in older than in younger adults. Poorer odor recognition memory performance in older adults than in younger adults was detected. This study suggests that the Brief Form of the COLT can detect differential odor learning and memory between young and older adults. Thus, the current brief test holds promise as a measure that can be incorporated into studies that demand a brief, non-invasive test capable of detecting impairment in olfactory function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;The detection of large vessel occlusion (LVO) plays a critical role in the diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Identifying LVO in the pre-hospital setting or early stage of hospitalization would increase the patients’ chance of receiving appropriate reperfusion therapy and thereby improve neurological recovery.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;To enable rapid identification of LVO, we established an automated evaluation system based on all recorded AIS patients in Hong Kong Hospital Authority’s hospitals in 2016. The 300 study samples were randomly selected based on a disproportionate sampling plan within the integrated electronic health record system, and then separated into a group of 200 patients for model training, and another group of 100 patients for model performance evaluation. The evaluation system contained three hierarchical models based on patients’ demographic data, clinical data and non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. The first two levels of modeling utilized structured demographic and clinical data, while the third level involved additional NCCT imaging features obtained from deep learning model. All three levels’ modeling adopted multiple machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost). The optimal cut-off for the likelihood of LVO was determined by the maximal Youden index based on 10-fold cross-validation. Comparisons of performance on the testing group were made between these techniques.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Among the 300 patients, there were 160 women and 140 men aged from 27 to 104 years (mean 76.0 with standard deviation 13.4). LVO was present in 130 (43.3%) patients. Together with clinical and imaging features, the XGBoost model at the third level of evaluation achieved the best model performance on testing group. The Youden index, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.638, 0.800, 0.953, 0.684, 0.804, and 0.847, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study combining both structured clinical data with non-structured NCCT imaging data for the diagnosis of LVO in the acute setting, with superior performance compared to previously reported approaches. Our system is capable of automatically providing preliminary evaluations at different pre-hospital stages for potential AIS patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the classical Turing test, participants are challenged to tell whether they are interacting with another human being or with a machine. The way the interaction takes place is not direct, but a distant conversation through computer screen messages. Basic forms of interaction are face-to-face and embodied, context-dependent and based on the detection of reciprocal sensorimotor contingencies. Our idea is that interaction detection requires the integration of proprioceptive and interoceptive patterns with sensorimotor patterns, within quite short time lapses, so that they appear as mutually contingent, as reciprocal. In other words, the experience of interaction takes place when sensorimotor patterns are contingent upon one’s own movements, and vice versa. I react to your movement, you react to mine. When I notice both components, I come to experience an interaction. Therefore, we designed a “minimal” Turing test to investigate how much information is required to detect these reciprocal sensorimotor contingencies. Using a new version of the perceptual crossing paradigm, we tested whether participants resorted to interaction detection to tell apart human from machine agents in repeated encounters with these agents. In two studies, we presented participants with movements of a human agent, either online or offline, and movements of a computerized oscillatory agent in three different blocks. In each block, either auditory or audiovisual feedback was provided along each trial. Analysis of participants’ explicit responses and of the implicit information subsumed in the dynamics of their series will reveal evidence that participants use the reciprocal sensorimotor contingencies within short time windows. For a machine to pass this minimal Turing test, it should be able to generate this sort of reciprocal contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Spatial selective attention greatly affects our processing of complex visual scenes, yet the way in which the brain selects relevant objects while suppressing irrelevant objects is still unclear. Evidence of these processes has been found using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). However, few studies have characterized these measures during attention to dynamic stimuli, and little is known regarding how these measures change with increased scene complexity. Here, we compared attentional modulation of the EEG N1 and alpha power (oscillations between 8–14 Hz) across three visual selective attention tasks. The tasks differed in the number of irrelevant stimuli presented, but all required sustained attention to the orientation trajectory of a lateralized stimulus. In scenes with few irrelevant stimuli, top-down control of spatial attention is associated with strong modulation of both the N1 and alpha power across parietal-occipital channels. In scenes with many irrelevant stimuli in both hemifields, however, top-down control is no longer represented by strong modulation of alpha power, and N1 amplitudes are overall weaker. These results suggest that as a scene becomes more complex, requiring suppression in both hemifields, the neural signatures of top-down control degrade, likely reflecting some limitation in EEG to represent this suppression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;High-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) signals play an important role in research on human emotions. However, the different network patterns under different emotional states in the high gamma band (50–80 Hz) remain unclear. In this paper, we investigate different emotional states using functional network analysis on various frequency bands. We constructed multiple functional networks on different frequency bands and performed functional network analysis and time–frequency analysis on these frequency bands to determine the significant features that represent different emotional states. Furthermore, we verified the effectiveness of these features by using them in emotion recognition. Our experimental results revealed that the network connections in the high gamma band with significant differences among the positive, neutral, and negative emotional states were much denser than the network connections in the other frequency bands. The connections mainly occurred in the left prefrontal, left temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Moreover, long-distance connections with significant differences among the emotional states were observed in the high frequency bands, particularly in the high gamma band. Additionally, high gamma band fusion features derived from the global efficiency, network connections, and differential entropies achieved the highest classification accuracies for both our dataset and the public dataset. These results are consistent with literature and provide further evidence that high gamma band EEG signals are more sensitive and effective than the EEG signals in other frequency bands in studying human affective perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The acquisition and evolution of speech production, discourse and communication can be negatively impacted by brain malformations. We describe, for the first time, a case of developmental dynamic dysphasia (DDD) in a right-handed adolescent boy (subject D) with cortical malformations involving language-eloquent regions (inferior frontal gyrus) in both the left and the right hemispheres. Language evaluation revealed a markedly reduced verbal output affecting phonemic and semantic fluency, phrase and sentence generation and verbal communication in everyday life. Auditory comprehension, repetition, naming, reading and spelling were relatively preserved, but executive function was impaired. Multimodal neuroimaging showed a malformed cerebral cortex with atypical configuration and placement of white matter tracts bilaterally and abnormal callosal fibers. Dichotic listening showed right hemisphere dominance for language, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) additionally revealed dissociated hemispheric language representation with right frontal activation for phonology and bilateral dominance for semantic processing. Moreover, subject D also had congenital mirror movements (CMM), defined as involuntary movements of one side of the body that mirror intentional movements of the other side. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and fMRI during voluntary unimanual (left and right) hand movements showed bilateral motor cortex recruitment and tractography revealed a lack of decussation of bilateral corticospinal tracts. Genetic testing aimed to detect mutations that disrupt the development of commissural tracts correlating with CMM (e.g., Germline DCC mutations) was negative. Overall, our findings suggest that DDD in subject D resulted from the underdevelopment of the left inferior frontal gyrus with limited capacity for plastic reorganization by its homologous counterpart in the right hemisphere. Corpus callosum anomalies probably contributed to hinder interhemispheric connectivity necessary to compensate language and communication deficits after left frontal involvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Retinal degenerative diseases (RDDs) are the leading causes of blindness and currently lack effective treatment. Cytotherapy has become a promising strategy for RDDs. The transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) or neural stem cells (NSCs) has recently been applied for the experimental treatment of RDDs. However, the long-term outcomes of single-cell transplantation are poor. The combined transplantation of multiple types of cells might achieve better effects. In the present study, OECs [containing olfactory nerve fibroblasts (ONFs)] and NSCs were cotransplanted into the subretinal space of Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats. Using electroretinogram (ERG), immunofluorescence, Western blot, and in vitro Transwell system, the differences in the electrophysiological and morphological changes of single and combined transplantation as well as the underlying mechanisms were explored at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperation. In addition, using the Transwell system, the influence of OECs on the stemness of NSCs was discovered. Results showed that, compared to the single transplantation of OECs or NSCs, the combined transplantation of OECs and NSCs produced greater improvements in b-wave amplitudes in ERGs and the thickness of the outer nuclear layer at all three time points. More endogenous stem cells were found within the retina after combined transplantation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression decreased significantly when NSCs were cotransplanted with OECs. Both the vertical and horizontal migration of grafted cells were enhanced in the combined transplantation group. Meanwhile, the stemness of NSCs was also better maintained after coculture with OECs. Taken together, the results suggested that the combined transplantation of NSCs and OECs enhanced the improvement in retinal protection in RCS rats, providing a new strategy to treat RDDs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Currently, there is a lack of biomarkers to identify individuals in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A preponderance of evidence suggests that neurodegenerative processes that affect the brain, may also affect the retina. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive approach, many have shown thinning of the retina in AD and the developmental precursor to AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the relationship between retinal thickness and cognitive function is not entirely clear. This is likely due to the disparity in diagnostic criteria used to determine MCI that does not fully probe the cognitive domains that are particularly vulnerable to aging. This study used a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment involving multiple domains of cognition to determine if retinal thickness correlates with cognitive performance in a normal aged population. In this study, 20 healthy individuals between 60 and 90 years of age were administered neuropsychological assessments probing various domains of cognitive function, and OCT to measure peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. We found that RNFL thickness is correlated with neuropsychological performance in multiple cognitive domains (e.g., working memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function). Our work demonstrates a positive correlation between RNFL thickness and several, but not all, domains of cognitive function in a normative aging population. By determining which cognitive domains retinal thickness can predict, this work can help identify individuals at risk or in preclinical stages of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system underlies the onset of the typical motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites (LN), proteinaceous inclusions mainly composed of insoluble α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils are key neuropathological hallmarks of the brain of affected patients. Compelling evidence supports that in the early prodromal phases of PD, synaptic terminal and axonal alterations initiate and drive a retrograde degeneration process culminating with the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. This notwithstanding, the molecular triggers remain to be fully elucidated. Although it has been shown that α-syn fibrillary aggregation can induce early synaptic and axonal impairment and cause nigrostriatal degeneration, we still ignore how and why α-syn fibrillation begins. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factors, key regulators of inflammation and apoptosis, are involved in the brain programming of systemic aging as well as in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. The NF-κB family of factors consists of five different subunits (c-Rel, p65/RelA, p50, RelB, and p52), which combine to form transcriptionally active dimers. Different findings point out a role of RelA in PD. Interestingly, the nuclear content of RelA is abnormally increased in nigral dopamine (DA) neurons and glial cells of PD patients. Inhibition of RelA exert neuroprotection against (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) MPTP and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) toxicity, suggesting that this factor decreases neuronal resilience. Conversely, the c-Rel subunit can exert neuroprotective actions. We recently described that mice deficient for c-Rel develop a PD-like motor and non-motor phenotype characterized by progressive brain α-syn accumulation and early synaptic changes preceding the frank loss of nigrostriatal neurons. This evidence supports that dysregulations in this transcription factors may be involved in the onset of PD. This review highlights observations supporting a possible interplay between NF-κB dysregulation and α-syn pathology in PD, with the aim to disclose novel potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Understanding the function of genes within staple crops will accelerate crop improvement by allowing targeted breeding approaches. Despite their importance, a lack of genomic information and resources has hindered the functional characterisation of genes in major crops. The recent release of high-quality reference sequences for these crops underpins a suite of genetic and genomic resources that support basic research and breeding. For wheat, these include gene model annotations, expression atlases and gene networks that provide information about putative function. Sequenced mutant populations, improved transformation protocols and structured natural populations provide rapid methods to study gene function directly. We highlight a case study exemplifying how to integrate these resources. This review provides a helpful guide for plant scientists, especially those expanding into crop research, to capitalise on the discoveries made in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; and other plants. This will accelerate the improvement of crops of vital importance for food and nutrition security.</content>

		<content type="html">
 At vertebrate neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), the synaptic basal lamina contains different extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and synaptogenic factors that induce and maintain synaptic specializations. Here, we report that podosome-like structures (PLSs) induced by ubiquitous ECM proteins regulate the formation and remodeling of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters via focal ECM degradation. Mechanistically, ECM degradation is mediated by PLS-directed trafficking and surface insertion of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) to AChR clusters through microtubule-capturing mechanisms. Upon synaptic induction, MT1-MMP plays a crucial role in the recruitment of aneural AChR clusters for the assembly of postsynaptic specializations. Lastly, the structural defects of NMJs in embryonic MT1-MMP&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice further demonstrate the physiological role of MT1-MMP in normal NMJ development. Collectively, this study suggests that postsynaptic MT1-MMP serves as a molecular switch to synaptogenesis by modulating local ECM environment for the deposition of synaptogenic signals that regulate postsynaptic differentiation at developing NMJs.</content>

 By sequencing autozygous human populations we identified a healthy adult woman with lifelong complete knockout of &lt;i&gt;HAO1&lt;/i&gt; (expected ~1 in 30 million outbred people). &lt;i&gt;HAO1&lt;/i&gt; (glycolate oxidase) silencing is the mechanism of lumasiran, an investigational RNA interference therapeutic for primary hyperoxaluria type 1. Her plasma glycolate levels were 12 times, and urinary glycolate 6 times, the upper limit of normal observed in healthy reference individuals (n=67). Plasma metabolomics and lipidomics (1871 biochemicals) revealed 18 markedly elevated biochemicals (&amp;gt;5sd outliers versus n=25 controls) suggesting additional HAO1 effects. Comparison with lumasiran preclinical and clinical trial data suggested she has &amp;lt;2% residual glycolate oxidase activity. Cell line p.Leu333SerfsTer4 expression showed markedly reduced HAO1 protein levels and cellular protein mis-localisation. In this woman, lifelong &lt;i&gt;HAO1&lt;/i&gt; knockout is safe and without clinical phenotype, de-risking a therapeutic approach and informing therapeutic mechanisms. Unlocking evidence from the diversity of human genetic variation can facilitate drug development.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Innate defensive behaviors, such as freezing, are adaptive for avoiding predation. Freezing-related midbrain regions project to the cerebellum, which is known to regulate rapid sensorimotor integration, raising the question of cerebellar contributions to freezing. Here, we find that neurons of the mouse medial (fastigial) cerebellar nuclei (mCbN), which fire spontaneously with wide dynamic ranges, send glutamatergic projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), which contains diverse cell types. In freely moving mice, optogenetically stimulating glutamatergic vlPAG neurons that express Chx10 reliably induces freezing. In vlPAG slices, mCbN terminals excite ~20% of neurons positive for Chx10 or GAD2 and ~70% of dopaminergic TH-positive neurons. Stimulating either mCbN afferents or TH neurons augments IPSCs and suppresses EPSCs in Chx10 neurons by activating postsynaptic D2 receptors. The results suggest that mCbN activity regulates dopaminergic modulation of the vlPAG, favoring inhibition of Chx10 neurons. Suppression of cerebellar output may therefore facilitate freezing.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Carbon catabolite repression 4 (CCR4) is a conserved mRNA deadenylase regulating posttranscriptional gene expression. However, regulation of CCR4 in virus infections is less understood. Here, we characterized a pro-viral role of CCR4 in replication of a plant cytorhabdovirus&lt;i&gt;, Barley yellow striate mosaic virus&lt;/i&gt; (BYSMV). The barley (&lt;i&gt;Hordeum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;) CCR4 protein (HvCCR4) was identified to interact with the BYSMV phosphoprotein (P). The BYSMV P protein recruited HvCCR4 from processing bodies (PBs) into viroplasm-like bodies. Overexpression of HvCCR4 promoted BYSMV replication in plants. Conversely, knockdown of the small brown planthopper CCR4 inhibited viral accumulation in the insect vector. Biochemistry experiments revealed that HvCCR4 was recruited into N–RNA complexes by the BYSMV P protein and triggered turnover of N-bound cellular mRNAs, thereby releasing RNA-free N protein to bind viral genomic RNA for optimal viral replication. Our results demonstrate that the co-opted the CCR4-mediated RNA decay facilitates cytorhabdovirus replication in plants and insects.</content>

 Breakthrough technologies for monitoring and manipulating single-neuron activity provide unprecedented opportunities for whole-brain neuroscience in larval zebrafish&lt;sup&gt;1–9&lt;/sup&gt;. Understanding the neural mechanisms of visually guided behavior also requires precise stimulus control, but little prior research has accounted for physical distortions that result from refraction and reflection at an air-water interface that usually separates the projected stimulus from the fish&lt;sup&gt;10–12&lt;/sup&gt;. Here we provide a computational tool that transforms between projected and received stimuli in order to detect and control these distortions. The tool considers the most commonly encountered interface geometry, and we show that this and other common configurations produce stereotyped distortions. By correcting these distortions, we reduced discrepancies in the literature concerning stimuli that evoke escape behavior&lt;sup&gt;13,14&lt;/sup&gt;, and we expect this tool will help reconcile other confusing aspects of the literature. This tool also aids experimental design, and we illustrate the dangers that uncorrected stimuli pose to receptive field mapping experiments.</content>

 The molecular underpinnings of antibiotic resistance are increasingly understood, but less is known about how these molecular events influence microbial dynamics on the population scale. Here we show that the dynamics of &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; communities exposed to antibiotics can be surprisingly rich, revealing scenarios where increasing population size or delaying drug exposure can promote population collapse. Specifically, we demonstrate how density-dependent feedback loops couple population growth and antibiotic efficacy when communities include drug-resistant subpopulations, leading to a wide range of behavior, including population survival, collapse, or one of two qualitatively distinct bistable behaviors where survival is favored in either small or large populations. These dynamics reflect competing density-dependent effects of different subpopulations, with growth of drug-sensitive cells increasing but growth of drug-resistant cells decreasing effective drug inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate how populations receiving immediate drug influx may sometimes thrive, while identical populations exposed to delayed drug influx collapse.</content>

 Rett syndrome is an incurable neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding for methyl-CpG binding-protein 2 (MeCP2). Gene therapy for this disease presents inherent hurdles since &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; is expressed throughout the brain and its duplication leads to severe neurological conditions as well. Herein, we use the AAV-PHP.eB to deliver an instability-prone &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; (i&lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;) transgene cassette which, increasing RNA destabilization and inefficient protein translation of the viral &lt;i&gt;Mecp2 &lt;/i&gt;transgene, limits supraphysiological Mecp2 protein levels. Intravenous injections of the PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus in symptomatic &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice significantly improved locomotor activity, lifespan and gene expression normalization. Remarkably, PHP.eB-iMecp2 administration was well tolerated in female &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutant or in wild-type animals. In contrast, we observed a strong immune response to the transgene in treated male &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice that was overcome by immunosuppression. Overall, PHP.eB-mediated delivery of i&lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; provided widespread and efficient gene transfer maintaining physiological Mecp2 protein levels in the brain.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Although Rad51 is the key protein in homologous recombination (HR), a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway, several auxiliary factors interact with Rad51 to promote productive HR. We present an interdisciplinary characterization of the interaction between Rad51 and Swi5-Sfr1, a conserved auxiliary factor. Two distinct sites within the intrinsically disordered N-terminus of Sfr1 (Sfr1N) were found to cooperatively bind Rad51. Deletion of this domain impaired Rad51 stimulation in vitro and rendered cells sensitive to DNA damage. By contrast, amino acid-substitution mutants, which had comparable biochemical defects, could promote DNA repair, suggesting that Sfr1N has another role in addition to Rad51 binding. Unexpectedly, the DNA repair observed in these mutants was dependent on Rad55-Rad57, another auxiliary factor complex hitherto thought to function independently of Swi5-Sfr1. When combined with the finding that they form a higher-order complex, our results imply that Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 can collaboratively stimulate Rad51 in &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt;.</content>

 Germinal centres (GCs) are T follicular helper cell (Tfh)-dependent structures that form in response to vaccination, producing long-lived antibody secreting plasma cells and memory B cells that protect against subsequent infection. With advancing age the GC and Tfh cell response declines, resulting in impaired humoral immunity. We sought to discover what underpins the poor Tfh cell response in ageing and whether it is possible to correct it. Here, we demonstrate that older people and aged mice have impaired Tfh cell differentiation upon vaccination. This deficit is preceded by poor activation of conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2) due to reduced type 1 interferon signalling. Importantly, the Tfh and cDC2 cell response can be boosted in aged mice by treatment with a TLR7 agonist. This demonstrates that age-associated defects in the cDC2 and Tfh cell response are not irreversible and can be enhanced to improve vaccine responses in older individuals.</content>

 Intracellular transport is predominantly heterogeneous in both time and space, exhibiting varying non-Brownian behavior. Characterization of this movement through averaging methods over an ensemble of trajectories or over the course of a single trajectory often fails to capture this heterogeneity. Here, we developed a deep learning feedforward neural network trained on fractional Brownian motion, providing a novel, accurate and efficient method for resolving heterogeneous behavior of intracellular transport in space and time. The neural network requires significantly fewer data points compared to established methods. This enables robust estimation of Hurst exponents for very short time series data, making possible direct, dynamic segmentation and analysis of experimental tracks of rapidly moving cellular structures such as endosomes and lysosomes. By using this analysis, fractional Brownian motion with a stochastic Hurst exponent was used to interpret, for the first time, anomalous intracellular dynamics, revealing unexpected differences in behavior between closely related endocytic organelles.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The cardiac ventricular action potential depends on several voltage-gated ion channels, including Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, and K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; channels. Mutations in these channels can cause Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) which increases the risk for ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have emerged as potential therapeutics for LQTS because they are modulators of voltage-gated ion channels. Here we demonstrate that PUFA analogues vary in their selectivity for human voltage-gated ion channels involved in the ventricular action potential. The effects of specific PUFA analogues range from selective for a specific ion channel to broadly modulating cardiac ion channels from all three families (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, and K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;). In addition, a PUFA analogue selective for the cardiac I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; channel (Kv7.1/KCNE1) is effective in shortening the cardiac action potential in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Our data suggest that PUFA analogues could potentially be developed as therapeutics for LQTS and cardiac arrhythmia.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In high-income countries, the biggest cause of premature death, defined as death before 70 years, is smoking of manufactured cigarettes. Smoking-related disease was responsible for about 41 million deaths in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, cumulatively, from 1960 to 2020. Every million cigarettes smoked leads to one death in the US and Canada, but slightly more than one death in the UK. The 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century hazards reveal that smokers who start smoking early in adult life and do not quit lose a decade of life expectancy versus non-smokers. Cessation, particularly before age 40 years, yields large reductions in mortality risk. Up to two-thirds of deaths among smokers are avoidable at non-smoking death rates, and former smokers have about only a quarter of the excess risk of death compared to current smokers. The gap between scientific and popular understanding of smoking hazards is surprisingly large.</content>

 New neurons undergo a critical period soon after migration during which the behavior of the animal may result in the survival or culling of these cells. In the songbird song system, new neurons may be maintained in the song motor pathway with respect to motor progression toward a target song--during juvenile song learning, seasonal song restructuring, and experimentally manipulated song variability. However, it is not known whether the quality of song per se, without progressive improvement, may also influence new neuron survival. To test this idea, we experimentally altered song acoustic structure by unilateral denervation of the syrinx. We found no effect of aberrant song on numbers of new neurons in the HVC of the song motor pathway, a loss of left-side dominance in new neurons in the auditory region caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), and a bilateral decrease in new neurons in the basal ganglia nucleus Area X. We propose new neuron survival may be determined in response to behavioral feedback in accordance with the function of new neurons within a given brain region. Studying the effects of singing behaviors on new neurons across multiple brain regions that subserve singing may give rise to general rules underlying the regulation of new neuron survival across taxa and brain regions more broadly.</content>

 The ability to group sensory stimuli into categories is crucial for efficient interaction with a rich and ever-changing environment. In olfaction, basic features of categorical representation of odours were observed as early as in the olfactory bulb (OB). Categorical representation was described in mitral cells (MCs) as sudden transitions in responses to odours that were morphed along a continuum. However, it remains unclear to what extent such response dynamics actually reflects perceptual categories and decisions therein. Here, we tested the role of learning on category formation in the mouse OB, using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and behaviour. We imaged MCs responses in naive mice and in awake behaving mice as they learned two tasks with different classification logic. In one task, a 1-decision boundary task, animals learned to classify odour mixtures based on the dominant compound in the mixtures. As expected, categorical representation of close by odours, which was evident already in naive animals, further increased following learning. In a second task, a multi-decision boundary task, animals learned to classify odours independent of their chemical similarity. Rather, odour discrimination was based on the meaning ascribed to them (either rewarding or not). Following the second task, odour representations by MCs reorganized according to the odour value in the new category. This functional reorganization was also reflected as a shift from predominantly excitatory odour responses to predominantly inhibitory odour responses. Our data shows that odour representations by MCs is flexible, shaped by task demands, and carry category-related information.</content>

 Metal implants are used worldwide, with millions of metal nails, plates and fixtures grafted during orthopaedic surgeries. Iron is the most common element of these metal implants. As time passes metal elements can be corroded and iron can be released from the implants in the form of ferric (Fe3+) or ferrous (Fe2+). These iron ions can permeate the surrounding tissues and enter circulation; importantly both Fe3+ and Fe2+ freely pass blood brain barrier (BBB). Can iron from implants represent a risk factor for neurological diseases? This remains an unanswered question. In this study, we discovered that the probability of metal implants delivered through orthopaedic surgeries was higher in patients of Parkinson's diseases (PD) or ischemic stroke than in healthy subjects. This finding instigated subsequent study of iron effects on neuronal cells. In experiments in vivo, we found that iron selectively decreased presence of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) in neurones through increasing the expression of Ndfip1, which degrades DMT1 and rarely exists in glial cells. At the same time iron accumulation increased expression of DMT1 in astrocytes and microglial cells and triggered reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation. Facing the attack of excess iron, glial cells act as neuroprotectors to uptake more extracellular iron by up-regulating DMT1, whereas neurones limit iron uptake through decreasing DMT1 operation. Cerebral accumulation of iron was associated with impaired cognition, locomotion and mood. Excess iron thus affects neural cells and could increase the risk of neurodegeneration.</content>

 There is increasing evidence that the hippocampus is involved in language production and verbal communication, although little is known about its possible role. According to one view, hippocampus contributes semantic memory to spoken language. Alternatively, hippocampus is involved in the processing the (mis)match between expected sensory consequences of speaking and the perceived speech feedback. In the current study, we re-analysed functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data of two overt picture-naming studies to test whether hippocampus is involved in speech production and, if so, whether the results can distinguish between a 'pure memory' versus an 'expectation' account of hippocampal involvement. In both studies, participants overtly named pictures during scanning while hearing their own speech feedback unimpededly or impaired by a superimposed noise mask. Results showed decreased hippocampal activity when speech feedback was impaired, compared to when feedback was unimpeded. Further, we found increased functional coupling between auditory cortex and hippocampus during unimpeded speech feedback, compared to impaired feedback. Finally, we found significant functional coupling between a hippocampal/supplementary motor area (SMA) interaction term and auditory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum during overt picture naming, but not during listening to one's own pre-recorded voice. These findings indicate that hippocampus plays a role in speech production that is in accordance with an 'expectation' view of hippocampal functioning.</content>

 We performed transcriptome analysis using RNAseq on substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) from mice after single exposure, 14 days after daily MPTP treatment and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Single dose of MPTP resulted in downregulation of genes involved in sodium channel regulation, which was also observed after 14 days. Upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways was seen after single dose but not after 14 days of MPTP treatment. Dopamine biosynthesis and synaptic vesicle recycling pathways were downregulated both in mice after 14 days of MPTP and PD patients. LMX1B, that is essential for midbrain development and determination of dopaminergic phenotype and other genes including FOXA1, RSPO2, KLHL1, EBF3, PITX3, RGS4, ALDH1A1, RET, FOXA2, EN1, DLK1, GFRA1, LMX1A, NR4A2, GAP43, SNCA, PBX1 and GRB10 were downregulated in human PD. Downregulation of ensemble of genes involved in development and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons indicate their critical involvement in pathogenesis and progression of human PD.</content>

 Timing and its variability are critical for behavior. Consequently, neural circuits that take part in the control of timing and in the measurement of temporal intervals have been the subject of much research. Here, we provide an analytical and computational account of the temporal variability in what is perhaps the simplest model of a timing circuit, the synfire chain. We elucidate the statistical structure of its trial-to-trial timing variability and show that it is well-described by a statistical model which consists of local, global, and jitter components. We relate each of these components to distinct biological mechanisms. A synfire chain architecture is thought to underlie the circuit that takes part in the control and timing of zebra finch song; we find that the structure of trial-to-trial timing variability in the synfire chain is consistent with experimental observations of the song's temporal variability. Our study therefore provides a neuronal account of behavioral variability in zebra finches.</content>

 Although It is widely recognized that virtually all antidepressants (ADs) suppress rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the effects of chronic AD treatments on sleep abnormalities, especially those of REM sleep, have rarely been investigated comprehensively in animal models of major depressive disorder (MDD). Here, we show that chronic social defeat stress (SDS) in rats induces prolonged social avoidance and MDD-like alterations in sleep architecture (increased REM sleep durations, bouts, and shortened REM latency) even a month after the last SDS. These abnormalities were associated with changes in electroencephalography (EEG) spectra powers, such as reduced REM sleep theta powers during the light phase. Chronic AD treatments significantly ameliorated these behavioral, sleep, and EEG abnormalities, although in some cases not to control levels. Interestingly, the social interaction ratios a month after the last SDS most strongly correlated with the REM sleep theta powers. These results suggest that chronic AD treatments suppress REM sleep durations and bouts as observed in human MDD patients, but, at the same time, increase REM sleep theta power. The latter is an EEG parameter that has never been directly investigated in humans, and which may be responsible for the therapeutic effects of ADs.</content>

 The hypothalamus is the central regulator of energy homeostasis. Hypothalamic neuronal circuits are disrupted upon overfeeding, and play a role in the development of metabolic disorders. While mouse models have been extensively employed for understanding mechanisms of hypothalamic dysfunction, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on hypothalamic nuclei has been challenging. We implemented a robust glucose-induced fMRI paradigm that allows to repeatedly investigate hypothalamic responses to glucose. This approach was used to test the hypothesis that hypothalamic nuclei functioning is impaired in mice exposed to a high-fat and high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 7 days. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal was measured from brains of mice under light isoflurane anaesthesia, during which a 2.6 g/kg glucose load was administered. The mouse hypothalamus responded to glucose but not saline administration with a biphasic BOLD fMRI signal reduction. Relative to controls, HFHSD-fed mice showed attenuated or blunted responses in arcuate nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus, but not in paraventricular nucleus. In sum, we have developed an fMRI paradigm that is able to determine dysfunction of glucose-sensing neuronal circuits within the mouse hypothalamus in a non-invasive manner.</content>

In order to monitor progress towards malaria elimination, it is crucial to be able to measure changes in spatio-temporal transmission. However, common metrics of malaria transmission such as parasite prevalence are under powered in elimination contexts. China has achieved major reductions in malaria incidence and is on track to eliminate, having reporting zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to model a latent diffusion process and estimate the joint likelihood of transmission between cases and the number of cases with unobserved sources of infection. This is used to estimate the case reproduction number, &lt;i&gt;Rc&lt;/i&gt;. We use these estimates within spatio-temporal geostatistical models to map how transmission varied over time and space, estimate the timeline to elimination and the risk of resurgence. We estimate the mean &lt;i&gt;Rc&lt;/i&gt; between 2011 and 2016 to be 0.171 (95% CI = 0.165, 0.178) for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; cases and 0.089 (95% CI = 0.076, 0.103) for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; cases. From 2014 onwards, no cases were estimated to have a &lt;i&gt;Rc&lt;/i&gt; value above one. An unobserved source of infection was estimated to be moderately likely (p&amp;gt;0.5) for 19/ 611 cases and high (p&amp;gt;0.8) for 2 cases, suggesting very high levels of case ascertainment. Our estimates suggest that, maintaining current intervention efforts, Yunnan is unlikely to experience sustained local transmission up to 2020. However, even with a mean of 0.005 projected up to 2020, locally-acquired cases are possible due to high levels of importation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mHXGGoKa4eY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

There is a long-standing interest in understanding host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics and associated fitness effects. Increasing amounts of genomic data for both interacting species offer a promising source to identify candidate loci and to infer the main parameters of the past coevolutionary history. However, so far no method exists to perform the latter. By coupling a gene-for-gene model with coalescent simulations, we first show that three types of biological costs, namely, resistance, infectivity and infection, define the allele frequencies at the internal equilibrium point of the coevolution model. These in return determine the strength of selective signatures at the coevolving host and parasite loci. We apply an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach on simulated datasets to infer these costs by jointly integrating host and parasite polymorphism data at the coevolving loci. To control for the effect of genetic drift on coevolutionary dynamics, we assume that 10 or 30 repetitions are available from controlled experiments or several natural populations. We study two scenarios: 1) the cost of infection and population sizes (host and parasite) are unknown while costs of infectivity and resistance are known, and 2) all three costs are unknown while populations sizes are known. Using the ABC model choice procedure, we show that for both scenarios, we can distinguish with high accuracy pairs of coevolving host and parasite loci from pairs of neutrally evolving loci, though the statistical power decreases with higher cost of infection. The accuracy of parameter inference is high under both scenarios especially when using both host and parasite data because parasite polymorphism data do inform on costs applying to the host and vice-versa. As the false positive rate to detect pairs of genes under coevolution is small, we suggest that our method complements recently developed methods to identify host and parasite candidate loci for functional studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vxof39ymxB8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Two-photon imaging studies in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) consistently report that around half of the neurons respond to oriented grating stimuli. However, in cats and primates, nearly all neurons respond to such stimuli. Here we show that mouse V1 responsiveness and selectivity strongly depends on neuronal depth. Moving from superficial layer 2 down to layer 4, the percentage of visually responsive neurons nearly doubled, ultimately reaching levels similar to what is seen in other species. Over this span, the amplitude of neuronal responses also doubled. Moreover, stimulus selectivity was also modulated, not only with depth but also with response amplitude. Specifically, we found that orientation and direction selectivity were greater in stronger responding neurons, but orientation selectivity decreased with depth whereas direction selectivity increased. Importantly, these depth-dependent trends were found not just between layer 2/3 and layer 4 but at different depths within layer 2/3 itself. Thus, neuronal depth is an important factor to consider when pooling neurons for population analyses. Furthermore, the inability to drive the majority of cells in superficial layer 2/3 of mouse V1 with grating stimuli indicates that there may be fundamental differences in the micro-circuitry and role of V1 between rodents and other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The number and function of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) tightly regulates excitatory synaptic transmission. Current evidence suggests that AMPARs are inserted into the postsynaptic membrane during long-term potentiation (LTP) and are removed from the membrane during long-term depression (LTD). Dephosphorylation of GluA1 at Ser845 and enhanced endocytosis are critical events in the modulation of LTD. Moreover, changes in scaffold proteins from the postsynaptic density (PSD) could be also related to AMPAR regulation in LTD. In the present study we analyzed the effect of chemical LTD (cLTD) on A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 150 and AMPARs levels in mouse-cultured neurons. We show that cLTD induces AKAP150 protein degradation via proteasome, coinciding with GluA1 dephosphorylation at Ser-845 and endocytosis of GluA1-containing AMPARs. Pharmacological inhibition of proteasome activity, but not phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), reverted cLTD-induced AKAP150 protein degradation. Importantly, AKAP150 silencing induced dephosphorylation of GluA1 Ser-845 and GluA1-AMPARs endocytosis while AKAP150 overexpression blocked cLTD-mediated GluA1-AMPARs endocytosis. Our results provide direct evidence that cLTD-induced AKAP150 degradation by the proteasome contributes to synaptic AMPARs endocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Multiple evidences have shown that changes in glutamatergic synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) modulate excitatory synaptic plasticity, playing a fundamental role in learning and memory-related processes such as long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD). AMPARs are inserted in the synapses during LTP and removed during LTD although the mechanisms involved in synaptic AMPARs dynamics are not fully understood. Here, we show that cLTD-dependent proteasome degradation of A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 150, a scaffold protein from the postsynaptic density, is related to synaptic AMPARs removal during cLTD whereas restored AKAP150 levels blocks cLTD-mediated endocytosis of AMPARs. Thus, our findings expand our understanding of the regulatory role of AKAP150 on AMPARs dynamics at glutamatergic synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The macroscopic dynamics of large populations of neurons can be
mathematically analyzed using low-dimensional firing-rate or neural-mass
models. However, these models fail to capture spike synchronization effects of
stochastic spiking neurons such as the non-stationary population response to
rapidly changing stimuli. Here, we derive low-dimensional firing-rate models
for homogeneous populations of general renewal-type neurons, including
integrate-and-fire models driven by white noise. Renewal models account for
neuronal refractoriness and spike synchronization dynamics. The derivation is
based on an eigenmode expansion of the associated refractory density equation,
which generalizes previous spectral methods for Fokker-Planck equations to
arbitrary renewal models. We find a simple relation between the eigenvalues,
which determine the characteristic time scales of the firing rate dynamics, and
the Laplace transform of the interspike interval density or the survival
function of the renewal process. Analytical expressions for the Laplace
transforms are readily available for many renewal models including the leaky
integrate-and-fire model. Retaining only the first eigenmode yields already an
adequate low-dimensional approximation of the firing-rate dynamics that
captures spike synchronization effects and fast transient dynamics at stimulus
onset. We explicitly demonstrate the validity of our model for a large
homogeneous population of Poisson neurons with absolute refractoriness, and
other renewal models that admit an explicit analytical calculation of the
eigenvalues. The here presented eigenmode expansion provides a systematic
framework for novel firing-rate models in computational neuroscience based on
spiking neuron dynamics with refractoriness.

 &lt;p&gt;When studying how people search for objects in scenes, the inhomogeneity of
the visual field is often ignored. Due to physiological limitations peripheral
vision is blurred and mainly uses coarse-grained information (i.e., low spatial
frequencies) for selecting saccade targets, whereas high-acuity central vision
uses fine-grained information (i.e., high spatial frequencies) for analysis of
details. Here we investigated how spatial frequencies and color affect object
search in real-world scenes. Using gaze-contingent filters we attenuated high
or low frequencies in central or peripheral vision while viewers searched color
or grayscale scenes. Results showed that peripheral filters and central
high-pass filters hardly affected search accuracy, whereas accuracy dropped
drastically with central low-pass filters. Peripheral filtering increased the
time to localize the target by decreasing saccade amplitudes and increasing
number and duration of fixations. The use of coarse-grained information in the
periphery was limited to color scenes. Central filtering increased the time to
verify target identity instead, especially with low-pass filters. We conclude
that peripheral vision is critical for object localization and central vision
is critical for object identification. Visual guidance during peripheral object
localization is dominated by low-frequency color information, whereas
high-frequency information, relatively independent of color, is most important
for object identification in central vision.

 &lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillations &amp;gt;80 Hz (HFOs) have unique features distinguishing them from spikes and artifactual components that can be well-evidenced in the time-frequency representations. We introduce an unsupervised HFO detector that uses computer-vision algorithms to detect HFO landmarks on two-dimensional (2D) time-frequency maps. To validate the detector, we introduce an analytical model of the HFO based on a sinewave having a Gaussian envelope, for which analytical equations in time-frequency space can be derived, allowing us to establish a direct correspondence between common HFO detection criteria in the time domain with the ones in the frequency domain, used by the computer-vision detection algorithm. The detector identifies potential HFO events on the time-frequency representation, which are classified as true HFOs if criteria regarding the HFO's frequency, amplitude, and duration are met. The detector is validated on simulated HFOs according to the analytical model, in the presence of noise, with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from −9 to 0 dB. The detector's sensitivity was 0.64 at an SNR of −9 dB, 0.98 at −6 dB, and &amp;gt;0.99 at −3 dB and 0 dB, while its positive prediction value was &amp;gt;0.95, regardless of the SNR. Using the same simulation dataset, our detector is benchmarked against four previously published HFO detectors. The F-measure, a combined metric that takes into account both sensitivity and positive prediction value, was used to compare detection algorithms. Our detector surpassed the other detectors at −6, −3, and 0 dB and had the second best F-score at −9 dB SNR after the MNI detector (0.77 vs. 0.83). The ability to detect HFOs in clinical recordings has been tested on a set of 36 intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) channels in six patients, with 89% of the detections being validated by two independent reviewers. The results demonstrate that the unsupervised detection of HFOs based on their 2D features in time-frequency maps is feasible and has a performance comparable or better than the most used HFO detectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 This paper adapts a method for detecting influential nodes and communities in networked systems to reveal changes in functional networks of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI). Well-established methods exist for analysing connectivity networks composed of brain regions, including the widespread use of centrality metrics such as eigenvector centrality. However, these metrics provide only limited information on the relationship between regions, with this understanding often sought by comparing the strength of pairwise functional connectivity. Our holistic approach, eigenvector alignment, considers the impact of all the functional connectivity changes on the alignment of any two regions. This is achieved by comparing their placement in a Euclidean space defined by the network's dominant eigenvectors. Eigenvector alignment reveals that key regions in the Default Mode Network lack clear and consistent alignments in healthy control subjects. This results in relatively few significant alignment changes in AD, despite clear reductions in functional connectivity within this network. For AD subjects, compared with healthy controls, the posterior superior temporal gyrus displays the most significant bilateral decrease in alignment where both sides become significantly more aligned with the brainstem. Substantial realignments were also noted bilaterally within regions such as the Heschl's gyrus and the planum polare, which begin in aMCI, and result in these brain regions having significantly increased separation from each other in AD. These findings present a case for the use of eigenvector alignment, alongside established network analytic approaches, to capture how the brain's functional networks develop and adapt when challenged by disease processes such as AD.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assess occurrence of the dendritic spine scaffolding protein Drebrin as pathophysiologically relevant autoantibody target in patients with recurrent seizures and suspected encephalitis as leading symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sera of four patients with adult onset epilepsy and suspected encephalitis of unresolved etiology and equivalent results in autoantibody screening were subjected to epitope identification. We combined a wide array of approaches ranging from immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and mass‐spectrometry, subcellular binding pattern analyses in primary neuronal cultures, immunohistochemistry in brains of wildtype and Drebrin knockout mice to &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; analyses on impaired synapse formation, morphology and aberrant neuronal excitability by antibody exposure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the serum of a patient with adult onset epilepsy and suspected encephalitis, a strong signal at ~70 kDa was detected by immunoblotting, for which mass‐spectrometry revealed Drebrin as putative antigen. Three other patients whose sera also showed strong immunoreactivity around 70 kDa in western blotting were also anti‐Drebrin positive. Seizures, memory impairment and increased protein content in cerebrospinal fluid occurred in anti‐Drebrin seropositive patients. Alterations in cerebral MRI comprised amygdalo‐hippocampal T2‐signal increase and hippocampal sclerosis. Diagnostic biopsy revealed T‐lymphocytic encephalitis in an anti‐Drebrin seropositive patient. Exposure of primary hippocampal neurons to anti‐Drebrin autoantibodies resulted in aberrant synapse composition and Drebrin distribution as well as increased spike rates and the emergence of burst discharges reflecting network hyperexcitability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti‐Drebrin autoantibodies define a chronic syndrome of recurrent seizures, neuropsychiatric impairment as well as inflammation of limbic and occasionally cortical structures. Immunosuppressant therapies should be considered in this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies showed alcohol drinking behaviors may be associated with the risk of ALS, whereas contradictory findings emerged and whether such association is causal is unclear. We here investigate the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and ALS. By leveraging instruments from large‐scale genome‐wide association studies, we performed a comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis and found alcohol consumption was causally associated with ALS, leading to ~1.5 fold (95%CI 1.4 ‐ 3.4) higher risk of ALS for each approximately 10g/d increase in alcohol intake. Our finding therefore suggests accumulative alcohol consumption may serve as a crucial risk factor in the pathogenesis of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;

Most enzymes act on more than a single substrate. There is frequently a need to block the production of a single pathogenic outcome of enzymatic activity on a substrate but to avoid blocking others of its catalytic actions. Full blocking might cause severe side effects because some products of that catalysis may be vital. Substrate selectivity is required but not possible to achieve by blocking the catalytic residues of an enzyme. That is the basis of the need for &quot;Substrate Selective Inhibitors&quot; (SSI), and there are several molecules characterized as SSI. However, none have yet been designed or discovered by computational methods. We demonstrate a computational approach to the discovery of Substrate Selective Inhibitors for one enzyme, Prolyl Oligopeptidase (POP) (E.C 3.4.21.26), a serine protease which cleaves small peptides between Pro and other amino acids. Among those are Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH) and Angiotensin-III (Ang-III), differing in both their binding (K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) and in turnover (k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;). We used our in-house &quot;Iterative Stochastic Elimination&quot; (ISE) algorithm and the structure-based &quot;Pharmacophore&quot; approach to construct two models for identifying SSI of POP. A dataset of ~1.8 million commercially available molecules was initially reduced to less than 12,000 which were screened by these models to a final set of 20 molecules which were sent for experimental validation (five random molecules were tested for comparison). Two molecules out of these 20, one with a high score in the ISE model, the other successful in the pharmacophore model, were confirmed by in vitro measurements. One is a competitive inhibitor of Ang-III (increases its K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;), but non-competitive towards TRH (decreases its V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HXg_LkFaA7w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To manipulate target gene function in specific adult cell populations, tamoxifen (TAM)-dependent CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt; is widely used to drive inducible, site-specific recombination of loxP flanked sequences. In studies of cell autonomous target gene function, it is common practice to combine these CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;-lox systems with a ubiquitously expressed stop-floxed fluorescent reporter gene to identify single cells supposedly undergoing target gene recombination. Here, we studied the reliability of using Cre-induced recombination of one gene to predict recombination in another gene at the single-cell level in adult hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Using both probabilistic predictions in a generic experimental paradigm, as well as a mouse model with two separate stop-floxed reporters plus a Nestin promoter-driven CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;, we found that, in individual cells, recombination of one gene was a poor predictor of recombination in another. This poor concordance in floxed sequence recombination across genes suggests that use of stop-floxed reporters to investigate cell autonomous gene function may not be universally reliable and could lead to false conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Catalepsy bar tests are widely used to measure the failure to correct an imposed posture resulting from muscular rigidity. Procedures for measuring catalepsy vary greatly in the published literature, but one commonly used test measures the time it takes for a rodent to remove one or both of its forelimbs from a bar. The following paper describes an affordable, adjustable, open-source bar test that automatically measures and logs the time it takes for a rat to remove itself from a bar. While commercially available automated bar tests are prohibitively expensive, requiring proprietary software and hardware to operate, the proposed apparatus runs on an Arduino-based microcontroller making it low-cost and customizable. This 3D-printed design costs less than $65 USD to build and is simple to assemble and operate. The beam-break sensor design also eliminates many of the pitfalls of the &quot;complete-the-circuit&quot; based approach to recording catalepsy. The paper further describes the successful validation of the design using adult male rats injected with different doses of haloperidol to demonstrate a dose-dependent cataleptic effect. This design provides a versatile, low-cost solution to standardizing and automating measurement of catalepsy in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement:&lt;/b&gt; Catalepsy measurements are important in behavioral research involving antipsychotic drugs, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and cannabis exposure. Standardized ways of measuring catalepsy will lead to more accurate data, while allowing for consistency between studies. To this end, we designed and constructed a catalepsy bar test that automatically measures and records the time it takes for a rat to remove its forelimbs from a bar. This easy-to-build apparatus will allow for unbiased, human-error free measurements to be made at a very low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;All-to-all homogeneous networks of inhibitory neurons synchronize completely under the right conditions; however, many modeling studies have shown that biological levels of heterogeneity disrupt synchrony. Our fundamental scientific question is &quot;how can neurons maintain partial synchrony in the presence of heterogeneity and noise?&quot; A particular subset of strongly interconnected interneurons, the PV+ fast spiking basket neurons, are strongly implicated in gamma oscillations and in phase locking of nested gamma oscillations to theta. Their excitability type apparently varies between brain regions: in CA1 and the dentate gyrus they have type 1 excitability, meaning that they can fire arbitrarily slowly, whereas in the striatum and cortex they have type 2 excitability, meaning that there is a frequency threshold below which they cannot sustain repetitive firing. We constrained the models to study the effect of excitability type (more precisely bifurcation type) in isolation from all other factors. We use sparsely connected, heterogeneous, noisy networks with synaptic delays to show that synchronization properties, namely the resistance to suppression and the strength of theta phase to gamma amplitude coupling, are strongly dependent on the pairing of excitability type with the type of inhibition. Shunting inhibition performs better for type 1 and hyperpolarizing inhibition for type 2. Gamma oscillations and their nesting within theta oscillations are thought to subserve cognitive functions like memory encoding and recall; therefore, it is important to understand the contribution of intrinsic properties to these rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The collective, synchronized activity of neurons produces brain rhythms. These rhythms are thought to subserve cognitive functions such as attention and memory encoding and retrieval. We focus on fast spiking basket cells, a subset of inhibitory interneurons. These neurons play an important role in brain rhythms. In some brain regions these neurons can fire arbitrarily slowly (type 1 dynamics) whereas in others they cannot fire below a minimum cutoff frequency (type 2 dynamics). We show that excitability type determines whether shunting or hyperpolarizing inhibition more effectively synchronizes the fast oscillatory activity of networks of these neurons in the presence of heterogeneity and noise, and more effectively drives modulation of fast activity by slower oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;A key goal in hippocampal research is to understand how neuronal activity is generated and organized across hippocampal subregions to enable memory formation and retrieval. Neuronal activity in CA2 is regulated by spatial and social investigation as well as by novelty (Mankin et al., 2015; Alexander et al., 2016), and CA2 activity controls population oscillatory activity in the slow gamma and ripple ranges within hippocampus (Kay et al., 2016; Oliva et al., 2016; Boehringer et al., 2017; Alexander et al., 2018). CA2 neurons are also required for social recognition memory (Stevenson and Caldwell, 2012; Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014; Smith et al., 2016). Because CA1 exhibits layer-specific organization (Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012; Lasztoczi and Klausberger, 2014, 2016) reflective of its inputs (Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2012; Schomburg et al., 2014), and because CA2 activity controls CA1 slow gamma (Alexander et al., 2018), we hypothesized that silencing CA2 would affect CA1 slow gamma in a layer-specific manner during investigation of a novel social stimulus. While recording from CA1, we leveraged molecular tools to selectively target and inhibit CA2 pyramidal cells using inhibitory DREADDs while subject mice investigated novel animals or objects. We found that CA2 inhibition reduced slow gamma power during investigation of a novel animal and fast gamma power during both novel object and animal investigation in a manner reflective of the CA2 axonal projection zones within CA1. Our results suggest that CA2 contributes to CA1 slow and fast gamma oscillations in a stimulus-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using chemogenetics and electrophysiology, we show that CA2 contributes to slow gamma oscillations in CA1 during novel animal investigation and fast gamma during novel animal or object investigation in a layer-specific manner reflective of CA2 connectivity. Slow gamma oscillations in CA1 rely on CA3 and CA2 input during running, and CA2 neuronal activity is required for social memory. Our findings of reduced slow gamma oscillations in CA1 layers targeted by CA2 axons upon reduction of CA2 activity support the involvement of CA2 in slow gamma oscillations, and the finding that slow gamma oscillations were impaired by CA2 silencing selectively during novel animal investigation are consistent with a role for CA2 in social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuron reconstruction is essential to generate exquisite neuron connectivity
map for understanding brain function. Despite the significant amount of effect
that has been made on automatic reconstruction methods, manual tracing by
well-trained human annotators is still necessary. To ensure the quality of
reconstructed neurons and provide guidance for annotators to improve their
efficiency, we propose a deep learning based quality control method for neuron
reconstruction in this paper. By formulating the quality control problem into a
binary classification task regarding each single point, the proposed approach
overcomes the technical difficulties resulting from the large image size and
complex neuron morphology. Not only it provides the evaluation of
reconstruction quality, but also can locate exactly where the wrong tracing
begins. This work presents one of the first comprehensive studies for
whole-brain scale quality control of neuron reconstructions. Experiments on
five-fold cross validation with a large dataset demonstrate that the proposed
approach can detect 74.7% errors with only 1.4% false alerts.

 &lt;p&gt;This paper shows that ResNets, NeuralODEs, and CT-RNNs, are particular neural
regulatory networks (NRNs), a biophysical model for the nonspiking neurons
encountered in small species, such as the C.elegans nematode, and in the retina
of large species. Compared to ResNets, NeuralODEs and CT-RNNs, NRNs have an
additional multiplicative term in their synaptic computation, allowing them to
adapt to each particular input. This additional flexibility makes NRNs $M$
times more succinct than NeuralODEs and CT-RNNs, where $M$ is proportional to
the size of the training set. Moreover, as NeuralODEs and CT-RNNs are $N$ times
more succinct than ResNets, where $N$ is the number of integration steps
required to compute the output $F(x)$ for a given input $x$, NRNs are in total
$M\,{\cdot}\,N$ more succinct than ResNets. For a given approximation task,
this considerable succinctness allows to learn a very small and therefore
understandable NRN, whose behavior can be explained in terms of well
established architectural motifs, that NRNs share with gene regulatory
networks, such as, activation, inhibition, sequentialization, mutual exclusion,
and synchronization. To the best of our knowledge, this paper unifies for the
first time the mainstream work on deep neural networks with the one in biology
and neuroscience in a quantitative fashion.

 &lt;p&gt;Traditional neuroimage analysis pipelines involve computationally intensive,
time-consuming optimization steps, and thus, do not scale well to large cohort
studies with thousands or tens of thousands of individuals. In this work we
propose a fast and accurate deep learning based neuroimaging pipeline for the
automated processing of structural human brain MRI scans, including surface
reconstruction and cortical parcellation. To this end, we introduce an advanced
deep learning architecture capable of whole brain segmentation into 95 classes
in under 1 minute, mimicking FreeSurfer's anatomical segmentation and cortical
parcellation. The network architecture incorporates local and global
competition via competitive dense blocks and competitive skip pathways, as well
as multi-slice information aggregation that specifically tailor network
performance towards accurate segmentation of both cortical and sub-cortical
structures. Further, we perform fast cortical surface reconstruction and
thickness analysis by introducing a spectral spherical embedding and by
directly mapping the cortical labels from the image to the surface. This
approach provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (within
1 minute) and surface-based thickness analysis (within only around 1h runtime).
For sustainability of this approach we perform extensive validation: we assert
high segmentation accuracy on several unseen datasets, measure generalizability
and demonstrate increased test-retest reliability, and increased sensitivity to
disease effects relative to traditional FreeSurfer.

 &lt;p&gt;The ability to learn new tasks and generalize performance to others is one of
the most remarkable characteristics of the human brain and of recent AI
systems. The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously is also a
signature characteristic of large-scale parallel architectures, that is evident
in the human brain, and has been exploited effectively more traditional,
massively parallel computational architectures. Here, we show that these two
characteristics are in tension, reflecting a fundamental tradeoff between
interactive parallelism that supports learning and generalization, and
independent parallelism that supports processing efficiency through concurrent
multitasking. We formally show that, while the maximum number of tasks that can
be performed simultaneously grows linearly with network size, under realistic
scenarios (e.g. in an unpredictable environment), the expected number that can
be performed concurrently grows radically sub-linearly with network size.
Hence, even modest reliance on shared representation strictly constrains the
number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously, implying profound
consequences for the development of artificial intelligence that optimally
manages the tradeoff between learning and processing, and for understanding the
human brains remarkably puzzling mix of sequential and parallel capabilities.

 &lt;p&gt;Most mammals rely on the extraction of acoustic information from the environment in order to survive. However, the mechanisms that support sound representation in auditory neural networks involving sensory and association brain areas remain underexplored. In this study, we address the functional connectivity between an auditory region in frontal cortex (the frontal auditory field, FAF) and the auditory cortex (AC) in the bat Carollia perspicillata. The AC is a classic sensory area central for the processing of acoustic information. On the other hand, the FAF belongs to the frontal lobe, a brain region involved in the integration of sensory inputs, modulation of cognitive states, and in the coordination of behavioral outputs. The FAF-AC network was examined in terms of oscillatory coherence (local-field potentials, LFPs), and within an information theoretical framework linking FAF and AC spiking activity. We show that in the absence of acoustic stimulation, simultaneously recorded LFPs from FAF and AC are coherent in low frequencies (1–12 Hz). This “default” coupling was strongest in deep AC layers and was unaltered by acoustic stimulation. However, presenting auditory stimuli did trigger the emergence of coherent auditory-evoked gamma-band activity (&amp;gt;25 Hz) between the FAF and AC. In terms of spiking, our results suggest that FAF and AC engage in distinct coding strategies for representing artificial and natural sounds. Taken together, our findings shed light onto the neuronal coding strategies and functional coupling mechanisms that enable sound representation at the network level in the mammalian brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ability of androstane and androstene neurosteroids with modifications at C-17, C-5, and C-3 (compounds 1-9) to influence the functional activity of inhibitory glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors was estimated. The glycine- and GABA-induced chloride current (I&lt;sub&gt;Gly&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt;) were measured in isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus and isolated rat cerebellar Purkinje cells, correspondingly, using the patch-clamp technique. Our results demonstrate that all the nine neurosteroids display similar biological activity, namely, they strongly inhibited I&lt;sub&gt;Gly&lt;/sub&gt; and weakly inhibited I&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt;. The threshold concentration of neurosteroids inducing effects on I&lt;sub&gt;Gly&lt;/sub&gt; was 0.1 μM, and for effects on I&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt; was 10–50 μM. Moreover, our compounds accelerated desensitization of the I&lt;sub&gt;Gly&lt;/sub&gt; with the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values varying from 0.12 to 0.49 μM and decreased the peak amplitude with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values varying from 16 to 22 μM. Interestingly, our study revealed that only compounds 4 (epiandrosterone) and 8 (dehydroepiandrosterone) were able to cause a significant change in I&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt; in 10 μM concentration. Moreover, compounds 3 (testosterone), 5 (epitestosterone), 6 (dihydroandrostenedione), and 9 (etiocholanedione) did not modulate I&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt; up to the concentration of 50 μM. Thus, we conclude that compounds 3, 5, 6, and 9 may be identified as selective modulators of I&lt;sub&gt;Gly&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results offer new avenues of investigation in the field of drug-like selective modulators of I&lt;sub&gt;Gly&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Diabetes affects hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Despite the advances in understanding the disease and therapeutic options, it remains a leading cause of death and of comorbidities globally. Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), or amylin, is a hormone produced by pancreatic β-cells. It contributes to the maintenance of glucose physiological levels namely by inhibiting insulin and glucagon secretion as well as controlling adiposity and satiation. IAPP is a highly amyloidogenic polypeptide forming intracellular aggregates and amyloid structures that are associated with β-cell death. Data also suggest the relevance of unprocessed IAPP forms as seeding for amyloid buildup. Besides the known consequences of hyperamylinemia in the pancreas, evidence has also pointed out that IAPP has a pathological role in cognitive function. More specifically, IAPP was shown to impair the blood–brain barrier; it was also seen to interact and co-deposit with amyloid beta peptide (Aß), and possibly with Tau, within the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, thereby contributing to diabetes-associated dementia. In fact, it has been suggested that AD results from a metabolic dysfunction in the brain, leading to its proposed designation as type 3 diabetes. Here, we have first provided a brief perspective on the IAPP amyloidogenic process and its role in diabetes and AD. We have then discussed the potential interventions for modulating IAPP proteotoxicity that can be explored for therapeutics. Finally, we have proposed the concept of a “diabetes brain phenotype” hypothesis in AD, which may help design future IAPP-centered drug developmentstrategies against AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The distinct organization of the brain’s vasculature ensures the adequate delivery of oxygen and nutrients during development and adulthood. Acute and chronic pathological changes of the vascular system have been implicated in many neurological disorders including stroke and dementia. Here, we describe a fast, automated method that allows the highly reproducible, quantitative assessment of distinct vascular parameters and their changes based on the open source software Fiji (ImageJ). In particular, we developed a practical guide to reliably measure aspects of growth, repair and maturation of the brain’s vasculature during development and neurovascular disease in mice and humans. The script can be used to assess the effects of different external factors including pharmacological treatments or disease states. Moreover, the procedure is expandable to blood vessels of other organs and vascular in vitro models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We have applied a novel and integrative analysis framework for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to 503 human subjects provided by the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) to examine changes in transcriptomic organization and common variants in association with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). Our framework identified seven reproducible, co-regulated modules after quality control (QC), clinical segregation, preservation filtering, and functional ontology analysis. These modules were specifically enriched in several innate and adaptive immune system processes, the synaptic vesicle cycle, and Hippo signaling. Topological and functional erosion of these modules due to shedding of genes and loss of in-module connectivity was diagnostic of disease progression. Perturbation analysis revealed that only 1% of eQTLs overlapped genes participating in these co-regulated modules. Common variants nevertheless identified components of the immune systems like human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) regions in association with LOAD. Our results implicate microglial function, adaptive immune response, and the structural degeneration of neurons as contributors to the transcriptional deregulation observed along with common genetic variants in the progression of LOAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) consist of a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases hallmarked by motor deficits and deterioration of the cerebellum and its associated circuitries. Neuroinflammatory responses are present in CA brain, but how neuroinflammation may contribute to CA pathogenesis remain unresolved. Here, we investigate whether transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, which possesses anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, can ameliorate the microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and thereby alleviate neurodegeneration in CA. In the current study, we administered TGF-β1 via the intracerebroventricle (ICV) in CA model rats, by intraperitoneal injection of 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP), to reveal the neuroprotective role of TGF-β1. The TGF-β1 administration after 3-AP injection ameliorated motor impairments and reduced the calbindin-positive neuron loss and apoptosis in the brain stem and cerebellum. Meanwhile, 3-AP induced microglial activation and inflammatory responses in vivo, which were determined by morphological alteration and an increase in expression of CD11b, enhancement of percentage of CD40 + and CD86 + microglial cells, upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β, and a downregulation of neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 in the brain stem and cerebellum. TGF-β1 treatment significantly prevented all the changes caused by 3-AP. In addition, in vitro experiments, TGF-β1 directly attenuated 3-AP-induced microglial activation and inflammatory responses in primary cultures. Purkinje cell exposure to supernatants of primary microglia that had been treated with TGF-β1 reduced neuronal loss and apoptosis induced by 3-AP-treated microglial supernatants. Furthermore, the protective effect was similar to those treated with TNF-α-neutralizing antibody. These findings suggest that TGF-β1 protects against neurodegeneration in 3-AP-induced CA rats via inhibiting microglial activation and at least partly TNF-α release.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The segmentation of brain region contours in three dimensions is critical for the analysis of different brain structures, and advanced approaches are emerging continuously within the field of neurosciences. With the development of high-resolution micro-optical imaging, whole-brain images can be acquired at the cellular level. However, brain regions in microscopic images are aggregated by discrete neurons with blurry boundaries, the complex and variable features of brain regions make it challenging to accurately segment brain regions. Manual segmentation is a reliable method, but is unrealistic to apply on a large scale. Here, we propose an automated brain region segmentation framework, DeepBrainSeg, which is inspired by the principle of manual segmentation. DeepBrainSeg incorporates three feature levels to learn local and contextual features in different receptive fields through a dual-pathway convolutional neural network (CNN), and to provide global features of localization by image registration and domain-condition constraints. Validated on biological datasets, DeepBrainSeg can not only effectively segment brain-wide regions with high accuracy (Dice ratio &amp;gt; 0.9), but can also be applied to various types of datasets and to datasets with noises. It has the potential to automatically locate information in the brain space on the large scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In recent years, deep learning (DL) has become more widespread in the fields of cognitive and clinical neuroimaging. Using deep neural network models to process neuroimaging data is an efficient method to classify brain disorders and identify individuals who are at increased risk of age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease. Here we investigated, for the first time, whether structural brain imaging and DL can be used for predicting a physical trait that is of significant clinical relevance—the body mass index (BMI) of the individual. We show that individual BMI can be accurately predicted using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a single structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan along with information about age and sex. Localization maps computed for the CNN highlighted several brain structures that strongly contributed to BMI prediction, including the caudate nucleus and the amygdala. Comparison to the results obtained via a standard automatic brain segmentation method revealed that the CNN-based visualization approach yielded complementary evidence regarding the relationship between brain structure and BMI. Taken together, our results imply that predicting BMI from structural brain scans using DL represents a promising approach to investigate the relationship between brain morphological variability and individual differences in body weight and provide a new scope for future investigations regarding the potential clinical utility of brain-predicted BMI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As a full-blown research topic, numerical cognition is investigated by a variety of disciplines including cognitive science, developmental and educational psychology, linguistics, anthropology and, more recently, biology and neuroscience. However, despite the great progress achieved by such a broad and diversified scientific inquiry, we are still lacking a comprehensive theory that could explain how numerical concepts are learned by the human brain. In this perspective, I argue that computer simulation should have a primary role in filling this gap because it allows identifying the finer-grained computational mechanisms underlying complex behavior and cognition. Modeling efforts will be most effective if carried out at cross-disciplinary intersections, as attested by the recent success in simulating human cognition using techniques developed in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this respect, deep learning models have provided valuable insights into our most basic quantification abilities, showing how numerosity perception could emerge in multi-layered neural networks that learn the statistical structure of their visual environment. Nevertheless, this modeling approach has not yet scaled to more sophisticated cognitive skills that are foundational to higher-level mathematical thinking, such as those involving the use of symbolic numbers and arithmetic principles. I will discuss promising directions to push deep learning into this uncharted territory. If successful, such endeavor would allow simulating the acquisition of numerical concepts in its full complexity, guiding empirical investigation on the richest soil and possibly offering far-reaching implications for educational practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previous literature on shooting performance neurofeedback training (SP-NFT) to enhance performance usually focused on changes in behavioral indicators, but research on the physiological features of SP-NFT is lacking. To explore the effects of SP-NFT on trainability and neuroplasticity, we conducted a study in which 45 healthy participants were randomly divided into three groups: based on sensory-motor rhythm of C3, Cz and C4 (SMR group), based on alpha rhythm of T3 and T4 (Alpha group), and no NFT (control group). The training was performed for six sessions for 3 weeks. Before and after the SP-NFT, we evaluated changes in shooting performance and resting electroencephalography (EEG) frequency power, participant’s subjective task appraisal, neurofeedback trainability score, and EEG feature. Statistical analysis showed that the shooting performance of the participants in the SMR group improved significantly, the participants in the Alpha group decreased, and that of participants in the control group have no change. Meanwhile, the resting EEG power features of the two NFT groups changed specifically after training. The training process data showed that the training difficulty was significantly lower in the SMR group than in the Alpha group. Both NFT groups could improve the neurofeedback trainability scores and change the feedback features by means of their mind strategy. These results may provide evidence of trainability and neuroplasticity for SP-NFT, suggesting that the SP-NFT is effective in brain regulation and thus provide a potential method to improve shooting performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) signal is an electrophysiological recording from electrodes placed on the scalp to reflect the electrical activities of the brain. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) is one type of EEG signals in response to an auditory stimulus, and it has been widely used to evaluate the potential disorders of the auditory function within the brain. Currently, the ABR measurements in the clinic usually adopt a fixed stimulation rate (FSR) technique in which the late evoked response could contaminate the ABR signals and deteriorate the waveform differentiation after averaging, thus compromising the overall auditory function assessment task. To resolve this issue, this study proposed a random stimulation rate (RSR) method by integrating a random interval between two adjacent stimuli. The results showed that the proposed RSR method was consistently repeatable and reliable in multiple trials of repeated measurements, and there was a large amplitude of successive late evoked response that would contaminate the ABR signals for conventional FSR methods. The ABR waveforms of the RSR method showed better wave I–V morphology across different stimulation rates and stimulus levels, and the improved ABR morphology played an important role in early diagnoses of auditory pathway abnormities. The correlation coefficients as functions of averaging time showed that the ABR waveform of the RSR method stabilizes significantly faster, and therefore, it could be used to speed up current ABR measurements with more reliable testing results. The study suggests that the proposed method would potentially aid the adequate reconstruction of ABR signals towards a more effective means of hearing loss screening, brain function diagnoses, and potential brain–computer interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Image registration and segmentation are the two most studied problems in medical image analysis. Deep learning algorithms have recently gained a lot of attention due to their success and state-of-the-art results in variety of problems and communities. In this paper, we propose a novel, efficient, and multi-task algorithm that addresses the problems of image registration and brain tumor segmentation jointly. Our method exploits the dependencies between these tasks through a natural coupling of their interdependencies during inference. In particular, the similarity constraints are relaxed within the tumor regions using an efficient and relatively simple formulation. We evaluated the performance of our formulation both quantitatively and qualitatively for registration and segmentation problems on two publicly available datasets (BraTS 2018 and OASIS 3), reporting competitive results with other recent state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our proposed framework reports significant amelioration (p &amp;lt; 0.005) for the registration performance inside the tumor locations, providing a generic method that does not need any predefined conditions (e.g., absence of abnormalities) about the volumes to be registered.

 &lt;p&gt;Neurochemicals have a large impact on brain states and animal behavior but are notoriously hard to detect accurately in the living brain. Recently developed genetically encoded sensors obtained from engineering a circularly permuted green fluorescent protein into G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) provided a vital boost to neuroscience, by innovating the way we monitor neural communication. These new probes are becoming widely successful due to their flexible combination with state of the art optogenetic tools and in vivo imaging techniques, mainly fiber photometry and 2-photon microscopy, to dissect dynamic changes in brain chemicals with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we highlight current approaches and challenges as well as novel insights in the process of GPCR sensor development, and discuss possible future directions of the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Viral vectors are essential tools for the study of neural circuits, with glycoprotein-deleted rabies viruses being widely used for monosynaptic retrograde tracing to map connectivity between specific cell types in the nervous system. However, the use of rabies virus is limited by the cytotoxicity and the inflammatory responses these viruses trigger. While components of the rabies virus genome contribute to its cytotoxic effects, the function of other neuronal and non-neuronal cells within the vicinity of the infected host neurons in either effecting or mitigating virally-induced tissue damage are still being elucidated. Here, we analyzed 60,212 single-cell RNA profiles to assess both global and cell-type-specific transcriptional responses in the mouse dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) following intracranial injection of glycoprotein-deleted rabies viruses and axonal infection of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons. Gene pathway analyses revealed a down-regulation of genes involved in metabolic processes and neurotransmission following infection. We also identified several transcriptionally diverse leukocyte populations that infiltrate the brain and are distinct from resident immune cells. Cell type-specific patterns of cytokine expression showed that antiviral responses were likely orchestrated by Type I and Type II interferon signaling from microglia and infiltrating CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, respectively. Additionally, we uncovered transcriptionally distinct states of microglia along an activation trajectory that may serve different functions, which range from surveillance to antigen presentation and cytokine secretion. Intercellular interactions inferred from transcriptional data suggest that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells facilitate microglial state transitions during the inflammatory response. Our study uncovers the heterogeneity of immune cells mediating neuroinflammatory responses and provides a critical evaluation of the compatibility between rabies-mediated connectivity mapping and single-cell transcriptional profiling. These findings provide additional insights into the distinct contributions of various cell types in mediating different facets of antiviral responses in the brain and will facilitate the design of strategies to circumvent immune responses to improve the efficacy of viral gene delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) has a vast population of dopamine (DA) neurons, whose function is to increase odor discrimination through mostly inhibitory synaptic mechanisms. However, it is not well understood whether there is more than one neuronal type of OB DA neuron, how these neurons respond to different stimuli, and the ionic mechanisms behind those responses. In this study, we used a transgenic rat line (hTH-GFP) to identify fluorescent OB DA neurons for recording via whole-cell electrophysiology. These neurons were grouped based on their localization in the glomerular layer (“Top” vs. “Bottom”) with these largest and smallest neurons grouped by neuronal area (“Large” vs. “Small,” in μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). We found that some membrane properties could be distinguished based on a neuron’s area, but not by its glomerular localization. All OB DA neurons produced a single action potential when receiving a sufficiently depolarizing stimulus, while some could also spike multiple times when receiving weaker stimuli, an activity that was more likely in Large than Small neurons. This single spiking activity is likely driven by the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, which showed a sensitivity to inactivation by depolarization and a relatively long time constant for the removal of inactivation. These recordings showed that Small neurons were more sensitive to inactivation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current at membrane potentials of −70 and −60 mV than Large neurons. The hyperpolarization-activated H-current (identified by voltage sags) was more pronounced in Small than Large DA neurons across hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Lastly, to mimic a more physiological stimulus, these neurons received ramp stimuli of various durations and current amplitudes. When stimulated with weaker/shallow ramps, the neurons needed less current to begin and end firing and they produced more action potentials at a slower frequency. These spiking properties were further analyzed between the four groups of neurons, and these analyses support the difference in spiking induced with current step stimuli. Thus, there may be more than one type of OB DA neuron, and these neurons’ activities may support a possible role of being high-pass filters in the OB by allowing the transmission of stronger odor signals while inhibiting weaker ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the present study, we characterized the effects of bath application of the proconvulsant drug 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) alone or in combination with GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and/or GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists, in cortical dysplasia (CD type I and CD type IIa/b), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and non-CD cortical tissue samples from pediatric epilepsy surgery patients. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in current and voltage clamp modes were obtained from cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs), interneurons, and balloon/giant cells. In pyramidal neurons, bath application of 4-AP produced an increase in spontaneous synaptic activity as well as rhythmic membrane oscillations. In current clamp mode, these oscillations were generally depolarizing or biphasic and were accompanied by increased membrane conductance. In interneurons, membrane oscillations were consistently depolarizing and accompanied by bursts of action potentials. In a subset of balloon/giant cells from CD type IIb and TSC cases, respectively, 4-AP induced very low-amplitude, slow membrane oscillations that echoed the rhythmic oscillations from pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Bicuculline reduced the amplitude of membrane oscillations induced by 4-AP, indicating that they were mediated principally by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. 4-AP alone or in combination with bicuculline increased cortical excitability but did not induce seizure-like discharges. Ictal activity was observed in pyramidal neurons and interneurons from CD and TSC cases only when phaclofen, a GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist, was added to the 4-AP and bicuculline solution. These results emphasize the critical and permissive role of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the transition to an ictal state in pediatric CD tissue and highlight the importance of these receptors as a potential therapeutic target in pediatric epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spinal cord ischemia is a severe clinical complication induced by thoracoabdominal aortic surgery, severe trauma, or compression to the spinal column. As one of the most important functional cells in the spinal cord, spinal motor neurons (SMNs) suffer most during the process since they are vulnerable to ischemic injury due to high demands of energy. Previous researches have tried various animal models or organotypic tissue experiments to mimic the process and get to know the pathogenesis and mechanism. However, little work has been performed on the cellular model of spinal cord ischemia, which has been hampered by the inability to obtain a sufficient number of pure primary SMNs for in vitro study. By optimizing the isolation and culture of SMNs, our laboratory has developed an improved culture system of primary SMNs, which allows cellular models and thus mechanism studies. In the present study, by establishing an in vitro model of spinal cord ischemia, we intended to observe the dynamic time-course changes of SMNs and investigate the role of autophagy in SMNs during the process. It was found that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) resulted in destruction of neural networks and decreased cell viability of primary SMNs, and the severity increased with the prolonging of the OGD time. The OGD treatment enhanced autophagy, which reached a peak at 5 h. Further investigation demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy exacerbated the injury, evidencing that autophagy plays a protective role during the process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Age-related deterioration in white and gray matter is linked to cognitive deficits. Reduced microstructure of the fornix, the major efferent pathway of the hippocampus, and volume of the dentate gyrus (DG), may cause age-associated memory decline. However, the linkage between these anatomical determinants and memory retrieval in healthy aging are poorly understood. In 30 older adults, we acquired diffusion tensor and T1-weighted images for individual deterministic tractography and volume estimation. A memory task, administered outside of the scanner to assess retrieval of learned associations, required discrimination of previously acquired picture-word pairs. The results showed that fornix fractional anisotropy (FA) and left DG volumes were related to successful retrieval. These brain-behavior associations were observed for correct rejections, but not hits, indicating specificity of memory network functioning for detecting false associations. Mediation analyses showed that left DG volume mediated the effect of fornix FA on memory (48%), but not vice versa. These findings suggest that reduced microstructure induces volume loss and thus negatively affects retrieval of learned associations, complementing evidence of a pivotal role of the fornix in healthy aging. Our study offers a neurobehavioral model to explain variability in memory retrieval in older adults, an important prerequisite for the development of interventions to counteract cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As the population ages worldwide, the prevalence of cognitive disorders including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is increasing. MCI appears in 10–20% of adults aged 65 years and older and is generally referred to as an intermediate stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia. To develop timely prevention and early treatment strategies by identifying biological factors, we investigated the relationship between dietary consumption of fish, brain structure, and MCI in cognitively normal subjects. The brain structure was assessed using neuroimaging-derived measures including the “gray-matter brain healthcare quotient (GM-BHQ)” and “fractional-anisotropy brain healthcare quotient (FA-BHQ),” which are approved as the international standard (H.861.1) by the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector. Dietary consumption of fish was calculated using the brief self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ), and MCI was assessed using the Memory Performance Index (MPI) of MCI screening method (MCI Screen). This study showed that fish intake was positively associated with both FA-BHQ and MPI, and FA-BHQ was more strongly associated with MPI than fish intake. Our findings are in line with those in previous studies, but our study further indicates that the condition of the whole brain integrity measured by the FA-BHQ may mediate the relationship between fish intake and MCI prevention in healthy people. In other words, FA-BHQ may be used to identify people at high risk of MCI to provide the appropriate intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Currently there are ~6 million Americans who are affected by dementia. Verbal fluency tasks have been commonly and frequently utilized to document the disease progression in many forms of dementia. Verb fluency has been found to display substantial potential to detect and monitor the cognitive declines of individuals with dementia who have fronto-striatal involvement. The neural substrates underlying verb fluency task performance, however, have remained unclear so far, especially in individuals with dementia. Therefore, in the current study, brain activation patterns of seven individuals with dementia and nine healthy older adults were investigated using functional MRI. The participants performed in the scanner an overt, subject-paced verb fluency task, representative of fluency tasks used in clinical settings. The brain activation patterns during the verb fluency task were compared between the two groups, and a correlational analysis was conducted to determine the neural correlates of verb fluency performance. The results suggest that compared to healthy older adults, individuals with dementia demonstrated poorer verb fluency performance and showed higher activation in specific neural regions, such as the bilateral frontal lobe. In addition, the correlational analysis revealed that poorer verb fluency performance lead to increased activation in certain cortical and subcortical areas, including left hippocampus and right supramarginal gyrus. The current findings are consistent with previous neurophysiological findings related to semantic (noun) fluency performance in older adults and individuals with dementia and add to the empirical evidence that supports the role of the frontal lobe and hippocampus in verb retrieval and search. Declines in verb fluency performance cannot only be used as a cognitive marker, but also represent neuropathological changes due to the neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-associated loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) causes visual deficits, but there is not yet any therapeutic agent to prevent the loss of these cells. Herein, we report that apelin, an endogenous peptide ligand of APJ receptor, is protective against the age-related loss of RGCs in mice. The mRNA expression of apelin was reduced in the retina of old mice compared with that in young mice, whereas retinal APJ expression increased with age. Immunofluorescence staining showed that APJ was present in RGCs and their surrounding cells expressed apelin. In addition, both functional and histological analyses demonstrated that apelin deficiency accelerated the loss of RGCs associated with age in mice. These results suggest that endogenous apelin plays a protective role against the degeneration of RGCs and that the apelinergic axis may be a new target for preventing age-related visual impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: Problems with attention are common in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). The normal human brain exhibits functional and structural asymmetry. However, it is unknown whether there is lateralization of attention in patients with CSVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aims to investigate attention separately in both cerebral hemispheres in patients with CSVD using the computer-based Lateralized Attention Network Test—Revised (LANT-R).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The total number of subjects included was 58, which includes the CSVD (N = 35) and healthy control (HC, N = 23) groups. All subjects completed the LANT-R paradigm and neuropsychological background tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The results indicate that there is an left hemisphere (LH) lateralization in orienting network efficiency in the HC group. However, this lateralization was not apparent in the CSVD group. Furthermore, the difference between groups was significant (interaction P = 0.02). In addition, the scores of subjects in the CSVD group are lower in several cognitive domains, including attention function, memory function, information processing speed, and executive function, compared with the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Patients with CSVD change in the lateralization of attention compared with the normal elderly. The decrease in attention in patients with CSVD might be caused by the reduced ability of selecting useful information in the LH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Shank3 loss or disfunction is strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders. Tatavarty et al. show that Shank3 loss impairs homeostatic plasticity and blocks homeostatic compensation during sensory perturbations; Li treatment restores homeostatic plasticity and normalizes a repetitive behavior. Thus, Shank3 loss impairs homeostatic compensation and renders central circuits vulnerable to perturbations during postnatal development.</content>

The use of comparative genomics for functional, evolutionary, and epidemiological studies requires methods to classify gene families in terms of occurrence in a given species. These methods usually lack multivariate statistical models to infer the partitions and the optimal number of classes and don’t account for genome organization. We introduce a graph structure to model pangenomes in which nodes represent gene families and edges represent genomic neighborhood. Our method, named PPanGGOLiN, partitions nodes using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on multivariate Bernoulli Mixture Model coupled with a Markov Random Field. This approach takes into account the topology of the graph and the presence/absence of genes in pangenomes to classify gene families into persistent, cloud, and one or several shell partitions. By analyzing the partitioned pangenome graphs of isolate genomes from 439 species and metagenome-assembled genomes from 78 species, we demonstrate that our method is effective in estimating the persistent genome. Interestingly, it shows that the shell genome is a key element to understand genome dynamics, presumably because it reflects how genes present at intermediate frequencies drive adaptation of species, and its proportion in genomes is independent of genome size. The graph-based approach proposed by PPanGGOLiN is useful to depict the overall genomic diversity of thousands of strains in a compact structure and provides an effective basis for very large scale comparative genomics.

 &lt;p&gt;Binaural beating is a perceptual auditory illusion occurring when presenting two neighboring frequencies to each ear separately. Several controversial claims have been attributed to binaural beats regarding their ability to entrain human brain activity and mood, in both the scientific literature and the marketing realm. Here, we sought to address those questions in a robust fashion using a single-blind, active-controlled protocol. To do so, we compared the effects of binaural beats with a control beat stimulation (monaural beats, known to entrain brain activity but not mood) across four distinct levels in the human auditory pathway: subcortical and cortical entrainment, scalp-level functional connectivity and self-reports. Both stimuli elicited standard subcortical responses at the pure tone frequencies of the stimulus [i.e., frequency following response (FFR)], and entrained the cortex at the beat frequency [i.e., auditory steady state response (ASSR)]. Furthermore, functional connectivity patterns were modulated differentially by both kinds of stimuli, with binaural beats being the only one eliciting cross-frequency activity. Despite this, we did not find any mood modulation related to our experimental manipulation. Our results provide evidence that binaural beats elicit cross frequency connectivity patterns, but weakly entrain the cortex when compared with monaural beat stimuli. Whether binaural beats have an impact on cognitive performance or other mood measurements remains to be seen and can be further investigated within the proposed methodological framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity forms the basis for neuronal circuit complexity and differences between otherwise similar circuits. We show that the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (&lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;) plays a central role in intrinsic plasticity of olfactory bulb (OB) projection neurons. Mitral and tufted (M/T) neurons from &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice are hyperexcitable, have a reduced Type-A potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) and exhibit reduced expression of &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3,&lt;/i&gt; which encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel subunit (Kv4.3) important for generating the I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, expression of the &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; genes is activity-dependent in OB projection neurons and the MITF protein activates expression from &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; regulatory elements. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice have changes in olfactory habituation and have increased habitutation for an odourant following long-term exposure, indicating that regulation of &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; is pivotal for long-term olfactory adaptation. Our findings show that &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; acts as a direct regulator of intrinsic homeostatic feedback and links neuronal activity, transcriptional changes and neuronal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; These findings broaden the general understanding of transcriptional regulation of intrinsic plasticity in learning and memory. Regulation of intrinsic plasticity has wide-ranging implications and fundamental importance for neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Local brain signal variability (standard deviation of the BOLD signal [SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt;]) correlates with age and cognitive performance, and recently differentiated Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients from healthy controls. However, it is unknown if changes to SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; precede diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We compared ostensibly healthy older adult humans who scored below the recommended threshold on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and who showed reduced medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume in a previous study (‘at-risk’ group, n=20), with healthy older adults who scored within the normal range on the MoCA (‘control’ group, n=20). Using multivariate partial least squares analysis we assessed the correlations between SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and age, MoCA score, global fractional anisotropy, global mean diffusivity, and four cognitive factors. Greater SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in the MTL and occipital cortex positively correlated with performance on cognitive control/speed tasks but negatively correlated with memory scores in the control group. These relations were weaker in the at-risk group. A post-hoc analysis assessed associations between MTL volumes and SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in both groups. This revealed a negative correlation, most robust in the at-risk group, between MTL SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and MTL subregion volumetry, particularly the entorhinal and parahippocampal regions. Taken together, these results suggest that the association between SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and cognition differs between the at-risk and control groups, which may be due to lower MTL volumes in the at-risk group. Our data indicate relations between MTL SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and cognition may be helpful in understanding brain differences in individuals who may be at risk for further cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Moment-to-moment variability in the BOLD signal, once dismissed as nuisance noise, is now understood to be an information-bearing signal. BOLD variability correlates with age and cognitive performance and was recently used to differentiate Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients from controls. As AD is a progressive disease, AD patients may benefit from its early detection. We found that older adults at-risk for cognitive decline showed differences in the relationships between BOLD variability and cognitive performance, relative to healthy controls. Notably, the differences were strongest in medial temporal lobe (MTL), areas where AD is known to begin. Our data suggest correlations between MTL BOLD variability and cognition may be useful for understanding brain differences in individuals at risk for further cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Toll‐like Receptor 4 Signaling in Neurons Enhances Calcium‐Permeable AMPA Receptor Currents and Drives Post‐Traumatic Epileptogenesis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0b2f7cbc-cb84-475a-b984-0cb6d205fcf3/ana25698-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary of interactions between Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and brain injury on network excitability and epileptogenesis. Graphic illustration of the effect of injury and early TLR4 antagonist treatment on early network excitability and the long‐term network state. The schematic neurons include TLR4 and α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit expression profiles in the acute phase of sham or brain injury. The corresponding early effects on network excitability are depicted by schematic population response traces (inset on upper left). Note the increase in excitability of the uninjured neuron after TLR4 antagonism without changes in AMPAR expression. Note also the increase in TLR4, calcium permeable AMPARs, and population excitability after injury and its reduction by TLR4 antagonist treatment. Ampakine enhancement of excitability during TLR4 antagonism is illustrated. The early phase responses and manipulations (including injury, treatments, and molecular responses) are superimposed on a 2‐tone color‐coded network state topology, where green indicates low‐normal network excitability, ensuring network stability and low risk for epilepsy (inset on upper right). Note the correspondence between early excitability state (population response profile) and long‐term seizure susceptibility and the effects of pharmacological manipulations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury is a major risk factor for acquired epilepsies, and understanding the mechanisms underlying the early pathophysiology could yield viable therapeutic targets. Growing evidence indicates a role for inflammatory signaling in modifying neuronal excitability and promoting epileptogenesis. Here we examined the effect of innate immune receptor Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) on excitability of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and epileptogenesis after brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slice and in vivo electrophysiology and Western blots were conducted in rats subject to fluid percussion brain injury or sham injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies identify that TLR4 signaling in neurons augments dentate granule cell calcium‐permeable α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor (CP‐AMPAR) currents after brain injury. Blocking TLR4 signaling in vivo shortly after brain injury reduced dentate network excitability and seizure susceptibility. When blocking of TLR4 signaling after injury was delayed, however, this treatment failed to reduce postinjury seizure susceptibility. Furthermore, TLR4 signal blocking was less efficacious in limiting seizure susceptibility when AMPAR currents, downstream targets of TLR4 signaling, were transiently enhanced. Paradoxically, blocking TLR4 signaling augmented both network excitability and seizure susceptibility in uninjured controls. Despite the differential effect on seizure susceptibility, TLR4 antagonism suppressed cellular inflammatory responses after injury without impacting sham controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrate that independently of glia, the immune receptor TLR4 directly regulates post‐traumatic neuronal excitability. Moreover, the TLR4‐dependent early increase in dentate excitability is causally associated with epileptogenesis. Identification and selective targeting of the mechanisms underlying the aberrant TLR4‐mediated increase in CP‐AMPAR signaling after injury may prevent epileptogenesis after brain trauma. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:497–515&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological research in multiple sclerosis (MS) has mainly been performed in socioeconomically and ethnically limited populations; influences on MS risk have not been studied in prospectively collected non‐White populations. We set out to study the influence of previously described MS risk factors in an ethnically diverse population.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nested case–control study was created using primary care records of &amp;gt;1 million individuals, &amp;gt;50% of whom identify as Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME). MS cases were compared to an age‐ and sex‐matched control cohort (1:4), and to a large unmatched cohort. Odds ratios (ORs) of disease were determined according to exposure of interest, and a multivariate model including all exposures was created. Potential pairwise interactions were considered where both indicated a significant effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,344 confirmed MS cases were included. MS OR in blacks aged &amp;lt;40 years was 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81–1.62) compared to whites. MS odds in BAME current (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.24–2.31) and ex‐smokers (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 2.14–3.72) were considerably higher than in Whites (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.88–1.34; OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.19–1.74, respectively). Prior infectious mononucleosis was associated with increased odds of MS in Blacks (OR = 4.94, 95% CI = 1.23–17.89). An increase in MS odds was seen in the least‐deprived quintile (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.40–4.24), but no effect across deprived quintiles was seen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cohort provides novel data on factors potentially driving MS susceptibility in a diverse population, one‐third of whom live in poverty. Environmental exposures have differential risk across ethnicity. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:599–608&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain networks of ALS patients (n = 208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that computer‐simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, at both group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore their potential as a prognostic biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not known whether patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with ischemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy are at increased risk for further recurrent strokes or how ongoing secondary prevention should be managed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an individual patient data pooled analysis of 7 prospective cohort studies that recruited patients with AF and recent cerebral ischemia. We compared patients taking oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists [VKA] or direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC]) prior to index event (OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt;) with those without prior oral anticoagulation (OAC&lt;sub&gt;naive&lt;/sub&gt;). We further compared those who changed the type (ie, from VKA or DOAC, vice versa, or DOAC to DOAC) of anticoagulation (OAC&lt;sub&gt;changed&lt;/sub&gt;) with those who continued the same anticoagulation as secondary prevention (OAC&lt;sub&gt;unchanged&lt;/sub&gt;). Time to recurrent acute ischemic stroke (AIS) was analyzed using multivariate competing risk Fine–Gray models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 5,413 patients (median age = 78 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 71–84 years]; 5,136 [96.7%] had ischemic stroke as the index event, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission = 6 [IQR = 2–12]). The median CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐Vasc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, sex category) was 5 (IQR = 4–6) and was similar for OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 1,195) and OAC&lt;sub&gt;naive&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 4,119, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.103). During 6,128 patient‐years of follow‐up, 289 patients had AIS (4.7% per year, 95% CI = 4.2–5.3%). OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt; was associated with an increased risk of AIS (HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2–2.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005). OAC&lt;sub&gt;changed&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 307) was not associated with decreased risk of AIS (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7–2.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.415) compared with OAC&lt;sub&gt;unchanged&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 585).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with AF who have an ischemic stroke despite previous oral anticoagulation are at a higher risk for recurrent ischemic stroke despite a CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐Vasc score similar to those without prior oral anticoagulation. Better prevention strategies are needed for this high‐risk patient group. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate β‐amyloid and tau depositions using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and AV1451 tau PET imaging in aging multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with MS (n = 16) and controls (n = 80) matched for age, sex, and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; ε4 status from the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent PiB PET imaging were studied. Of these individuals, 12 patients with MS and 60 matching controls also underwent AV1451 tau PET. Cortical PiB and AV1451 standard uptake value ratios (SUVrs) from the entire cortex and previously determined Alzheimer disease (AD) signature regions in the same population were calculated for group comparisons and testing for associations with age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AD signature PiB SUVr (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.52 [0.27–0.98], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.044), total cortical PiB SUVr (OR [95% CI] = 0.52 [0.28–0.99], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.048), and the frequency of abnormal PiB SUVrs (OR [95% CI] = 0.10 [0.01–0.90], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.040) were lower in MS than controls. Although AD‐signature and total cortical AV1451 SUVrs were not different between the groups, the frequency of abnormal AV1451 SUVrs was higher (OR [95% CI] = 10.65 [1.10–103.35], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.041) in MS than controls. The association of AD signature PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95% CI] = −0.14 [−0.023 to −0.006], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). Similarly, the association of total cortical PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95% CI] = −0.13 [−0.021 to −0.005], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). There was no difference in the association of AV1451 SUVr findings with age between the MS patients and controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both β‐amyloid and tau are biomarkers of cognitive aging and AD, cortical β‐amyloid deposition was lower in MS than age‐matched controls, suggesting that some aspect of MS pathobiology retards the accumulation of β‐amyloid but not the accumulation of tau. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:556–567&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The bicaudal D cargo adaptor 2 (&lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt;) gene encodes a conserved cargo adaptor protein required for dynein‐mediated transport. Inherited and de novo variants in &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; cause SMALED2 (spinal muscular atrophy lower extremity dominant 2), and a subset have recently been reported to cause severe, often lethal disease. However, a true genotype–phenotype correlation for &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; has not been performed, and cases described to date are scattered among at least 14 publications. In this review, we identify the characteristics of disease‐causing variants in &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; that distinguish them from benign variation and perform genotype–phenotype correlations for 99 &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; variant carriers from 35 families. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:487–496&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies against neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis alter neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, but the effects on other cells of the nervous system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (preabsorbed or not with GluN1) and a human NMDAR‐specific monoclonal antibody (SSM5) derived from plasma cells of a patient, along the corresponding controls, were used in the studies. To evaluate the activity of oligodendrocyte NMDARs and α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in vitro after exposure to patients' CSF antibodies or SSM5, we used a functional assay based on cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging. Expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT1) in oligodendrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NMDAR agonist responses were robustly reduced after preincubation of oligodendrocytes with patients' CSF or SSM5 but remained largely unaltered with the corresponding controls. These effects were NMDAR specific, as patients' CSF did not alter responses to AMPA receptor agonists and was abrogated by preabsorption of CSF with HEK cells expressing GluN1 subunit. Patients' CSF also reduced oligodendrocyte expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 induced by NMDAR activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis specifically alter the function of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes, causing a decrease of expression of GLUT1. Considering that normal GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes and myelin is needed to metabolically support axonal function, the findings suggest a link between antibody‐mediated dysfunction of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes and the white matter alterations reported in patients with this disorder.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT‐HD, TRACK‐HD, and IMAGE‐HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease‐affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (&amp;gt;0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of &amp;gt;80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide the first cross‐study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM2 gangliosidoses are lysosomal diseases due to biallelic mutations in the &lt;i&gt;HEXA&lt;/i&gt; (Tay–Sachs disease [TS]) or &lt;i&gt;HEXB&lt;/i&gt; (Sandhoff disease [SD]) genes, with subsequent low hexosaminidase(s) activity. Most patients have childhood onset, but some experience the first symptoms during adolescence/adulthood. This study aims to clarify the natural history of adult patients with GM2 gangliosidosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively described 12 patients from a French cohort and 45 patients from the literature.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed 4 typical presentations: (1) lower motoneuron disorder responsible for proximal lower limb weakness that subsequently expanded to the upper limbs, (2) cerebellar ataxia, (3) psychosis and/or severe mood disorder (only in the TS patients), and (4) a complex phenotype mixing the above 3 manifestations. The psoas was the first and most affected muscle in the lower limbs, whereas the triceps and interosseous were predominantly involved in the upper limbs. A longitudinal study of compound motor action potentials showed a progressive decrease in all nerves, with different kinetics. Sensory potentials were sometimes abnormally low, mainly in the SD patients. The main brain magnetic resonance imaging feature was cerebellar atrophy, even in patients without cerebellar symptoms. The prognosis was mainly related to gait disorder, as we showed that beyond 20 years of disease evolution, half of the patients were wheelchair users.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved knowledge of GM2 gangliosidosis in adults will help clinicians achieve correct diagnoses and better inform patients on the evolution and prognosis. It may also contribute to defining proper outcome measures when testing emerging therapies. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:609–617&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early step in tau‐mediated neurodegeneration and is associated with intracellular aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer disease. Sleep loss increases the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of amyloid‐β and tau. Using mass spectrometry, we measured tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations in serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected from participants who were sleep‐deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. We found that sleep loss affected phosphorylated tau differently depending on the modified site. These findings suggest a mechanism for sleep loss to increase risk of Alzheimer disease.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel, highly effective disease‐modifying therapies have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care. However, evidence from large comparative studies on important safety outcomes, such as cancer, is still lacking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this nationwide register‐based cohort study, we linked data from the Swedish MS register to the Swedish Cancer Register and other national health care and census registers. We included 4,187 first‐ever initiations of rituximab, 1,620 of fingolimod, and 1,670 of natalizumab in 6,136 MS patients matched for age, sex, and location to 37,801 non‐MS general population subjects. Primary outcome was time to first invasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 78 invasive cancers among treated patients: rituximab 33 (incidence rate [IR] per 10,000 person‐years = 34.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.7–48.3), fingolimod 28 (IR = 44.0, 95% CI = 29.2–63.5), and natalizumab 17 (IR = 26.0, 95% CI = 15.1–41.6). The general population IR was 31.0 (95% CI = 27.8–34.4). Adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found no difference in risk of invasive cancer between rituximab, natalizumab, and the general population but a possibly higher risk with fingolimod compared to the general population (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53, 95% CI = 0.98–2.38) and rituximab (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.00–2.84).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first large comparative study of 3 highly effective MS disease‐modifying therapies, no increased risk of invasive cancer was seen with rituximab and natalizumab, compared to the general population. However, there was a borderline‐significant increased risk with fingolimod, compared to both the general population and rituximab. It was not possible to attribute this increased risk to any specific type of cancer, and further studies are warranted to validate these findings. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25705?af=R"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is conventionally not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex postprocessing, or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness, and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time‐efficient simultaneous T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxometry and proton density mapping in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3T MRI ex vivo in 3 multiple sclerosis brain samples and in vivo in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex‐matched healthy controls, with scan–rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2‐year follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin‐related stains (proteolipid protein immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole‐brain and normal‐appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow‐up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal‐appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Because the technique is fast, with automatic postprocessing and US Food and Drug Administration/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors of prolonged (&amp;gt;2 weeks) post–cardiac arrest (CA) coma are expected to remain permanently disabled. We aimed to investigate 3 outlier patients who ultimately achieved independent functional outcomes after prolonged post‐CA coma to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of their recovery potential. For validation purposes, we also aimed to evaluate these markers in an independent cohort of post‐CA patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 3 patients with late recovery from coma (17–37 days) following CA who recovered to functionally independent behavioral levels. We performed spectral power analyses of available EEGs during prominent burst suppression patterns (BSP) present in all 3 patients. Using identical methods, we also assessed the relationship of intraburst spectral power and outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of post‐CA patients. We performed chart reviews of common clinical, imaging, and EEG prognostic variables and clinical outcomes for all patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 3 patients with late recovery from coma lacked evidence of overwhelming cortical injury but demonstrated prominent BSP on EEG. Spectral analyses revealed a prominent theta (~4–7Hz) feature dominating the bursts during BSP in these patients. In the prospective cohort, similar intraburst theta spectral features were evident in patients with favorable outcomes; patients with BSP and unfavorable outcomes showed either no features, transient burst features, or decreasing intraburst frequencies with time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSP with theta (~4–7Hz) peak intraburst spectral power after CA may index a recovery potential. We discuss our results in the context of optimizing metabolic substrate availability and stimulating the corticothalamic system during recovery from prolonged post‐CA coma. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:618–632&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not uniform as dopamine neurons from the ventral tier are lost more rapidly than those of the dorsal tier. Identifying the intrinsic differences that account for this differential vulnerability may provide a key for developing new treatments for PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we compared the RNA‐sequenced transcriptomes of ~100 laser captured micro‐dissected SNpc neurons from each tier from seven healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expression levels of dopaminergic markers were similar across the tiers while markers specific to the neighbouring ventral tegmental area were virtually undetected. After accounting for unwanted sources of variation, we identified one hundred and six differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the SNpc tiers. The genes higher in the dorsal/resistant SNpc tier neurons displayed coordinated patterns of expression across the human brain, their protein products had more interactions than expected by chance and they demonstrated evidence of functional convergence. No significant shared functionality was found for genes higher in the ventral/vulnerable SNpc tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly but importantly, none of the identified DEGs were among the familial PD genes or genome‐wide associated loci. Finally, we found some DEGs in opposite tier orientation between human and analogous mouse populations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results highlight functional enrichments of vesicular trafficking, ion transport/homeostasis and oxidative stress genes showing higher expression in the resistant neurons of the SNpc dorsal tier. Furthermore, the comparison of gene expression variation in human and mouse SNpc populations strongly argues for the need of human‐focused Omics studies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Expanding use of immune‐checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) underscores the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely management of neurological immune‐related adverse events (irAE‐N). We evaluate the real‐world frequency, phenotypes, co‐occurring immune‐related adverse events (irAEs), and long‐term outcomes of severe, grade III to V irAE‐N at a tertiary care center over 6 years. We analyze how our experience supports published literature and professional society guidelines. We also discuss these data with regard to common clinical scenarios, such as combination therapy, ICI rechallenge and risk of relapse of irAE‐N, and corticosteroid taper, which are not specifically addressed by current guidelines and/or have limited data. Recommendations for management and future irAE‐N reporting are outlined. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Graph theory in the last two decades penetrated sociology, molecular biology,
genetics, chemistry, computer engineering, and numerous other fields of
science. One of the more recent areas of its applications is the study of the
connections of the human brain. By the development of diffusion magnetic
resonance imaging (diffusion MRI), it is possible today to map the connections
between the 1-1.5 cm$^2$ regions of the gray matter of the human brain. These
connections can be viewed as a graph: the vertices are the anatomically
identified regions of the gray matter, and two vertices are connected by an
edge if the diffusion MRI-based workflow finds neuronal fiber tracts between
these areas. This way we can compute 1015-vertex graphs with tens of thousands
of edges. In a previous work, we have analyzed the male and female braingraphs
graph-theoretically, and we have found statistically significant differences in
numerous parameters between the sexes: the female braingraphs are better
expanders, have more edges, larger bipartition widths, and larger vertex cover
than the braingraphs of the male subjects. Our previous study has applied the
data of 96 subjects; here we present a much larger study of 426 subjects. Our
data source is an NIH-founded project, the &quot;Human Connectome Project (HCP)&quot;
public data release. As a service to the community, we have also made all of
the braingraphs computed by us from the HCP data publicly available at the
\url{&lt;a href=&quot;http://braingraph.org&quot;&gt;this http URL&lt;/a&gt;} for independent validation and further
investigations.

 &lt;p&gt;Eukaryotic cells release different types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes, ectosomes, and microvesicles. Exosomes are nanovesicles, 30–200 nm in diameter, that carry cell- and cell-state-specific cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, including mRNA and miRNA. Recent studies have shown that central nervous system (CNS)-derived exosomes may carry amyloidogenic proteins and facilitate their cell-to-cell transfer, thus playing a critical role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as tauopathies and synucleinopathies. CNS-derived exosomes also have been shown to cross the blood-brain-barrier into the bloodstream and therefore have drawn substantial attention as a source of biomarkers for various neurodegenerative diseases as they can be isolated via a minimally invasive blood draw and report on the biochemical status of the CNS. However, although isolating specific brain-cell-derived exosomes from the blood is theoretically simple and the approach has great promise, practical details are of crucial importance and may compromise the reproducibility and utility of this approach, especially when different laboratories use different protocols. In this review we discuss the role of exosomes in neurodegenerative diseases, the usefulness of CNS-derived blood exosomes as a source of biomarkers for these diseases, and practical challenges associated with the methodology of CNS-derived blood exosomes and subsequent biomarker analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;The peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) has been proposed as a fully automated imaging marker of relevance to cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). We assessed PSMD in relation to conventional SVD markers, global measures of neurodegeneration, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;145 participants underwent 3T brain MRI and cognitive assessment. 112 were patients with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with Lewy bodies, or frontotemporal dementia. PSMD, SVD burden [white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), microbleeds, lacunes], average mean diffusivity (MD), gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and total intracranial volume were quantified. Robust linear regression was conducted to examine associations between variables. Dominance analysis assessed the relative importance of markers in predicting various outcomes. Regional analyses examined spatial overlap between PSMD and WMH.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;PSMD was associated with global and regional SVD measures, especially WMH and microbleeds. Dominance analysis demonstrated that among SVD markers, WMH was the strongest predictor of PSMD. Furthermore, PSMD was more closely associated to WMH than with GM and WM volumes. PSMD was associated with WMH across all regions, and correlations were not significantly stronger in corresponding regions (e.g., frontal PSMD and frontal WMH) compared to non-corresponding regions. PSMD outperformed all four conventional SVD markers and MD in predicting cognition, but was comparable to GM and WM volumes.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;PSMD was robustly associated with established SVD markers. This new measure appears to be a marker of diffuse brain injury, largely due to vascular pathology, and may be a useful and convenient metric of overall cerebrovascular burden.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that altered activity in somatosensory and motor cortices play a key role in pain chronification. Neurofeedback training of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) is a tool which allow individuals to self-modulate their brain activity and to produce significant changes over somatomotor brain areas. Several studies have further shown that neurofeedback training may reduce pain and other pain-related symptoms in chronic pain patients. The goal of the present study was to analyze changes in SMR power and brain functional connectivity of the somatosensory and motor cortices elicited by neurofeedback task designed to both synchronize and desynchronize the SMR power over motor and somatosensory areas in fibromyalgia patients. Seventeen patients were randomly assigned to the SMR training (n = 9) or to a sham protocol (n = 8). All participants were trained during 6 sessions, and fMRI and EEG power elicited by synchronization and desynchronization trials were analyzed. In the SMR training group, four patients achieved the objective of SMR modulation in more than 70% of the trials from the second training session (good responders), while five patients performed the task at the chance level (bad responders). Good responders to the neurofeedback training significantly reduced pain and increased both SMR power modulation and functional connectivity of motor and somatosensory related areas during the last neurofeedback training session, whereas no changes in brain activity or pain were observed in bad responders or participants in the sham group. In addition, we observed that good responders were characterized by reduced impact of fibromyalgia and pain symptoms, as well as by increased levels of health-related quality of life during the pre-training sessions. In summary, the present study revealed that neurofeedback training of SMR elicited significant brain changes in somatomotor areas leading to a significant reduction of pain in fibromyalgia patients. In this sense, our research provide evidence that neurofeedback training is a promising tool for a better understanding of brain mechanisms involved in pain chronification.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can induce changes in remote brain regions. In the stimulated regions, low-frequency (≤1 Hz) rTMS induces inhibitory effects, while high-frequency (≥5 Hz) stimulation induces excitatory effects. However, these stereotypical effects arising from low- and high-frequency stimulation are based on measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by pulsed stimulation. To test the effects of rTMS on remote brain regions, the current study recruited 31 young healthy adults who participated in three rTMS sessions (10 Hz high frequency, 1 Hz low frequency, and sham) on three separate days. The stimulation target was based on individual fMRI activation in the motor cortex evoked by a finger movement task. Pre- and post-rTMS resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) were acquired. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and degree centrality (DC) were calculated to measure the local and global connectivity, respectively. Compared with the sham session, high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS significantly increased ReHo and DC in the right cerebellum, while low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation did not significantly alter ReHo or DC. Then, using a newly developed PAIR support vector machine (SVM) method, we achieved accuracy of 93.18–97.24% by split-half validation for pairwise comparisons between conditions for ReHo or DC. While the univariate analyses suggest that high-frequency rTMS of the left motor cortex could affect distant brain activity in the right cerebellum, the multivariate SVM results suggest that both high- and low-frequency rTMS significantly modulated widespread brain activity. The current findings are useful for increasing the understanding of the mechanisms of rTMS, as well as guiding precise individualized rTMS treatment of movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Acute brain slice preparation is a powerful experimental model for investigating the characteristics of synaptic function in the brain. Although brain tissue is usually cut at ice-cold temperature (CT) to facilitate slicing and avoid neuronal damage, exposure to CT causes molecular and architectural changes of synapses. To address these issues, we investigated ultrastructural and electrophysiological features of synapses in mouse acute cerebellar slices prepared at ice-cold and physiological temperature (PT). In the slices prepared at CT, we found significant spine loss and reconstruction, synaptic vesicle rearrangement and decrease in synaptic proteins, all of which were not detected in slices prepared at PT. Consistent with these structural findings, slices prepared at PT showed higher release probability. Furthermore, preparation at PT allows electrophysiological recording immediately after slicing resulting in higher detectability of long-term depression (LTD) after motor learning compared with that at CT. These results indicate substantial advantages of the slice preparation at PT for investigating synaptic functions in different physiological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in persistent functional deficits due to the lack of axon regeneration within the mammalian CNS. After SCI, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) inhibit axon regrowth via putative interactions with the LAR-family protein tyrosine phosphatases, PTPσ and LAR, localized on the injured axon tips. Unlike mammals, the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, robustly recovers locomotion after complete spinal cord transection (TX). Behavioral recovery is accompanied by heterogeneous yet predictable anatomical regeneration of the lamprey’s reticulospinal (RS) system. The identified RS neurons can be categorized as “good” or “bad” regenerators based on the likelihood that their axons will regenerate. Those neurons that fail to regenerate their axons undergo a delayed form of caspase-mediated cell death. Previously, this lab reported that lamprey PTPσ mRNA is selectively expressed in “bad regenerator” RS neurons, preceding SCI-induced caspase activation. Consequently, we hypothesized that PTPσ deletion would reduce retrograde cell death and promote axon regeneration. Using antisense morpholino oligomers (MOs), we knocked down PTPσ expression after TX and assessed the effects on axon regeneration, caspase activation, intracellular signaling, and behavioral recovery. Unexpectedly, PTPσ knockdown significantly impaired RS axon regeneration at 10 weeks post-TX, primarily due to reduced long-term neuron survival. Interestingly, cell loss was not preceded by an increase in caspase or p53 activation. Behavioral recovery was largely unaffected, although PTPσ knockdowns showed mild deficits in the recovery of swimming distance and latency to immobility during open field swim assays. Although the mechanism underlying the cell death following TX and PTPσ knockdown remains unknown, this study suggests that PTPσ is not a net negative regulator of long tract axon regeneration in lampreys.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by substantial heterogeneity. To identify the convergence of disease pathology on common pathways, it is essential to understand the correlations among ASD candidate genes and study shared molecular pathways between them. Investigating functional interactions between ASD candidate genes in different cell types of normal human brains may shed new light on the genetic heterogeneity of ASD. Here we apply cell type-specific gene network-based analysis to analyze human brain nucleus gene expression data and identify cell type-specific ASD-associated gene modules. ASD-associated modules specific to different cell types are relevant to different gene functions, for instance, the astrocytes-specific module is involved in functions of axon and neuron projection guidance, GABAergic interneuron-specific modules are involved in functions of postsynaptic membrane, extracellular matrix structural constituent, and ion transmembrane transporter activity. Our findings can promote the study of cell type heterogeneity of ASD, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of ASD. Our method has been shown to be effective in discovering cell type-specific disease-associated gene expression patterns and can be applied to other complex diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A plethora of neurological disorders shares a final common deadly pathway known as excitotoxicity. Among these disorders, ischemic injury is a prominent cause of death and disability worldwide. Brain ischemia stems from cardiac arrest or stroke, both responsible for insufficient blood supply to the brain parenchyma. Glucose and oxygen deficiency disrupts oxidative phosphorylation, which results in energy depletion and ionic imbalance, followed by cell membrane depolarization, calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) overload, and extracellular accumulation of excitatory amino acid glutamate. If tight physiological regulation fails to clear the surplus of this neurotransmitter, subsequent prolonged activation of glutamate receptors forms a vicious circle between elevated concentrations of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and aberrant glutamate release, aggravating the effect of this ischemic pathway. The activation of downstream Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent enzymes has a catastrophic impact on nervous tissue leading to cell death, accompanied by the formation of free radicals, edema, and inflammation. After decades of “neuron-centric” approaches, recent research has also finally shed some light on the role of glial cells in neurological diseases. It is becoming more and more evident that neurons and glia depend on each other. Neuronal cells, astrocytes, microglia, NG2 glia, and oligodendrocytes all have their roles in what is known as glutamate excitotoxicity. However, who is the main contributor to the ischemic pathway, and who is the unsuspecting victim? In this review article, we summarize the so-far-revealed roles of cells in the central nervous system, with particular attention to glial cells in ischemia-induced glutamate excitotoxicity, its origins, and consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synaptic loss induced by soluble oligomeric forms of the amyloid β peptide (sAβos) is one of the earliest events in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is thought to be the major cause of the cognitive deficits. These abnormalities rely on defects in synaptic plasticity, a series of events manifested as activity-dependent modifications in synaptic structure and function. It has been reported that pannexin 1 (Panx1), a nonselective channel implicated in cell communication and intracellular signaling, modulates the induction of excitatory synaptic plasticity under physiological contexts and contributes to neuronal death under inflammatory conditions. Here, we decided to study the involvement of Panx1 in functional and structural defects observed in excitatory synapses of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic (Tg) mice, an animal model of AD. We found an age-dependent increase in the Panx1 expression that correlates with increased Aβ levels in hippocampal tissue from Tg mice. Congruently, we also observed an exacerbated Panx1 activity upon basal conditions and in response to glutamate receptor activation. The acute inhibition of Panx1 activity with the drug probenecid (PBN) did not change neurodegenerative parameters such as amyloid deposition or astrogliosis, but it significantly reduced excitatory synaptic defects in the AD model by normalizing long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression and improving dendritic arborization and spine density in hippocampal neurons of the Tg mice. These results suggest a major contribution of Panx1 in the early mechanisms leading to the synaptopathy in AD. Indeed, PBN induced a reduction in the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), a kinase widely implicated in the early neurotoxic signaling in AD. Our data strongly suggest that an enhanced expression and activation of Panx1 channels contribute to the Aβ-induced cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives&lt;p&gt;Clinically relevant neuroanatomy is challenging to teach, learn and remember since many functionally important structures are visualized best using histology stains from serial 2D planar sections of the brain. In clinical patients, the locations of specific structures then must be inferred from spatial position and surface anatomy. A 3D MRI dataset of neuroanatomy has several advantages including simultaneous multi-planar visualization in the same brain, direct end-user manipulation of the data and image contrast identical to clinical MRI. We created 3D MRI datasets of the postmortem brain with high spatial and contrast resolution for simultaneous multi-planar visualization of complex neuroanatomy.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Whole human brains (N = 6) were immersion-fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 4 weeks, then washed continuously in water for 48 h. The brains were imaged on a clinical 3-T MRI scanner with a 64-channel head and neck coil using a 3D T2-weighted sequence with 400-micron isotropic resolution (voxel = 0.064 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; time = 7 h). Besides resolution, this sequence has multiple adjustments to improve contrast compared to a clinical protocol, including 93% reduced turbo factor and 77% reduced effective echo time.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;This MRI microscopy protocol provided excellent contrast resolution of small nuclei and internal myelinated pathways within the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum. Contrast was sufficient to visualize the presence and variation of horizontal layers in the cerebral cortex. 3D isotropic resolution datasets facilitated simultaneous multi-planar visualization and efficient production of specific tailored oblique image orientations to improve understanding of complex neuroanatomy.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We created an unlabeled high-resolution digital 3D MRI dataset of neuroanatomy as an online resource for readers to download, manipulate, annotate and use for clinical practice, research, and teaching that is complementary to traditional histology-based atlases. Digital MRI contrast is quantifiable, reproducible across brains and could help validate novel MRI strategies for in vivo structure visualization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Subplate neurons (SpNs) are one of the earliest born and matured neurons in the developing cerebral cortex and play an important role in the early development of the neocortex. It has been known that SpNs have an essential role in thalamocortical axon (TCA) pathfinding and the establishment of the first neural circuit from the thalamus towards cortical layer IV. In addition to this function, it has recently been revealed in mouse corticogenesis that SpNs play an important role in the regulation of radial neuronal migration during the mid-embryonic stage. Moreover, accumulating studies throw light on the possible roles of SpNs in adult brain functions and also their involvement in psychiatric or other neurological disorders. As SpNs are unique to mammals, they may have contributed to the evolution of the mammalian neocortex by efficiently organizing cortical formation during the limited embryonic period of corticogenesis. By increasing our knowledge of the functions of SpNs, we will clarify how SpNs act as an organizer of mammalian neocortical formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Sleep spindles are distinctive transient patterns of brain activity that typically occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in humans and other mammals. Thought to be important for the consolidation of learning, they may also be useful for indicating the progression of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize sleep spindles in sheep (&lt;i&gt;Ovis aries&lt;/i&gt;). We recorded electroencephalographs wirelessly from six sheep over a continuous period containing 2 nights and a day. We detected and characterized spindles using an automated algorithm. We found that sheep sleep spindles fell within the classical range seen in humans (10–16 Hz), but we did not see a further separation into fast and slow bands. Spindles were detected predominantly during NREM sleep. Spindle characteristics (frequency, duration, density, topography) varied between individuals, but were similar within individuals between nights. Spindles that occurred during NREM sleep in daytime were indistinguishable from those found during NREM sleep at night. Surprisingly, we also detected numerous spindle-like events during unequivocal periods of wake during the day. These events were mainly local (detected at single sites), and their characteristics differed from spindles detected during sleep. These &quot;wake spindles&quot; are likely to be events that are commonly categorized as &quot;spontaneous alpha activity&quot; during wake. We speculate that wake and sleep spindles are generated via different mechanisms, and that wake spindles play a role in cognitive processes that occur during the daytime.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Fever is a common phenomenon during infection or inflammatory conditions. This stereotypic rise in body temperature (Tb) in response to inflammatory stimuli is a result of autonomic responses triggered by prostaglandin E2 action on EP3 receptors expressed by neurons in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO&lt;sup&gt;EP3R&lt;/sup&gt; neurons). To investigate the identity of MnPO&lt;sup&gt;EP3R&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, we first used &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to show coexpression of EP3R and the VGluT2 transporter in MnPO neurons. Retrograde tracing showed extensive direct projections from MnPO&lt;sup&gt;VGluT2&lt;/sup&gt; but few from MnPO&lt;sup&gt;Vgat&lt;/sup&gt; neurons to a key site for fever production, the raphe pallidus. Ablation of MnPO&lt;sup&gt;VGluT2&lt;/sup&gt; but not MnPO&lt;sup&gt;Vgat&lt;/sup&gt; neurons abolished fever responses but not changes in Tb induced by behavioral stress or thermal challenges. Finally, we crossed EP3R conditional knock-out mice with either VGluT2-IRES-cre or Vgat-IRES-cre mice and used both male and female mice to confirm that the neurons that express EP3R and mediate fever are glutamatergic, not GABAergic. This finding will require rethinking current concepts concerning the central thermoregulatory pathways based on the MnPO&lt;sup&gt;EP3R&lt;/sup&gt; neurons being GABAergic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Body temperature is regulated by the CNS. The rise of the body temperature, or fever, is an important brain-orchestrated mechanism for fighting against infectious or inflammatory disease, and is tightly regulated by the neurons located in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Here we demonstrate that excitatory MnPO neurons mediate fever and examine a potential central circuit underlying the development of fever responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/12/2562?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;When selectively attending to a speech stream in multi-talker scenarios, low-frequency cortical activity is known to synchronize selectively to fluctuations in the attended speech signal. Older listeners with age-related sensorineural hearing loss (presbycusis) often struggle to understand speech in such situations, even when wearing a hearing aid. Yet, it is unclear whether a peripheral hearing loss degrades the attentional modulation of cortical speech tracking. Here, we used psychoacoustics and electroencephalography (EEG) in male and female human listeners to examine potential effects of hearing loss on EEG correlates of speech envelope synchronization in cortex. Behaviorally, older hearing-impaired (HI) listeners showed degraded speech-in-noise recognition and reduced temporal acuity compared with age-matched normal-hearing (NH) controls. During EEG recordings, we used a selective attention task with two spatially separated simultaneous speech streams where NH and HI listeners both showed high speech recognition performance. Low-frequency (&amp;lt;10 Hz) envelope-entrained EEG responses were enhanced in the HI listeners, both for the attended speech, but also for tone sequences modulated at slow rates (4 Hz) during passive listening. Compared with the attended speech, responses to the ignored stream were found to be reduced in both HI and NH listeners, allowing for the attended target to be classified from single-trial EEG data with similar high accuracy in the two groups. However, despite robust attention-modulated speech entrainment, the HI listeners rated the competing speech task to be more difficult. These results suggest that speech-in-noise problems experienced by older HI listeners are not necessarily associated with degraded attentional selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; People with age-related sensorineural hearing loss often struggle to follow speech in the presence of competing talkers. It is currently unclear whether hearing impairment may impair the ability to use selective attention to suppress distracting speech in situations when the distractor is well segregated from the target. Here, we report amplified envelope-entrained cortical EEG responses to attended speech and to simple tones modulated at speech rates (4 Hz) in listeners with age-related hearing loss. Critically, despite increased self-reported listening difficulties, cortical synchronization to speech mixtures was robustly modulated by selective attention in listeners with hearing loss. This allowed the attended talker to be classified from single-trial EEG responses with high accuracy in both older hearing-impaired listeners and age-matched normal-hearing controls.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning (RL) refers to the behavioral process of learning to obtain reward and avoid punishment. An important component of RL is managing explore–exploit tradeoffs, which refers to the problem of choosing between exploiting options with known values and exploring unfamiliar options. We examined correlates of this tradeoff, as well as other RL related variables, in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) while three male monkeys performed a three-armed bandit learning task. During the task, novel choice options periodically replaced familiar options. The values of the novel options were unknown, and the monkeys had to explore them to see if they were better than other currently available options. The identity of the chosen stimulus and the reward outcome were strongly encoded in the responses of single OFC neurons. These two variables define the states and state transitions in our model that are relevant to decision-making. The chosen value of the option and the relative value of exploring that option were encoded at intermediate levels. We also found that OFC value coding was stimulus specific, as opposed to coding value independent of the identity of the option. The location of the option and the value of the current environment were encoded at low levels. Therefore, we found encoding of the variables relevant to learning and managing explore–exploit tradeoffs in OFC. These results are consistent with findings in the ventral striatum and amygdala and show that this monosynaptically connected network plays an important role in learning based on the immediate and future consequences of choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in representing the expected values of choices. Here we extend these results and show that OFC also encodes information relevant to managing explore–exploit tradeoffs. Specifically, OFC encodes an exploration bonus, which characterizes the relative value of exploring novel choice options. OFC also strongly encodes the identity of the chosen stimulus, and reward outcomes, which are necessary for computing the value of novel and familiar options.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Altered synaptic function is thought to play a role in many neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms for synaptic dysfunction. The squid giant synapse (SGS) is a classical model for studying synaptic electrophysiology and ultrastructure, as well as molecular mechanisms of neurotransmission. Here, we conduct a multidisciplinary study of synaptic actions of misfolded human G85R-SOD1 causing familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (fALS). G85R-SOD1, but not WT-SOD1, inhibited synaptic transmission, altered presynaptic ultrastructure, and reduced both the size of the Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles and mobility from the Reserved Pool (RP) to the RRP. Unexpectedly, intermittent high frequency stimulation (iHFS) blocked inhibitory effects of G85R-SOD1 on synaptic transmission, suggesting aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling may underlie G85R-SOD1 toxicity. Ratiometric Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging showed significantly increased presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induced by G85R-SOD1 that preceded synaptic dysfunction. Chelating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; using EGTA prevented synaptic inhibition by G85R-SOD1, confirming the role of aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating G85R-SOD1 toxicity. These results extended earlier findings in mammalian motor neurons and advanced our understanding by providing possible molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in ALS as well as a unique model for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The squid giant synapse presents one of the few mature nervous systems &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; that mimics mammalian neuromuscular junctions, while allowing precise experimental manipulations and live measurement with superior spatial and temporal resolution. Applying these unique features to studying the molecular mechanisms of ALS, a devastating adult-onset neurodegenerative disease without cure, offers clues to understand the pathogenesis of the disease. Our results demonstrating synaptic dysfunction caused by ALS-associated mutant SOD1 protein and its underlying molecular pathways may suggest a novel approach to an effective therapeutic intervention as well as identify biomarkers for early diagnosis. Furthermore, the altered synaptic vesicle behavior and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics revealed through the perturbation of neurotransmission by ALS extends our understanding of fundamental synaptic physiology at both molecular and cellular levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;In the auditory system, the spectrotemporal structure of acoustic signals determines the temporal pattern of spikes. Here we investigated this effect in neurons of the barn owl’s auditory midbrain (&lt;i&gt;Tyto furcata&lt;/i&gt;) that are selective for auditory space and whether it can influence the coding of sound direction. We found that in the nucleus where neurons first become selective to combinations of sound localization cues, reproducibility of spike trains across repeated trials of identical sounds, a metric of across-trial temporal fidelity of spiking patterns evoked by a stimulus, was maximal at the sound direction that elicited the highest firing rate. We then tested the hypothesis that this stimulus-dependent patterning resulted in rate co-modulation of cells with similar frequency and spatial selectivity, driving stimulus-dependent synchrony of population responses. Tetrodes were used to simultaneously record multiple nearby units in the optic tectum (OT), where auditory space is topographically represented. While spiking of neurons in OT showed lower reproducibility across trials compared to upstream nuclei, spike-time synchrony between nearby OT neurons was highest for sounds at their preferred direction. A model of the midbrain circuit explained the relationship between stimulus-dependent reproducibility and synchrony, and demonstrated that this effect can improve the decoding of sound location from the OT output. Thus, stimulus-dependent spiking patterns in the auditory midbrain can have an effect on spatial coding. This study reports a functional connection between spike patterning elicited by spectrotemporal features of a sound and the coding of its location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Spike timing of auditory neurons is modulated by the spectrotemporal structure of sounds. Whether this effect may have implications for coding of sound location remains unresolved. This question was approached in neurons of the owl’s midbrain, where temporal spiking patterns are modulated by the sound’s envelope while firing rate is driven by sound direction. We found that temporal patterns were dependent on binaural cues, leading to stimulus-dependent synchrony of nearby cells. Theoretical analysis showed that stimulus-dependent temporal patterning predicts stimulus-dependent synchrony in nearby cells sharing input with similar spectrotemporal structure, which in turn can sharpen the downstream readout of sound direction. This work shows how stimulus-dependent spike timing can affect the downstream coding of sound location by firing rate, a mechanism that can be generalized to sensory neurons sensitive to the temporal structure of the stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Nicotine use increases the risk for subsequent abuse of other addictive drugs, but the biological basis underlying this risk remains largely unknown. Interactions between nicotine and other drugs of abuse may arise from nicotine-induced neural adaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, a common pathway for the reinforcing effects of many addictive substances. Previous work identified nicotine-induced neuroadaptations that alter inhibitory transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here, we test whether nicotine-induced dysregulation of GABAergic signaling within the VTA increases the vulnerability for benzodiazepine abuse that has been reported in smokers. We demonstrate in rats that nicotine exposure dysregulates diazepam-induced inhibition of VTA GABA neurons and increases diazepam consumption. In VTA GABA neurons, nicotine impaired KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion, depolarized the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; reversal potential, and shifted the pharmacological effect of diazepam on GABA neurons from inhibition toward excitation. In parallel, nicotine-related alterations in GABA signaling observed &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; were associated with enhanced diazepam-induced inhibition of lateral VTA DA neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Targeting KCC2 with the agonist CLP290 normalized diazepam-induced effects on VTA GABA transmission and reduced diazepam consumption following nicotine administration to the control level. Together, our results provide insights into midbrain circuit alterations resulting from nicotine exposure that contribute to the abuse of other drugs, such as benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is the ventral part of the striatum and the interface between cognition, emotion, and action. It is composed of three major subnuclei: i.e., NAc core (NAcC), lateral shell (NAcLS), and medial shell (NAcMS), which exhibit functional heterogeneity. Thus, determining the synaptic inputs of the subregions of the NAc is important for understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in regulating different functions. Here, we simultaneously labeled subregions of the NAc with cholera toxin subunit B conjugated with multicolor Alexa Fluor, then imaged serial sections of the whole brain with a fully automated slide scanning system. Using the interactive WholeBrain framework, we characterized brain-wide inputs to the NAcC subdomains, including the rostral, caudal, dorsal, and ventral subdomains (i.e., rNAcC, cNAcC, dNAcC, and vNAcC, respectively) and the NAc subnuclei. We found diverse brain regions, distributed from the cerebrum to brain stem, projecting to the NAc. Of the 57 brain regions projecting to the NAcC, the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) exhibited the greatest inputs. The input neurons of rNAcC and cNAcC are two distinct populations but share similar distribution over the same upstream brain regions, whereas the input neurons of dNAcC and vNAcC exhibit slightly different distributions over the same upstream regions. Of the 55 brain regions projecting to the NAcLS, the piriform area contributed most of the inputs. Of the 72 brain regions projecting to the NAcMS, the lateral septal nucleus contributed most of the inputs. The input neurons of NAcC and NAcLS share similar distributions, whereas the NAcMS exhibited brain-wide distinct distribution. Thus, the NAcC subdomains appeared to share the same upstream brain regions, although with distinct input neuron populations and slight differences in the input proportions, whereas the NAcMS subnuclei received distinct inputs from multiple upstream brain regions. These results lay an anatomical foundation for understanding the different functions of NAcC subdomains and NAc subnuclei.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain aging is the critical and common factor among several neurodegenerative disorders and dementia. Cellular, biochemical and molecular studies have shown intimate links between oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction during aging and age-associated neuronal diseases. Brain aging is accompanied by oxidative damage of nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA, and diminished repair. Recent studies have reported epigenetic alterations during aging of the brain which involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) that regulates various systems through distinct mechanisms. However, there are studies which depict differing roles of reactive oxidant species as a major factor during aging. In this review, we describe the evidence to show how oxidative stress is intricately linked to age-associated cognitive decline. The review will primarily focus on implications of age-associated oxidative damage on learning and memory, and the cellular events, with special emphasis on associated epigenetic machinery. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms may provide a perspective on the development of potential therapeutic targets within the oxidative system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Oxytocin, acting through the oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) in the periphery, is best known for its roles in regulating parturition and lactation. However, it is also now known to possess a number of important social functions within the central nervous system, including social preference, memory and aggression, that vary to different degrees in different species. The Oxtr is found in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the brain and research is focusing on how, for example, activation of the receptor in interneurons can enhance the signal-to-noise of neuronal transmission. It is important to understand which neurons in the mouse dorsal hippocampus might be activated during memory formation. Therefore, we examined the colocalization of transcripts in over 5,000 neurons for Oxtr with those for nine different markers often found in interneurons using hairpin chain reaction in situ hybridization on hippocampal sections. Most pyramidal cell neurons of CA2 and many in the CA3 express Oxtr. Outside of those excitatory neurons, over 90% of Oxtr-expressing neurons co-express glutamic acid decarboxylase-1 (Gad-1) with progressively decreasing numbers of co-expressing cholecystokinin, somatostatin, parvalbumin, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, the serotonin 3a receptor, the vesicular glutamate transporter 3, calbindin 2 (calretinin), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons. Distributions were analyzed within hippocampal layers and regions as well. These findings indicate that Oxtr activation will modulate the activity of ~30% of the Gad-1 interneurons and the majority of the diverse population of those, mostly, interneuron types specifically examined in the mouse hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the MAPT gene can lead to disease-associated variants of tau. However, the pathological mechanisms behind these genetic tauopathies are poorly understood. Here, we characterized the aggregation stages and conformational changes of tau C291R, a recently described MAPT mutation with potential pathogenic functions. The C291R variant of the tau four-repeat domain (tau-K18; a functional fragment with increased aggregation propensity compared with the full-length protein), aggregated into a mix of granular oligomers, amorphous and annular pore-like aggregates, in native-state and heparin-treated reactions as observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and negative-stained electron microscopy. On extended incubation in the native-state, tau-K18 C291R oligomers, unlike wild type (WT) tau-K18, aggregated to form protofibrils of four different phenotypes: (1) spherical annular; (2) spherical annular encapsulating granular oligomers; (3) ring-like annular but non-spherical; and (4) linear protofibrils. The ring-like tau-K18 C291R aggregates shared key properties of annular protofibrils previously described for other amyloidogenic proteins, in addition to two unique features: irregular/non-spherical-shaped annular protofibrils, and spherical protofibrils encapsulating granular oligomers. Tau-K18 C291R monomers had a circular dichroism (CD) peak at ~210 nm compared with ~199 nm for tau-K18 WT. These data suggest mutation-enhanced β-sheet propensity. Together, we describe the characterization of tau-K18 C291R, the first genetic mutation substituting a cysteine residue. The aggregation mechanism of tau-K18 C291R appears to involve β-sheet-rich granular oligomers which rearrange to form unique protofibrillar structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization plays key roles in cell cycle progression, the pathogenesis of cancer, and age-related neurodegeneration. Most of our knowledge about the role of phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization and the enzyme catalyzing this reaction, the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (Pin1), is largely limited to proteins not present in neurons. Only a handful of examples have shown that phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization, Pin1 binding, or Pin1-mediated peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization regulate proteins present at excitatory synapses. In this work, I confirm previous findings showing that Pin1 binds postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) and identify an alternative binding site in the phosphorylated N-terminus of the PSD-95. Pin1 associates via its WW domain with phosphorylated threonine (T19) and serine (S25) in the N-terminus domain of PSD-95 and this association alters the local conformation of PSD-95. Most importantly, I show that proline-directed phosphorylation of the N-terminus domain of PSD-95 alters the local conformation of this region. Therefore, proline-directed phosphorylation of the N-terminus of PSD-95, Pin1 association, and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization may all play a role in excitatory synaptic function and synapse development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the most common causative gene for autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson’s disease, encodes a large protein kinase harboring multiple characteristic domains. LRRK2 phosphorylates a set of Rab GTPases in cells, which is enhanced by the Parkinson-associated LRRK2 mutations. Accumulating evidence suggests that LRRK2 regulates intracellular vesicle trafficking and organelle maintenance including Golgi, endosomes and lysosomes. Furthermore, genetic knockout or inhibition of LRRK2 cause lysosomal abnormalities in rodents and primates, and cells from Parkinson’s patients with LRRK2 mutations also exhibit altered lysosome morphology. Cell biological studies on LRRK2 in a diverse cellular context further strengthen the potential connection between LRRK2 and regulation of the endolysosomal system, part of which is mediated by Rab phosphorylation by LRRK2. We will focus on the latest advances on the role of LRRK2 and Rab in relation to the endolysosomal system, and discuss the possible link to the pathomechanism of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides is regarded as the hallmark of neurodegenerative alterations in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. In the eye, accumulation of Aβ peptides has also been suggested to be a trigger of retinal neurodegenerative mechanisms. Some pathological aspects associated with Aβ levels in the brain are synaptic dysfunction, neurochemical remodeling and glial activation, but these changes have not been established in the retina of animals with Aβ accumulation. We have employed the Octodon degus in which Aβ peptides accumulated in the brain and retina as a function of age. This current study investigated microglial morphology, expression of PSD95, synaptophysin, Iba-1 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the retina of juvenile, young and adult degus using immunolabeling methods. Neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were detected using immunogold labeling and glutamate receptor subunits were quantified using Western blotting. There was an age-related increase in presynaptic and a decrease in post-synaptic retinal proteins in the retinal plexiform layers. Immunolabeling showed changes in microglial morphology characteristic of intermediate stages of activation around the optic nerve head (ONH) and decreasing activation toward the peripheral retina. Neurotransmitter expression pattern changed at juvenile ages but was similar in adults. Collectively, the results suggest that microglial activation, synaptic remodeling and neurotransmitter changes may be consequent to, or parallel to Aβ peptide and phosphorylated tau accumulation in the retina.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neonates born premature or who suffer brain injury at birth often have oral feeding dysfunction and do not meet oral intake requirements needed for discharge. Low oral intake volumes result in extended stays in the hospital (&amp;gt;2 months) and can lead to surgical implant and explant of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube). Prior work suggests pairing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with motor activity accelerates functional improvements after stroke, and transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) has emerged as promising noninvasive form of VNS. Pairing taVNS with bottle-feeding rehabilitation may improve oromotor coordination and lead to improved oral intake volumes, ultimately avoiding the need for G-tube placement. We investigated whether taVNS paired with oromotor rehabilitation is tolerable and safe and facilitates motor learning in infants who have failed oral feeding. We enrolled 14 infants [11 premature and 3 hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)] who were slated for G-tube placement in a prospective, open-label study of taVNS-paired rehabilitation to increase feeding volumes. Once-daily taVNS was delivered to the left tragus during bottle feeding for 2 weeks, with optional extension. The primary outcome was attainment of oral feeding volumes and weight gain adequate for discharge without G-tube while also monitoring discomfort and heart rate (HR) as safety outcomes. We observed no adverse events related to stimulation, and stimulation-induced HR reductions were transient and safe and likely confirmed vagal engagement. Eight of 14 participants (57%) achieved adequate feeding volumes for discharge without G-tube (mean treatment length: 16 ± 6 days). We observed significant increases in feeding volume trajectories in responders compared with pre-stimulation (p &amp;lt; 0.05). taVNS-paired feeding rehabilitation appears safe and may improve oral feeding in infants with oromotor dyscoordination, increasing the rate of discharge without G-tube, warranting larger controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model has been one of the most successful electrical interpretation of nerve membrane which led to revolutions in the field of computational neuroscience. On the contrary, experimental observations indicate that, an Action Potential (AP) is accompanied with certain physiological changes in the nerve membrane such as, production and absorption of heat; variation of axon diameter, pressure and length. Although, in the early 1900's a Pressure Wave Theory was proposed by E. Wilke, but, due to lack of sophisticated experimental techniques it was left uncharted. Until recently, when Heimburg-Jackson, Hady-Machta and Rvachev, independently proposed Soliton Theory (thermodynamic interpretation of nerve membrane), Mechanical Surface Waves theory (electro-mechanical interpretation) and Rvachev Model (mechano-electrical activation of voltage gated sodium ion channels) respectively; encouraging a deviation from the traditional HH interpretation with justification for the physical changes in the nerve membrane observed experimentally. But, these theories lead to a “hit and miss” scenario because, they do explain certain features (increase/decrease in axon diameter) but miss to explain, correlation between the strength of stimuli and spike rate of AP. Bio-physical models of nerve membrane are thus important for enhancing our understanding regarding the governing dynamics of neural activities encompassing the experimental observations. A novel theory is proposed here which, unravels vortex ring formation due to ion currents in the intracellular and extracellular region leading to variation of pressure causing the increment/decrement in axon diameter. These formations manifest as membrane oscillations which are used to establish a correlation between the strength of stimuli and spike rate of AP. The theory proposed in this paper, brings a paradigm shift in our understanding of neural dynamics from a thorough bio-physical and physiological perspective with promising applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to modulate behavior and immunity. We recently reported that both short and long-term EE enhance baseline locomotion and alleviate depressive-like behavior, but only long-term EE affects locomotion adversely in a threatening environment and enhances anxiety-like behavior in middle-age mice. We have now investigated whether the observed changes in behavior after short- and long-term EE were associated with underlying immune changes. Hence, at the end of behavioral testing, mice were sacrificed, and brains and cervical lymph nodes were collected to investigate the differential effects of the duration of EE (short- and long-term) on the number of immunopositive glial cells in the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and proportions of T cell subsets in the cervical lymph nodes using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, respectively. EE, regardless of duration, caused an increase in microglia number within the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions, but only long-term EE increased astrocytes number within the dentate gyrus and CA3 hippocampal regions. A significantly higher proportion of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; naive T cells was observed after long-term EE vs. short-term EE. No significant differences were observed in the proportion of central memory and effector memory T cells or early activated CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells between any of the test groups. Our results suggest that EE, irrespective of duration, enhances the numbers of microglia, but long-term EE is required to modify astrocyte number and peripheral T cell proportions in middle-aged mice. Our findings provide new insights into the therapeutic effects of EE on various brain disorders, which may be at least partly mediated by glial and neuroimmune modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;During the past 50 years, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been studied in great detail. A plethora of signaling pathways have been identified that account for synaptic changes based on positive and negative feedback mechanisms. Yet, the biological significance of Hebbian synaptic plasticity (= positive feedback) and homeostatic synaptic plasticity (= negative feedback) remains a matter of debate. Specifically, it is unclear how these opposing forms of plasticity, which share common downstream mechanisms, operate in the same networks, neurons, and synapses. Based on the observation that rapid and input-specific homeostatic mechanisms exist, we here discuss a model that is based on signaling pathways that may adjust a balance between Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Hence, “alterations” in Hebbian plasticity may, in fact, resemble “enhanced” homeostasis, which rapidly returns synaptic strength to baseline. In turn, long-lasting experience-dependent synaptic changes may require attenuation of homeostatic mechanisms or the adjustment of homeostatic setpoints at the single-synapse level. In this context, we propose a role for the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in setting a balance between the ability of neurons to express Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the impact of evolution on the central nervous system has been studied by comparing the sizes of brain regions between species. However, more recent work has demonstrated that environmental factors, such as sensory experience, modulate brain region sizes intraspecifically, clouding the distinction between evolutionary and environmental sources of neuroanatomical variation in a sampled brain. Here, we review how teleost fish have played a central role in shaping this traditional understanding of brain structure evolution between species as well as the capacity for the environment to shape brain structure similarly within a species. By demonstrating that variation measured by brain region size varies similarly both inter- and intraspecifically, work on teleosts highlights the depth of the problem of studying brain evolution using neuroanatomy alone: even neurogenesis, the primary mechanism through which brain regions are thought to change size between species, also mediates experience-dependent changes within species. Here, we argue that teleost models also offer a solution to this overreliance on neuroanatomy in the study of brain evolution. With the advent of work on teleosts demonstrating interspecific evolutionary signatures in embryonic gene expression and the growing understanding of developmental neurogenesis as a multi-stepped process that may be differentially regulated between species, we argue that the tools are now in place to reframe how we compare brains between species. Future research can now transcend neuroanatomy to leverage the experimental utility of teleost fishes in order to gain deeper neurobiological insight to help us discern developmental signatures of evolutionary adaptation from phenotypic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stroke remains a leading cause of death, disability, and medical care burden worldwide. However, transformation from laboratory findings toward effective pharmacological interventions for clinical stroke has been unsatisfactory. Novel evidence has been gained on the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic potential related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in several disorders. The TRP superfamily consists of a diverse group of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable non-selective cation channels. In particular, the members of TRP subfamilies, TRP canonical (TRPC) channels and TRPC6, have been found in different cell types in the whole body and have high levels of expression in the central nervous system (CNS). Notably, the TRPCs and TRPC6 channel have been implicated in neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival during normal development and in a range of CNS pathological conditions. Recent studies have shown that suppression of TRPC6 channel degradation prevents ischemic neuronal cell death in experimental stroke. Accumulating evidence supports the important functions of TRPC6 in brain ischemia. We have highlighted some crucial advancement that points toward an important involvement of TRPCs and TRPC6 in ischemic stroke. This review will make an overview of the TRP and TRPC channels due to their roles as targets for clinical trials and CNS disorders. Besides, the primary goal is to discuss and update the critical role of TRPC6 channels in stroke and provide a promising target for stroke prevention and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The human cerebral cortex is the source of many complex behaviors and is a vulnerable target of various neuropsychiatric disorders, but transcriptional profiles linked to cerebral cortical volume (CCV) differences across brain areas remain unknown. Here, we screened CCV-related genes using an across-sample spatial correlation analysis in 6 postmortem brains and then individually validated these correlations in 1091 subjects with different ages and ethnicities. We identified 62 genes whose transcriptional profiles were repeatedly associated with CCV in more than 90% of individuals. CCV-related genes were specifically expressed in neurons and in developmental periods from middle childhood to young adulthood, were enriched in ion channels and developmental processes, and showed significant overlap with genes linked to brain functional activity and mental disorders. The identified genes represent the conserved transcriptional architecture of the human cerebral cortex, suggesting a link between conserved gene transcription and neocortical structural properties.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Many studies showed that anatomical connectivity supports both anatomical and functional hierarchies that span across the primary and association cortices in the cerebral cortex. Even though a structure–function relationship has been indicated to uncouple in the association cortex, it is still unknown whether anatomical connectivity can predict functional activations to the same degree throughout the cortex, and it remains unclear whether a hierarchy of this connectivity–function relationship (CFR) exists across the human cortex. We first addressed whether anatomical connectivity could be used to predict functional activations across different functional domains using multilinear regression models. Then, we characterized the CFR by predicting activity from anatomical connectivity throughout the cortex. We found that there is a hierarchy of CFR between sensory–motor and association cortices. Moreover, this CFR hierarchy was correlated to the functional and anatomical hierarchies, respectively, reflected in functional flexibility and the myelin map. Our results suggest a shared hierarchical mechanism in the cortex, a finding which provides important insights into the anatomical and functional organizations of the human brain.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Telencephalic radial glial progenitors (RGPs) are retained in the ventricular zone (VZ), the niche for neural stem cells during cortical development. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. To study whether protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) may regulate the above process, we generate &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ppp2cα&lt;/span&gt; conditional knockout (cKO) mice, in which PP2A catalytic subunit α (PP2Acα) is inactivated in neural progenitor cells in the dorsal telencephalon. We show that RGPs are ectopically distributed in cortical areas outside of the VZ in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ppp2cα&lt;/span&gt; cKO embryos. Whereas deletion of PP2Acα does not affect the proliferation of RGPs, it significantly impairs the generation of late-born neurons. We find complete loss of apical adherens junctions (AJs) in the ventricular membrane in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ppp2cα&lt;/span&gt; cKO cortices. We observe abundant colocalization for N-cadherin and PP2Acα in control AJs. Moreover, in vitro analysis reveals direct interactions of N-cadherin to PP2Acα and to β-catenin. Overall, this study not only uncovers a novel function of PP2Acα in retaining RGPs into the VZ but also demonstrates the impact of PP2A-dependent retention of RGPs on the generation for late-born neurons.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

The identification of structural variants using short-read data remains challenging. Most approaches that use discordant paired-end sequences ignore non-trivial signatures presented by variants containing 3 breakpoints, such as those generated by various copy-paste and cut-paste mechanisms. This can result in lower precision and sensitivity in the identification of the more common structural variants such as deletions and duplications. We present SVXplorer, which uses a graph-based clustering approach streamlined by the integration of non-trivial signatures from discordant paired-end alignments, split-reads and read depth information to improve upon existing methods. We show that SVXplorer is more sensitive and precise compared to several existing approaches on multiple real and simulated datasets. SVXplorer is available for download at https://github.com/kunalkathuria/SVXplorer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MXfpJUKyczY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The nycthemeral transcriptome embodies all genes displaying a rhythmic variation of their mRNAs periodically every 24 hours, including but not restricted to circadian genes. In this study, we show that the nycthemeral rhythmicity at the gene expression level is biologically functional and that this functionality is more conserved between orthologous genes than between random genes. We used this conservation of the rhythmic expression to assess the ability of seven methods (ARSER, Lomb Scargle, RAIN, JTK, empirical-JTK, GeneCycle, and meta2d) to detect rhythmic signal in gene expression. We have contrasted them to a naive method, not based on rhythmic parameters. By taking into account the tissue-specificity of rhythmic gene expression and different species comparisons, we show that no method is strongly favored. The results show that these methods designed for rhythm detection, in addition to having quite similar performances, are consistent only among genes with a strong rhythm signal. Rhythmic genes defined with a standard &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-value threshold of 0.01 for instance, could include genes whose rhythmicity is biologically irrelevant. Although these results were dependent on the datasets used and the evolutionary distance between the species compared, we call for caution about the results of studies reporting or using large sets of rhythmic genes. Furthermore, given the analysis of the behaviors of the methods on real and randomized data, we recommend using primarily ARS, empJTK, or GeneCycle, which verify expectations of a classical distribution of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values. Experimental design should also take into account the circumstances under which the methods seem more efficient, such as giving priority to biological replicates over the number of time-points, or to the number of time-points over the quality of the technique (microarray vs RNAseq). GeneCycle, and to a lesser extent empirical-JTK, might be the most robust method when applied to weakly informative datasets. Finally, our analyzes suggest that rhythmic genes are mainly highly expressed genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XQPboTkpOqc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Pain is a multidimensional experience of sensory-discriminative, cognitive, and affective processes; however, current basic research methods rely heavily on response to threshold stimuli, bypassing the supraspinal processing that ultimately gives rise to the pain experience. We developed the operant plantar thermal assay (OPTA), which utilizes a novel, conflict-based operant task requiring evaluation and active decision-making to obtain reward under thermally aversive conditions to quantify thermal pain tolerance. In baseline measures, male and female mice exhibited similar temperature preferences, however in the OPTA, female mice exhibited greater temperature-dependent tolerance, as defined by choice time spent in an adverse thermal condition to obtain reward. Increasing reward salience (4% vs 10% sucrose solution) led to increased thermal tolerance for males but not females. To determine whether neuropathic and inflammatory pain models alter thermal tolerance, animals with chronic constriction injury (CCI) or complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), respectively, were tested in the OPTA. Surprisingly, neuropathic animals exhibited increased thermal tolerance, as shown by greater time spent in the reward zone in an adverse thermal condition, compared with sham animals. There was no effect of inflammation on thermal tolerance. Administration of clonidine in the CCI model led to increased thermal tolerance in both injured and sham animals. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meloxicam was anti-hyperalgesic in the CFA model, but reduced thermal pain tolerance. These data support the feasibility of using the OPTA to assess thermal pain tolerance to gain new insights into complex pain behaviors and to investigate novel aspects of analgesic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic scaling is a form of synaptic plasticity where individual synapses scale their strengths to compensate for global suppression or elevation of neuronal activity. This process can be studied by measuring miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes and frequencies following the regulation of activity in neuronal cultures. Here we demonstrate a quantitative approach to characterize multiplicative synaptic scaling using immunolabelling of hippocampal neuronal cultures treated with tetrodotoxin or bicuculline to extract scaling factors for various synaptic proteins. This approach allowed us to directly examine the scaling of pre- and postsynaptic scaffolding molecules along with neurotransmitter receptors in primary cultures from mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. We show robust multiplicative scaling of synaptic scaffolding molecules namely, Shank2, PSD95, Bassoon, and AMPA receptor subunits and quantify their scaling factors. We use super-resolution microscopy to calculate scaling factors of surface expressed GluA2 within functional zones of the synapse and show that there is differential and correlated scaling of GluA2 levels within the spine, the postsynaptic density, and the perisynaptic regions. Our method opens a novel paradigm to quantify relative molecular changes of synaptic proteins within distinct subsynaptic compartments from a large number of synapses in response to alteration of neuronal activity, providing anatomical insights into the intricacies of variability in strength of individual synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Here we demonstrate a novel quantitative method based on rank ordered analysis to characterize multiplicative synaptic scaling from immunolabelling of hippocampal neuronal cultures after activity blockade. We show that along with glutamatergic receptors, several scaffolding molecules are scaled after blocking activity. This analysis paradigm can be generalized to any protein which alters its content post plasticity protocols. With the aid of conventional and super-resolution microscopy, we examine pools of AMPA type glutamatergic receptors, and confirm that they are scaled differentially within functional zones of synapses. Furthermore, we show that the AMPA receptor content within the postsynaptic density and perisynaptic compartments are altered differentially during homeostatic scaling, indicating a differential regulation of receptors within various subsynaptic compartments during homeostatic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Our previous study showed that astrocyte-specific ephrin-B1 knock-out (KO) enhanced but ephrin-B1 overexpression (OE) in hippocampal astrocytes impaired contextual memory recall following fear conditioning. The goal of this study was to understand the mechanism by which astrocytic ephrin-B1 influences learning; specifically, learning-induced remodeling of synapses and dendritic spines in CA1 hippocampus using fear-conditioning paradigm. While we found a higher dendritic spine density and clustering on c-Fos-positive (+) neurons activated during contextual memory recall in both wild-type (WT) and KO mice, overall spine density and mEPSC amplitude were increased in CA1 neurons of KO compared to WT. In contrast, ephrin-B1 OE in hippocampal astrocytes impaired dendritic spine formation and clustering, specifically on c-Fos(+) neurons, coinciding with an overall decrease in vGlut1/PSD95 co-localization. Although astrocytic ephrin-B1 influenced learning-induced spine formation, the changes in astrocytic ephrin-B1 levels did not affect spine enlargement as no genotype differences in spine volume were observed between trained WT, KO, and OE groups. Our results suggest that a reduced formation of new spines rather than spine maturation in activated CA1 hippocampal neurons is most likely responsible for impaired contextual learning in OE mice due to abundantly high ephrin-B1 levels in astrocytes. The ability of astrocytic ephrin-B1 to negatively influence new spine formation during learning can potentially regulate new synapse formation at specific dendritic domains and underlie memory encoding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dentate granule cells (DGCs), the progeny of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG), must develop and functionally integrate with the mature cohort of neurons in order to maintain critical hippocampal functions throughout adulthood. Dysregulation in the continuum of DGC development can result in aberrant morphology and disrupted functional maturation, impairing neuroplasticity of the network. Yet, the molecular underpinnings of the signaling involved in adult-born DGC maturation including dendritic growth, which correlates with functional integration, remains incompletely understood. Given the high metabolic activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) required to achieve continuous neurogenesis, we investigated the potential regulatory role of a cellular metabolism-linked gene recently implicated in NSC cycling and neuroblast migration, called Four and a half LIM domain 2 (FHL2). The FHL2 protein modulates numerous pathways related to proliferation, migration, survival and cytoskeletal rearrangement in peripheral tissues, interacting with the machinery of the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway, also known to be highly active especially in the hippocampus. Yet, the potential relevance of FHL2 to adult-born DGC development remains unknown. To elucidate the role of FHL2 in DGC development in the adult brain, we first confirmed the endogenous expression of FHL2 in NSCs and new granule cells within the DG, then engineered viral vectors for genetic manipulation experiments, investigating morphological changes in early stages of DGC development. Overexpression of FHL2 during early DGC development resulted in marked sprouting and branching of dendrites, while silencing of FHL2 increased dendritic length. Together, these findings suggest a novel role of FHL2 in adult-born DGC morphological maturation, which may open up a new line of investigation regarding the relevance of this gene in physiology and pathologies of the hippocampus such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is an extremely significant public health issue, since it is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, nevertheless it is still widely undiagnosed because of its devious nature. Glaucoma diagnosis criteria are well-defined and have to be strictly observed and recognized: the earlier the disease is diagnosed, the earlier the patient can undergo the most suitable treatment, the better can be the prognosis. The three levels of prevention are essential in the approach to the disease and its pathophysiological features make it eligible for screening. This review provides an overview of the current state of the art in glaucoma management, starting from its prevention and coming to the hub-and-spoke organization. This model applied to glaucoma aims to direct patients toward professional and not professional figures who may guide them in integrated care pathway. This path should be designed in accordance with best practice to coordinate glaucoma prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow up with the best cost-benefit ratio, protecting both the interests of the patient and of the society.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accurately digitizing the brain at the micro-scale is crucial for investigating brain structure-function relationships and documenting morphological alterations due to neuropathies. Here we present a new Smart Region Growing algorithm (SmRG) for the segmentation of single neurons in their intricate 3D arrangement within the brain. Its Region Growing procedure is based on a homogeneity predicate determined by describing the pixel intensity statistics of confocal acquisitions with a mixture model, enabling an accurate reconstruction of complex 3D cellular structures from high-resolution images of neural tissue. The algorithm’s outcome is a 3D matrix of logical values identifying the voxels belonging to the segmented structure, thus providing additional useful volumetric information on neurons. To highlight the algorithm’s full potential, we compared its performance in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, precision and robustness of 3D neuron reconstructions based on microscopic data from different brain locations and imaging protocols against both manual and state-of-the-art reconstruction tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This article starts by discussing the state of the art in accessible interactive maps for use by blind and visually impaired (BVI) people. It then describes a behavioral experiment investigating the efficacy of a new type of low-cost, touchscreen-based multimodal interface, called a vibro-audio map (VAM), for supporting environmental learning, cognitive map development, and wayfinding behavior on the basis of nonvisual sensing. In the study, eight BVI participants learned two floor-maps of university buildings, one using the VAM and the other using an analogous hardcopy tactile map (HTM) overlaid on the touchscreen. They were asked to freely explore each map, with the task of learning the entire layout and finding three hidden target locations. After meeting a learning criterion, participants performed an environmental transfer test, where they were brought to the corresponding physical layout and were asked to plan/navigate routes between learned target locations from memory, i.e., without access to the map used at learning. The results using Bayesian analyses aimed at assessing equivalence showed highly similar target localization accuracy and route efficiency performance between conditions, suggesting that the VAM supports the same level of environmental learning, cognitive map development, and wayfinding performance as is possible from interactive displays using traditional tactile map overlays. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the VAM for supporting complex spatial tasks without vision using a commercially available, low-cost interface and open the door to a new era of mobile interactive maps for spatial learning and wayfinding by BVI navigators.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One approach to the rehabilitation of navigation impairments is to train the use of compensatory egocentric or allocentric navigation strategies. Yet, it is unknown whether and to what degree training programs can influence strategic navigation preferences. In validating this approach, the key assumption that strategic preference can be changed by using a navigation training was assessed in a group of healthy participants (n = 82). The training program consisted of a psychoeducation session and a software package that included either allocentric or egocentric navigation exercises in virtual environments. Strategic navigation preference, objective and self-reported spatial abilities were assessed in pre- and post-training sessions. Based on their pre-training strategic preference, participants received either the egocentric training (n = 19) or the allocentric training (n = 21) version of the training. These participants engaged in four training sessions over a period of 2–3 weeks. The second group of participants did not use the training software (n = 43) and served as a control group. The results show that 50% of participants that received the egocentric training shifted from an allocentric to and an egocentric strategic preference. The proportion of participants that switched their strategic preference as a result of the allocentric training was identical to this proportion in the control group (19%). The training did not affect objective and self-reported navigation abilities as measured in the pre- and post-training sessions. We conclude that strategic navigation preferences can be influenced by using home-based training in healthy participants. However, using the current approach, only a preference shift from an allocentric to an egocentric navigation strategy could be achieved. The effectiveness of this navigation strategy training should next be assessed in relevant patient populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) refers to the temporary retention and manipulation of information, and its capacity is highly susceptible to training. Yet, the neural mechanisms that allow for increased performance under demanding conditions are not fully understood. We expected that post-training efficiency in WM performance modulates neural processing during high load tasks. We tested this hypothesis, using electroencephalography (EEG) (N = 39), by comparing source space spectral power of healthy adults performing low and high load auditory WM tasks. Prior to the assessment, participants either underwent a modality-specific auditory WM training, or a modality-irrelevant tactile WM training, or were not trained (active control). After a modality-specific training participants showed higher behavioral performance, compared to the control. EEG data analysis revealed general effects of WM load, across all training groups, in the theta-, alpha-, and beta-frequency bands. With increased load theta-band power increased over frontal, and decreased over parietal areas. Centro-parietal alpha-band power and central beta-band power decreased with load. Interestingly, in the high load condition a tendency toward reduced beta-band power in the right medial temporal lobe was observed in the modality-specific WM training group compared to the modality-irrelevant and active control groups. Our finding that WM processing during the high load condition changed after modality-specific WM training, showing reduced beta-band activity in voice-selective regions, possibly indicates a more efficient maintenance of task-relevant stimuli. The general load effects suggest that WM performance at high load demands involves complementary mechanisms, combining a strengthening of task-relevant and a suppression of task-irrelevant processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Early nutritional compromise after preterm birth is shown to affect long-term neurodevelopment, however, there has been a lack of early functional measures of nutritional effects. Recent progress in computational electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has provided means to measure the early maturation of cortical activity. Our study aimed to explore whether computational metrics of early sequential EEG recordings could reflect early nutritional care measured by energy and macronutrient intake in the first week of life. A higher energy or macronutrient intake was assumed to associate with improved development of the cortical activity. We analyzed multichannel EEG recorded at 32 weeks (32.4 ± 0.7) and 36 weeks (36.6 ± 0.9) of postmenstrual age in a cohort of 28 preterm infants born before 32 weeks of postmenstrual age (range: 24.3–32 weeks). We computed several quantitative EEG measures from epochs of quiet sleep (QS): (i) spectral power; (ii) continuity; (iii) interhemispheric synchrony, as well as (iv) the recently developed estimate of maturational age. Parenteral nutritional intake from day 1 to day 7 was monitored and clinical factors collected. Lower calories and carbohydrates were found to correlate with a higher reduction of spectral amplitude in the delta band. Lower protein amount associated with higher discontinuity. Both higher proteins and lipids intake correlated with a more developmental increase in interhemispheric synchrony as well as with better progress in the estimate of EEG maturational age (EMA). Our study shows that early nutritional balance after preterm birth may influence subsequent maturation of brain activity in a way that can be observed with several intuitively reasoned and transparent computational EEG metrics. Such measures could become early functional biomarkers that hold promise for benchmarking in the future development of therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural activity related to language can be modulated within widespread networks following learning or in response to disruption—including the experimental application of noninvasive brain stimulation. However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of such modulation remain insufficiently explored. The present study combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the modulation of activity across the language network following continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) of the left pars opercularis. In 10 healthy subjects (21 ± 2 years old, four females), neuronavigated cTBS was delivered over the left pars opercularis of the frontal operculum (part of the traditional Broca’s area) at 80% of active motor threshold (AMT) stimulation intensity. Real cTBS and sham cTBS were performed in two different visits separated by at least 48 h. Before, immediately, and 10 min after cTBS, 30 single pulses of TMS were delivered to the left pars opercularis at 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT), whereas EEG was simultaneously recorded. We examined the cTBS-induced modulation of phase locking values (PLVs) between the TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded over the pars opercularis and those recorded over its right-hemispheric homolog area, the left supramarginal area, and the left superior temporal area in different EEG frequency bands and different time windows following cTBS. cTBS to the left pars opercularis induced within the gamma band: (1) a significant increase in TEP phase synchronization between the left and right pars opercularis at an early time window (250–350 ms) following cTBS; and (2) significantly increased PLV with the left supramarginal area and the left superior temporal area at a later time window (600–700 ms). In the theta and delta band, cTBS to the left pars opercularis induced significantly increased phase synchronization of TEPs between the left pars opercularis and the posterior left hemispheric language areas at a late time window. In sham condition, there was a significant decrease in TEP phase synchronization of the high beta band between left pars opercularis and left superior temporal area at 200–300 ms. These results contribute to characterize the dynamics of the language network and may have implications in the development of noninvasive stimulation protocols to promote the language rehabilitation in aphasia patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Many popular activities are thought by the general public to improve cognitive function. Such expectations can influence how often people engage in these activities, as well as the scientific evaluation of their putative cognitive benefits, e.g., via placebo effects. Here, we gathered survey data about the public’s perceptions of nine different activities commonly thought to be cognitively stimulating, including “brain-training” games. Information was collected about the degree to which participants thought each activity was beneficial for improving cognitive function and how often they engaged in each activity. The patterns of correlation between ratings reveal details about the perception of cognitive benefits and its relation to engagement. They suggest that participants varied with respect to an overarching perception of the entire set of activities, which were perceived also as divided into three clusters. Frequency of engagement and perceived cognitive benefits were positively correlated across participants for each activity considered individually. But, when the activities were compared, the magnitude of their perceived benefits was not a good predictor of their frequency of engagement (and vice versa). Though small, there were systematic demographic differences. Women were more optimistic than men about cognitive benefits. Individual participants differed in the range of their ratings of benefit across activities, and these ranges were greater for younger than older participants, suggesting that perceptions of benefit are more differentiated among the young. Besides contributing to a better understanding of public expectations of cognitive benefits, the findings of this study are relevant to the critical evaluation of such benefits. Our survey can be viewed as providing an interface between expectations held by the general public and the design of studies examining the efficacy of cognitive training. The type of information it provides could be used in the selection of activities performed by an active control group, so that control activities match the treatment intervention as closely as possible with respect to such expectations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;An experience-driven increase in oligodendrocytes and myelin in the somatosensory cortex (S1) has emerged as a new marker of adult cortical plasticity. That finding contrasts with the view that myelin is a structural brake on plasticity, and that contributes to ending the critical period (CP) in the visual cortex (V1). Despite the evidence that myelin-derived signaling acts to end CP in V1, there is no information about myelin changes during adult plasticity in V1. To address this, we quantified the effect of three manipulations that drive adult plasticity (monocular deprivation (MD), fluoxetine treatment or the combination of MD and fluoxetine) on the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in adult rat V1. In tandem, we validated that environmental enrichment (EE) increased cortical myelin by measuring MBP in adult S1. For comparison with the MBP measurements, three plasticity markers were also quantified, the spine markers drebrin E and drebrin A, and a plasticity maintenance marker Ube3A. First, we confirmed that EE increased MBP in S1. Next, that expression of the plasticity markers was affected in S1 by EE and in V1 by the visual manipulations. Finally, we found that after adult MD, MBP increased in the non-deprived V1 hemisphere, but it decreased in the deprived hemisphere, and those changes were not influenced by fluoxetine. Together, the findings suggest that modulation of myelin expression in adult V1 may reflect the levels of visually driven activity rather than synaptic plasticity caused by adult plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Granule cell dispersion (GCD) is a common pathological feature observed in the hippocampus of patients with Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE). Pathomechanisms underlying GCD remain to be elucidated, but one hypothesis proposes aberrant reactivation of neurodevelopmental migratory pathways, possibly triggered by febrile seizures. This study aims to compare the proteomes of basal and dispersed granule cells in the hippocampus of eight MTLE patients with GCD to identify proteins that may mediate GCD in MTLE. Quantitative proteomics identified 1,882 proteins, of which 29% were found in basal granule cells only, 17% in dispersed only and 54% in both samples. Bioinformatics analyses revealed upregulated proteins in dispersed samples were involved in developmental cellular migratory processes, including cytoskeletal remodeling, axon guidance and signaling by Ras homologous (Rho) family of GTPases (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The expression of two Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1, was subsequently explored in immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies involving eighteen MTLE cases with or without GCD, and three normal post mortem cases. In cases with GCD, most dispersed granule cells in the outer-granular and molecular layers have an elongated soma and bipolar processes, with intense RhoA immunolabeling at opposite poles of the cell soma, while most granule cells in the basal granule cell layer were devoid of RhoA. A higher percentage of cells expressing RhoA was observed in cases with GCD than without GCD (P &amp;lt; 0.004). In GCD cases, the percentage of cells expressing RhoA was significantly higher in the inner molecular layer than the granule cell layer (P &amp;lt; 0.026), supporting proteomic findings. In situ hybridization studies using probes against RHOA and RAC1 mRNAs revealed fine peri- and nuclear puncta in granule cells of all cases. The density of cells expressing RHOA mRNAs was significantly higher in the inner molecular layer of cases with GCD than without GCD (P = 0.05). In summary, our study has found limited evidence for ongoing adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of patients with MTLE, but evidence of differential dysmaturation between dispersed and basal granule cells has been demonstrated, and elevated expression of Rho GTPases in dispersed granule cells may contribute to the pathomechanisms underpinning GCD in MTLE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia present in older adults; its etiology involves genetic and environmental factors. In recent years, epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between AD and chronic epilepsy since a considerable number of patients with AD may present seizures later on. Although the pathophysiology of seizures in AD is not completely understood, it could represent the result of several molecular mechanisms linked to amyloid beta-peptide (Aβ) accumulation and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which may induce an imbalance in the release and recapture of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, structural alterations of the neuronal cytoskeleton, synaptic loss, and neuroinflammation. These changes could favor the recurrent development of hypersynchronous discharges and epileptogenesis, which, in a chronic state, favor the neurodegenerative process and influence the cognitive decline observed in AD. Supporting this correlation, histopathological studies in the brain tissue of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients have revealed the presence of Aβ deposits and the accumulation of tau protein in the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), accompanied by an increase of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) activity that may lead to an imminent alteration in posttranslational modifications of some microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), mainly tau. The present review is focused on understanding the pathological aspects of GSK3β and tau in the development of TLE and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Several lines of evidence point to alteration in brain metabolic homeostasis in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), yet the metabolic mechanism in different brain regions underlying PD and LID remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to uncover the metabolic pathways across anatomical regions in the brain of PD and LID. Using an NMR-based metabolomic approach, we generated the metabolomics profiling data from six different brain regions of PD rats and following the onset of LIDs. The diversity of metabolite patterns across the brain and its relation to PD and LID were further investigated through principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate general linear model. Compared with control rats, dopamine loss in PD rats produced a marked and persistent metabolic disturbance in neurotransmitter metabolism and energy pathway, resulting in a metabolic imbalance among different brain regions. In LID rats, levodopa replacement did not restore the midbrain-striatum metabolic crosstalk and metabolic disturbance throughout the brain was involved in levodopa related involuntary movements. Most notably, the midbrain and right cortex were identified as the primary regions of metabolic abnormalities in PD and LID rats. Neurochemical differences in metabolic phenotypes were mainly defined by various neurotransmitters including glutamate, glutamine and aspartate. Accordingly, we found that the PD and LID rats exhibited lower levels of synaptophysin (SYP), a marker for synaptic plasticity, compared with control rats. These findings provide key insights into the metabolic mechanism underlying PD and LID by defining brain-region specific metabolic phenotype, with implications for developing targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One of the pivotal challenges of aging is to maintain independence in the activities of daily life. In order to adapt to changes in the environment, it is crucial to continuously process and accurately combine simultaneous input from different sensory systems, i.e., crossmodal or multisensory integration. With aging, performance decreases in multiple domains, affecting bottom-up sensory processing as well as top-down control. However, whether this decline leads to impairments in crossmodal interactions remains an unresolved question. While some researchers propose that crossmodal interactions degrade with age, others suggest that they are conserved or even gain compensatory importance. To address this question, we compared the behavioral performance of older and young participants in a well-established crossmodal matching task, requiring the evaluation of congruency in simultaneously presented visual and tactile patterns. Older participants performed significantly worse than young controls in the crossmodal task when being stimulated at their individual unimodal visual and tactile perception thresholds. Performance increased with adjustment of stimulus intensities. This improvement was driven by better detection of congruent stimulus pairs, while the detection of incongruent pairs was not significantly enhanced. These results indicate that age-related impairments lead to poor performance in complex crossmodal scenarios and demanding cognitive tasks. Crossmodal congruency effects attenuate the difficulties of older adults in visuotactile pattern matching and might be an important factor to drive the benefits of older adults demonstrated in various crossmodal integration scenarios. Congruency effects might, therefore, be used to develop strategies for cognitive training and neurological rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder defined by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra in the brain. It is associated with cytosolic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. The major component of Lewy bodies is aggregated alpha-synuclein. The molecular mechanism of alpha-synuclein aggregation is not known. Our conceptual model is that alpha-synuclein aggregates due to a dysregulation of its interactions with other protein partners that are required for its biogenesis. In this mini review article, we identified alpha-synuclein interactions using both current literature and predictive pathway analysis. Alterations of these interactions may be crucial elements for the molecular mechanism of the protein aggregation and related pathology in the disease. Identification of alpha-synuclein interactions provides valuable tools to understand PD pathology and find new pharmacological targets for disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with changes in brain functional patterns as well as cognition. The present research sought to investigate longitudinal changes in whole brain functional connectivity strength (FCS) and cognitive performance scores in very old cognitively unimpaired individuals. We studied 34 cognitively normal elderly individuals at both baseline and 4-year follow-up (baseline age = 78 ± 3.14 years) with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (r-fMRI), structural MRI scans, and neuropsychological assessments conducted. Voxel-based whole brain FCS was calculated and we found that bilateral superior parietal and medial frontal regions showed decreased FCS, while the supplementary motor area (SMA) and insula showed increased FCS with age, along with a decrease in bilateral prefrontal cortical thickness. The changes of FCS in left precuneus were associated with an aging-related decline in global cognition. Taken together, our results suggest changes in FCS with aging with the precuneus as a hub and this may underlie changes in global cognition that accompany aging. These findings help better understand the normal aging mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Associative memory is one of the first cognitive functions negatively affected by healthy and pathological aging processes. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are easily administrable tools to support memory. However, the optimal stimulation parameters inducing a reliable positive effect on older adult’s memory performance remain mostly unclear. In our randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, 28 healthy older adults (16 females; 71.18 + 6.42 years of age) received anodal transcranial direct (tDCS), alternating current in the theta range (tACS), and sham stimulation over the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) each once during encoding. We tested associative memory performance with cued recall and recognition tasks after a retention period and again on the following day. Overall, neither tDCS nor tACS showed effects on associative memory performance. Further analysis revealed a significant difference for performance on the cued recall task under tACS compared to sham when accounting for age. Our results suggest that tACS might be more effective to improve associative memory performance than tDCS in higher aged samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Recently, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been described as the earliest at-risk state of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and drawn attention of investigators. Studies suggested that SCD-community individuals may constitute a more vulnerable population than SCD-clinic patients, therefore, to investigate the early changes of the brain may provide guidance for treatment of the disease. We sought to investigate the changes of structure and functional connectivity alternation of the hippocampus in individuals with SCD recruited from the community using structural and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five SCD patients and 32 healthy controls were recruited. Resting-state fMRI data and high-resolution T1-weighted images were collected. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry was used to examine the brain structural changes. We also used the hippocampal tail and the whole hippocampus as seeds to investigate functional connectivity alternation in SCD.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Individuals with SCD showed significant gray matter volume decreases in the bilateral hippocampal tails and enlargement of the bilateral paracentral lobules. We also found that individuals with SCD showed decreased hippocampal tail resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) with the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and decreased whole hippocampus rsFC with the bilateral mPFC and TPJ. These brain region and FC showing significant differences also showed significantly correlation with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Individuals with SCD recruited from the community is associated with structural and functional changes of the hippocampus, and these changes may serve as potential biomarkers of SCD.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;The Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was registered in http://www.chictr.org.cn.

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical activity during jaw movement has been analyzed using various non-invasive brain imaging methods, but the contribution of orofacial sensory input to voluntary jaw movements remains unclear. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe brain activities during a simple teeth tapping task in adult dentulous (AD), older dentulous (OD), and older edentulous subjects who wore dentures (OEd) or did not wear dentures (OE) to analyze their functional network connections. (1) To assess the effect of age on natural activation patterns during teeth tapping, a comparison of groups with natural dentition—AD and OD—was undertaken. A general linear model analysis indicated that the major activated site in the AD group was the primary sensory cortex (SI) and motor cortex (MI) (p &amp;lt; 0.05, family wise error corrected). In the OD group, teeth tapping induced brain activity at various foci (p &amp;lt; 0.05, family wise error corrected), including the SI, MI, insula cortex, supplementary motor cortex (SMC)/premotor cortex (PMA), cerebellum, thalamus, and basal ganglia in each group. (2) Group comparisons between the OD and OEd subjects showed decreased activity in the SI, MI, Brodmann’s area 6 (BA6), thalamus (ventral posteromedial nucleus, VPM), basal ganglia, and insular cortex (p ¡ 0.005, uncorrected). This suggested that the decreased S1/M1 activity in the OEd group was related to missing teeth, which led to reduced periodontal afferents. (3) A conjunction analysis in the OD and OEd/OE groups revealed that commonly activated areas were the MI, SI, cerebellum, BA6, thalamus (VPM), and basal ganglia (putamen; p &amp;lt; 0.05, FWE corrected). These areas have been associated with voluntary movements. (4) Psychophysiological interaction analysis (OEd vs OE) showed that subcortical and cortical structures, such as the MI, SI, DLPFC, SMC/PMA, insula cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, likely function as hubs and form an integrated network that participates in the control of teeth tapping. These results suggest that oral sensory inputs are involved in the control of teeth tapping through feedforward control of intended movements, as well as feedback control of ongoing movements.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Estimation of pathogenic life-history values, for instance the duration a pathogen is retained in an insect vector (i.e., retention period) is of particular importance for understanding plant disease epidemiology. How can we extract values for these epidemiological parameters from conventional small-scale laboratory experiments in which transmission success is measured in relation to durations of vector access to host plants? We provide a solution to this problem by deriving formulae for the empirical curves that these experiments produce, called access period response curves (i.e., transmission success vs access period). We do this by writing simple equations for the fundamental life-cycle components of insect vectors in the laboratory. We then infer values of epidemiological parameters by matching the theoretical and empirical gradients of access period response curves. Using the example of &lt;i&gt;Cassava brown streak virus&lt;/i&gt; (CBSV), which has emerged in sub-Saharan Africa and now threatens regional food security, we illustrate the method of matching gradients. We show how applying the method to published data produces a new understanding of CBSV through the inference of retention period, acquisition period and inoculation period parameters. We found that CBSV is retained for a far shorter duration in its insect vector (&lt;i&gt;Bemisia tabaci&lt;/i&gt; whitefly) than had previously been assumed. Our results shed light on a number of critical factors that may be responsible for the transition of CBSV from sub- to super-threshold &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in sub-Saharan Africa. The method is applicable to plant pathogens in general, to supply epidemiological parameter estimates that are crucial for practical management of epidemics and prediction of pandemic risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mW3kcWMn1Tg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Autism is still diagnosed on the basis of subjective assessments of elusive notions such as interpersonal contact and social reciprocity. We propose to decompose reciprocal social interactions in their basic computational constituents. Specifically, we test the assumption that autistic individuals disregard information regarding the stakes of social interactions when adapting to others. We compared 24 adult autistic participants to 24 neurotypical (NT) participants engaging in a repeated dyadic competitive game against artificial agents with calibrated reciprocal adaptation capabilities. Critically, participants were framed to believe either that they were competing against somebody else or that they were playing a gambling game. Only the NT participants did alter their adaptation strategy when they held information regarding others' competitive incentives, in which case they outperformed the AS group. Computational analyses of trial-by-trial choice sequences show that the behavioural repertoire of autistic people exhibits subnormal flexibility and mentalizing sophistication, especially when information regarding opponents’ incentives was available. These two computational phenotypes yield 79% diagnosis classification accuracy and explain 62% of the severity of social symptoms in autistic participants. Such computational decomposition of the autistic social phenotype may prove relevant for drawing novel diagnostic boundaries and guiding individualized clinical interventions in autism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/maqMjNM0JuM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Networks based on coordinated spike coding can encode information with high efficiency in the spike trains of individual neurons. These networks exhibit single-neuron variability and tuning curves as typically observed in cortex, but paradoxically coincide with a precise, non-redundant spike-based population code. However, it has remained unclear whether the specific synaptic connectivities required in these networks can be learnt with local learning rules. Here, we show how to learn the required architecture. Use coding efficiency as an objective, we derive spike-timing-dependent learning rules for a recurrent neural network, and we provide exact solutions for the networks’ convergence to an optimal state. As a result, we deduce an entire network from its input distribution and a firing cost. After learning, basic biophysical quantities such as voltages, firing thresholds, excitation, inhibition, or spikes acquire precise functional interpretations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JZqRdXgZFOI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The circadian clock orchestrates biological processes so that they occur at specific times of the day, thereby facilitating adaptation to diurnal and seasonal environmental changes. In plants, mathematical modelling has been comprehensively integrated with experimental studies to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the complex genetic regulatory network comprising the clock. However, with an increasing number of circadian genes being discovered, there is a pressing need for methods facilitating the expansion of computational models to incorporate these newly-discovered components. Conventionally, plant clock models have comprised differential equation systems based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, the difficulties associated with modifying interactions using this approach—and the concomitant problem of robustly identifying regulation types—has contributed to a complexity bottleneck, with quantitative fits to experimental data rapidly becoming computationally intractable for models possessing more than ≈50 parameters. Here, we address these issues by constructing the first plant clock models based on the S-System formalism originally developed by Savageau for analysing biochemical networks. We show that despite its relative simplicity, this approach yields clock models with comparable accuracy to the conventional Michaelis-Menten formalism. The S-System formulation also confers several key advantages in terms of model construction and expansion. In particular, it simplifies the inclusion of new interactions, whilst also facilitating the modification of regulation types, thereby making it well-suited to network inference. Furthermore, S-System models mitigate the issue of parameter identifiability. Finally, by applying linear systems theory to the models considered, we provide some justification for the increased use of aggregated protein equations in recent plant clock modelling, replacing the separate cytoplasmic/nuclear protein compartments that were characteristic of the earlier models. We conclude that as well as providing a simplified framework for model development, the S-System formalism also possesses significant potential as a robust modelling method for designing synthetic gene circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IwQR4sEYASY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

With the improvement of -omics and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, along with the lowered cost of generating these types of data, the analysis of high-throughput biological data has become standard both for forming and testing biomedical hypotheses. Our knowledge of how to normalize datasets to remove latent undesirable variances has grown extensively, making for standardized data that are easily compared between studies. Here we present the CAncer bioMarker Prediction Pipeline (CAMPP), an open-source R-based wrapper (https://github.com/ELELAB/CAncer-bioMarker-Prediction-Pipeline -CAMPP) intended to aid bioinformatic software-users with data analyses. CAMPP is called from a terminal command line and is supported by a user-friendly manual. The pipeline may be run on a local computer and requires little or no knowledge of programming. To avoid issues relating to R-package updates, a renv .lock file is provided to ensure R-package stability. Data-management includes missing value imputation, data normalization, and distributional checks. CAMPP performs (I) k-means clustering, (II) differential expression/abundance analysis, (III) elastic-net regression, (IV) correlation and co-expression network analyses, (V) survival analysis, and (VI) protein-protein/miRNA-gene interaction networks. The pipeline returns tabular files and graphical representations of the results. We hope that CAMPP will assist in streamlining bioinformatic analysis of quantitative biological data, whilst ensuring an appropriate bio-statistical framework.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4tX46Deg1pQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The high-resolution and mass accuracy of Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT-MS) has made it an increasingly popular technique for discerning the composition of soil, plant and aquatic samples containing complex mixtures of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, lignins, hydrocarbons, phytochemicals and other compounds. Thus, there is a growing demand for informatics tools to analyze FT-MS data that will aid investigators seeking to understand the availability of carbon compounds to biotic and abiotic oxidation and to compare fundamental chemical properties of complex samples across groups. We present &lt;i&gt;ftmsRanalysis&lt;/i&gt;, an R package which provides an extensive collection of data formatting and processing, filtering, visualization, and sample and group comparison functionalities. The package provides a suite of plotting methods and enables expedient, flexible and interactive visualization of complex datasets through functions which link to a powerful and interactive visualization user interface, Trelliscope. Example analysis using FT-MS data from a soil microbiology study demonstrates the core functionality of the package and highlights the capabilities for producing interactive visualizations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/juwxkf7JGCY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Coordinated motion and collective decision-making in fish schools result from complex interactions by which individuals integrate information about the behavior of their neighbors. However, little is known about how individuals integrate this information to take decisions and control their motion. Here, we combine experiments with computational and robotic approaches to investigate the impact of different strategies for a fish to interact with its neighbors on collective swimming in groups of rummy-nose tetra (&lt;i&gt;Hemigrammus rhodostomus&lt;/i&gt;). By means of a data-based agent model describing the interactions between pairs of &lt;i&gt;H. rhodostomus&lt;/i&gt; (Calovi &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;., 2018), we show that the simple addition of the pairwise interactions with two neighbors quantitatively reproduces the collective behavior observed in groups of five fish. Increasing the number of interacting neighbors does not significantly improve the simulation results. Remarkably, and even without confinement, we find that groups remain cohesive and polarized when each agent interacts with only one of its neighbors: the one that has the strongest contribution to the heading variation of the focal agent, dubbed as the “most influential neighbor”. However, group cohesion is lost when each agent only interacts with its nearest neighbor. We then investigate by means of a robotic platform the collective motion in groups of five robots. Our platform combines the implementation of the fish behavioral model and a control system to deal with real-world physical constraints. A better agreement with experimental results for fish is obtained for groups of robots only interacting with their most influential neighbor, than for robots interacting with one or even two nearest neighbors. Finally, we discuss the biological and cognitive relevance of the notion of “most influential neighbors”. Overall, our results suggest that fish have to acquire only a minimal amount of information about their environment to coordinate their movements when swimming in groups.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EH6md4iZAiw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Complex, highly-computational, individual-based models are abundant in epidemiology. For epidemics such as macro-parasitic diseases, detailed modelling of human behaviour and pathogen life-cycle are required in order to produce accurate results. This can often lead to models that are computationally-expensive to analyse and perform model fitting, and often require many simulation runs in order to build up sufficient statistics. Emulation can provide a more computationally-efficient output of the individual-based model, by approximating it using a statistical model. Previous work has used Gaussian processes (GPs) in order to achieve this, but these can not deal with multi-modal, heavy-tailed, or discrete distributions. Here, we introduce the concept of a mixture density network (MDN) in its application in the emulation of epidemiological models. MDNs incorporate both a mixture model and a neural network to provide a flexible tool for emulating a variety of models and outputs. We develop an MDN emulation methodology and demonstrate its use on a number of simple models incorporating both normal, gamma and beta distribution outputs. We then explore its use on the stochastic SIR model to predict the final size distribution and infection dynamics. MDNs have the potential to faithfully reproduce multiple outputs of an individual-based model and allow for rapid analysis from a range of users. As such, an open-access library of the method has been released alongside this manuscript.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fHA23vtdYcU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Interruptions (interfering stimuli to respond to) and distractions (interfering stimuli to be ignored) have been shown to negatively impact performance, particularly in tasks requiring working memory (WM). This study investigated how these two types of external interference affect task performance and attentional and WM processes as indexed by specific event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG. A Continuous Number Task (CNT) was applied, in which participants had to either decide whether the current number (condition without WM load) or the sum of the current and the preceding number (condition with WM load) was odd or even while responding to interlaced single letters (interruptions) or ignoring them (distractions). Contrary to previous research, we did not find external interference to affect performance under WM load. Unexpectedly, our results rather show that performance was significantly improved in trials after distractions compared to before. This effect was reflected particularly in a significantly increased P3 mean amplitude indicating enhanced attentional reallocation to task-relevant stimuli. Interestingly, this P3 effect appeared independent of WM load and also following interruptions. This underpins the account of P3 amplitudes being modulated by the interval between two task-relevant stimuli rather than by overall task-difficulty. Moreover, a pronounced fronto-central and posterior slow wave following interference suggest more control resources to maintain task-relevant stimuli in WM independent of the preceding interfering stimulus. Our results thus suggest that the type and foreknowledge of external interference may modulate the amount of interference and may also facilitate resource preparation under WM load.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 While many signaling pathways modulate neuronal differentiation and migration, Kullmann et al. show immature regions of brain are hypoxic, and neuronal maturation proceeds only when Hif1 inhibition of neuronal polarity and germinal zone exit recedes. Hif1 antagonism of neuronal polarity controls migration initiation by altering adhesion to germinal niche extracellular matrix.</content>

Rational drug design for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is limited by the small number of available atomic resolution structures. We assessed the use of homology modeling to predict the structures of two therapeutically relevant GPCRs and strategies to improve the performance of virtual screening against modeled binding sites. Homology models of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dopamine (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) and serotonin 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) were generated based on crystal structures of 16 different GPCRs. Comparison of the homology models to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R crystal structures showed that accurate predictions could be obtained, but not necessarily using the most closely related template. Assessment of virtual screening performance was based on molecular docking of ligands and decoys. The results demonstrated that several templates and multiple models based on each of these must be evaluated to identify the optimal binding site structure. Models based on aminergic GPCRs displayed ligand enrichment and there was a trend toward improved virtual screening performance with increasing binding site accuracy. The best models even displayed ligand enrichment better than that of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R crystal structures. Methods to consider binding site plasticity were explored to further improve predictions. Molecular docking to ensembles of structures did not outperform the best individual binding site models, but could increase the diversity of hits from virtual screens and be advantageous for GPCR targets with few known ligands. Molecular dynamics refinement resulted in moderate improvements of structural accuracy and the virtual screening performance of snapshots was either comparable to or worse than that of the raw homology models. These results provide guidelines for successful application of structure-based ligand discovery using GPCR homology models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3s2xA9w3VrQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The overall malaria burden in the Americas has decreased dramatically over the past two decades, but residual transmission pockets persist across the Amazon Basin, where &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; is the predominant infecting species. Current elimination efforts require a better quantitative understanding of malaria transmission dynamics for planning, monitoring, and evaluating interventions at the community level. This can be achieved with mathematical models that properly account for risk heterogeneity in communities approaching elimination, where few individuals disproportionately contribute to overall malaria prevalence, morbidity, and onwards transmission. Here we analyse demographic information combined with routinely collected malaria morbidity data from the town of Mâncio Lima, the main urban transmission hotspot of Brazil. We estimate the proportion of high-risk subjects in the host population by fitting compartmental susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) transmission models simultaneously to age-stratified vivax malaria incidence densities and the frequency distribution of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; malaria attacks experienced by each individual over 12 months. Simulations with the best-fitting SIS model indicate that 20% of the hosts contribute 86% of the overall vivax malaria burden. Despite the low overall force of infection typically found in the Amazon, about one order of magnitude lower than that in rural Africa, high-risk individuals gradually develop clinical immunity following repeated infections and eventually constitute a substantial infectious reservoir comprised of asymptomatic parasite carriers that is overlooked by routine surveillance but likely fuels onwards malaria transmission. High-risk individuals therefore represent a priority target for more intensive and effective interventions that may not be readily delivered to the entire community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t9McFNjeAq0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Coexistence of bacteriophages, or phages, and their host bacteria plays an important role in maintaining the microbial communities. In natural environments with limited nutrients, motile bacteria can actively migrate towards locations of richer resources. Although phages are not motile themselves, they can infect motile bacterial hosts and spread in space via the hosts. Therefore, in a migrating microbial community coexistence of bacteria and phages implies their co-propagation in space. Here, we combine an experimental approach and mathematical modeling to explore how phages and their motile host bacteria coexist and co-propagate. When lytic phages encountered motile host bacteria in our experimental set up, a sector-shaped lysis zone formed. Our mathematical model indicates that local nutrient depletion and the resulting inhibition of proliferation and motility of bacteria and phages are the key to formation of the observed lysis pattern. The model further reveals the straight radial boundaries in the lysis pattern as a telltale sign for coexistence and co-propagation of bacteria and phages. Emergence of such a pattern, albeit insensitive to extrinsic factors, requires a balance between intrinsic biological properties of phages and bacteria, which likely results from coevolution of phages and bacteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Mt22RpZ9ec0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) plays a central role in excitatory synapse development and synaptic plasticity. Phosphorylation of the N-terminus of PSD-95 at threonine 19 (T19) and serine 25 (S25) decreases PSD-95 stability at synapses; however, a molecular mechanism linking PSD-95 phosphorylation to altered synaptic stability is lacking. Here, we show that phosphorylation of T19/S25 recruits the phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase (Pin1) and reduces the palmitoylation of Cysteine 3 and Cysteine 5 in PSD-95. This reduction in PSD-95 palmitoylation accounts for the observed loss in the number of dendritic PSD-95 clusters, the increased AMPAR mobility, and the decreased number of functional excitatory synapses. We find the effects of Pin1 overexpression were all rescued by manipulations aimed at increasing the levels of PSD-95 palmitoylation. Therefore, Pin1 is a key signaling molecule that regulates the stability of excitatory synapses and may participate in the destabilization of PSD-95 following the induction of synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: A neurophysiologic biomarker for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly desirable and can improve diagnosis, monitoring, and assessment of therapeutic response among children with ASD. We investigated the utility of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) applied to the motor cortex (M1) as a biomarker for children and adolescents with high-functioning (HF) ASD compared to their age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) controls. We also compared the developmental trajectory of long-term depression- (LTD-) like plasticity in the two groups. Finally, we explored the influence of a common brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism on cTBS aftereffects in a subset of the ASD group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-nine children and adolescents (age range 10–16) in ASD (n = 11) and TD (n = 18) groups underwent M1 cTBS. Changes in MEP amplitude at 5–60 min post-cTBS and their cumulative measures in each group were calculated. We also assessed the relationship between age and maximum cTBS-induced MEP suppression (ΔMEP&lt;sub&gt;Max&lt;/sub&gt;) in each group. Finally, we compared cTBS aftereffects in BDNF Val/Val (n = 4) and Val/Met (n = 4) ASD participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Cumulative cTBS aftereffects were significantly more facilitatory in the ASD group than in the TD group (P&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt;’s &amp;lt; 0.03). ΔMEP&lt;sub&gt;Max&lt;/sub&gt; was negatively correlated with age in the ASD group (r = −0.67, P = 0.025), but not in the TD group (r = −0.12, P = 0.65). Cumulative cTBS aftereffects were not significantly different between the two BDNF subgroups (P-values &amp;gt; 0.18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The results support the utility of cTBS measures of cortical plasticity as a biomarker for children and adolescents with HF-ASD and an aberrant developmental trajectory of LTD-like plasticity in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Potential pathogenic factors, other than well-known APP, APOE4, and PSEN, can be further identified from transcriptomics studies of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are specific for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but findings are often inconsistent or even contradictory. Evidence corroboration by combining meta-analysis and bioinformatics methods may help to resolve existing inconsistencies and contradictions. This study aimed to demonstrate a systematic workflow for evidence synthesis of transcriptomic studies using both meta-analysis and bioinformatics methods to identify potential pathogenic factors. Transcriptomic data were assessed from GEO and ArrayExpress after systematic searches. The DEGs and their dysregulation states from both DNA microarray and RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed and corroborated by meta-analysis. Statistically significant DEGs were used for enrichment analysis based on KEGG and protein–protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis based on STRING. AD-specific modules were further determined by the DIAMOnD algorithm, which identifies significant connectivity patterns between specific disease-associated proteins and non-specific proteins. Within AD-specific modules, the nodes of highest degrees (&amp;gt;95th percentile) were considered as potential pathogenic factors. After systematic searches of 225 datasets, extensive meta-analyses among 25 datasets (21 DNA microarray datasets and 4 RNA sequencing datasets) identified 9,298 DEGs. The dysregulated genes and pathways in AD were associated with impaired amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance. From the AD-specific module, Fyn, and EGFR were the most statistically significant and biologically relevant. This meta-analytical study suggested that the reduced Aβ clearance in AD pathogenesis was associated with the genes encoding Fyn and EGFR, which were key receptors in Aβ downstream signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We propose that correlations among neurons are generically strong enough to organize neural activity patterns into a discrete set of clusters, which can each be viewed as a population codeword. Our reasoning starts with the analysis of retinal ganglion cell data using maximum entropy models, showing that the population is robustly in a frustrated, marginally sub-critical, or glassy, state. This leads to an argument that neural populations in many other brain areas might share this structure. Next, we use latent variable models to show that this glassy state possesses well-defined clusters of neural activity. Clusters have three appealing properties: (i) clusters exhibit error correction, i.e., they are reproducibly elicited by the same stimulus despite variability at the level of constituent neurons; (ii) clusters encode qualitatively different visual features than their constituent neurons; and (iii) clusters can be learned by downstream neural circuits in an unsupervised fashion. We hypothesize that these properties give rise to a “learnable” neural code which the cortical hierarchy uses to extract increasingly complex features without supervision or reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study describes the cytoarchitecture of the torus longitudinalis (TL) in adult zebrafish by using light and electron microscopy, as well as its main connections as revealed by DiI tract tracing. In addition, by using high resolution confocal imaging followed by digital tracing, we describe the morphology of tectal pyramidal cells (type I cells) that are GFP positive in the transgenic line Tg(1.4dlx5a-dlx6a:GFP)&lt;sup&gt;ot1&lt;/sup&gt;. The TL consists of numerous small and medium-sized neurons located in a longitudinal eminence attached to the medial optic tectum. A small proportion of these neurons are GABAergic. The neuropil shows three types of synaptic terminals and numerous dendrites. Tracing experiments revealed that the main efference of the TL is formed of parallel-like fibers that course within the marginal layer of the optic tectum. A toral projection to the thalamic nucleus rostrolateralis is also observed. Afferents to the TL come from visual and cerebellum-related nuclei in the pretectum, namely the central, intercalated and the paracommissural pretectal nuclei, as well as from the subvalvular nucleus in the isthmus. Additional afferents to the TL may come from the cerebellum but their origins could not be confirmed. The tectal afferent projection to the TL originates from cells similar to the type X cells described in other cyprinids. Tectal pyramidal neurons show round or piriform cell bodies, with spiny apical dendritic trees in the marginal layer. This anatomical study provides a basis for future functional and developmental studies focused on this cerebellum-like circuit in zebrafish.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a highly conserved degradative process that conveys dysfunctional proteins, lipids, and organelles to lysosomes for degradation. The post-mitotic nature, complex and highly polarized morphology, and high degree of specialization of neurons make an efficient autophagy essential for their homeostasis and survival. Dysfunctional autophagy occurs in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and autophagy at synaptic sites seems to play a crucial role in neurodegeneration. Moreover, a role of autophagy is emerging for neural development, synaptogenesis, and the establishment of a correct connectivity. Thus, it is not surprising that defective autophagy has been demonstrated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, often associated with early-onset epilepsy. Here, we discuss the multiple roles of autophagy in neurons and the recent experimental evidence linking neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy to genes coding for autophagic/lysosomal system-related proteins and envisage possible pathophysiological mechanisms ranging from synaptic dysfunction to neuronal death.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Little is known about the underlying mechanisms of the similarities in the core features of postoperative delirium (POD) and α-synuclein (α-syn)-related cognitive disorders. We herein investigated associations between fluctuated levels of exosomal α-syn in the plasma and POD presentation in geriatric hip fracture patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We conducted an observational, prospective, and 1:1 matched (on age older than 65, hip fracture diagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologist’ (ASA) physical status, duration of surgery, and intraoperative bleeding) case-control study: POD cases and non-POD controls were selected from the overall cohort by using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Delirium severity was measured by the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Plasma exosome levels of α-syn were examined preoperatively and at the time that POD was diagnosed, by using an established immunocapture technology based on a putative brain-cell-specific marker. Circulating concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were also determined. The relationship between α-syn levels and POD risk, as well as the association between α-syn and MDAS scores and plasma cytokines, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: POD incidence was 8.4% (17/202). Postoperative α-syn were either elevated or lowered. As primary outcome variables, the change of α-syn in POD patients was significantly higher than non-POD ones (21.0 ± 29.3 pg.ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; vs.1.9 ± 20.0, P = 0.047). The α-syn alteration was positively correlated to MDAS (r = 0.436, P = 0.010) and the change of IL-6 (r = 0.383, P = 0.025).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Exosome α-syn release in plasma may be associated with the POD development which might be due to systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier ChiCTR-IPR-17012301.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior Presentation: The abstract of this work has been selected for presentation in the 2019 ANESTHESIOLOGY Journal Symposium “What’s New with the old,” and it has been present in the ASA 2019 annual meeting October 21st, 2019 in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: Till now, the effect of serum lipid levels on cognitive function is still controversial. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the most critical genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment. Additionally, APOE ε4 allele has a major impact on lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the APOE genotype-dependent relationship between peripheral serum lipid levels and cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 1,273 subjects aged 40–86 years participated in this cross-sectional study. Serum lipid levels and the APOE genotype were detected. Mini-Mental State Examination was used to diagnose the cognitive impairment or not. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the relationships between APOE genotype, serum lipid levels, and cognition function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After controlling for all possible covariates, a significant interaction between low serum high-density lipoprotein and the APOE ε4 allele on cognitive impairment (Wald’s χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.269, df = 1, OR = 20.094, p = 0.039) was found in the total participants. In APOE ε4 carriers, low serum high-density lipoprotein was positively associated with cognitive impairment (Wald’s χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8.200, df = 1, OR = 60.335, p = 0.004) and serum high-density lipoprotein levels were positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination score (r = 0.217, df = 176, p = 0.004). There was no significant correlation between serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides (TG) levels, and cognitive impairment in either the total participants or APOE ε4 carriers/non-carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: APOE ε4 carriers, but not non-carriers, with lower serum high-density lipoprotein had a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment and a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score. These results suggest that the APOE ε4 allele may affect the relationship between serum lipid levels and cognitive impairment. However, the specific mechanism needs to be further elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) may simplify control of limb movements by activating certain combinations of muscles together, i.e., muscle synergies. Little is known, however, about the spinal cord interneurons that activate muscle synergies by exciting sets of motoneurons for different muscles. The turtle spinal cord, even without brain inputs and movement-related sensory feedback, can generate the patterns of motoneuron activity underlying forward swimming, three forms of scratching, and limb withdrawal. Spinal interneurons activated during scratching are typically activated during all three forms of scratching, to different degrees, even though each form of scratching has its own knee-hip synergy. Such spinal interneurons are also typically activated rhythmically during scratching motor patterns, with hip-related timing. We proposed a hypothesis that such interneurons that are most active during rostral scratch stimulation project their axons to both knee-extensor and hip-flexor motoneurons, thus generating the rostral scratch knee-hip synergy, while those interneurons most active during pocket scratch stimulation project their axons to both knee-extensor and hip-extensor motoneurons, thus generating the pocket scratch knee-hip synergy. The activity of the entire population would then generate the appropriate synergy, depending on the location of sensory stimulation. Mathematical modeling has demonstrated that this hypothesis is feasible. Here, we provide one test of this hypothesis by injecting two fluorescent retrograde tracers into the regions of knee-extensor motoneurons (more rostrally) and hip-extensor motoneurons (more caudally). We found that there were double-labeled interneurons, which projected their axons to both locations. The dual-projecting interneurons were widely distributed rostrocaudally, dorsoventrally, and mediolaterally within the hindlimb enlargement and pre-enlargement spinal segments examined. The existence of such dual-projecting interneurons is consistent with the hypothesis that they contribute to generating the knee-hip synergy for pocket scratching. The dual-projecting interneurons, however, were only about 1% of the total interneurons projecting to each location, which suggests that they might be one of several contributors to the appropriate knee-hip synergy. Indirect projections to both motor pools and/or knee extensor-dedicated interneurons might also contribute. There is evidence for dual-projecting spinal interneurons in frogs and mice as well, suggesting that they may contribute to limb motor control in a variety of vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether plasma transferrin levels are associated with longitudinal changes in cognitive performance in older individuals with normal cognition (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: At baseline, there were a total of 358 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, including 58 older individuals with CN, 198 older individuals with MCI, and 102 patients with AD. Linear mixed models were utilized to examine the associations of plasma transferrin levels with changes in cognitive performance over time after adjustment of several potential covariates. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were used to examine the global cognition of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: First, no significant differences in the plasma transferrin levels were observed across three diagnostic groups. Second, in the cross-sectional analyses, the baseline plasma transferrin levels were negatively associated with the MMSE scores in the CN group, but not in the MCI or the AD group. Third, in the longitudinal analyses, we found that a higher plasma transferrin was associated with a steeper cognitive decline in the MCI and AD groups, but not in the CN group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Higher plasma transferrin levels were associated with a steeper cognitive decline in participants with MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Astrocyte (As) bidirectional dialog with neurons plays a fundamental role in major homeostatic brain functions, particularly providing metabolic support and antioxidant self-defense against reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) via the activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of oxidative stress. Disruption of As–neuron crosstalk is chiefly involved in neuronal degeneration observed in Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most common movement disorder characterized by the selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) cell bodies of the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (SNpc). Ventral midbrain (VM)-As are recognized to exert an important role in DAergic neuroprotection via the expression of a variety of factors, including wingless-related MMTV integration site 1 (Wnt1), a principal player in DAergic neurogenesis. However, whether As, by themselves, might fulfill the role of chief players in DAergic neurorestoration of aged PD mice is presently unresolved. Here, we used primary postnatal mouse VM-As as a graft source for unilateral transplantation above the SN of aged 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice after the onset of motor symptoms. Spatio-temporal analyses documented that the engrafted cells promoted: (i) a time-dependent nigrostriatal rescue along with increased high-affinity synaptosomal DA uptake and counteraction of motor deficit, as compared to mock-grafted counterparts; and (ii) a restoration of the impaired microenvironment via upregulation of As antioxidant self-defense through the activation of Nrf2/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suggesting that grafting As has the potential to switch the SN neurorescue-unfriendly environment to a beneficial antioxidant/anti-inflammatory prosurvival milieu. These findings highlight As-derived factors/mechanisms as the crucial key for successful therapeutic outcomes in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The exact cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in modern societies, is still unknown. Many scientists point out that PD is caused by a complex interaction between different factors. Although the main risk factor is age, there are other influences, genetic and environmental, that individually or in combination may trigger neurodegenerative changes leading to PD. Nowadays, research remains focused on better understanding which environmental factors are related to the risk of developing PD and why. In line with the knowledge on evidence on exposures that prevent/delay PD onset or that impact on disease progression, the aims of this review were: (i) to comment on the non-genetic risk factors that mainly affect idiopathic PD; and (ii) to comment on seemingly reliable preventive interventions. We discuss both environmental factors that may affect the central nervous system (CNS) or the intestinal tract, and the likely mechanisms underlying noxious or protective actions. Knowledge on risk, protective factors, and mechanisms may help to envisage why nigral dopaminergic neurons are so vulnerable in PD and, eventually, to design new strategies for PD prevention and/or anti-PD therapy. This article reviews the variety of the known and suspected environmental factors, such as lifestyle, gut microbiota or pesticide exposition, and distinguishes between those that are harmful or beneficial for the PD acquisition or progression. In fact, the review covers one of the most novel players in the whole picture, and we address the role of microbiota on keeping a healthy CNS and/or on preventing the “side-effects” related to aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Gray matter networks (GMn) provide essential information on the intrinsic organization of the brain and appear to be disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;APOE&lt;/span&gt;)-ε4 represents the major genetic risk factor for AD, yet the association between &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;APOE&lt;/span&gt;-ε4 and GMn has remained unexplored. Here, we determine the impact of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;APOE&lt;/span&gt;-ε4 on GMn in a large sample of cognitively unimpaired individuals, which was enriched for the genetic risk of AD. We used independent component analysis to retrieve sources of structural covariance and analyzed &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;APOE&lt;/span&gt; group differences within and between networks. Analyses were repeated in a subsample of amyloid-negative subjects. Compared with noncarriers and heterozygotes, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;APOE&lt;/span&gt;-ε4 homozygotes showed increased covariance in one network including primarily right-lateralized, parietal, inferior frontal, as well as inferior and middle temporal regions, which mirrored the formerly described AD-signature. This result was confirmed in a subsample of amyloid-negative individuals. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;APOE&lt;/span&gt;-ε4 carriers showed reduced covariance between two networks encompassing frontal and temporal regions, which constitute preferential target of amyloid deposition. Our data indicate that, in asymptomatic individuals, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;APOE&lt;/span&gt;-ε4 shapes the cerebral organization in a way that recapitulates focal morphometric alterations observed in AD patients, even in absence of amyloid pathology. This suggests that structural vulnerability in neuronal networks associated with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;APOE&lt;/span&gt;-ε4 may be an early event in AD pathogenesis, possibly upstream of amyloid deposition.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The acquisition of fear memories involves plasticity of the thalamic and cortical pathways to the lateral amygdala (LA). In turn, the maintenance of synaptic plasticity requires the interplay between input-specific synaptic tags and the allocation of plasticity-related proteins. Based on this interplay, weakly activated synapses can express long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity by cooperating with strongly activated synapses. Increasing the number of activated synapses can shift cooperation to competition. Synaptic cooperation and competition can determine whether two events, separated in time, are associated or whether a particular event is selected for storage. The rules that determine whether synapses cooperate or compete are unknown. We found that synaptic cooperation and competition, in the LA, are determined by the temporal sequence of cortical and thalamic stimulation and that the strength of the synaptic tag is modulated by the endocannabinoid signaling. This modulation is particularly effective in thalamic synapses, supporting a critical role of endocannabinoids in restricting thalamic plasticity. Also, we found that the availability of synaptic proteins is activity-dependent, shifting competition to cooperation. Our data present the first evidence that presynaptic modulation of synaptic activation, by the cannabinoid signaling, functions as a temporal gating mechanism limiting synaptic cooperation and competition.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 Chung et al. show that ACOX1, a peroxisomal protein required for degrading VLCFA, is mostly expressed in glial cells. Its loss causes an accumulation of VLCFA and glial loss. An ACOX1 gain-of-function mutation identified in three individuals leads to elevated ROS and glial loss and is potently suppressed by antioxidants.</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Many neurodegenerative conditions are characterized by the deposition of protein aggregates (mainly amyloid-like) in the central nervous system (CNS). In post-mitotic CNS cells protein aggregation causes cytotoxicity by interfering with various cellular functions. Mutations in different genes may directly cause protein aggregation. However, genetic factors together with aging may contribute to the onset of protein aggregation also by affecting cellular degradative functions, in particular the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Increasing body of evidence show that ALP dysfunction and protein aggregation are functionally interconnected and induce each other during neurodegenerative processes. We will summarize the findings supporting these concepts by focusing on lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), a class of metabolic inherited conditions characterized by global lysosomal dysfunction and often associated to a severe neurodegenerative course. We propose a model by which the inherited lysosomal defects initiate aggregate-prone protein deposition, which, in turns, worsen ALP degradation function, thus generating a vicious cycle, which boost neurodegenerative cascades.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation (SD) induces hippocampal damage. Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is a neuronal protective factor. Silence information regulating factor 1 (Sirt1) plays an important role in neuroprotection. Therefore, this study was aimed at exploring whether H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S meliorates SD-induced hippocampal damage and whether Sirt1 mediates this protective role of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. We found that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a donor of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) alleviated SD-generated hippocampal oxidative stress, including increases in the activation of SOD and the level of GSH as well as a decrease in the level of MDA. Meanwhile, we found that NaHS reduced SD-exerted hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Stress, including downregulations of GRP78, CHOP, and cleaved-caspase-12 expression. Moreover, NaHS reduced the apoptosis in the SD-exposed hippocampus, and this included decreases in the number of apoptotic cells and the activation of caspase-3, downregulation of Bax expression, and upregulation of Bcl-2 expression. NaHS upregulated the expression of Sirt1 in the hippocampus of SD-exposed rats. Furthermore, Sirtinol, the inhibitor of Sirt1, abrogated the protection of NaHS against SD-exerted hippocampal oxidative stress, ER stress, and apoptosis. These results suggested that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S alleviates SD-induced hippocampal damage by upregulation of hippocampal Sirt1.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are the morphological basis of excitatory synapses in the cortex and their size and shape correlates with functional synaptic properties. Recent experiments show that spines exhibit large shape fluctuations that are not related to activity-dependent plasticity but nonetheless might influence memory storage at their synapses. To investigate the determinants of such spontaneous fluctuations, we propose a mathematical model for the dynamics of the spine shape and analyze it in 2D—related to experimental microscopic imagery—and in 3D. We show that the spine shape is governed by a local imbalance between membrane tension and the expansive force from actin bundles that originates from discrete actin polymerization foci. Experiments have shown that only few such polymerization foci co-exist at any time in a spine, each having limited life time. The model shows that the momentarily existing set of such foci pushes the membrane along certain directions until foci are replaced and other directions may now be affected. We explore these relations in depth and use our model to predict shape and temporal characteristics of spines from the different biophysical parameters involved in actin polymerization. Approximating the model by a single recursive equation we finally demonstrate that the temporal evolution of the number of active foci is sufficient to predict the size of the model-spines. Thus, our model provides the first platform to study the relation between molecular and morphological properties of the spine with a high degree of biophysical detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2020-03-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Studies suggest that neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum play an important role in childhood epilepsy. However, these investigations remain controversial due to inconsistent clinical results. The present study aimed to quantitatively summarize and assess whether CSF and serum NSE levels are associated with epilepsy in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : A systematic search of the Harvard Hollis+, Clinicaltrials, Open Gray, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases was performed. Studies investigating NSE and epilepsy were identified and retrieved. Original studies with data overlapping those from other investigations and those lacking the necessary data were excluded. The included studies were extracted and synthesized, and data were analyzed using a random-effects model in R Studio and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Random-effects meta-analysis of 26 studies, including 1,360 patients, and 1,256 healthy control, revealed that childhood epilepsy exhibited meaningfully increased CSF and serum levels of NSE compared with controls [Hedges' g = 1.962 (95% confidence interval, 1.413–2.512); P &amp;lt; 0.001]. No single study meaningfully influenced the overall association between CSF and serum levels of NSE and epilepsy after sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analyses according to sample source and assay type revealed a significant association between NSE levels and epilepsy. Stratified analysis confirmed that NSE levels were significantly correlated with the severity of neurological compromise. Metaregression analyses revealed that sample size, mean age, and sex may contribute to effect-size reductions; however, sample source, assay type, and country did not moderate effect size. Funnel plots constructed using the trim-and-fill method confirmed that the outcome of the meta-analysis could not be due to publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results demonstrated that childhood epilepsy exhibits significantly elevated levels of NSE in the CSF and serum, thus strengthening the association between increased NSE levels and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a widely distributed neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive deficits and pathologically by formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Vanadium is a biological trace element that has a function to mimic insulin for diabetes. Bis(ethylmaltolato) oxidovanadium (IV) (BEOV) has been reported to have a hypoglycemic property, but its effect on AD remains unclear. In this study, BEOV was supplemented at doses of 0.2 and 1.0 mmol/L to the AD model mice APPSwe/PS1dE9 for 3 months. The results showed that BEOV substantially ameliorated glucose metabolic disorder as well as synaptic and behavioral deficits of the AD mice. Further investigation revealed that BEOV significantly reduced Aβ generation by increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and insulin-degrading enzyme and by decreasing β-secretase 1 in the hippocampus and cortex of AD mice. BEOV also reduced tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B and regulating the pathway of insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. Furthermore, BEOV could enhance autophagolysosomal fusion and restore autophagic flux to increase the clearance of Aβ deposits and phosphorylated tau in the brains of AD mice. Collectively, the present study provides solid data for revealing the function and mechanism of BEOV on AD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Many studies in neuroscience use head-fixed behavioral preparations, which confer a number of advantages, including the ability to limit the behavioral repertoire and use techniques for large-scale monitoring of neural activity. But traditional studies using this approach use extremely limited behavioral measures, in part because it is difficult to detect the subtle movements and postural adjustments that animals naturally exhibit during head fixation. Here we report a new head-fixed setup with analog load cells capable of precisely monitoring the continuous forces exerted by mice. The load cells reveal the dynamic nature of movements generated not only around the time of task-relevant events, such as presentation of stimuli and rewards, but also during periods in between these events, when there is no apparent overt behavior. It generates a new and rich set of behavioral measures that have been neglected in previous experiments. We detail the construction of the system, which can be 3D-printed and assembled at low cost, show behavioral results collected from head-fixed mice, and demonstrate that neural activity can be highly correlated with the subtle, whole-body movements continuously produced during head restraint.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, is reported to interfere with cerebral blood flow and microcirculation in patients, but our current understanding is quite limited and the results are often controversial. Here we used longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate dynamic changes in cerebral vessels and velocities of red blood cells (RBC) following mTBI. Closed-head mTBI induced using a controlled cortical impact device resulted in a significant reduction of dwell time in a Rotarod test but no significant change in water maze test. Cerebral blood vessels were repeatedly imaged through a thinned skull window at baseline, 0.5, 1, 6 h, and 1 day following mTBI. In both arterioles and capillaries, their diameters and RBC velocities were significantly decreased at 0.5, 1, and 6 h after injury, and recovered in 1 day post-mTBI. In contrast, decreases in the diameter and RBC velocity of venules occurred only in 0.5–1 h after mTBI. We also observed formation and clearance of transient microthrombi in capillaries within 1 h post-mTBI. We concluded that in vivo two-photon imaging is useful for studying earlier alteration of vascular dynamics after mTBI and that mTBI induced reduction of cerebral blood flow, vasospasm, and formation of microthrombi in the acute stage following injury. These changes may contribute to early brain functional deficits of mTBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The developing nervous system is a complex yet organized system of neurons, glial support cells, and extracellular matrix that arranges into an elegant, highly structured network. The extracellular and intracellular events that guide axons to their target locations have been well characterized in many regions of the developing nervous system. However, despite extensive work, we have a poor understanding of how axonal growth cones interact with surrounding glial cells to regulate network assembly. Glia-to-growth cone communication is either direct through cellular contacts or indirect through modulation of the local microenvironment via the secretion of factors or signaling molecules. Microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, Schwann cells, neural progenitor cells, and olfactory ensheathing cells have all been demonstrated to directly impact axon growth and guidance. Expanding our understanding of how different glial cell types directly interact with growing axons throughout neurodevelopment will inform basic and clinical neuroscientists. For example, identifying the key cellular players beyond the axonal growth cone itself may provide translational clues to develop therapeutic interventions to modulate neuron growth during development or regeneration following injury. This review will provide an overview of the current knowledge about glial involvement in development of the nervous system, specifically focusing on how glia directly interact with growing and maturing axons to influence neuronal connectivity. This focus will be applied to the clinically-relevant field of regeneration following spinal cord injury, highlighting how a better understanding of the roles of glia in neurodevelopment can inform strategies to improve axon regeneration after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, researchers have sought to uncover the biological function of the enigmatic leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) enzyme, a large multi-domain protein with dual GTPase and kinase activities. Originally identified as a familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk gene, variations in LRRK2 are also associated with risk of idiopathic PD, inflammatory bowel disease and susceptibility to bacterial infections. LRRK2 is highly expressed in peripheral immune cells and the potential of LRRK2 to regulate immune and inflammatory pathways has emerged as common link across LRRK2-implicated diseases. This review outlines the current genetic and biochemical evidence linking LRRK2 to the regulation of innate immune inflammatory pathways, including the toll-like receptor and inflammasome pathways. Evidence suggests a complex interplay between genetic risk and protective alleles acts to modulate immune outcomes in a manner dependent on the particular pathogen and cell type invaded.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Exercise enhances cognitive function through increased neurogenesis but can also cause neurogenesis-induced forgetting. It remains unclear whether the diminished memory traces are completely forgotten. Our goals were to determine whether spatial memory is diminished by exercise, and if so, whether the memory is completely gone or whether only the local details disappear but not the acquired strategy. Two-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were trained on a spatial memory task using the Morris water maze and tested to determine that they had learned the platform location. Another mouse group received no training. Half the mice in each group then exercised on a running wheel, while the other half remained sedentary in home cages. After 4 weeks of this, previously trained mice were tested for their retention of the platform location. All mice were then subjected to the task, but the platform was located in a different position (reversal learning for previously trained mice). We found that exercise significantly facilitated the forgetting of the first platform location (i.e., diminished spatial memory) but also significantly enhanced reversal learning. Compared with mice that received no pre-exercise training, mice that had been previously trained, even those in the exercise group that had decreased recall, showed significantly better performance in the reversal learning test. Activation of new adult-born neurons was also examined. Although newborn neuron activation between groups that had or had not received prior task training was not different, activation was significantly higher in exercise groups than in sedentary groups after the probe test for reversal learning. These results indicated that the experience of pre-exercise training equally facilitated new learning in the sedentary and exercise groups, even though significantly lower memory retention was found in the exercise group, suggesting rule-based learning in mice. Furthermore, newborn neurons equally participated in similar and novel memory acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a kind of severe brain injury characterized with a high incidence rate and a high disability rate. Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (LITUS) is a promising neuroprotective method for improving the functional prognosis of TBI. The fractional anisotropy (FA) value and mean diffusivity (MD) value can be sensitive to abnormal brain structure and function and can thus be used to evaluate the effect of LITUS on TBI. Our purpose was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LITUS in a moderate TBI rat model with FA and MD values. For our method, we used 45 male Sprague Dawley rats (15 sham normal, 15 TBI, and 15 LITUS treatment rats). We used single-shot spin echo echo-planar imaging sequences at 3.0T to obtain the DTI parameters. Parameters of FA and MD on the treated side of the injury cortex were measured to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LITUS in a TBI rat model. For FA and MD values, groups were compared by using a two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures, and this was followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Differences were considered significant at P &amp;lt; 0.05. The results were that the FA value in the LITUS treatment group at 1 day after TBI was significantly higher than that in the control group (adjusted P = 0.0422) and significantly lower than that in the TBI group at 14, 21, and 35 days after TBI (adjusted P = 0.0015, 0.0064, and 0.0173, respectively). At the end of the scan time point, the differences between the two groups were not significant (adjusted P = 0.3242). The MD values in the LITUS treatment group were significantly higher in the early stage than that in the TBI group (adjusted P = 0.0167) and significantly lower at the following time points than in the TBI group. In conclusion, daily treatment with LITUS for 10 min effectively improved the brain damage in the Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI)-caused TBI model. FA and MD values can serve as evaluation indicators for the neuro-protective effect of LITUS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A variety of assessment tools are currently available to help clinicians assess Sports Related Concussion (SRC). Currently, the most widely available tools are neither objective nor portable, and are therefore not ideal for assessment at the site and time of a suspected injury. A portable system was developed to deliver a measurement of the steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP). This system involved a smartphone housed in a Google Cardboard frame, which delivered a 15-Hz flicker visual stimulus while an electroencephalography (EEG) headset recorded EEG signals. Sixty-five rugby union players were tested during their regular season and were stratified into healthy, concussed, and recovered groups based on clinical examination. Their SSVEP response was quantified into a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNRs of players in each study group were summarized. Additionally, the SNRs of individual players who had baseline, post-injury, and post-recovery readings were analyzed. Sixty-five participants completed a baseline evaluation to measure their SSVEP. Twelve of these participants sustained a medically diagnosed concussion and completed SSVEP re-testing within 72 h. Eight concussed players received follow-up SSVEP testing after recovery. Concussed participants had a lower SNR [2.20 (2.04–2.38)] when compared to their baseline [4.54 (3.79–5.10)]. When clinically recovered, participant SNR was not significantly different to their baseline [4.82 (4.13–5.18)]. The baseline SNRs of the players who experienced a concussion during the season were not different to those of players who did not experience a concussion [4.80 (4.07–5.68)]. This is the first study to identify differences in SSVEP responses in male amateur rugby union players with and without concussion. It is also the first SSVEP demonstration for concussion evaluation at point-of-care. SSVEPs are significantly attenuated in the presence of concussion in these male athletes. Individuals returned to their baseline SSVEP following clinical recovery from the concussive injury. The use of SSVEPs has the potential to be a supplemental aid for the assessment and management of concussion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Twenty-three young adults (4 Females, 25.13 ± 3.72 years) performed an intermittent maximal handgrip force task using their dominant hand for 20 min (3.5 s squeeze/6.5 s release, 120 blocks) with concurrent cortical activity imaging by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNRIS; OMM-3000, Shimadzu Corp., 111 channels). Subjects were grouped as physically active (n = 10) or inactive (n = 12) based on a questionnaire (active-exercise at least four times a week, inactive- exercise less than two times a week). We explored how motor task fatigue affected the vasomotion-induced oscillations in ΔHbO as measured by fNIRS at each hemodynamic frequency band: endothelial component (0.003–0.02 Hz) associated to microvascular activity, neurogenic component (0.02–0.04 Hz) related to intrinsic neuronal activity, and myogenic component (0.04–0.15 Hz) linked to activity of smooth muscles of arterioles. To help understand how these three neurovascular regulatory mechanisms relate to handgrip task performance we quantified several dynamic fNIRS metrics, including directional phase transfer entropy (dPTE), a computationally efficient and data-driven method used as a marker of information flow between cortical regions, and directional connectivity (DC), a means to compute directionality of information flow between two cortical regions. The relationship between static functional connectivity (SFC) and functional connectivity variability (FCV) was also explored to understand their mutual dependence for each frequency band in the context of handgrip performance as fatigued increased. Our findings ultimately showed differences between subject groups across all fNIRS metrics and hemodynamic frequency bands. These findings imply that physical activity modulates neurovascular control mechanisms at the endogenic, neurogenic, and myogenic frequency bands resulting in delayed fatigue onset and enhanced performance. The dynamic cortical network metrics quantified in this work for young, healthy subjects provides baseline measurements to guide future work on older individuals and persons with impaired cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional brain network (FBN) provides an effective biomarker for understanding brain activation patterns and a diagnostic criterion for neurodegenerative diseases detections. Unfortunately, it remains challenges to estimate the biologically meaningful or discriminative FBNs accurately, because of the poor quality of functional magnetic resonance imaging data or our limited understanding of human brain. In this study, a novel FBN estimation model based on group similarity prior was proposed. In particular, we extended the FBN estimation model to tensor form and incorporated the tensor trace-norm regularizer to formulate the group similarity constraint. To verify the proposed method, we conducted experiments on identifying mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) from normal controls (NCs) based on the estimated FBNs. Experimental results illustrated that our method is effective in modeling FBNs. Consequently, we achieved 91.97% classification accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. The post hoc analysis further demonstrated that more biologically meaningful functional brain connections were obtained using our proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is a common treatment method for menopausal syndrome; however, its therapeutic value for the treatment of neurological diseases is still unclear. Epidemiological studies were performed, and the effect of postmenopausal ERT on treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), was summarized through a meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-one articles were selected using a systematic searching of the contents listed on PubMed and Web of Science before June 1, 2019. Epidemiological studies were extracted, and relevant research data were obtained from the original articles based on the predefined inclusion criteria and data screening principles. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2 software was used to pool effective size, test heterogeneity, conduct meta-regression and subgroup analysis, and to calculate publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our results showed that ERT significantly decreased the risk of onset and/or development of AD [odds ratio (OR): 0.672; 95% CI: 0.581–0.779; P &amp;lt; 0.001] and PD (OR: 0.470; 95% CI: 0.368–0.600; P &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with the control group. A subgroup and meta-regression analysis showed that study design and measure of effect were the source of heterogeneity. Age, sample size, hormone therapy ascertainment, duration of the treatment, or route of administration did not play a significant role in affecting the outcome of the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We presented evidence here to support the use of estrogen therapy for the treatment of AD and PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Monte-Carlo Diffusion Simulations (MCDS) have been used extensively as a ground truth tool for the validation of microstructure models for Diffusion-Weighted MRI. However, methodological pitfalls in the design of the biomimicking geometrical configurations and the simulation parameters can lead to approximation biases. Such pitfalls affect the reliability of the estimated signal, as well as its validity and reproducibility as ground truth data. In this work, we first present a set of experiments in order to study three critical pitfalls encountered in the design of MCDS in the literature, namely, the number of simulated particles and time steps, simplifications in the intra-axonal substrate representation, and the impact of the substrate's size on the signal stemming from the extra-axonal space. The results obtained show important changes in the simulated signals and the recovered microstructure features when changes in those parameters are introduced. Thereupon, driven by our findings from the first studies, we outline a general framework able to generate complex substrates. We show the framework's capability to overcome the aforementioned simplifications by generating a complex crossing substrate, which preserves the volume in the crossing area and achieves a high packing density. The results presented in this work, along with the simulator developed, pave the way toward more realistic and reproducible Monte-Carlo simulations for Diffusion-Weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Automatic segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning of MS. Recent years have seen an increasing use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for this task. Although these methods provide accurate segmentation, their applicability in clinical settings remains limited due to a reproducibility issue across different image domains. MS images can have highly variable characteristics across patients, MRI scanners and imaging protocols; retraining a supervised model with data from each new domain is not a feasible solution because it requires manual annotation from expert radiologists. In this work, we explore an unsupervised solution to the problem of domain shift. We present a framework, Seg-JDOT, which adapts a deep model so that samples from a source domain and samples from a target domain sharing similar representations will be similarly segmented. We evaluated the framework on a multi-site dataset, MICCAI 2016, and showed that the adaptation toward a target site can bring remarkable improvements in a model performance over standard training.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We describe a model of neurological disease based on dysfunctional brain oscillators. This is not a new model, but it is not one that is widely appreciated by clinicians. The value of this model lies in the predictions it makes and the utility it provides in translational applications, in particular for neuromodulation devices. Specifically, we provide a perspective on devices that provide input to sensory receptors and thus stimulate endogenous sensory networks. Current forms of clinically applied neuromodulation, including devices such as (implanted) deep brain stimulators (DBS) and various, noninvasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial current methods (tACS, tDCS), have been studied extensively. The potential strength of neuromodulation of a sensory organ is access to the same pathways that natural environmental stimuli use and, importantly, the modulatory signal will be transformed as it travels through the brain, allowing the modulation input to be consistent with regional neuronal dynamics. We present specific examples of devices that rely on sensory neuromodulation and evaluate the translational potential of these approaches. We argue that sensory neuromodulation is well suited to, ideally, repair dysfunctional brain oscillators, thus providing a broad therapeutic approach for neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) is an extensively used organophosphate in industry. It has been proven to lead to toxicity in different organ systems, especially in the nervous system. Neural stem cells (NSCs) play important roles in both embryonic and adult nervous systems. However, whether TOCP induces cytotoxicity in embryonic NSCs remains unclear. In this study, mouse NSCs were exposed to different concentrations of TOCP for 24 h. The results showed that TOCP led to impaired proliferation of NSCs and induced the autophagy of NSCs by increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2). Melatonin has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects via various mechanisms. Therefore, we further investigate whether melatonin has potential protective effects against TOCP-induced cytotoxicity on NSCs. Our data showed that melatonin pretreatment attenuated TOCP-induced autophagy by suppressing oxidative stress and restoring ERK1/2 phosphorylation consistently. Taken together, the results indicated that TOCP induced the autophagy in mouse NSCs, and melatonin may effectively protect NSCs against TOCP-induced autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The expression of contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), one of the major cellular components of the neurovascular unit (NVU), has been revealed recently. However, the physiological role of Caspr1 in BMECs remains unclear. We previously reported the nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid protein precursor (APP) pathway in the human BMECs (HBMECs). In this study, we found Caspr1 depletion reduced the levels of soluble amyloid protein precursor α (sAPPα) in the supernatant of HBMECs, which could be rescued by expression of full-length Caspr1. Our further results showed that ADAM9, the α-secretase essential for processing of APP to generate sAPPα, was decreased in Caspr1-depleted HBMECs. The reduced sAPPα secretion in Caspr1-depleted HBMECs was recovered by expression of exogenous ADAM9. Then, we identified that Caspr1 specifically regulates the expression of ADAM9, but not ADAM10 and ADAM17, at transcriptional level by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Caspr1 knockout attenuated the activation of NF-κB and prevented the nuclear translocation of p65 in brain endothelial cells, which was reversed by expression of full-length Caspr1. The reduced sAPPα production and ADAM9 expression upon Caspr1 depletion were effectively recovered by NF-κB agonist. The results of luciferase assays indicated that the NF-κB binding sites are located at −859 bp to −571 bp of ADAM9 promoter. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Caspr1 facilitates sAPPα production by transcriptional regulation of α-secretase ADAM9 in brain endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential neurotrophic factors and expression of neurotrophin receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells linked with the antidepressant action of exercise intervention during protracted methamphetamine (METH) abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: A total of 72 male METH addicts, including 47 individuals with depression and 25 individuals without depression, were recruited in this study. Individuals with depression were divided into the depression control group and the depression exercised group. Consequently, 12 weeks of supervised exercise intervention was applied. Depression and anxiety were analyzed; plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neuronal growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), NT-4, and proBDNF levels were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the mRNA expressions of TrkA, TrkB-FL, TrkB-T1, TrkCB, and P75NTR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: NT-4 plasma levels were correlated with depression (r = −0.330, p = 0.005), which remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In addition, the BDNF and NT-3 levels in the plasma were significantly correlated with depression (r = −0.268, p = 0.023; r = −0.259, p = 0.028), but did not reach significance after Bonferroni correction. The BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 plasma levels were significantly different between the depressive control group and the depressive exercise group using pre-exercise values as the covariate. The fold changes in TrkB-FL and TrkB-T1 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between the post-exercise and pre-exercise demonstrated a remarkable decrease (fold change = −11.056 and −39.055).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Exercise intervention can alleviate depression and anxiety during protracted METH abstinence. Decrease in BDNF and the expression of TrkB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occur following the exercise intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The motor system has the flexibility to update motor plans according to systematic changes in the environment or the body. This capacity is studied in the laboratory through sensorimotor adaptation paradigms imposing sustained and predictable motor demands specific to the task at hand. However, these studies are tied to the laboratory setting. Thus, we asked if a portable device could be used to elicit locomotor adaptation outside the laboratory. To this end, we tested the extent to which a pair of motorized shoes could induce similar locomotor adaptation to split-belt walking, which is a well-established sensorimotor adaptation paradigm in locomotion. We specifically compared the adaptation effects (i.e. after-effects) between two groups of young, healthy participants walking with the legs moving at different speeds by either a split-belt treadmill or a pair of motorized shoes. The speeds at which the legs moved in the split-belt group was set by the belt speed under each foot, whereas in the motorized shoes group were set by the combined effect of the actuated shoes and the belts’ moving at the same speed. We found that the adaptation of joint motions and measures of spatial and temporal asymmetry, which are commonly used to quantify sensorimotor adaptation in locomotion, were indistinguishable between groups. We only found small differences in the joint angle kinematics during baseline walking between the groups – potentially due to the weight and height of the motorized shoes. Our results indicate that robust sensorimotor adaptation in walking can be induced with a paired of motorized shoes, opening the exciting possibility to study sensorimotor adaptation during more realistic situations outside the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cocaine use disorder and methamphetamine use disorder are chronic, relapsing disorders with no US Food and Drug Administration-approved interventions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation tool that has been increasingly investigated as a possible therapeutic intervention for substance use disorders. rTMS may have the ability to induce beneficial neuroplasticity in abnormal circuits and networks in individuals with addiction. The aim of this review is to highlight the rationale and potential for rTMS to treat cocaine and methamphetamine dependence: we synthesize the outcomes of studies in healthy humans and animal models to identify and understand the neurobiological mechanisms of rTMS that seem most involved in addiction, focusing on the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. rTMS-induced changes to neurotransmitter systems include alterations to striatal dopamine release and metabolite levels, as well as to glutamate transporter and receptor expression, which may be relevant for ameliorating the aberrant plasticity observed in individuals with substance use disorders. We also discuss the clinical studies that have used rTMS in humans with cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders. Many such studies suggest changes in network connectivity following acute rTMS, which may underpin reduced craving following chronic rTMS. We suggest several possible future directions for research relating to the therapeutic potential of rTMS in addiction that would help fill current gaps in the literature. Such research would apply rTMS to animal models of addiction, developing a translational pipeline that would guide evidence-based rTMS treatment of cocaine and methamphetamine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Successful navigation relies on the flexible and appropriate use of metric representations of space or topological knowledge of the environment. Spatial dimensions (2D vs. 3D), spatial scales (vista-scale vs. large-scale environments) and the abundance of visual landmarks critically affect navigation performance and behavior in healthy human subjects. Virtual reality (VR)-based navigation paradigms in stationary position have given insight into the major navigational strategies, namely egocentric (body-centered) and allocentric (world-centered), and the cerebral control of navigation. However, VR approaches are biased towards optic flow and visual landmark processing. This major limitation can be overcome to some extent by increasingly immersive and realistic VR set-ups (including large-screen projections, eye tracking and use of head-mounted camera systems). However, the highly immersive VR settings are difficult to apply particularly to older subjects and patients with neurological disorders because of cybersickness and difficulties with learning and conducting the tasks. Therefore, a need for the development of novel spatial tasks in real space exists, which allows a synchronous analysis of navigational behavior, strategy, visual explorations and navigation-induced brain activation patterns. This review summarizes recent findings from real space navigation studies in healthy subjects and patients with different cognitive and sensory neurological disorders. Advantages and limitations of real space navigation testing and different VR-based navigation paradigms are discussed in view of potential future applications in clinical neurology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Preeclampsia is a dangerous hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with known links to negative child health outcomes. Here, we review epidemiological and basic neuroscience work from the past several decades linking prenatal preeclampsia to altered neurodevelopment. This work demonstrates increased rates of neuropsychiatric disorders [e.g., increased autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)] in children of preeclamptic pregnancies, as well as increased rates of cognitive impairments [e.g., decreased intelligence quotient (IQ), academic performance] and neurological disease (e.g., stroke and epilepsy).</content>

 Childhood maltreatment increases the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders in humans. Early life adversity (ELA) paradigms in rodents produce lasting increases in avoidant and inhibitory responses to both immediate and nonspecific threats, collectively referred to as defensive behaviors. This approach provides an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the underlying mechanisms, an effort that is currently under way. In this review, we consider the growing literature indicating that ELA alters the rhythmic firing of neurons in brain regions associated with defensive behavior, as well as potential neuronal, glial, and extracellular matrix contributions to functional changes in this circuitry.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cerebral ischemia injury can result in neuronal death and/or functional impairment, which leads to further damage and dysfunction after recovery of blood supply. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) often causes irreversible brain damage and neuronal injury and death, which involves many complex pathological processes including oxidative stress, amino acid toxicity, the release of endogenous substances, inflammation and apoptosis. Oxidative stress and inflammation are interactive and play critical roles in ischemia/reperfusion injury in the brain. Oxidative stress is important in the pathological process of ischemic stroke and is critical for the cascade development of ischemic injury. Oxidative stress is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cerebral ischemia and is more likely to lead to cell death and ultimately brain death after reperfusion. During reperfusion especially, superoxide anion free radicals, hydroxyl free radicals, and nitric oxide (NO) are produced, which can cause lipid peroxidation, inflammation and cell apoptosis. Inflammation alters the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in cerebral ischemic injury. Inflammatory factors can therefore stimulate or exacerbate inflammation and aggravate ischemic injury. Neuroprotective therapies for various stages of the cerebral ischemia cascade response have received widespread attention. At present, neuroprotective drugs mainly include free radical scavengers, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-apoptotic agents. However, the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between oxidative stress and inflammation, and their interplay with different types of programmed cell death in ischemia/reperfusion injury are unclear. The development of a suitable method for combination therapy has become a hot topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a class of G-protein-coupled receptors found in mammals. While TAAR1 is expressed in several brain regions, all the other TAARs have been described mainly in the olfactory epithelium and the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and are believed to serve as a new class of olfactory receptors sensing innate odors. However, there is evidence that TAAR5 could play a role also in the central nervous system. In this study, we characterized a mouse line lacking TAAR5 (TAAR5 knockout, TAAR5-KO) expressing beta-galactosidase mapping TAAR5 expression. We found that TAAR5 is expressed not only in the glomerular layer in the olfactory bulb but also in deeper layers projecting to the limbic brain olfactory circuitry with prominent expression in numerous limbic brain regions, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the amygdala, the hippocampus, the piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. TAAR5-KO mice did not show gross developmental abnormalities but demonstrated less anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in several behavioral tests. TAAR5-KO mice also showed significant decreases in the tissue levels of serotonin and its metabolite in several brain areas and were more sensitive to the hypothermic action of serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propilamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). These observations indicate that TAAR5 is not just innate odor-sensing olfactory receptor but also serves to provide olfactory input into limbic brain areas to regulate emotional behaviors likely via modulation of the serotonin system. Thus, anxiolytic and/or antidepressant action of future TAAR5 antagonists could be predicted. In general, “olfactory” TAAR-mediated brain circuitry may represent a previously unappreciated neurotransmitter system involved in the transmission of innate odors into emotional behavioral responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study presents a computational model of closed-loop control of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson’s disease (PD) to investigate clinically viable control schemes for suppressing pathological beta-band activity. Closed-loop DBS for PD has shown promising results in preliminary clinical studies and offers the potential to achieve better control of patient symptoms and side effects with lower power consumption than conventional open-loop DBS. However, extensive testing of algorithms in patients is difficult. The model presented provides a means to explore a range of control algorithms in silico and optimize control parameters before preclinical testing. The model incorporates (i) the extracellular DBS electric field, (ii) antidromic and orthodromic activation of STN afferent fibers, (iii) the LFP detected at non-stimulating contacts on the DBS electrode and (iv) temporal variation of network beta-band activity within the thalamo-cortico-basal ganglia loop. The performance of on-off and dual-threshold controllers for suppressing beta-band activity by modulating the DBS amplitude were first verified, showing levels of beta suppression and reductions in power consumption comparable with previous clinical studies. Proportional (P) and proportional-integral (PI) closed-loop controllers for amplitude and frequency modulation were then investigated. A simple tuning rule was derived for selecting effective PI controller parameters to target long duration beta bursts while respecting clinical constraints that limit the rate of change of stimulation parameters. Of the controllers tested, PI controllers displayed superior performance for regulating network beta-band activity whilst accounting for clinical considerations. Proportional controllers resulted in undesirable rapid fluctuations of the DBS parameters which may exceed clinically tolerable rate limits. Overall, the PI controller for modulating DBS frequency performed best, reducing the mean error by 83% compared to DBS off and the mean power consumed to 25% of that utilized by open-loop DBS. The network model presented captures sufficient physiological detail to act as a surrogate for preclinical testing of closed-loop DBS algorithms using a clinically accessible biomarker, providing a first step for deriving and testing novel, clinically suitable closed-loop DBS controllers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that assessment of brain connectivity may shed light on the underpinnings of ocular hypertension (OHT), characterized by raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and no typical glaucomatous findings. OHT carries a risk for future glaucoma development, thus representing a model of presymptomatic condition. In previous studies on glaucoma, we showed altered brain connectivity since the early stage and in case of normal IOP. In this pilot study, we used a multimodal MRI approach by modeling voxelwise measures of gray matter volume, anatomical connectivity along white matter(WM) tracts, and large-scale functional connectivity in OHT subjects (n = 18, age: 58.3 ± 9.8 years) and demographically matched normal controls (n = 29). While OHT brain had no structural alterations, it showed significantly decreased functional connectivity in key cognitive networks [default mode network, frontoparietal working memory network (WMN), ventral attention network (VAN), and salience network (SN)] and altered long-range functional connectivity, which was decreased between default mode and SNs and increased between primary and secondary visual networks (VN). Overall, such findings seem to delineate a complex neuroplasticity in the OHT brain, where decreased functional connectivity in non-visual networks may reflect a type of temporarily downregulated functional reserve while increased functional connectivity between VN may be viewed as a very early attempt of adaptive functional reorganization of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ensemble classifiers have been proven to result in better classification accuracy than that of a single strong learner in many machine learning studies. Although many studies on electroencephalography-brain-computer interface (BCI) used ensemble classifiers to enhance the BCI performance, ensemble classifiers have hardly been employed for near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-BCIs. In addition, since there has not been any systematic and comparative study, the efficacy of ensemble classifiers for NIRS-BCIs remains unknown. In this study, four NIRS-BCI datasets were employed to evaluate the efficacy of linear discriminant analysis ensemble classifiers based on the bootstrap aggregating. From the analysis results, significant (or marginally significant) increases in the bitrate as well as the classification accuracy were found for all four NIRS-BCI datasets employed in this study. Moreover, significant bitrate improvements were found in two of the four datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent progenitors that are responsible for producing all of the neurons and macroglia in the nervous system. In adult mammals, NSCs reside predominantly in a mitotically dormant, quiescent state, but they can proliferate in response to environmental inputs such as feeding or exercise. It is hoped that quiescent NSCs could be activated therapeutically to contribute towards repair in humans. This will require an understanding of quiescent NSC heterogeneities and regulation during normal physiology and following brain injury.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;How are the complex maps for orientation selectivity (OS) created in the primary visual cortex (V1)? Rodents and rabbits have a random distribution of OS preferences across V1 while in cats, ferrets, and all primates cells with similar OS preferences cluster together into relatively wide cortical columns. Given other clear similarities in the organization of the visual pathways, why is it that maps coding OS preferences are so radically different? Prominent models have been created of cortical OS mapping that incorporate Hebbian plasticity, intracortical interactions, and the properties of growing axons. However, these models suggest that the maps arise primarily through intracortical interactions. Here we focus on several other features of the visual system and brain that may influence V1 structure. These are: eye divergence, the total number of cells in V1, the thalamocortical networks, the topography of the retina and phylogeny. We outline the evidence for and against these factors contributing to map formation. One promising theory is that the central-to-peripheral ratio (CP ratio) of retinal cell density can be used to predict whether or not a species has pinwheel maps. Animals with high CP ratios (&amp;gt;7) have orientation columns while those with low CP ratios (&amp;lt;4) have random OS maps. The CP ratio is related to the total number of cells in cortex, which also appears to be a reasonable contributing factor. However, while these factors correlate with map structure to some extent, there is a gray area where certain species do not fit elegantly into the theory. A problem with the existing literature is that OS maps have been investigated in only a small number of mammals, from a small fraction of the mammalian phylogenetic tree. We suggest four species (agouti, fruit bat, sheep, and wallaby) that have a range of interesting characteristics, which sit at intermediate locations between primates and rodents, that make them good targets for filling in the missing gaps in the literature. We make predictions about the map structures of these species based on the organization of their brains and visual systems and, in doing so, set possible paths for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The propensity to engage in risky behaviors including excessive alcohol consumption may impose increased medical, emotional, and psychosocial burdens. Personality and behavioral traits of individuals may contribute in part to the involvement in risky behaviors, and therefore the classification of one’s traits may help identify those who are at risk for future onset of the addictive disorder and related behavioral issues such as alcohol misuse. Personality and behavioral characteristics including impulsivity, anger, reward sensitivity, and avoidance were assessed in a large sample of healthy young adults (n = 475). Participants also underwent diffusion tensor imaging for the analysis of structural brain networks. A data-driven clustering using personality and behavioral traits of the participants identified four subtypes. As compared with individuals clustered into the neutral type, individuals with a high level of impulsivity (A subtype) and those with high levels of reward sensitivity, impulsivity, anger, and avoidance (B subtype) showed significant associations with problem drinking. In contrast, individuals with high levels of impulsivity, anger, and avoidance but not reward sensitivity (C subtype) showed a pattern of social drinking that was similar to those of the neutral subtype. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis with ridge estimators was applied to demonstrate the neurobiological relevance for the identified subtypes according to distinct patterns of structural brain connectivity within the addiction circuitry [neutral vs. A subtype, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67–0.81; neutral vs. B subtype, AUC = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.66–0.82; neutral vs. C subtype, AUC = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.70–0.84]. The current findings enable the characterization of individuals according to subtypes based on personality and behavioral traits that are also corroborated by neuroimaging data and may provide a platform to better predict individual risks for addictive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synchronization of neural activity across brain regions is critical to processes that include perception, learning, and memory. After traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuronal degeneration is one possible effect and can alter communication between neural circuits. Consequently, synchronization between neurons may change and can contribute to both lasting changes in functional brain networks and cognitive impairment in patients. However, fundamental principles relating exactly how TBI at the cellular scale affects synchronization of mesoscale circuits are not well understood. In this work, we use computational networks of Izhikevich integrate-and-fire neurons to study synchronized, oscillatory activity between clusters of neurons, which also adapt according to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We study how the connections within and between these neuronal clusters change as unidirectional connections form between the two neuronal populations. In turn, we examine how neuronal deletion, intended to mimic the temporary or permanent loss of neurons in the mesoscale circuit, affects these dynamics. We determine synchronization of two neuronal circuits requires very modest connectivity between these populations; approximately 10% of neurons projecting from one circuit to another circuit will result in high synchronization. In addition, we find that synchronization level inversely affects the strength of connection between neuronal microcircuits – moderately synchronized microcircuits develop stronger intercluster connections than do highly synchronized circuits. Finally, we find that highly synchronized circuits are largely protected against the effects of neuronal deletion but may display changes in frequency properties across circuits with targeted neuronal loss. Together, our results suggest that strongly and weakly connected regions differ in their inherent resilience to damage and may serve different roles in a larger network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human intelligence is constituted by a multitude of cognitive functions activated either directly or indirectly by external stimuli of various kinds. Computational approaches to the cognitive sciences and to neuroscience are partly premised on the idea that computational simulations of such cognitive functions and brain operations suspected to correspond to them can help to further uncover knowledge about those functions and operations, specifically, how they might work together. These approaches are also partly premised on the idea that empirical neuroscience research, whether following on from such a simulation (as indeed simulation and empirical research are complementary) or otherwise, could help us build better artificially intelligent systems. This is based on the assumption that principles by which the brain seemingly operate, to the extent that it can be understood as computational, should at least be tested as principles for the operation of artificial systems. This paper explores some of the principles of the brain that seem to be responsible for its autonomous, problem-adaptive nature. The brain operating system (BrainOS) explicated here is an introduction to ongoing work aiming to create a robust, integrated model, combining the connectionist paradigm underlying neural networks and the symbolic paradigm underlying much else of AI. BrainOS is an automatic approach that selects the most appropriate model based on the (a) input at hand, (b) prior experience (a history of results of prior problem solving attempts), and (c) world knowledge (represented in the symbolic way and used as a means to explain its approach). It is able to accept diverse and mixed input data types, process histories and objectives, extract knowledge and infer a situational context. BrainOS is designed to be efficient through its ability to not only choose the most suitable learning model but to effectively calibrate it based on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neonatal brain development relies on a combination of critical factors inclusive of genetic predisposition, attachment, and the conditions of the pre and postneonatal environment. The status of the infant’s developing brain in its most vulnerable state and the impact that physiological elements of music, silences and sounds may make in the earliest stages of brain development can enhance vitality. However, little attention has been focused on the integral aspects of the music itself. This article will support research that has hypothesized conditions of music therapeutic applications in an effort to further validate models of neurobehavioral care that have optimized conditions for growth, inclusive of recommendations leading toward the enhancement of self-regulatory behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Robust cross-subject emotion recognition based on multichannel EEG has always been hard work. In this work, we hypothesize that there exist default brain variables across subjects in emotional processes. Hence, the states of the latent variables that relate to emotional processing must contribute to building robust recognition models. Specifically, we propose to utilize an unsupervised deep generative model (e.g., variational autoencoder) to determine the latent factors from the multichannel EEG. Through a sequence modeling method, we examine the emotion recognition performance based on the learnt latent factors. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified on two public datasets (DEAP and SEED) and compared with traditional matrix factorization-based (ICA) and autoencoder-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that autoencoder-like neural networks are suitable for unsupervised EEG modeling, and our proposed emotion recognition framework achieves an inspiring performance. As far as we know, it is the first work that introduces variational autoencoder into multichannel EEG decoding for emotion recognition. We think the approach proposed in this work is not only feasible in emotion recognition but also promising in diagnosing depression, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, etc., whose specific latent processes may be altered or aberrant compared with the normal healthy control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Many in the neuroscience community were surprised and saddened to learn of Bruce McEwen’s sudden passing on January 2, 2020 after a brief illness. Several of us had interacted with Bruce recently, read his recent publications, and saw no signs of his enthusiasm for science or productivity waning despite being close to his 82nd birthday. Given that Bruce had a larger-than-life capacity for generating, storing, and integrating scientific knowledge, and a seemingly never-failing enthusiasm for stress neurobiology and neuroendocrinology in general, it seemed as though he would live forever.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We previously created a prosthetic hand with a tacit learning system (TLS) that automatically supports the control of forearm pronosupination. This myoelectric prosthetic hand enables sensory feedback and flexible motor output, which allows users to move efficiently with minimal burden. In this study, we investigated whether electroencephalography can be used to analyze the influence of the auxiliary function of the TLS on brain function. Three male participants who had sustained below-elbow amputations and were myoelectric prosthesis users performed a series of physical movement trials with the TLS inactivated and activated. Trials were video recorded and a sequence of videos was prepared to represent each individual’s own use while the system was inactivated and activated. In a subsequent motor imagery phase during which electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected, each participant was asked to watch both videos of themself while actively imagining the physical movement depicted. Differences in mean cortical current and amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) values between supplementary motor areas (SMA) and each vertex were calculated. For all participants, there were differences in the mean cortical current generated by the motor imagery tasks when the TLS inactivated and activated conditions were compared. The AEC values were higher during the movement imagery task with TLS activation, although their distribution on the cortex varied between the three individuals. In both S1 and other brain areas, AEC values increased in conditions with the TLS activated. Evidence from this case series indicates that, in addition to motor control, TLS may change sensory stimulus recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Several approaches can be used to estimate neural activity. The main differences between them concern the a priori information used and its sensitivity to high noise levels. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been recently applied to electroencephalography EEG-based neural activity reconstruction to provide a priori time-frequency information to improve the estimation of neural activity. EMD has the specific ability to identify independent oscillatory modes in non-stationary signals with multiple oscillatory components. However, attempts to use EMD in EEG analysis have not yet provided optimal reconstructions, due to the intrinsic mode-mixing problem of EMD. Several studies have used single-channel analysis, whereas others have used multiple-channel analysis for other applications. Here, we present the results of multiple-channel analysis using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to reduce the mode-mixing problem and provide useful a priori time-frequency information for the reconstruction of neuronal activity using several low-density EEG electrode montages. The methods were evaluated using real and synthetic EEG data, in which the reconstructions were performed using the multiple sparse priors (MSP) algorithm with EEG electrode montages of 32, 16, and 8 electrodes. The quality of the source reconstruction was assessed using the Wasserstein metric. A comparison of the solutions without pre-processing and those after applying MEMD showed the source reconstructions to be improved using MEMD as a priori information for the low-density montages of 8 and 16 electrodes. The mean source reconstruction error on a real EEG dataset was reduced by 59.42 and 66.04% for the 8 and 16 electrode montages, respectively, and that on a simulated EEG with three active sources, by 87.31 and 31.45% for the same electrode montages.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Current neural prostheses can restore limb movement to tetraplegic patients by translating brain signals coding movements to control a variety of actuators. Fast and accurate somatosensory feedback is essential for normal movement, particularly dexterous tasks, but is currently lacking in motor neural prostheses. Attempts to restore somatosensory feedback have largely focused on cortical stimulation which, thus far, have succeeded in eliciting minimal naturalistic sensations. Yet, a question that deserves more attention is whether the cortex is the best place to activate the central nervous system to restore somatosensation. Here, we propose that the brainstem dorsal column nuclei are an ideal alternative target to restore somatosensation. We review some of the recent literature investigating the dorsal column nuclei functional organization and neurophysiology and highlight some of the advantages and limitations of the dorsal column nuclei as a future neural prosthetic target. Recent evidence supports the dorsal column nuclei as a potential neural prosthetic target, but also identifies several gaps in our knowledge as well as potential limitations which need to be addressed before such a goal can become reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;High-fidelity measurements of neural activity can enable advancements in our understanding of the neural basis of complex behaviors such as speech, audition, and language, and are critical for developing neural prostheses that address impairments to these abilities due to disease or injury. We develop a novel high resolution, thin-film micro-electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) array that enables high-fidelity surface measurements of neural activity from songbirds, a well-established animal model for studying speech behavior. With this device, we provide the first demonstration of sensory-evoked modulation of surface-recorded single unit responses. We establish that single unit activity is consistently sensed from micro-ECoG electrodes over the surface of sensorimotor nucleus HVC (used as a proper name) in anesthetized European starlings, and validate responses with correlated firing in single units recorded simultaneously at surface and depth. The results establish a platform for high-fidelity recording from the surface of subcortical structures that will accelerate neurophysiological studies, and development of novel electrode arrays and neural prostheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Automatic alignment of brain anatomy in a standard space is a key step when processing magnetic resonance imaging for group analyses. Such brain registration is prone to failure, and the results are therefore typically reviewed visually to ensure quality. There is however no standard, validated protocol available to perform this visual quality control (QC). We propose here a standardized QC protocol for brain registration, with minimal training overhead and no required knowledge of brain anatomy. We validated the reliability of three-level QC ratings (OK, Maybe, Fail) across different raters. Nine experts each rated N = 100 validation images, and reached moderate to good agreement (kappa from 0.4 to 0.68, average of 0.54 ± 0.08), with the highest agreement for “Fail” images (Dice from 0.67 to 0.93, average of 0.8 ± 0.06). We then recruited volunteers through the Zooniverse crowdsourcing platform, and extracted a consensus panel rating for both the Zooniverse raters (N = 41) and the expert raters. The agreement between expert and Zooniverse panels was high (kappa = 0.76). Overall, our protocol achieved a good reliability when performing a two level assessment (Fail vs. OK/Maybe) by an individual rater, or aggregating multiple three-level ratings (OK, Maybe, Fail) from a panel of experts (3 minimum) or non-experts (15 minimum). Our brain registration QC protocol will help standardize QC practices across laboratories, improve the consistency of reporting of QC in publications, and will open the way for QC assessment of large datasets which could be used to train automated QC systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates local translation in dendrites and spines for synaptic plasticity. In axons, FMRP is implicated in axonal extension and axon guidance. We previously demonstrated the involvement of FMRP in growth cone collapse via a translation-dependent response to Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A), a repulsive axon guidance factor. In the case of attractive axon guidance factors, RNA-binding proteins such as zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) accumulate towards the stimulated side of growth cones for local translation. However, it remains unclear how Sema3A effects FMRP localization in growth cones. Here, we show that levels of FMRP in growth cones of hippocampal neurons decreased after Sema3A stimulation. This decrease in FMRP was suppressed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 enzyme inhibitor PYR-41 and proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in Sema3A-induced FMRP degradation in growth cones. Moreover, the E1 enzyme or proteasome inhibitor suppressed Sema3A-induced increases in microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) in growth cones, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway promotes local translation of MAP1B, whose translation is mediated by FMRP. These inhibitors also blocked the Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. Collectively, our results suggest that Sema3A promotes degradation of FMRP in growth cones through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to growth cone collapse via local translation of MAP1B. These findings reveal a new mechanism of axon guidance regulation: degradation of the translational suppressor FMRP via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
