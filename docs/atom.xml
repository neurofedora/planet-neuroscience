 &lt;p&gt;Human memory -- the learning of new information involves changes at the
synaptic level between neurons dedicated for storage of in-formation.
Generally, memory is classified as Long-Term Memory and Short-Term Memory. The
various types of the memory and their disorder are widely studied using
neuroimaging techniques like Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Brain is effectively occupied with the
capabilities of learning, retention and recall. The brain regions (pre-frontal
cortex, associated hippocampus cortices and their interactions with other
lobes) involved in memory recall tasks focuses on understanding the memory
retention and recall processes. However, due to highly complicated and dynamic
mechanisms of brain, the specific regions where information may reside are not
completely explored. In this research paper, recent memory literature using EEG
and fMRI studies is reviewed to understand the memory retention and recall
processes as well as the various brain regions associated with these processes.
A number of stimuli which are reported in previous studies are evaluated and
discussed. Furthermore, the challenges which are being faced by researchers in
EEG and fMRI methodologies are also presented. Recommendations for the future
research related to memory retention and recall are also discussed at the end.

 &lt;p&gt;Axons functionally link the somato-dendritic compartment to synaptic
terminals. Structurally and functionally diverse, they accomplish a central
role in determining the delays and reliability with which neuronal ensembles
communicate. By combining their active and passive biophysical properties, they
ensure a plethora of physiological computations. In this review, we revisit the
biophysics of generation and propagation of electrical signals in the axon,
their complex interplay, and their rich dynamics. We further place the
computational abilities of axons in the context of intracellular and
intercellular coupling. We discuss how, by means of sophisticated biophysical
mechanisms, axons expand the repertoire of axonal computation, and thereby, of
neural computation.

 &lt;p&gt;A good understanding of how neurons use electrical pulses (i.e, spikes) to
encode the signal information remains elusive. Analyzing spike sequences
generated by individual neurons and by two coupled neurons (using the
stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model), recent theoretical studies have found that
the relative timing of the spikes can encode the signal information. Using a
symbolic method to analyze the spike sequence, preferred and infrequent spike
patterns were detected, whose probabilities vary with both, the amplitude and
the frequency of the signal. To investigate if this encoding mechanism is
plausible also for neuronal ensembles, here we analyze the activity of a group
of neurons, when they all perceive a weak periodic signal. We find that, as in
the case of one or two coupled neurons, the probabilities of the spike
patterns, now computed from the spike sequences of all the neurons, depend on
the signal's amplitude and period, and thus, the patterns' probabilities encode
the information of the signal. We also find that the resonances with the period
of the signal or with the noise level are more pronounced when a group of
neurons perceive the signal, in comparison with when only one or two coupled
neurons perceive it. Neuronal coupling is beneficial for signal encoding as a
group of neurons is able to encode a small-amplitude signal, which could not be
encoded when it is perceived by just one or two coupled neurons. Interestingly,
we find that for a group of neurons, just a few connections with one another
can significantly improve the encoding of small-amplitude signals. Our findings
indicate that information encoding in preferred and infrequent spike patterns
is a plausible mechanism that can be employed by neuronal populations to encode
weak periodic inputs, exploiting the presence of neural noise.

 &lt;p&gt;Chemical and electrical synapses shape the dynamics of neuronal networks.
Numerous theoretical studies have investigated how each of these types of
synapses contributes to the generation of neuronal oscillations, but their
combined effect is less understood. This limitation is further magnified by the
impossibility of traditional neuronal mean-field models ---also known as firing
rate models, or firing rate equations--- to account for electrical synapses.
Here we analyze the dynamics of heterogeneous populations of quadratic
integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons with both chemical and electrical coupling. To
this aim, we derive an exact firing rate model that describes the collective
dynamics of the QIF network in a unified framework valid for both electrical
and chemical coupling. Networks with instantaneous chemical synapses display a
well-known bifurcation scenario characterized by a codimension-2 Cusp point
and, thus, by the presence of persistent asynchronous states for strong
excitatory coupling. The inclusion of electrical coupling generally implies the
emergence of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation and, hence, neuronal synchrony.
This dramatically transforms the Cusp scenario into a bifurcation scenario
characterized by three codimension-2 points (Cusp, Takens-Bogdanov, and
Saddle-Node Separatrix Loop), which is generic for the dynamics of
heterogeneous QIF networks with both chemical and electrical coupling.

 &lt;p&gt;We study the statistical physics of a surprising phenomenon arising in large
networks of excitable elements in response to noise: while at low noise,
solutions remain in the vicinity of the resting state and large-noise solutions
show asynchronous activity, the network displays orderly, perfectly
synchronized periodic responses at intermediate level of noise. We show that
this phenomenon is fundamentally stochastic and collective in nature. Indeed,
for noise and coupling within specific ranges, an asymmetry in the transition
rates between a resting and an excited regime progressively builds up, leading
to an increase in the fraction of excited neurons eventually triggering a chain
reaction associated with a macroscopic synchronized excursion and a collective
return to rest where this process starts afresh, thus yielding the observed
periodic synchronized oscillations. We further uncover a novel anti-resonance
phenomenon: noise-induced synchronized oscillations disappear when the system
is driven by periodic stimulation with frequency within a specific range. In
that anti-resonance regime, the system is optimal for measures of information
capacity. This observation provides a new hypothesis accounting for the
efficiency of Deep Brain Stimulation therapies in Parkinson's disease, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by an increased synchronization of
brain motor circuits. We further discuss the universality of these phenomena in
the class of stochastic networks of excitable elements with confining coupling,
and illustrate this universality by analyzing various classical models of
neuronal networks. Altogether, these results uncover some universal mechanisms
supporting a regularizing impact of noise in excitable systems, reveal a novel
anti-resonance phenomenon in these systems, and propose a new hypothesis for
the efficiency of high-frequency stimulation in Parkinson's disease.

 Detailed behavioral analysis is key to understanding the brain-behavior relationship. Here, we present deep learning-based methods for analysis of behavior imaging data in mice and humans. Specifically, we use three different convolutional neural network architectures and five different behavior tasks in mice and humans and provide detailed instructions for rapid implementation of these methods for the neuroscience community. We provide examples of three dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis in the food pellet reaching task in mice, social behavior analysis in freely moving mice with simultaneous miniscope calcium imaging, and 3D kinematic analysis of reaching and fine hand movements in humans. We demonstrate that the transfer learning approach accelerates the training of the network when using images from these types of behavior video recordings. We also provide code for post-processing of the data after initial analysis with deep learning. Our methods expand the repertoire of available tools using deep learning for behavior analysis by providing detailed instruction on implementation, applications in several behavior tests, and post-processing methods and annotated code for detailed behavior analysis. Moreover, our methods in human motor behavior can be used in the clinic to assess motor function during recovery after an injury such as stroke.</content>

 The view that different kinds of memory are mediated by dissociable neural systems has received extensive experimental support.  Dissociations between memory systems are usually observed during initial acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of memory, however increasing evidence also indicates a role for multiple memory systems in extinction behavior.  The present paper reviews a recent series of maze learning experiments that provide evidence for a multiple memory systems approach to extinction learning and memory. Evidence is described indicating that (1) the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) mediate different kinds of extinction learning, (2) the effectiveness of different extinction protocols depends on the kind of memory being extinguished, and (3) whether a neural system is involved in extinction is also determined by the extinction protocol and kind of memory undergoing extinction.  Based on these findings, a novel hypothetical model regarding the role of multiple memory systems in extinction is presented.  In addition, the relevance of this multiple memory systems approach to other learning paradigms involving extinction (i.e. extinction of conditioned fear) and for treating human psychopathologies characterized by maladaptive memories (e.g. drug addiction and relapse) is briefly considered.</content>

 Metabolic dysfunction is a hallmark of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). But the crosstalk between metabolic alteration and disease progression in ALS is still largely unknown. Glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose residues, is identified as the energy reserve of central nervous system (CNS), where its aberrant accumulation leads to neurodegeneration. Glycogen was reported to be accumulated in both CNS and visceral organs of SOD1G93A mice, a well-known ALS model, and contributes to pathological process of ALS. However, the accumulative patterns and mechanisms are not well elucidated. Here, we provide extensive evidence to show that glycogen accumulated in the lumbar spinal cord of ALS mice along with the disease progression, but not in the motor cortex. This regional accumulation of glycogen was caused by deteriorated glycogenolysis, which was triggered by decreased PYGB (glycogen phosphorylase, brain form). Moreover, miR-338-3p, an elevated miRNA in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice, directly targeted PYGB and was responsible for the decreased glycogenolysis and subsequent glycogen accumulation. Our work is helpful for better understanding of metabolic dysfunctions in ALS and provides novel targets for the therapeutic intervention in the future.</content>

 Alzheimer disease (AD) represents an oncoming epidemic that without an effective treatment promises to exact extraordinary financial and emotional burdens. Studies of pathogenesis are essential for defining critical molecular and cellular events and for discovering therapies to prevent or mitigate their effects. Through studies of neuropathology, genetic and cellular and molecular biology recent decades have provided many important insights. Several hypotheses have been suggested. Documentation in the 1980s of selective loss of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, followed by clinical improvement in those treated with inhibitors of acetylycholinesterase, supported the “cholinergic hypothesis of age-related cognitive dysfunction”. A second hypothesis, prompted by the selective loss of cholinergic neurons and the discovery of central nervous system (CNS) neurotrophic factors, including NGF, prompted the “deficient neurotrophic hypothesis”. The most persuasive hypothesis, the amyloid cascade hypothesis first proposed more than 25 years ago, is supported by a wealth of observations. Genetic studies were exceptionally important, pointing to increased dose of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Down syndrome (DS) and a familial AD (FAD) due to duplication of APP and to mutations in APP and in the genes for Presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1, 2), which encode the γ-secretase enzyme that processes APP. The “tau hypothesis” noted the prominence of tau-related pathology and its correlation with dementia. Recent interest in induction of microglial activation in the AD brain, as well as other manifestations of inflammation, supports the ‘inflammatory hypothesis” . We place these findings in the context of the selective, but by no means unique, involvement of BFCNs and their trophic dependence on NGF signaling and speculate as to how pathogenesis in these neurons is initiated, amplified and ultimately results in their dysfunction and death. In so doing we attempt to show how the different hypotheses for AD may interact and reinforce one another. Finally, we address current attempts to prevent and/or treat AD in light of advances in understanding pathogenetic mechanisms and suggest that studies in the Down syndrome population may provide unique insights into AD pathogenesis and treatment.</content>

 Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a widely used technique for mapping the brain’s functional architecture, so delineating the main sources of variance comprising the signal is crucial. Low frequency oscillations (LFO) that are not of neural origin, but which are driven by mechanisms related to cerebral autoregulation (CA), are present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the rs-fMRI frequency band. In this study we use a MR compatible device (Caretaker, Biopac) to obtain a non-invasive estimate of beat-to-beat mean arterial pressure (MAP) fluctuations concurrently with rs-fMRI at 3T. Healthy adult subjects (n=9; 5 male) completed two 20-minute rs-fMRI scans. MAP fluctuations were decomposed into different frequency scales using a discrete wavelet transform, and oscillations at approximately 0.1Hz show a high degree of spatially structured correlations with matched frequency fMRI fluctuations. On average across subjects, MAP fluctuations at this scale of the wavelet decomposition explain ~ 2.2% of matched frequency fMRI signal variance. Additionally, a simultaneous multi-slice multi-echo acquisition was used to collect 10-minute rs-fMRI at three echo times at 7T in a separate group of healthy adults (n=5; 5 male). Multiple echo times were used to estimate the R2* decay at every time point, and MAP was shown to strongly correlate with this signal, which suggests a purely BOLD (i.e. blood flow related) origin. This study demonstrates that there is a significant component of the BOLD signal that has a systemic physiological origin, and highlights the fact that not all localized BOLD signal changes necessarily reflect blood flow supporting local neural activity. Instead, these data show that a proportion of BOLD signal fluctuations in rs-fMRI are due to localized control of blood flow that is independent of local neural activity, most likely reflecting more general systemic autoregulatory processes. Thus, fMRI is a promising tool for studying flow changes associated with cerebral autoregulation with high spatial resolution.</content>

 Two-photon imaging of fluorescently labelled microglia in vivo provides a direct approach to measure motility of microglial processes as a readout of microglial function that is crucial in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to understand the neuroinflammatory response to implanted substrates and brain-computer interfaces. In this longitudinal study, we quantified surveilling and photodamage-directed microglial processes motility in both acute and chronic cranial window preparations and compared the motility under isoflurane and ketamine anesthesia to awake condition in the same animal. The isoflurane anesthesia increased the length of surveilling microglial processes in both acute and chronic preparations, while ketamine increased the number of microglial branches in acute preparation only. In chronic (but not acute) preparation, the extension of microglial processes towards the laser-ablated microglial cell was faster under isoflurane (but not ketamine) anesthesia than in awake mice, indicating distinct effects of anesthetics and of preparation type. These data reveal potentiating effects of isoflurane on microglial response to damage, and provide a framework for comparison and optimal selection of experimental conditions for quantitative analysis of microglial function using two-photon microscopy in vivo.</content>

 Our knowledge of the brain has evolved over millennia in philosophical, experimental and theoretical phases. We suggest that the next phase is simulation neuroscience. The main drivers of simulation neuroscience are big data generated at multiple levels of brain organization and the need to integrate these data to trace the causal chain of interactions within and across all these levels. Simulation neuroscience is currently the only methodology for systematically approaching the multiscale brain. In this review, we attempt to reconstruct the deep historical paths leading to simulation neuroscience, from the first observations of the nerve cell to modern efforts to digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain. Neuroscience began with the identification of the neuron as the fundamental unit of brain structure and function and has evolved towards understanding the role of each cell type in the brain, how brain cells are connected to each other, and how the seemingly infinite networks they form give rise to the vast diversity of brain functions. Neuronal mapping is evolving from subjective descriptions of cell types towards objective classes, subclasses and types. Connectivity mapping is evolving from loose topographic maps between brain regions towards dense anatomical and physiological maps of connections between individual genetically distinct neurons. Functional mapping is evolving from psychological and behavioral stereotypes towards a map of behaviors emerging from structural and functional connectomes. We show how industrialization of neuroscience and the resulting large disconnected datasets are generating demand for integrative neuroscience, how the scale of neuronal and connectivity maps is driving digital atlasing and digital reconstruction to piece together the multiple levels of brain organization, and how the complexity of the interactions between molecules, neurons, microcircuits and brain regions is driving brain simulation to understand the interactions in the multiscale brain.</content>

 The chronic consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may contribute to the increased risk for early cognitive decline and dementia, primarily due to the diffusion axonal injury. Previous studies in mild (mTBI) have been controversy in describing the white matter tracts integrity changes occurring at acute and sub-acute post-injury. In the prospective longitudinal study, we aim to investigate the longitudinal changes of white matter using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and their correlations with neuropsychological tests. Thirty-three patients with sub-acute mTBI, 31 matched healthy controls were studied with an extensive imaging and clinical battery. Neuroimaging was obtained within 7 days post-injury for acute scans and repeated at 1 month and 3 month post-injury. Using a region-of-interest-based approach, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics was used to conduct voxel-wise analysis on diffusion changes in mTBI and was compared to those of healthy matched controls, scanned during the same time period and rescanned with a similar interval as that of patients. We found decreased FA values in the left anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC) and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) during the 7 days post-injury, which showed longitudinal evidence of recovery following one-month post-injury. Increased FA values in these two tracts at 1 month post-injury was positively associated with better performance on cognitive information processing speed at initial assessment. By contrast, there were also some tracts (right anterior corona radiata, forceps major and body of corpus callosum) exhibiting the continuing loss of integrity sustaining even beyond 3 months, which can predict the persisting post-concussion syndromes. Continuing loss of structural integrity in some tracts may contribute to the persistent post-concussion syndromes in mTBI patients, suggesting certain tracts providing an objective biomarker for tracking the pathological recovery process following mTBI.</content>

 Hyperforin has been shown to be capable of promoting angiogenesis and functional recovery after ischemic stroke in our previous study. However, the exact mechanisms involved are not fully elucidated. In this study, adult male mice were subjected to 60-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion for 28 days. Hyperforin was administrated to MCAO mice every 24 hours for 2 weeks starting at 14 days post-ischemia (dpi). Then flow cytometry, quantitative Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and functional assays were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. Our data showed that hyperforin increased astrocytic interleukin (IL)-6 in the ischemic hemisphere via TLR4 at 28dpi. The astrocytic IL-6 was essential to the promoting effects of hyperforin on the neural precursor cells (NPCs) proliferation, neuronal differentiation, angiogenesis and functional recovery after stroke. Furthermore, hyperforin promoted the infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the ischemic hemisphere and increased Tregs-derived cytokine IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in a manner that was dependent on astrocytic IL-6. Astrocytic IL-6 was critical to the role of hyperforin in promoting the infiltration of T-helper (Th) type 2 cells to the ischemic hemisphere and Th2-derived cytokine IL-4, relative to Th1 and Th1-derived cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which decreased during stroke recovery. After depletion of CD25+ Tregs, the promoting effects of hyperforin on post-stroke neurogenesis was attenuated. Moreover, blockade of IL-4 and TGF-β abrogated the promoting role of hyperforin in post-stroke neurogenesis, angiogenesis and functional recovery. Our results reveal a previously uncharacterized role of astrocytic IL-6-mediated negative immune regulation in the promoting effects of hyperforin on post-stroke neurovascular regeneration and functional recovery.</content>

 The mechanisms that coordinately regulate lipid synthesis in the nervous system together with the high rates of membrane biogenesis needed to support cell growth are largely unknown as are their subcellular site of synthesis. c-Fos, a well-known AP-1 transcription factor, has emerged as a unique protein with the capacity to associate to specific enzymes of the pathway of synthesis of phospholipids at the endoplasmic reticulum and activate their synthesis to accompany genomic decisions of growth. Herein, we discuss this effect of c-Fos in the context of neuronal differentiation and also with respect to pathologies of the nervous system such as the development and growth of tumors. We also provide insights into the sub-cellular sites where this regulation occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and the molecular mechanism by which c-Fos exerts this activity.</content>

 Chronic stress has an important impact on the adult brain. However, most of the knowledge on its effects is focused on principal neurons and less on inhibitory neurons. Consequently, recent reports have begun to describe stress-induced alterations in the structure, connectivity and neurochemistry of interneurons. Some of these changes appear to be mediated by certain molecules particularly associated to interneurons, such as the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) and components of the perineuronal nets (PNN), specialized regions of the extracellular matrix. These plasticity-related molecules modulate interneuronal structure and connectivity, particularly of parvalbumin expressing basket interneurons, both during development and adult life. These inhibitory neurons are specially affected after chronic stress and in some stress-related disorders, in which the expression of PSA-NCAM and certain components of PNN are also altered. For these reasons we have decided to study PSA-NCAM, PNN and parvalbumin expressing interneurons after 10 days of chronic restraint stress, a time point in which its behavioral consequences are starting to appear. We have focused initially on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and hippocampus, regions affected by stress and stress-related psychiatric diseases, but we have also explored the habenula and the thalamic reticular nucleus due to the important presence of PNN and their relationship with certain disorders. PSA-NCAM expression was increased by stress in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1. Increases in parvalbumin immunoreactive cells were detected in the mPFC and the BLA, but were not accompanied by increases in the number of parvalbumin expressing perisomatic puncta on the somata of principal neurons. The number of PNN was also increased in the mPFC and the habenula, although habenular PNN were not associated to parvalbumin cells. Increased expression of parvalbumin and components of PNN were also detected in the thalamic reticular nucleus after chronic restraint stress, revealing for the first time substantial effects on this region. Our study shows that, even a short chronic stress protocol, can induce consistent changes in interneuronal plasticity-related molecules in cortical and extracortical regions, which may represent initial responses of inhibitory circuits to counteract the effects of this aversive experience.</content>

 It has recently been proposed using a multi-compartmental mathematical model that negatively fixed charged membrane-associated sites constrain the flow of cations in perisynaptic astroglial processes. This restricted movement of ions between the perisynaptic cradle (PsC), principal astroglial processes and the astrocyte soma gives rise to potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) microdomains at the PsC. The present paper extends the above model to demonstrate that the formation of an Na+ microdomain can reverse the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) thus providing an additional source of calcium (Ca2+) at the PsC. Results presented clearly show that reversal of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is instigated by a glutamate transporter coupled increase in concentration of cytoplasmic [Na+]i at the PsC, which and instigates Ca2+ influx through the NCX. As the flow of Ca2+ along the astrocyte process and away from the PsC is also constrained by Ca2+ binding proteins, then a Ca2+ microdomain forms at the PsC. The paper also serves to demonstrate that the EAAT, NKA and NCX represent the minimal requirement necessary and sufficient for the development of a Ca2+ microdomain and that these mechanisms directly link neuronal activity and glutamate release to the formation of localised Na+ and Ca2+ microdomains signals at the PsC. This local source of Ca2+ can provide a previously underexplored form of astroglial Ca2+ signaling.</content>

 Background: The relationship between cognitive impairment and abdominal visceral is controversial. Moreover, all studies so far used imaging studies to evaluate visceral fat and this association has not been described yet using autopsy material, which allows the direct quantification of abdominal fat. We aimed to investigate the association between direct measurements of abdominal visceral fat and cognitive impairment in an autopsy study.  Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we collected information on sociodemographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cognitive status from subjects aged 50 or older at time of death in a general autopsy service in Brazil. Abdominal visceral fat was obtained in natura by the dissection of perirenal, mesenteric, omental, and mesocolon fat. The associations of total abdominal visceral fat with cognitive impairment [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score ≥0.5) and CDR-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) were evaluated using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models, respectively. All analyses were adjusted for height, age, sex, education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, smoking, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. In addition, we compared the discrimination of visceral fat, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) measurements in predicting cognitive impairment. Results: We evaluated 234 participants (mean age=71.2±12.9 years old, 59% male). Abdominal visceral fat was inversely associated with cognitive impairment (OR=0.46, CI=0.30; 0.70, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and with CDR-SB scores (β=-0.85, 95% CI=-1.28; -0.43, p&amp;lt;0.0001). When we compared the area under the ROC curve (AUC), visceral fat (AUC=0.754), BMI (AUC=0.729), and WC (AUC=0.720) showed similar discrimination in predicting cognitive impairment (p=0.38). Conclusion: In an autopsy study, larger amount of directly measured abdominal visceral fat was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in older adults.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is associated with dysregulation at different levels from transcriptome to cellular functioning. Such complexity necessitates investigations of disease etiology to be carried out considering multiple aspects of the disease and the use of independent strategies. The established works more emphasized on the structural organization of gene regulatory network while neglecting the internal regulation changes.  Methods: Applying a strategy different from popularly used co-expression network analysis, this study investigated the transcriptional dysregulations during the transition from normal to disease states.   Results: 97 genes were predicted as dysregulated genes, which were also associated with clinical outcomes of Alzheimer's disease. Both the co-expression and differential co-expression analysis suggested these genes to be interconnected as a core network and that their regulations were strengthened during the transition to disease states. Functional studies suggested the dysregulated genes to be associated with aging and synaptic function. Further, we checked the evolutionary conservation of the gene co-expression and found that human and mouse brain might have divergent transcriptional co-regulation even when they had conserved gene expression profiles.  Conclusion: Overall, our study reveals a core network of transcriptional dysregulation associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease by affecting the aging and synaptic functions related genes; the gene regulation  is not conserved in the human and mouse brains.</content>

 A growing body of evidence indicates that biomarkers of cardiovascular risk may be related to cerebral health. However, little is known about the role non-fasting lipoprotein play in assessing age-related declines in a cerebral biomarker sensitive to vascular compromise, white matter (WM) microstructure. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is atheroprotective and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major atherogenic lipoprotein. This study explored the relationships between non-fasting levels of cholesterol and WM microstructure in healthy older adults. A voxelwise and region of interest approach was used to determine the relationship between cholesterol and fractional anisotropy (FA). Participants were 87 older adults between the ages of 59 and 77 (mean age = 65.5 years, SD = 3.9). Results indicated that higher HDL-C was associated with higher FA in diffuse regions of the brain when controlling for age, sex, and body mass index. HDL-C was also positively associated with FA in the corpus callosum and fornix. No relationship was observed between LDL-C and FA. Findings suggest that a modifiable lifestyle variable associated with cardiovascular health may help to preserve cerebral WM.</content>

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether cognitive training of other types undertaken at home has beneficial effects on driving skills. Using our developed cognitive training games that work on a TV with a set-top box in a person’s home, we investigated effects of 6-week cognitive training on driving skills which assessed with on-road evaluation (primary outcome) and also check the benefit on cognitive functions and emotional states (secondary outcome) in older people. Methods For this double-blinded randomized control trial (RCT), 60 older licensed drivers were assigned randomly to two groups: a cognitive training game for car driving (CTCD) group and an active control cognitive training game (ACT) group. The CTCD, participants played CTCD (processing speed, dual attention, and speed prediction) for 20 min during 5 sessions per week for 6 weeks. The ACT group participants played ACT (select large number, select number from largest to smallest, rock–paper–scissors) for 20 min during 5 sessions per week for 6 weeks. We measured driving skills, several cognitive functions, and emotional states before and after the 6 week intervention period. Results Our main results demonstrated that, compared to ACT, CTCD improved driving skills (adjusted p = 0.034). Moreover, compared to ACT, CTCD improved inhibition (stroop, adjusted p = 0.042: reverse Stroop, adjusted p = 0.043) and processing speed performance (symbol search, adjusted p = 0.049; digit symbol coding, (adjusted p = 0.047). It increased vigor–activity mood scores (adjusted p = 0.041) as measured using the Profile of Mood State. Discussion This randomized controlled trial first provided scientific evidence related to benefits of 6-week CTCD on driving skills, cognitive functions such as processing speed, inhibition, and vigor–activity mood in healthy older people. Our results suggested cognitive training as a useful tool for improving driving skills of older adults.

Cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) networks are critical for adaptive decision-making, yet how changes to circuit-level properties impact cognitive algorithms remains unclear. Here we explore how dopaminergic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses alters competition between striatal pathways, impacting the evidence accumulation process during decision-making. Spike-timing dependent plasticity simulations showed that dopaminergic feedback based on rewards modified the ratio of direct and indirect corticostriatal weights within opposing action channels. Using the learned weight ratios in a full spiking CBGT network model, we simulated neural dynamics and decision outcomes in a reward-driven decision task and fit them with a drift diffusion model. Fits revealed that the rate of evidence accumulation varied with inter-channel differences in direct pathway activity while boundary height varied with overall indirect pathway activity. This multi-level modeling approach demonstrates how complementary learning and decision computations can emerge from corticostriatal plasticity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aJKmYhBIb1c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Gene-expression deconvolution is used to quantify different types of cells in a mixed population. It provides a highly promising solution to rapidly characterize the tumor-infiltrating immune landscape and identify cold cancers. However, a major challenge is that gene-expression data are frequently contaminated by many outliers that decrease the estimation accuracy. Thus, it is imperative to develop a robust deconvolution method that automatically decontaminates data by reliably detecting and removing outliers. We developed a new machine learning tool, Fast And Robust DEconvolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), to enumerate immune cell subsets from whole tumor tissue samples. To reduce noise in the tumor gene expression datasets, FARDEEP utilizes an adaptive least trimmed square to automatically detect and remove outliers before estimating the cell compositions. We show that FARDEEP is less susceptible to outliers and returns a better estimation of coefficients than the existing methods with both numerical simulations and real datasets. FARDEEP provides an estimate related to the absolute quantity of each immune cell subset in addition to relative percentages. Hence, FARDEEP represents a novel robust algorithm to complement the existing toolkit for the characterization of tissue-infiltrating immune cell landscape. The source code for FARDEEP is implemented in R and available for download at https://github.com/YuningHao/FARDEEP.git.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ch_oucou2P4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Auditory neurons encode stimulus history, which is often modelled using a span of time-delays in a spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF). We propose an alternative model for the encoding of stimulus history, which we apply to extracellular recordings of neurons in the primary auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets. For a linear-non-linear STRF model (LN model) to achieve a high level of performance in predicting single unit neural responses to natural sounds in the primary auditory cortex, we found that it is necessary to include time delays going back at least 200 ms in the past. This is an unrealistic time span for biological delay lines. We therefore asked how much of this dependence on stimulus history can instead be explained by dynamical aspects of neurons. We constructed a neural-network model whose output is the weighted sum of units whose responses are determined by a dynamic firing-rate equation. The dynamic aspect performs low-pass filtering on each unit’s response, providing an exponentially decaying memory whose time constant is individual to each unit. We find that this dynamic network (DNet) model, when fitted to the neural data using STRFs of only 25 ms duration, can achieve prediction performance on a held-out dataset comparable to the best performing LN model with STRFs of 200 ms duration. These findings suggest that integration due to the membrane time constants or other exponentially-decaying memory processes may underlie linear temporal receptive fields of neurons beyond 25 ms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RE63FYO0E5Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Inferior olivary activity causes both short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output underlying motor performance and motor learning. Many of its neurons engage in coherent subthreshold oscillations and are extensively coupled via gap junctions. Studies in reduced preparations suggest that these properties promote rhythmic, synchronized output. However, the interaction of these properties with torrential synaptic inputs in awake behaving animals is not well understood. Here we combine electrophysiological recordings in awake mice with a realistic tissue-scale computational model of the inferior olive to study the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing its activity. Our data and model suggest that if subthreshold oscillations are present in the awake state, the period of these oscillations will be transient and variable. Accordingly, by using different temporal patterns of sensory stimulation, we found that complex spike rhythmicity was readily evoked but limited to short intervals of no more than a few hundred milliseconds and that the periodicity of this rhythmic activity was not fixed but dynamically related to the synaptic input to the inferior olive as well as to motor output. In contrast, in the long-term, the average olivary spiking activity was not affected by the strength and duration of the sensory stimulation, while the level of gap junctional coupling determined the stiffness of the rhythmic activity in the olivary network during its dynamic response to sensory modulation. Thus, interactions between intrinsic properties and extrinsic inputs can explain the variations of spiking activity of olivary neurons, providing a temporal framework for the creation of both the short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XmkFrsWZKic&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Functional brain networks self-assemble during development, although the molecular basis of network assembly is poorly understood. &lt;i&gt;Protocadherin-19&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt;) is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and influences multiple cellular and developmental events in zebrafish. Although loss of &lt;i&gt;PCDH19&lt;/i&gt; in humans and model organisms leads to functional deficits, the underlying network defects remain unknown. Here, we employ multiplane, resonant-scanning &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium imaging of developing zebrafish, and use graph theory to characterize the development of resting state functional networks in both wild type and &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; mutant larvae. We find that the brain networks of &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; mutants display enhanced clustering and an altered developmental trajectory of network assembly. Our results show that functional imaging and network analysis in zebrafish larvae is an effective approach for characterizing the developmental impact of lesions in genes of clinical interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Non-clustered protocadherins are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders that include microcephaly, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. In humans, mutations in &lt;i&gt;PCDH19&lt;/i&gt; cause a female limited form of infantile epileptic encephalopathy and are associated with an increased incidence of schizophrenia and autism. In this study, we use large-scale calcium imaging to reveal that mutations in zebrafish &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; alter the development of brain network topology. This work is the first to use functional imaging to explore the effects of a clinically relevant mutation on brain-wide network assembly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We show that graph analysis of spontaneous network activity is a sensitive method for revealing subtle changes to network architecture in response to genetic perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In network models of spiking neurons, the coupled impact of network structure
and synaptic parameters on activity propagation is still an open problem. For
spiking networks with hierarchical modular topology, we show that slow
spike-train fluctuations emerge due to the increase of either the global
synaptic strength parameter or the network hierarchical level, while the
network size remains constant. Through an information-theoretical approach we
show that information propagation of activity among adjacent modules is
enhanced as the number of modules increases until an optimal value is reached
and then decreases. This suggests that there is an optimal interplay between
hierarchical level and synaptic strengths for information propagation among
modules, but we also found that information transfer measured from the
spike-trains differs from this one indicating that modular organization
restructures information communicated in the mesoscopic level. By examining the
increase of synaptic strengths and number of modules we find that the network
behavior changes following different mechanisms: (1) increase of
autocorrelations among individual neurons, and (2) increase of
cross-correlations among pairs of neurons, respectively. The latter being
better for information propagation. Our results have important implications and
suggest roles that link topological features and synaptic levels to the
transmission of information in cortical networks.

 &lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a novel method for analysis and segmentation of
laminar structure of the cortex based on tissue characteristics whose change
across the gray matter facilitates distinction between cortical layers. We
develop and analyze features of individual neurons to investigate changes in
architectonic differentiation and present a novel high-performance, automated
tree-ensemble method trained on data manually labeled by three human
investigators. From the location and basic measures of neurons, more complex
features are developed and used in machine learning models for automatic
segmentation of cortical layers. Tree ensembles are used on data manually
labeled by three human experts. The most accurate classification results were
obtained by training three models separately and creating another ensemble by
combining probability outputs for final neuron layer classification.
Measurement of importances of developed neuron features on both global model
level and individual prediction level are obtained.

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;“Superagers” are older adults who, despite their advanced age, maintain youthful memory. Previous morphometry studies revealed multiple default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) regions whose cortical thickness is greater in superagers and correlates with memory performance. In this study, we examined the intrinsic functional connectivity within DMN and SN in 41 young (24.5 ± 3.6 years old) and 40 older adults (66.9 ± 5.5 years old). Superaging was defined as youthful performance on a memory recall task, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Participants underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan and performed a separate visual–verbal recognition memory task. As predicted, within both DMN and SN, superagers had stronger connectivity compared with typical older adults and similar connectivity compared with young adults. Superagers also performed similarly to young adults and better than typical older adults on the recognition task, demonstrating youthful episodic memory that generalized across memory tasks. Stronger connectivity within each network independently predicted better performance on both the CVLT and recognition task in older adults. Variation in intrinsic connectivity explained unique variance in memory performance, above and beyond youthful neuroanatomy. These results extend our understanding of the neural basis of superaging as a model of successful aging.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 In 1929 Hans Berger discovered the alpha oscillations: a prominent, ongoing 10 Hz rhythm in the human EEG. These alpha oscillations are amongst the most widely studied cerebral signals, related to cognitive phenomena such as attention, memory and consciousness. However, the mechanisms by which alpha oscillations affect cognition await demonstration. Here we provide a novel model system from an adequately described complex neural circuit of the honey bee (Apis mellifera), that exhibits properties of the alpha oscillations. We found a prominent alpha wave-like ongoing neural activity (~ 18 Hz) that is reduced in amplitude upon stimulus presentation. The phase of this alpha activity biased both neuronal spikes and amplitude of high frequency gamma activity (&amp;gt; 30 Hz). These results suggest a common role of oscillatory neuronal activity across phyla and provide an unprecedented new venue for causal studies on the relationship between neuronal spikes, brain oscillations and cognition.</content>

 Bimanual motor actions, such as threading a needle, require coordination of the movements of each hand according to the state of the other hand. By connecting homologous cortical regions between the two cerebral hemispheres, the corpus callosum is thought to play a key role in such bimanual coordination. However, direct experimental evidence of the contribution of the corpus callosum to natural behaviors requiring bimanual coordination, such as feeding, is lacking. We investigated the hypothesis that the corpus callosum mediates bimanual movements during food-handling behavior. We first traced the forelimb-related components of the motor corpus callosum in Long-Evans rats, and found that the callosal fiber bundle from the forelimb motor areas passes through the anterior part of the corpus callosum. We then confirmed by electrophysiological recordings that blocking the axonal conduction of fibers in the anterior corpus callosum reduced neural transmission between cortical forelimb areas. The causal role of corpus callosum in bimanual coordination was then tested by analyzing forelimb kinematics during object manipulation, before and after blocking axonal conduction in the anterior corpus callosum. We found the frequency of occurrence of symmetric bimanual movements was reduced by inhibition of anterior corpus callosum. In contrast, asymmetric bimanual movement was increased. Our findings suggest that the anterior corpus callosum coordinates the direction of bimanual movement.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In the mouse olfactory bulb, sensory information detected by ~1,000 types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) is represented by the glomerular map. The second-order neurons, mitral and tufted cells, connect a single primary dendrite to one glomerulus. This forms discrete connectivity between the ~1,000 types of input and output neurons. It has remained unknown how this discrete dendrite wiring is established during development. We found that genetically silencing neuronal activity in mitral cells, but not from OSNs, perturbs the dendrite pruning of mitral cells. In vivo calcium imaging of awake neonatal animals revealed two types of spontaneous neuronal activity in mitral/tufted cells, but not in OSNs. Pharmacological and knockout experiments revealed a role for glutamate and NMDARs. The genetic blockade of neurotransmission among mitral/tufted cells reduced spontaneous activity and perturbed dendrite wiring. Thus, spontaneous network activity generated within the olfactory bulb self-organizes the parallel discrete connections in the mouse olfactory system.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Complex brain networks are increasingly characterized at different scales, including global summary statistics, community connectivity, and individual edges. While research relating brain networks to demographic and behavioral measurements has yielded many insights into brain-phenotype relationships, common analytical approaches only consider network information at a single scale, thus failing to incorporate rich information present at other scales. Here, we designed, implemented, and deployed Multi-Scale Network Regression (MSNR), a penalized multivariate approach for modeling brain networks that explicitly respects both edge- and community-level information by assuming a low rank and sparse structure, both encouraging less complex and more interpretable modeling. Capitalizing on a large neuroimaging cohort (n=1,051), we demonstrate that MSNR recapitulates interpretable and statistically significant association between functional connectivity patterns with brain development, sex differences, and motion-related artifacts. Notably, compared to single-scale methods, MSNR achieves a balance between prediction performance and model complexity, with improved interpretability. Together, by jointly exploiting both edge- and community-level information, MSNR has the potential to yield novel insights into brain-behavior relationships.</content>

		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/628610v1?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 We studied the shift of gaze direction induced by dark background in monkeys. Faced with large inter-individual variability, we asked how common the upshift is, and how the upshift size is distributed. Furthermore, we sought to reckon processes influencing the variability. Approaching these questions necessitates a large sample. Here we report data from 10 rhesus monkeys recorded in Tuebingen, together with reported data from 4 cynomolgus monkeys studied in Rehovot. In all 14 monkeys, dark background induced upshift - but no systematic horizontal shift. The upshift might be thought of as a simple sensorimotor response; nevertheless, surprisingly, the monkeys' previous experience appeared to have a decisive role in influencing the upshift's size. All the monkeys were previously trained in tasks that involved vision and eye movements; by their previous training, the monkeys were naturally divided into two groups. Monkeys of the first, 'bright-habituated' group, previously trained in photopic, bright ambient-light conditions; monkeys of the second, 'dark-habituated' group previously trained mostly with isolated dots of light appearing in dim ambient lighting or in full darkness. The dark-habituated monkeys had a larger upshift than the bright-habituated: the groups were separated by a border-value such that 6/7 of the dark-habituated monkeys had upshift larger than the border, and 5/7 of the bright-habituated monkeys had upshift smaller than the border. Thus, the size of the dark-background-induced upshift largely reflects the extent to which a monkey is habituated to work in the dark. Though the upshift is reflex-like sensorimotor behavior, its amplitude largely reflects cumulative experience.</content>

 Simultaneous multi-slice or multi-band parallel imaging is frequently used in fMRI to accelerate acquisition. In this study, we propose a new a non-water-suppressed multi-band MRSI using a density weighted concentric ring trajectory (DW-CRT) acquisition. The properties of multi-band acquisition scheme were compared against single-band acquisition in phantoms and in-vivo experiments. High-quality spectra were acquired for all simultaneously acquired three slices from a limited volume of interest with an in-plane resolution of 5 x 5 mm2 method allowed the reliable metabolic mapping of four major metabolites with Cramer Rao lower bounds below 50%, using a LCModel analysis. Metabolite maps and LCModel quality metrics were compared between multi-band and single-band acquisition schemes for both phantom and in-vivo measurements. Structural similarity (SSIM) index and conventional coefficient of variance analysis of both phantom and in-vivo measurements revealed a SSIM index higher than 0.83, corresponding to a coefficient of variance of less than 30%. These findings demonstrate that our multi-band DW-CRT MRSI demonstrate a multi-band acceleration, simultaneously acquired 3 slices, with no apparent loss in spectral quality, reducing scan time by a factor of 3 without any significant penalty.</content>

 In recent years, there has been a massive effort to analyze the topological properties of brain networks. Yet, one of the challenging questions in the field is how to construct brain networks based on the connectivity values derived from neuroimaging methods. From a theoretical point of view, it is plausible that the brain would have evolved to minimize energetic costs of information processing, and therefore, maximizes efficiency as well as to redirect its function in an adaptive fashion, that is, resilience. A brain network with such features, when characterized using graph analysis, would present small-world and scale-free properties. In this paper, we focused on how the brain network is constructed by introducing and testing an alternative method: k-nearest neighbor (kNN). In addition, we compared the kNN method with one of the most common methods in neuroscience: namely the density threshold. We performed our analyses on functional connectivity matrices derived from resting state fMRI of a big imaging cohort (N=434) of young and older healthy participants. The topology of networks was characterized by the graph measures degree, characteristic path length, clustering coefficient and small world. In addition, we verified whether kNN produces scale-free networks. We showed that networks built by kNN presented advantages over traditional thresholding methods, namely greater values for small-world (linked to efficiency of networks) than those derived by means of density thresholds and moreover, it presented also scale-free properties (linked to the resilience of networks), where density threshold did not. A brain network with such properties would have advantages in terms of efficiency, rapid adaptive reconfiguration and resilience, features of brain networks that are relevant for plasticity and cognition as well as neurological diseases as stroke and dementia.</content>

		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/628388v1?rss=1"/>
		<id>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/628388v1?rss=1</id>

		<content type="html">
 Rationale: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) remains difficult to treat with no FDA-approved medications to reduce relapse. Antagonism of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) has been demonstrated to decrease cocaine seeking but may also further compromise cognitive function in long-term cocaine users. Objectives: Here we assessed the effect of repeated administration of negative or positive allosteric modulators (NAM or PAM) of mGlu5 on both cognitive performance and (context+cue)-primed cocaine seeking after prolonged abstinence. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 6 days of short-access (1 h/day) and 12 days of long-access (6 h/day) cocaine self-administration. Rats were then trained and tested in a delayed-match-to-sample (DMS) task to establish baseline working memory performance over a five-day block of testing. Next, rats received daily systemic administration of the mGlu5 NAM MTEP (3 mg/kg), mGlu5 PAM CDPPB (30 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to DMS testing during a block of five days, followed by a 5-day washout DMS testing block. Results: MTEP and CDPPB decreased drug seeking in response to cocaine-associated cues after prolonged abstinence. However, repeated treatment with MTEP impaired working memory, while CDPPB had no effects on performance. Conclusions: These results emphasize the relevance of evaluating cognitive function within the context of investigating pharmacotherapies to treat CUD. Further research is needed to determine how two mechanistically different pharmacological compounds can exert the same behavioral effects to reduce cocaine seeking.</content>

 Sensory information is represented and elaborated in hierarchical cortical systems that are thought to be dedicated to individual sensory modalities. This traditional view of sensory cortex organization has been challenged by recent evidence of multimodal responses in primary and association sensory areas. Although it is indisputable that sensory areas respond to multiple modalities, it remains unclear whether these multimodal responses reflect selective information processing for particular stimulus features. Here, we used fMRI adaptation to identify brain regions that are sensitive to the temporal frequency information contained in auditory, tactile, and audiotactile stimulus sequences. A number of brain regions distributed over the parietal and temporal lobes exhibited frequency-selective temporal response modulation for both auditory and tactile stimulus events, as indexed by repetition suppression effects. A smaller set of regions responded to crossmodal adaptation sequences in a frequency-dependent manner. Despite an extensive overlap of multimodal frequency-selective responses across the parietal and temporal lobes, representational similarity analysis revealed a cortical regional landscape that clearly reflected distinct somatosensory and auditory processing systems that converged on modality-invariant areas. These structured relationships between brain regions were also evident in spontaneous signal fluctuation patterns measured at rest. Our results reveal that multimodal processing in human cortex can be feature-specific and that multimodal frequency representations are embedded in the intrinsically hierarchical organization of cortical sensory systems.</content>

 Prefrontal dysfunction is a common feature of brain diseases such as schizophrenia and contributes to deficits in executive functions, including working memory, attention, flexibility, inhibitory control, and timing of behaviors. Currently, few interventions can compensate for impaired prefrontal function. Here, we tested whether stimulating the axons of prefrontal neurons in the striatum could compensate for deficits in temporal processing related to prefrontal dysfunction. We used an interval-timing task that requires working memory for temporal rules and attention to the passage of time. Our previous work showed that inactivation of the medial frontal cortex (MFC) impairs interval timing and attenuates ramping activity, a key form of temporal processing in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). We found that 20-Hz optogenetic stimulation of MFC axon terminals in the DMS shifted response times and improved interval-timing behavior. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of terminals modulated time-related ramping of medium spiny neurons in the striatum. These data suggest that corticostriatal stimulation can compensate for deficits caused by MFC inactivation and they imply that frontostriatal projections are sufficient for controlling responses in time.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: One aspect of selfhood that may have relevance for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is variation in sense of body ownership. We employed the rubber hand illusion (RHI) to manipulate sense of body ownership in BPD. We extended previous research on illusory body ownership in BPD by testing: 1) two illusion conditions: asynchronous &amp;amp; synchronous stimulation, 2) relationship between Illusion experience and core BPD symptoms, and 3) relationship between illusion experience maladaptive personality traits. Methods: Participants (24 BPD, 21 control) underwent RHI procedures. We measured illusion strength (questionnaire responses), proprioceptive drift (perceived shift in physical hand position), BPD symptoms (DIB-R score), and maladaptive personality traits (PID-5). Results: For subjective illusion strength, we found a main effect of group (BPD &amp;gt; HC, F = 11.94 p = 0.001), and condition (synchronous &amp;gt; asynchronous, F(1,43) = 22.80, p &amp;lt; 0.001). There was a group x condition interaction for proprioceptive drift (F(1,43) = 6.48, p = 0.015) such that people with BPD maintained illusion susceptibility in the asynchronous condition. Borderline symptom severity correlated with illusion strength within the BPD group, and this effect was specific to affective symptoms (r = 0.481, p &amp;lt; 0.01). Across all participants, trait psychoticism correlated with illusion strength (r = 0.481, p &amp;lt;0.01). Conclusion: People with BPD are more susceptible to illusory body ownership than are healthy controls. This result is consistent with the robust clinical literature describing aberrant physical and emotional experience of self in BPD. A predictive coding interpretation of these results holds promise to develop testable mechanistic hypotheses for experiences of disrupted bodily self in BPD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Changes in human gait that result from ageing or neurodegenerative diseases are multifactorial. Here we assess the effects of age and Parkinson's disease (PD) on corticospinal control by performing time-frequency analysis of electrophysiological activity recorded during treadmill and overground walking. Electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) were acquired from 22 healthy young, 24 healthy older and 20 adults with PD. Participants walked at their preferred speed, which was matched across both gait conditions. Event-related power, corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were assessed for EEG from bilateral sensorimotor cortices and EMG from the bilateral tibialis anterior muscles during the double support phase of the gait cycle. CMC and EMG power in the low beta band (13-21 Hz) was significantly decreased in older and PD participants compared to young people, but there was no difference between older and PD groups. Older and PD participants spent shorter time in the swing phase than healthy young individuals. These differences in electrophysiological and gait measures in older and PD people indicate age-related changes in corticospinal control. Parallel and transient modulations in power and coherence within the gait cycle suggest that these changes reflect bursts of beta activity that are superimposed on ongoing activity, which may be involved in the temporal coordination of gait. Task-dependent differences in neural control of locomotion are also suggested by the frequency-dependent differences between overground and treadmill walking.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Chronic pain is often associated with changes in brain structure and function, and also cognitive deficits. It has been noted that these chronic pain-related alterations may resemble changes found in healthy aging, and thus may represent accelerated or pre-mature aging of the brain. Here we test the hypothesis that patients with chronic non-cancer pain demonstrate accelerated brain aging compared to healthy control subjects. The predicted brain age of 59 patients with chronic pain (mean chronological age {+/-} standard deviation: 53.0 {+/-} 9.0 years; 43 women) and 60 pain-free healthy controls (52.6 {+/-} 9.0 years; 44 women) was determined using the software brainageR. This software segments the individual T1-weighted structural MR images into gray and white matter and compares gray and white matter images to a large (n = 2001) training set of structural images, using machine learning. Finally, brain age delta, which is the predicted brain age minus chronological age, was calculated and compared across groups. This study provided no evidence for the hypothesis that chronic pain is associated with accelerated brain aging (Welch's t-test, p = 0.74, Cohen's d = 0.061). A Bayesian independent samples t-test indicated moderate evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (BF01 = 4.875, i.e. group means were equal). Our results provide indirect support for recent models of pain related-changes of brain structure, brain function, and cognitive functions. These models postulate network-specific maladaptive plasticity, rather than wide-spread or global neural de- generation, leading to synaptic, dendritic, and neuronal remodeling.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: The Isotropic Fractionator (IF) is a method used to determine the cellular composition of nervous tissue. It has been mostly applied to assess variation across species, where differences are expected to be large enough not to be masked by methodological error. However, understanding the sources of variation in the method is important if the goal is to detect smaller differences, for example, in same-species comparisons. Comparisons between different mice strains suggest that the IF is consistent enough to detected these differences. Nevertheless, the internal validity of the method has not yet been examined directly. Method: In this study, we evaluate the reliability of the IF method for the determination of cellular and neuronal numbers. We performed repeated cell counts of the same material by different experimenters to quantify different sources of variation. Results: In total cell counts, we observed that for the cerebral cortex most of the variance was at the counter level. For the cerebellum, most of the variance is attributed to the sample itself. As for neurons, random error along with the immunological staining correspond to most of the variation, both in the cerebral cortex and in the cerebellum. Test-retest reliability coefficients were relatively high, especially for cell counts. Conclusions: Although biases between counters and random variation in staining could be problematic when aggregating data from different sources, we offer practical suggestions to improve the reliability of the method. While small, this study is a most needed step towards more precise measurement of the brain's cellular composition.</content>

 A large amount of brain imaging research has focused on group studies delineating differences between males and females with respect to both cognitive performance as well as structural and functional brain organization. To supplement existing findings, the present study employed a machine learning approach to assess how accurately participants' sex can be classified based on spatially specific resting state (RS) brain-connectivity, using two samples from the Human Connectome Project (n1 = 434, n2 = 310) and one fully independent sample from the 1000BRAINS study (n=941). The classifier, which was trained on one sample and tested on the other two, was able to reliably classify sex, both within sample and across independent samples, differing both with respect to imaging parameters and sample characteristics. Brain regions displaying highest sex classification accuracies were mainly located along the cingulate cortex, medial and lateral frontal cortex, temporo-parietal regions, insula and precuneus. These areas were stable across samples and match well with previously described sex differences in functional brain organization. While our data show a clear link between sex and regionally specific brain connectivity, they do not support a clear-cut dimorphism in functional brain organization that is driven by sex alone.</content>

 Mosquitoes pose widespread threats to humans and other animals as disease vectors. Day- vs. night-biting mosquitoes occupy distinct time-of-day niches and exhibit very different innate temporal attraction/avoidance behavioral responses to light, yet little is known about their circuit or molecular mechanisms. Day-biting diurnal mosquitoes Aedes aegypti are attracted to light during the day regardless of spectra. In contrast, night-biting nocturnal mosquitoes Anopheles coluzzii avoid short, but not long wavelength light. Attraction/avoidance behavioral responses to light in both species change with time-of-day and show distinct sex and circuit differences. The basis of diurnal versus nocturnal behavior is driven by clock timing, which cycle anti-phase between day-biting versus night-biting mosquito species. Disruption of the circadian molecular clock severely interferes with light-evoked attraction/avoidance behavior in mosquitoes. In summary, attraction/avoidance mosquito behaviors are circadian and light regulated, which may be applied towards species specific control of harmful mosquitoes.</content>

 The choroid plexus (ChP), located in each brain ventricle, produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and forms the blood-CSF barrier, but is under-characterized. Here, we combine single cell RNA-Seq and spatial mapping of RNA and proteins to construct an atlas of each ChP in the developing and adult mouse brain. Each ChP comprises of epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, immune, neuronal, and glial cells, with distinct subtypes, differentiation states and anatomical locations. Epithelial, fibroblast, and macrophage populations had ventricle-specific, regionalized gene expression programs across the developing brain. Key cell types are retained in adult, with loss of developmental signatures and maturation of ventricle-specific regionalization in the epithelial cells. Expression of cognate ligand-receptor pairs across cell subtypes suggests substantial cell-cell interactions within the ChP. Our atlas sheds new light on the development and function of the ChP brain barrier system, and will facilitate future studies on its role in brain development, homeostasis and disease.</content>

 In albinism, the pathological decussation of the temporal retinal afferents at the optic chiasm leads to superimposed representations of opposing hemifields in the visual cortex. Here, we assessed the equivalence of the two representations and the cortico-cortical connectivity of the early visual areas. Applying fMRI-based population receptive field (pRF)-mapping (both hemifield and bilateral mapping) and connective field (CF)-modeling, we investigated the early visual cortex in 6 albinotic participants and 4 controls. In albinism, superimposed retinotopic representations of the contra- and ipsilateral visual hemifield were observed on the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated eye. This was confirmed by the observation of bilateral pRFs during bilateral mapping. Hemifield mapping revealed similar pRF-sizes for both hemifield representations throughout V1 to V3. The typical increase of V1-sampling extent for V3 compared to V2 was not found for the albinotic participants. The similarity of the pRF-sizes for opposing visual hemifield representations highlights the equivalence of the two maps in the early visual cortex. The altered V1-sampling extent in V3 indicates the adaptation of cortico-cortical connections to the abnormal input of the visual cortex. These findings thus suggest that conservative developmental mechanisms are complemented by alterations of the extrastriate cortico-cortical connectivity.</content>

 Substantial genome-wide association study (GWAS) work in Parkinson's disease (PD) has led to an increasing number of loci shown reliably and robustly to be associated with the increased risk of the disease. Prioritising causative genes and pathways from these studies has proven problematic. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of PD GWAS data with expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (eQTL/mQTL) using Colocalisation analysis (Coloc) and transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS) to uncover putative gene expression and splicing mechanisms driving PD GWAS signals. Candidate genes were further characterised by determining cell-type specificity, weighted gene co-expression (WGNCA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Gene-level analysis of expression revealed 5 genes (WDR6, CD38, GPNMB, RAB29, TMEM163) that replicated using both Coloc and TWAS analyses in both GTEx and Braineac expression datasets. A further 6 genes (ZRANB3, PCGF3, NEK1, NUPL2, GALC, CTSB) showed evidence of disease-associated splicing effects. Cell-type specificity analysis revealed that gene expression was overall more prevalent in glial cell-types compared to neurons. The WGNCA analysis showed that NUPL2 is a key gene in 3 modules implicated in catabolic processes related with protein ubiquitination (protein ubiquitination (p=7.47e-10) and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (p = 2.57e-17) in nucleus accumbens, caudate and putamen, while TMEM163 and ZRANB3 were both important in modules indicating regulation of signalling (p=1.33e-65] and cell communication (p=7.55e-35) in the frontal cortex and caudate respectively. PPI analysis and simulations using random networks demonstrated that the candidate genes interact significantly more with known Mendelian PD and parkinsonism proteins than would be expected by chance. The proteins core proteins this network were enriched for regulation of the ERBB receptor tyrosine protein kinase signalling pathways. Together, these results point to a number of candidate genes and pathways that are driving the associations observed in PD GWAS studies.</content>

 Focusing attention on one speaker on the background of other irrelevant speech can be a challenging feat. A longstanding question in attention research is whether and how frequently individuals shift their attention towards task-irrelevant speech, arguably leading to occasional detection of words in a so-called unattended message. However, this has been difficult to gauge empirically, particularly when participants attend to continuous natural speech, due to the lack of appropriate metrics for detecting shifts in internal attention. Here we introduce a new experimental platform for studying the dynamic deployment of attention among concurrent speakers, utilizing a unique combination of Virtual Reality and Eye-Tracking technology. We created a Virtual Cafe in which participants sit across from and attend to the narrative of a target speaker. We manipulate the number and location of distractor speakers, manifest as additional patrons throughout the Virtual Cafe. By monitoring participants eye-gaze dynamics, we studied the patterns of overt shifts of attention among the concurrent speakers as well as the consequences of these shifts on speech comprehension. Our results reveal important individual differences in the gaze-pattern displayed during selective attention to speech. While some participants stayed fixated on a target speaker throughout the entire experiment, approximately 30% of participants frequently shifted their gaze toward distractor speakers or other locations in the environment, regardless of the severity of audiovisual distraction. Critically, the tendency for frequent gaze-shifts negatively impacted comprehension of the target speaker. We also found that gaze-shifts occurred primarily during gaps in the acoustic input, suggesting they are prompted by momentary unmasking of the competing audio, in line with glimpsing theories of processing speech in noise. These results open a new window into understanding the dynamics of attention as they wax and wane over time, and the different listening patterns employed for dealing with the influx of sensory input in multisensory environments. Moreover, the novel approach developed here for tracking the locus of momentary attention in a naturalistic virtual-reality environment holds high promise for extending the study of human behavior and cognition and bridging the gap between the laboratory and real-life.</content>

Immunoglobulin A is a class of antibodies produced by the adaptive immune system and secreted into the gut lumen to fight pathogenic bacteria. We recently demonstrated that the main physical effect of these antibodies is to enchain daughter bacteria, i.e. to cross-link bacteria into clusters as they divide, preventing them from interacting with epithelial cells, thus protecting the host. These links between bacteria may break over time. We study several models using analytical and numerical calculations. We obtain the resulting distribution of chain sizes, that we compare with experimental data. We study the rate of increase in the number of free bacteria as a function of the replication rate of bacteria. Our models show robustly that at higher replication rates, bacteria replicate before the link between daughter bacteria breaks, leading to growing cluster sizes. On the contrary at low growth rates two daughter bacteria have a high probability to break apart. Thus the gut could produce IgA against all the bacteria it has encountered, but the most affected bacteria would be the fast replicating ones, that are more likely to destabilize the microbiota. Linking the effect of the immune effectors (here the clustering) with a property directly relevant to the potential bacterial pathogeneicity (here the replication rate) could avoid to make complex decisions about which bacteria to produce effectors against.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CPWkFKxDiJw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The rectified surface EMG signal is commonly used as an estimator of the neural drive to muscles and therefore to infer sources of synaptic input to motor neurons. Loss of EMG amplitude due to the overlap of motor unit action potentials (amplitude cancellation), however, may distort the spectrum of the rectified EMG and thereby its correlation with the neural drive. In this study, we investigated the impact of amplitude cancelation on this correlation using analytical derivations and a computational model of motor neuron activity, force, and the EMG signal. First, we demonstrated analytically that an ideal rectified EMG signal without amplitude cancellation (EMG&lt;sub&gt;nc&lt;/sub&gt;) is superior to the actual rectified EMG signal as estimator of the neural drive to muscle. This observation was confirmed by the simulations, as the average coefficient of determination (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) between the neural drive in the 1–30 Hz band and EMG&lt;sub&gt;nc&lt;/sub&gt; (0.59±0.08) was matched by the correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive only when the level of amplitude cancellation was low (&amp;lt;40%) at low contraction levels (&amp;lt;5% of maximum voluntary contraction force; MVC). This correlation, however, decreased linearly with amplitude cancellation (r = -0.83) to values of r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt;0.2 at amplitude cancellation levels &amp;gt;60% (contraction levels &amp;gt;15% MVC). Moreover, the simulations showed that a stronger (i.e. more variable) neural drive implied a stronger correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive and that amplitude cancellation distorted this correlation mainly for low-frequency components (&amp;lt;5 Hz) of the neural drive. In conclusion, the results indicate that amplitude cancellation distorts the spectrum of the rectified EMG signal. This implies that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jQRqrSKduuY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genome-scale metabolic models have become a fundamental tool for examining metabolic principles. However, metabolism is not solely characterized by the underlying biochemical reactions and catalyzing enzymes, but also affected by regulatory events. Since the pioneering work of Covert and co-workers as well as Shlomi and co-workers it is debated, how regulation and metabolism synergistically characterize a coherent cellular state. The first approaches started from metabolic models, which were extended by the regulation of the encoding genes of the catalyzing enzymes. By now, bioinformatics databases in principle allow addressing the challenge of integrating regulation and metabolism on a system-wide level. Collecting information from several databases we provide a network representation of the integrated gene regulatory and metabolic system for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, including major cellular processes, from metabolic processes via protein modification to a variety of regulatory events. Besides transcriptional regulation, we also take into account regulation of translation, enzyme activities and reactions. Our network model provides novel topological characterizations of system components based on their positions in the network. We show that network characteristics suggest a representation of the integrated system as three network domains (regulatory, metabolic and interface networks) instead of two. This new three-domain representation reveals the structural centrality of components with known high functional relevance. This integrated network can serve as a platform for understanding coherent cellular states as active subnetworks and to elucidate crossover effects between metabolism and gene regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aPbvpghPPY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In order to record the stream of autobiographical information that defines our unique personal history, our brains must form durable memories from single brief exposures to the patterned stimuli that impinge on them continuously throughout life. However, little is known about the computational strategies or neural mechanisms that underlie the brain's ability to perform this type of &quot;online&quot; learning. Based on increasing evidence that dendrites act as both signaling and learning units in the brain, we developed an analytical model that relates online recognition memory capacity to roughly a dozen dendritic, network, pattern, and task-related parameters. We used the model to determine what dendrite size maximizes storage capacity under varying assumptions about pattern density and noise level. We show that over a several-fold range of both of these parameters, and over multiple orders-of-magnitude of memory size, capacity is maximized when dendrites contain a few hundred synapses—roughly the natural number found in memory-related areas of the brain. Thus, in comparison to entire neurons, dendrites increase storage capacity by providing a larger number of better-sized learning units. Our model provides the first normative theory that explains how dendrites increase the brain’s capacity for online learning; predicts which combinations of parameter settings we should expect to find in the brain under normal operating conditions; leads to novel interpretations of an array of existing experimental results; and provides a tool for understanding which changes associated with neurological disorders, aging, or stress are most likely to produce memory deficits—knowledge that could eventually help in the design of improved clinical treatments for memory loss.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x35HjJZIH_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Midbrain dopamine seems to play an outsized role in motivated behavior and learning. Widely associated with mediating reward-related behavior, decision making, and learning, dopamine continues to generate controversies in the field. While many studies and theories focus on what dopamine cells encode, the question of how the midbrain derives the information it encodes is poorly understood and comparatively less addressed. Recent anatomical studies suggest greater diversity and complexity of afferent inputs than previously appreciated, requiring rethinking of prior models. Here, we elaborate a hypothesis that construes midbrain dopamine as implementing a Bayesian selector in which individual dopamine cells sample afferent activity across distributed brain substrates, comprising evidence to be evaluated on the extent to which stimuli in the on-going sensorimotor stream organizes distributed, parallel processing, reflecting implicit value. To effectively generate a temporally resolved phasic signal, a population of dopamine cells must exhibit synchronous activity. We argue that synchronous activity across a population of dopamine cells signals consensus across distributed afferent substrates, invigorating responding to recognized opportunities and facilitating further learning. In framing our hypothesis, we shift from the question of how value is computed to the broader question of how the brain achieves coordination across distributed, parallel processing. We posit the midbrain is part of an &quot;axis of agency&quot; in which the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basal ganglia (BGS), and midbrain form an axis mediating control, coordination, and consensus, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful markers of neuronal activation and essential components of neuronal response. While studies of gastropods have provided many insights into the basic learning and memory mechanisms, the genome-wide assessment of IEGs has been mainly restricted to vertebrates. In this study we identified IEGs in the terrestrial snail &lt;i&gt;Helix lucorum&lt;/i&gt;. In the absence of the genome, we conducted &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome assembly using reads with short and intermediate lengths cumulatively covering more than 98 billion nucleotides. Based on this assembly, we identified 37 proteins corresponding to contigs differentially expressed in either the parietal ganglia or two giant interneurons located within the parietal ganglia of the snail in response to the neuronal stimulation. These proteins included homologues of well-known mammalian IEGs, such as &lt;i&gt;c-jun/jund&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C/EBP&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-fos/fosl2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Egr1&lt;/i&gt;, as well as homologues of genes not yet implicated in the neuronal response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Gastropods, which include snails and slugs, are widely used in studies of basic neuronal activity mechanisms. The first step of the transcriptional response to neuronal stimulation requires the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs). The identification of IEGs is important for the understanding of neuronal response mechanisms and for the visualization of activated neurons. However, genome-wide studies of IEGs have thus far been mainly restricted to vertebrates. Furthermore, a study of activity-regulated genes, a gene group that includes IEGs, conducted in fruit flies did not reveal a clear overlap with vertebrate IEGs. In this study we present a transcriptome-wide study of snail IEGs, which reveals multiple homologues of well-known mammalian IEGs, as well as a number of novel IEG candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X‐linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by a single mutation: SINE‐VNTR‐Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion in &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt;. Recently, a (CCCTCT)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; repeat within the SVA insertion has been reported as an age‐at‐onset (AAO) modifier in XDP. Here we investigate the role of this hexanucleotide repeat in modifying expressivity of XDP.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We genotyped the hexanucleotide repeat in 355 XDP patients and correlated the repeat number (RN) with AAO (n = 295), initial clinical manifestation (n = 294), site of dystonia onset (n = 238), disease severity (n = 28), and cognitive function (n = 15). Furthermore, we investigated i) repeat instability by segregation analysis and Southern blotting using postmortem brain samples from two affected individuals and ii) relative &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; expression in blood RNA from 31 XDP patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RN showed significant inverse correlations with AAO and with &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; expression and a positive correlation with disease severity and cognitive dysfunction. Importantly, AAO (and not RN) was directly associated with whether dystonia or parkinsonism will manifest at onset. RN was lower in patients affected by mouth/tongue dystonia compared with blepharospasm. RN was unstable across germline transmissions with an overall tendency to increase in length and exhibited somatic mosaicism in brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hexanucleotide repeat within the SVA insertion acts as a genetic modifier of disease expressivity in XDP. RN‐dependent &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; repression and subsequent differences in &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels in patients may be potentiated in the brain through somatic variability leading to the neurological phenotype.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;JBTS17&lt;/i&gt; is a major gene mutated in ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome and oral–facial–digital syndrome type VI. Most patients with loss of function mutations in &lt;i&gt;JBTS17&lt;/i&gt; exhibit cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and brainstem malformation. However, some patients with &lt;i&gt;JBTS17&lt;/i&gt; mutations show microcephaly and abnormal gyration. We examined potential roles of JBTS17 in neurogenesis to understand the pathological mechanism of JBTS17‐related cortical abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined subcellular localization and cell‐cycle–dependent expression of JBTS17 proteins using anti‐JBTS17 antibodies and JBTS17 expression vectors. We also performed knockdown experiments to determined roles of JBTS17 in human cells, and demonstrated mitotic functions of JBTS17 using immunostaining and live imaging. We examined the involvement of JBTS17 in cortical neurogenesis using a mouse in utero electroporation technique.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that JBTS17 localizes to the kinetochore and the level of JBTS17 is regulated by cell‐cycle–dependent proteolysis. Depletion of JBTS17 disrupts chromosome alignment and spindle pole orientation, resulting in mitotic delay. JBTS17 interacts with LIS1 and influences LIS1 localization. Depletion of Jbts17 in the developing mouse cortex interferes with the mitotic progression of neural progenitors and the migration of postmitotic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIS1 is implicated in lissencephaly, but altered dosage of LIS1 has been also associated with microcephaly syndromes. Our results suggest that JBTS17 contributes to mitotic progression by interacting with LIS1, and abnormal mitosis is an underlying mechanism of the microcephaly phenotype in JBTS17‐related ciliopathies. We propose that understanding extraciliary roles of ciliopathy proteins is important to elucidate pathological mechanisms underlying diverse ciliopathy phenotypes. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) causes severe distress and is therefore counted by the WHO as one of the ten most impairing illnesses. There is evidence for a strong genetic under-pinning especially in early onset OCD. Though several genes involved in neurotransmission have been reported as candidates there is still need to identify new pathways. In this study, we focussed on genetic variants of the Neuropetide Y (NPY) system. NPY is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the human brain with emerging evidence of capacity to modulate stress response, which is of high relevance in OCD. We focussed on tag-SNPs of NPY and its receptor gene NPY1R in a family-based approach. The sample comprised 86 patients (children and adolescents) with early onset OCD with both their biological parents. However, this first study on genetic variants of the NPY-system could not confirm association between the investi-gated SNPs and early onset OCD.</content>

In the last several decades, significant progress has been made in understanding basic biology, molecular mechanisms, and development of biomarkers and therapeutic drugs. Multiple cellular changes are implicated in the disease process including amyloid beta and phosphorylation of tau synaptic damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. Among these, amyloid beta is considered a major player in the disease process. Recent advancements in molecular biology revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered potential biomarkers in AD with a focus on amyloid beta.  In this article we discussed several aspects of AD including its prevalence, classifications, risk factors, and amyloid species &amp;amp; their accumulation in subcellular compartments. This article also discusses the discovery and biogenesis of miRNAs and their relevance to AD. Today’s research continues to add to the wealth of miRNA data that has been accumulated, however, there still lacks clear-cut understanding of the physiological relevance of miRNAs to AD. MiRNAs appear to regulate translation of gene products in AD and other human diseases. However, the mechanism of how many of these miRNAs regulate both the 5’ and 3’UTR of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing is still being extrapolated. Hence, we still need more research on miRNAs and APP/amyloid beta formation in the progression and pathogenesis of AD.</content>

 Background: Hippocampal dysconnectivity has been detected in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. Neuroanatomical evidence has indicated distinct sub-regions in the hippocampus, but which sub-regions within the hippocampus may emerge dysfunction in the brain network, and the relationship between connection strength and the severity of this debilitating disease have yet to be revealed. Masked independent component analysis (mICA), i.e., ICA restricted to a defined region of interest, can provide insight into observing local functional connectivity in a particular brain region. We aim to map out the sub-regions in the hippocampus with dysconnectivity linked to auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Methods: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study of schizophrenia patients with (n = 57) and without (n = 83) auditory verbal hallucinations, and 71 healthy controls, we first examined hippocampal connectivity using mICA, and then the correlation between connection metric and clinical severity was generated. Results: As compared with patients without auditory verbal hallucinations, mICA showed a group of hyper-connections for the left middle part, as well as another group of hypo-connections for the bilateral antero-lateral and right antero-medial parts in patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. Connectivity was linked to the clinical symptoms scores in the sample of patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the left middle part is more densely connected, but the bilateral antero-lateral and right antero-medial parts are more sparsely connected in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. The findings in the present study show proof of precious location in the hippocampus mediating the neural mechanism behind auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.</content>

 Fusing complementary information from different modalities can lead to the discovery of more accurate diagnostic biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. However, biomarker discovery through data fusion is challenging since it requires extracting interpretable and reproducible patterns from data sets, consisting of shared/unshared patterns and of different orders. For example, multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals from multiple subjects can be represented as a third-order tensor with modes: subject, time, and channel, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data may be in the form of subject by voxel matrices. Traditional data fusion methods rearrange higher-order tensors, such as EEG, as matrices to use matrix factorization-based approaches. In contrast, fusion methods based on coupled matrix and tensor factorizations (CMTF) exploit the potential multi-way structure of higher-order tensors. The CMTF approach has been shown to capture underlying patterns more accurately without imposing strong constraints on the latent neural patterns, i.e., biomarkers. In this paper, EEG, fMRI and structural MRI (sMRI) data collected during an auditory oddball task (AOD) from a group of subjects consisting of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, are arranged as matrices and higher-order tensors coupled along the subject mode, and jointly analyzed using structure-revealing CMTF methods (also known as advanced CMTF (ACMTF)) focusing on unique identification of underlying patterns in the presence of shared/unshared patterns. We demonstrate that joint analysis of the EEG tensor and fMRI matrix using ACMTF reveals significant and biologically meaningful components in terms of differentiating between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls while also providing spatial patterns with high resolution and improving the clustering performance compared to the analysis of only the EEG tensor. We also show that these patterns are reproducible, and study reproducibility for different model parameters. In comparison to the joint independent component analysis (jICA) data fusion approach, ACMTF provides easier interpretation of EEG data by revealing a single summary map of the topography for each component. Furthermore, fusion of sMRI data with EEG and fMRI through an ACMTF model provides structural patterns; however, we also show that when fusing data sets from multiple modalities, hence of very different nature, preprocessing plays a crucial role.</content>

		<content type="html">
 There have always been practical demands for objective and accurate assessment of muscle spasticity beyond its clinical routine. A novel regression-based framework for quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity is proposed in this paper using wearable surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial sensors combined with a simple examination procedure. Sixteen subjects with elbow flexor or extensor (i.e., biceps brachii muscle or triceps brachii muscle) spasticity and eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study. The sEMG and inertial data were recorded from each subject when a series of passive elbow stretches with different stretch velocities were conducted. In the proposed framework, both lambda model and kinematic model were constructed from the recorded data, and biomarkers were extracted respectively from the two models to describe the neurogenic component and biomechanical component of the muscle spasticity, respectively. Subsequently, three evaluation methods using supervised machine learning algorithms including single-/multi-variable linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied to calibrate biomarkers from each single model or combination of two models into evaluation scores. Each of these evaluation scores can be regarded as a prediction of the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) grades for spasticity assessment with the same meaning and clinical interpretation. In order to validate performance of three proposed methods within the framework, a 24-fold leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for each of all subjects. Both methods with each individual model achieved satisfactory performance, with low mean square error (MSE, 0.14 and 0.47) between the resultant evaluation score and the MAS. By contrast, the method using SVR to fuse biomarkers from both models outperformed other two methods with the lowest MSE at 0.059. The experimental results demonstrated the usability and feasibility of the proposed framework, and it provides an objective, quantitative and convenient solution to spasticity assessment, suitable for clinical, community and home-based rehabilitation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background The functional aspects of mast cell-microglia interactions are important in neuroinflammation. We have previously found that mast cell degranulation could directly induce microglia activation. However, the role of mast cell in LPS-induced microglia activation, neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment has not been clarified. Methods We studied brain microglia and mast cells interaction by site-directed injection of cromolyn in rat right hypothalamus using stereotaxic techniques. TFC and Y maze were used to assess cognitive function. Mast cells were stained by toluidine blue and calculated with Cell D software. Microglia activation was assessed by Iba1 immunohistochemistry. Conditioned medium from activated P815 cells induces microglial activation. The levels of cytokines were measured with Milliplex kit. Cell signalling was analysed by Western blotting. Results We find that “Mast cell stabilizer” cromolyn can ameliorate LPS-induced mast cells degranulation and cognitive dysfunction, and stabilization of mast cell is able to inhibit LPS-induced microglia activation, inflammatory factors release and MAPK, AKT and NF-κB signaling pathway activation in vivo and in vitro. Further LPS IP injection for 24 h induces significant microglia activation in the hypothalamus of the WT mice but has little effect on the microglia activation in KitW-sh/W-sh mice. We also find that LPS selectively provokes upregulation of expressions of H1R, H4R, PAR2, and TLR4, but deregulation of H2R and H3R expressions in the ipsilateral hypothalamus microglia, which was partially inhibits by cromolyn. Conclusions Taken together, our study provides evidence that stabilization of mast cells can inhibit LPS-induced neuroinflammation and memory impairment. Investigating the role of mast cell activation in neuroinflammation is an emerging new area to understand and effectively treat neuroinflammation-related diseases.</content>

 Objective: As a high-level nerve center that regulates visceral and endocrine activity, the hypothalamus plays an important role in regulating the body’s stress response. Previous studies have shown that stress can cause damage to hypothalamic neurons. The present study aimed to further clarify the mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress involvement in hypothalamic neuronal injury. Methods: A 7-day stressed rat model was established with daily restraining for 8 h and forced ice-water swimming for 5 min. The rats were randomly divided into control, stress, stress + GSK2606414 (PERK phosphorylation inhibitor), stress + KIRA6 (IRE1 phosphokinase activity inhibitor), GSK2606414 and KIRA6 groups. The pathological changes of hypothalamic neurons were observed by thionine staining. Expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins GRP78, ATF4, ASK1, JNK and CHOP in the hypothalamic neurons were observed by immunohistochemical staining. The expression of JNK and CHOP mRNA in the hypothalamic neurons were observed by RNA in situ hybridization (RNA Scope), and the expression of related proteins and mRNA was semiquantitatively analyzed by microscopy-based multicolor tissue cytometry (MMTC). Results: Thionine staining revealed that stress exposure resulted in edema, a lack of Nissl bodies, and pyknosis in hypothalamic neurons. Immunohistochemistry and RNA Scope showed that stress exposure significantly increased the expression of GRP78, ATF4, ASK1, CHOP, JNK, JNK mRNA and CHOP mRNA. Treatment with PERK and IRE1 inhibitors attenuated pathological damage and downregulated the expression of ATF4, ASK1, JNK, CHOP, JNK mRNA and CHOP mRNA. Conclusion: Stress caused pathological changes in rat hypothalamic neurons. Endoplasmic reticulum stress PERK-ATF4-CHOP and IRE1-ASK1-JNK pathways were involved in the injury process.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Obesity and cognitive decline can occur in association. Brain dysmetabolism and insulin resistance might be common underlying traits. We aimed to examine the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on cognitive decline, and of cognitive impairment on food intake and body-weight, and explore efficacy of chronic intranasal insulin (INI) therapy. We used control (C) and triple transgenic mice (3xTg, a model of Alzheimers’ pathology) to measure cerebral mass, glucose metabolism, and the metabolic response to acute intranasal insulin administration (cerebral insulin sensitivity). Y-Maze, positron emission-computed tomography, and histology were employed in 8 and 14-month-old mice, receiving normal diet (ND) or HFD. Chronic INI therapy was tested in an additional 3xTg-HFD group. The 3xTg groups overate, and had lower body-weight, but similar BMI, than diet-matched controls. Cognitive decline was progressive from HFD to 3xTg-ND to 3xTg-HFD. At 8 months, brain fasting glucose uptake was increased by C-HFD, and this effect was blunted in 3xTg-HFD mice, also showing brain insulin resistance. Brain mass was reduced in 3xTg mice at 14 months. Dentate gyrus dimensions paralleled cognitive findings. Chronic INI preserved cognition, dentate gyrus and metabolism, reducing food intake and body weight in 3xTg-HFD mice. Peripherally, leptin was suppressed and PAI-1 elevated in 3xTg mice, correlating inversely with cerebral glucose uptake. In conclusion, 3xTg background and HFD exert additive (genes*lifestyle) detriment to the brain, and cognitive dysfunction is accompanied by increased food intake in 3xTg mice. PAI-1 levels and leptin deficiency were identified as potential peripheral contributors. Chronic INI improved peripheral and central outcomes.</content>

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by intracellular tau aggregates and extracellular deposition of amyloid-ß (Aß). The major genetic risk factor to develop AD is the Apolipoprotein E isoform 4 (ApoE4). ApoE4 may directly affect Aß pathology, yet the exact role of ApoE4 in the progression of AD remains unclear. Although astrocytes are the main source of ApoE in brain tissue, other cell types might contribute to ApoE isotype-dependent effects. While ApoE expression does not play a relevant role in homeostatic microglia, we and others could recently show that ApoE expression is significant upregulated in disease-associated microglia including AD-mouse models and human AD. ApoE has been supposed to have an anti-inflammatory effect, with ApoE4 being less effective than ApoE3. However, ApoE-isotype specific effects on microglia function in disease have not been thoroughly investigated to date. In contrast to this, the role of ApoE2, the third most common major ApoE isoform, in neurodegeneration has not been characterized in detail, but it has been shown to delay the onset of disease in familial AD. To elucidate the differential roles of the three-major human ApoE isoforms on microglia function we each expressed the human ApoE isoforms in murine N9 microglia cells. We could show that ApoE4 specifically influences actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and morphology. In migration assays, ApoE4 significantly promotes cell motility. To quantify phagocytosis by microglia we established an uptake assay based on imaging flow cytometry. Although expression of ApoE4 led to significantly reduced uptake of Aß in contrast to the other isoforms, we could show that ApoE4 specifically increased phagocytosis of apoptotic neuronal cells. Our findings show that ApoE4 intrinsically affects microglia physiology by upregulating motility and phagocytic behavior in vitro and may therefore specifically contribute to microglia dysregulation in AD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The inner ear is a complex organ containing highly specialised cell types and structures that are critical for sensing sound and movement. In vivo, the inner ear is difficult to study due to the osseous nature of the otic capsule and its encapsulation within an intricate bony labyrinth. As such, mammalian inner ear explants are an invaluable tool for the study and manipulation of the complex intercellular connections, structures, and cell types within this specialised organ. The greatest strength of this technique is that the complete organ of Corti, or peripheral vestibular organs including hair cells, supporting cells and accompanying neurons, is maintained in its in situ form. The greatest weakness of in vitro hair cell preparations is the short time frame in which the explanted tissue remains viable. Yet, cochlear explants have proven to be an excellent experimental model for understanding the fundamental aspects of auditory biology, substantiated by their use for over 40 years. In this protocol, we present a modernised inner ear explant technique that employs organotypic cell culture inserts and serum free media. This approach decreases the likelihood of explant damage by eliminating the need for adhesive substances. Serum free media also restricts excessive cellular outgrowth and inter-experimental variability, both of which are side effects of exogenous serum addition to cell cultures. The protocol described can be applied to culture both cochlear and vestibular explants from various mammals. Example outcomes are demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, hair cell quantification, and electrophysiological recordings to validate the versatility and viability of the protocol.</content>

 Serotonin receptors are potential neuroprotective agents in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). The protective effects of serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) agonists on the survival and function of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by regulating the release of the presynaptic neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were confirmed in our previous study of a chronic glaucoma rat model. However, the roles of excitatory amino acids and their interactions with the 5-HT1A receptor in glaucoma remain unknown. Here, we found that ocular hypertension increased glutamine synthetase (GS) and excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) expression in rat retinas. In addition, the high expression of GS and EAAT2 induced by glaucoma was downregulated by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635, respectively. Patch-clamp techniques were used to record glutamate receptor-mediated spontaneous and miniature glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and mEPSCs) as well as L-glutamate-induced current in OFF-type and ON-type RGCs in rat retinal slices. Although there were no significant differences in the frequency and amplitude of sEPSC and mEPSC release between normal and glaucoma OFF- and ON-type RGCs, exogenous 8-OH-DPAT administration specifically reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude, of sEPSC and mEPSC release in glaucoma OFF-type rather than ON-type RGCs; these effects were completely blocked by WAY-100635. In summary, 8-OH-DPAT decreases and increases GS and EAAT2 expression, respectively, while decreasing mEPSC frequency. In contrast, WAY-100635 increases and decreases GS and EAAT2 expression, respectively, while increasing sEPSC and mEPSC frequency. The reduction of glutamatergic presynaptic transmission by 8-OH-DPAT deactivates RGCs at the neural network level and reduces the excitotoxic damage in the pathological process of chronic glaucoma.</content>

 Neurotransmitter release is initiated by the influx of Ca2+ via voltage-gated calcium channels. The accessory β-subunit (CaVβ) of these channels shapes synaptic transmission by associating with the pore-forming subunit (CaVα1) and up-regulating presynaptic calcium currents. Besides CaVα1, CaVβ interacts with several partners including actin filaments (F-actin). These filaments are known to associate with synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic terminals and support their translocation within different pools, but the role of CaVβ/F-actin association on synaptic transmission has not yet been explored. We here study how CaVβ4, the major calcium channel β isoform in mamalian brain, modifies synaptic transmission in concert with F-actin in cultured hippocampal neurons. We analysed the effect of exogenous CaVβ4 before and after pharmacological disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and dissected calcium channel-dependent and -independent functions by comparing the effects of the wild-type subunit with the one bearing a double mutation that impairs binding to CaVα1. We found that exogenously expressed wild-type CaVβ4 enhances spontaneous and depolarization-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents without altering synaptogenesis. CaVβ4 increases the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles at resting conditions and accelerates their recovery after depletion. The enhanced neurotransmitter release induced by CaVβ4 is abolished upon disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. The CaVα1 association-deficient CaVβ4 mutant associates with actin filaments, but neither alters postsynaptic responses nor the time course of the RRP recovery.  Furthermore, this mutant protein preserves the ability to increase the RRP size. These results indicate that the interplay between CaVβ4 and F-actin also support recruitment of synaptic vesicles to the RRP in a CaVα1-independent manner. Our studies show an  emerging role of CaVβ in determining synaptic vesicle maturation toward the priming state and its replenishment after release. We envision that this subunit plays a role in coupling exocytosis to endocytosis during the vesicle cycle.</content>

 Subplate (SP) neurons are among the earliest-born neurons in the cerebral cortex and heterogeneous in terms of gene expression. SP neurons consist mainly of projection neurons, which begin to extend their axons to specific target areas very early during development. However, the relationships between axon projection and gene expression patterns of the SP neurons, and their remnant layer 6b (L6b) neurons, are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the corticocortical projections of L6b/SP neurons in the mouse cortex and searched for a marker gene expressed in L6b/SP neurons that have ipsilateral inter-areal projections. Retrograde tracing experiments demonstrated that L6b/SP neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) projected to the primary motor cortex (M1) within the same cortical hemisphere at postnatal day (PD) 2 but did not show any callosal projection. This unilateral projection pattern persisted into adulthood. Our microarray analysis identified the gene encoding a β subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel (Kcnab1) as being expressed in L6b/SP. Double labeling with retrograde tracing and in situ hybridization demonstrated that Kcnab1 was expressed in the unilaterally-projecting neurons in L6b/SP. Embryonic expression was specifically detected in the SP as early as embryonic day (E) 14.5, shortly after the emergence of subplate. Double immunostaining experiments revealed different degrees of co-expression of the protein product Kvβ1 with L6b/SP markers Ctgf (88%), Cplx3 (79%), and Nurr1 (58%), suggesting molecular subdivision of unilaterally-projecting L6b/SP neurons. In addition to expression in L6b/SP, scattered expression of Kcnab1 was observed during postnatal stages without layer specificity. Among splicing variants with three alternative first exons, the variant 1.1 explained all the cortical expression mentioned in this study. Together, our data suggest that L6b/SP neurons have corticocortical projections and Kcnab1 expression defines a subpopulation of L6b/SP neurons with a unilateral inter-areal projection.</content>

 We investigated whether P300-ERP and cognitive test performance differ for age, sex and education in two groups of healthy elderly, and verified whether any correlations exist between P300 amplitude and latency and grey matter volume using whole brain voxel-by-voxel-based mapping, controlling for age, education, sex and Total Intracranial Volume (TIV). We used 32 channel electroencephalograms (EEG) to record the P300 responses and 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine grey matter volume. We recruited 36 native-Dutch speaking healthy older subjects, equally divided in two sub-groups of 52-64 and 65-76 years old, administered a battery of cognitive tests and recorded their demographics, EEGs and task performance; additionally, 16 adults from the second sub-group underwent an MRI scan. We found significant differences between age groups in their cognitive tests performance, P300 amplitudes for the frontal and parietal electrodes for the most difficult task, and P300 latencies for frontal, central and parietal electrodes for all three tasks difficulty levels. Interesting, sex and education affected cognitive and P300 results. Higher education was related to higher accuracy, and P300 amplitudes and shorter latencies. Moreover, females exhibited higher P300 amplitudes and shorter latencies, and better cognitive tasks performance compared to males. Additionally, for the 16 adults underwent to MRI scan, we found positive correlations between P300 characteristics in frontal, central and parietal areas and grey matter volume, controlling for demographic variables and TIV, but also showing that age, sex and education correlate with grey matter volume. These findings provide support that age, sex and education affect an individual’s cognitive, neurophysiological and structural characteristics, and therefore motivate the need to further investigate these in relation to P300 responses and grey matter volume in healthy elderly.</content>

 Control of cell size requires molecular size sensors that are coupled to the cell cycle. Rod-shaped fission yeast cells divide at a threshold size partly due to Cdr2 kinase, which forms nodes at the medial cell cortex where it inhibits the Cdk1-inhibitor Wee1. Pom1 kinase phosphorylates and inhibits Cdr2, and forms cortical concentration gradients from cell poles. Pom1 inhibits Cdr2 signaling to Wee1 specifically in small cells, but the time and place of their regulatory interactions were unclear. We show that Pom1 forms stable oligomeric clusters that dynamically sample the cell cortex. Binding frequency is patterned into a concentration gradient by the polarity landmarks Tea1 and Tea4. Pom1 clusters colocalize with Cdr2 nodes, forming a glucose-modulated inhibitory threshold against node activation. Our work reveals how Pom1-Cdr2-Wee1 operates in multiprotein clusters at the cortex to promote mitotic entry at a cell size that can be modified by nutrient availability.</content>

 Protein concentration gradients pattern developing organisms and single cells. In &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe &lt;/i&gt;rod-shaped cells, Pom1 kinase forms gradients with maxima at cell poles. Pom1 controls the timing of mitotic entry by inhibiting Cdr2, which forms stable membrane-associated nodes at mid-cell. Pom1 gradients rely on membrane association regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle and lateral diffusion modulated by clustering. Using quantitative PALM imaging, we find individual Pom1 molecules bind the membrane too transiently to diffuse from pole to mid-cell. Instead we propose they exchange within longer-lived clusters forming the functional gradient unit. An allelic series blocking auto-phosphorylation shows multi-phosphorylation shapes and buffers the gradient to control mid-cell levels, which represent the critical Cdr2-regulating pool. TIRF imaging of this cortical pool demonstrates more Pom1 overlaps with Cdr2 in short than long cells, consistent with Pom1 inhibition of Cdr2 decreasing with cell growth. Thus, the gradients modulate Pom1 mid-cell levels according to cell size.</content>

 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-stimulated translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;α (cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;α) to the Golgi induces arachidonic acid production, the rate-limiting step in pro-inflammatory eicosanoid synthesis. Structural insights into the cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;α preference for phosphatidylcholine (PC)-enriched membranes have remained elusive. Here, we report cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;α C2-domain structure (2.2Å resolution) containing bound 1,2-dihexanoyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Two Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+ &lt;/sup&gt;are complexed at locations previously reported for lipid-free C2-domain. One of these Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+ &lt;/sup&gt;along with a third Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; bridge the C2-domain to the DHPC phosphate group, which also interacts with Asn65. Tyr96 plays a key role in lipid headgroup recognition via cation-π interaction with the PC trimethylammonium group. Mutagenesis analyses confirm Tyr96 and Asn65 function in PC binding selectivity by C2-domain and regulation of cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;α&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;activity. The differing DHPC-binding mode of cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;α C2-domain, compared to phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding by other C2-domains, expands and deepens knowledge of lipid-binding mechanisms mediated by C2-domains.</content>

		<content type="html">
 PAX8 is a prototype lineage-survival oncogene in epithelial ovarian cancer. However, neither its underlying pro-tumorigenic mechanisms nor potential therapeutic implications have been adequately elucidated. Here, we identified an ovarian lineage-specific PAX8 regulon using modified cancer outlier profile analysis, in which PAX8-FGF18 axis was responsible for promoting cell migration in an autocrine fashion. An image-based drug screen pinpointed that PAX8 expression was potently inhibited by small-molecules against histone deacetylases (HDACs). Mechanistically, HDAC blockade altered histone H3K27 acetylation occupancies and perturbed the super-enhancer topology associated with PAX8 gene locus, resulting in epigenetic downregulation of PAX8 transcripts and related targets. HDAC antagonists efficaciously suppressed ovarian tumor growth and spreading as single agents, and exerted synergistic effects in combination with standard chemotherapy. These findings provide mechanistic and therapeutic insights for PAX8-addicted ovarian cancer. More generally, our analytic and experimental approach represents an expandible paradigm for identifying and targeting lineage-survival oncogenes in diverse human malignancies.</content>

 Reduced protein homeostasis leading to increased protein instability is a common molecular feature of aging, but it remains unclear whether this is a cause or consequence of the aging process. In neurodegenerative diseases and other amyloidoses, specific proteins self-assemble into amyloid fibrils and accumulate as pathological aggregates in different tissues. More recently, widespread protein aggregation has been described during normal aging. Until now, an extensive characterization of the nature of age-dependent protein aggregation has been lacking. Here, we show that age-dependent aggregates are rapidly formed by newly synthesized proteins and have an amyloid-like structure resembling that of protein aggregates observed in disease. We then demonstrate that age-dependent protein aggregation accelerates the functional decline of different tissues in&lt;i&gt; C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Together, these findings imply that amyloid-like aggregates contribute to the aging process and therefore could be important targets for strategies designed to maintain physiological functions in the late stages of life.</content>

 During development cells become restricted in their differentiation potential by repressing alternative cell fates, and the Polycomb complex plays a crucial role in this process. However, how alternative fate genes are lineage-specifically silenced is unclear. We studied Ultrabithorax, a multi-lineage transcription factor of the Hox class, in two tissue lineages using sorted nuclei and interfered with Ubx in mesodermal cells. We find that depletion of Ubx leads to the de-repression of genes normally expressed in other lineages. Ubx silences expression of alternative fate genes by retaining the Polycomb Group protein Pleiohomeotic at Ubx targeted genomic regions, thereby stabilizing repressive chromatin marks in a lineage-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates that Ubx stabilizes lineage choice by suppressing the multipotency encoded in the genome via its interaction with Pho. This mechanism may explain why the Hox code is maintained throughout the lifecycle, since it could set a block to transdifferentiation in adult cells.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The rate and temporal pattern of neural spiking each have the potential to influence computation. In the cerebellum, it has been hypothesized that the irregularity of interspike intervals in Purkinje cells affects their ability to transmit information to downstream neurons. Accordingly, during oculomotor behavior in mice and rhesus monkeys, mean irregularity of Purkinje cell spiking varied with mean eye velocity. However, moment-to-moment variations revealed a tight correlation between eye velocity and spike rate, with no additional information conveyed by spike irregularity. Moreover, when spike rate and irregularity were independently controlled using optogenetic stimulation, the eye movements elicited were well-described by a linear population rate code with 3–5 ms temporal precision. Biophysical and random-walk models identified biologically realistic parameter ranges that determine whether spike irregularity influences responses downstream. The results demonstrate cerebellar control of movements through a remarkably rapid rate code, with no evidence for an additional contribution of spike irregularity.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Semaphorins (SEMAs) and their Plexin (PLXN) receptors are central regulators of metazoan cellular communication. SEMA-PLXND1 signaling plays important roles in cardiovascular, nervous, and immune system development, and cancer biology. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that modulate SEMA-PLXND1 signaling. As PLXND1 associates with GIPC family endocytic adaptors, we evaluated the requirement for the molecular determinants of their association and PLXND1’s vascular role. Zebrafish that endogenously express a Plxnd1 receptor with a predicted impairment in GIPC binding exhibit low penetrance angiogenesis deficits and antiangiogenic drug hypersensitivity. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;gipc&lt;/i&gt; mutant fish show angiogenic impairments that are ameliorated by reducing Plxnd1 signaling. Finally, &lt;i&gt;GIPC&lt;/i&gt; depletion potentiates SEMA-PLXND1 signaling in cultured endothelial cells. These findings expand the vascular roles of GIPCs beyond those of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-dependent, proangiogenic GIPC1-Neuropilin 1 complex, recasting GIPCs as negative modulators of antiangiogenic PLXND1 signaling and suggest that PLXND1 trafficking shapes vascular development.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GABA signaling sustains fundamental brain functions, from nervous system development to the synchronization of population activity and synaptic plasticity. Despite these pivotal features, molecular determinants underscoring the rapid and cell-autonomous replenishment of the vesicular neurotransmitter GABA and its impact on synaptic plasticity remain elusive. Here, we show that genetic disruption of the glutamine transporter Slc38a1 in mice hampers GABA synthesis, modifies synaptic vesicle morphology in GABAergic presynapses and impairs critical period plasticity. We demonstrate that Slc38a1-mediated glutamine transport regulates vesicular GABA content, induces high-frequency membrane oscillations and shapes cortical processing and plasticity. Taken together, this work shows that Slc38a1 is not merely a transporter accumulating glutamine for metabolic purposes, but a key component regulating several neuronal functions.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused “visual” cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

The axon plasma membrane consists of the membrane skeleton, which comprises ring-like actin filaments connected to each other by spectrin tetramers, and the lipid bilayer, which is tethered to the skeleton via, at least, ankyrin. Currently it is unknown whether this unique axon plasma membrane skeleton (APMS) sets the diffusion rules of lipids and proteins in the axon. To answer this question, we developed a coarse-grain molecular dynamics model for the axon that includes the APMS, the phospholipid bilayer, transmembrane proteins (TMPs), and integral monotopic proteins (IMPs) in both the inner and outer lipid layers. We first showed that actin rings limit the longitudinal diffusion of TMPs and the IMPs of the inner leaflet but not of the IMPs of the outer leaflet. To reconcile the experimental observations, which show restricted diffusion of IMPs of the outer leaflet, with our simulations, we conjectured the existence of actin-anchored proteins that form a fence which restricts the longitudinal diffusion of IMPs of the outer leaflet. We also showed that spectrin filaments could modify transverse diffusion of TMPs and IMPs of the inner leaflet, depending on the strength of the association between lipids and spectrin. For instance, in areas where spectrin binds to the lipid bilayer, spectrin filaments would restrict diffusion of proteins within the skeleton corrals. In contrast, in areas where spectrin and lipids are not associated, spectrin modifies the diffusion of TMPs and IMPs of the inner leaflet from normal to confined-hop diffusion. Overall, we showed that diffusion of axon plasma membrane proteins is deeply anisotropic, as longitudinal diffusion is of different type than transverse diffusion. Finally, we investigated how accumulation of TMPs affects diffusion of TMPs and IMPs of both the inner and outer leaflets by changing the density of TMPs. We showed that the APMS structure acts as a fence that restricts the diffusion of TMPs and IMPs of the inner leaflet within the membrane skeleton corrals. Our findings provide insight into how the axon skeleton acts as diffusion barrier and maintains neuronal polarity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0rLv1_9yqa4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The origin of avian flight is one of the most controversial debates in Paleontology. This paper investigates the wing performance of &lt;i&gt;Caudipteryx&lt;/i&gt;, the most basal non-volant dinosaur with pennaceous feathered forelimbs by using modal effective mass theory. From a mechanical standpoint, the forced vibrations excited by hindlimb locomotion stimulate the movement of wings, creating a flapping-like motion in response. This shows that the origin of the avian flight stroke should lie in a completely natural process of active locomotion on the ground. In this regard, flapping in the history of evolution of avian flight should have already occurred when the dinosaurs were equipped with pennaceous remiges and rectrices. The forced vibrations provided the initial training for flapping the feathered wings of theropods similar to &lt;i&gt;Caudipteryx&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pX_Nq1y_A-o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The formation of gaps in the endothelium is a crucial process underlying both cancer and immune cell extravasation, contributing to the functioning of the immune system during infection, the unfavorable development of chronic inflammation and tumor metastasis. Here, we present a stochastic-mechanical multiscale model of an endothelial cell monolayer and show that the dynamic nature of the endothelium leads to spontaneous gap formation, even without intervention from the transmigrating cells. These gaps preferentially appear at the vertices between three endothelial cells, as opposed to the border between two cells. We quantify the frequency and lifetime of these gaps, and validate our predictions experimentally. Interestingly, we find experimentally that cancer cells also preferentially extravasate at vertices, even when they first arrest on borders. This suggests that extravasating cells, rather than initially signaling to the endothelium, might exploit the autonomously forming gaps in the endothelium to initiate transmigration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O9u34B68bSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested two hypotheses regarding age at onset within familial epilepsies: (1) family members with epilepsy tend to have similar ages at onset, independent of epilepsy syndrome; (2) age at onset is younger in successive generations after controlling for sampling bias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical data collected by the Epi4K Consortium (303 multiplex families, 1,120 individuals). To test hypothesis 1, we used both linear mixed models commonly used for heritability analysis and Cox regression models with frailty terms to assess clustering of onset within families after controlling for other predictors. To test hypothesis 2, we used mixed effects models, pair‐wise analyses, and survival analysis to address sampling‐related bias that may mimic anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Age at seizure onset was significantly heritable (ICC 0.17, p &amp;lt; 0.001) after adjusting for epilepsy type, sex, site, history of febrile seizure, and age at last observation. This finding remained significant after adjusting for epilepsy syndromes, and was robust across statistical methods in all families and in generalized families. (2) The mean age at onset decreased in successive generations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). After adjusting for age at last observation, this effect was not significant in mixed‐effects models (p=0.14), but remained significant in pair‐wise (p=0.0003) and survival analyses (p=0.02).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age at seizure onset is an independent familial trait, and may have genetic determinants distinct from the determinants of particular epilepsy syndromes. Younger onsets in successive generations can be explained in part by sampling bias, but the presence of genetic anticipation cannot be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is used for the treatment of dystonia in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy, however, the current level of evidence for the effect is low. The primary aim of this study was to provide evidence for the effect of intrathecal baclofen treatment on individual goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi‐centre, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was performed at two University Medical Centres in the Netherlands. Patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Functioning Classification System level IV‐V), aged 4 to 24, eligible for intrathecal baclofen, were included. Patients were assigned by block randomization (2:2) for treatment with intrathecal baclofen or placebo during three months via an implanted micro‐infusion pump. The primary outcome was Goal Attainment Scaling of individual treatment goals (GAS T‐score). A linear regression model was used for statistical analysis with study site as a covariate. Safety analyses were done for number and type of (serious) adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six patients were recruited from January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2013 to March 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2018. Data for final analysis were available for 17 in the intrathecal baclofen group and 16 patients in the placebo group. Mean (SD) GAS T‐score at three months was 38∙9 (13∙2) for intrathecal baclofen and 21∙0 (4∙6) for placebo (regression coefficient 17∙8, 95% CI 10∙4 to 25∙0, p&amp;lt;0∙001). Number and types of (serious) adverse events were similar between groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is superior to placebo in achieving treatment goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Recent work has sought to understand the behavior of neural networks by
comparing representations between layers and between different trained models.
We examine methods for comparing neural network representations based on
canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We show that CCA belongs to a family of
statistics for measuring multivariate similarity, but that neither CCA nor any
other statistic that is invariant to invertible linear transformation can
measure meaningful similarities between representations of higher dimension
than the number of data points. We introduce a similarity index that measures
the relationship between representational similarity matrices and does not
suffer from this limitation. This similarity index is equivalent to centered
kernel alignment (CKA) and is also closely connected to CCA. Unlike CCA, CKA
can reliably identify correspondences between representations in networks
trained from different initializations.

 &lt;p&gt;A fundamental question for understanding brain function is what types of
stimuli drive neurons to fire. In visual neuroscience, this question has also
been posted as characterizing the receptive field of a neuron. The search for
effective stimuli has traditionally been based on a combination of insights
from previous studies, intuition, and luck. Recently, the same question has
emerged in the study of units in convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), and
together with this question a family of solutions were developed that are
generally referred to as &quot;feature visualization by activation maximization.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to bring in tools and techniques developed for studying ConvNets to
the study of biological neural networks. However, one key difference that
impedes direct translation of tools is that gradients can be obtained from
ConvNets using backpropagation, but such gradients are not available from the
brain. To circumvent this problem, we developed a method for gradient-free
activation maximization by combining a generative neural network with a genetic
algorithm. We termed this method XDream (EXtending DeepDream with real-time
evolution for activation maximization), and we have shown that this method can
reliably create strong stimuli for neurons in the macaque visual cortex (Ponce
et al., 2019). In this paper, we describe extensive experiments characterizing
the XDream method by using ConvNet units as in silico models of neurons. We
show that XDream is applicable across network layers, architectures, and
training sets; examine design choices in the algorithm; and provide practical
guides for choosing hyperparameters in the algorithm. XDream is an efficient
algorithm for uncovering neuronal tuning preferences in black-box networks
using a vast and diverse stimulus space.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is becoming an important
method in the field of motor rehabilitation because of its ability to
non-invasively influence ongoing brain oscillations at arbitrary frequencies.
However, substantial variations in its effect across individuals are reported,
making tACS a currently unreliable treatment tool. One reason for this
variability is the lack of knowledge about the exact way tACS entrains and
interacts with ongoing brain oscillations. The present crossover stimulation
study on 20 healthy subjects contributes to the understanding of
cross-frequency effects of gamma (70 Hz) tACS over the contralateral motor
cortex by providing empirical evidence which is consistent with a role of low-
(12~-20 Hz) and high- (20-~30 Hz) beta power as a mediator of gamma-tACS on
motor performance.

 &lt;p&gt;In order to develop more precise and functional affective applications, it is
necessary to achieve a balance between the psychology and the engineering
applied to emotions. Signals from the central and peripheral nervous systems
have been used for emotion recognition purposes, however, their operation and
the relationship between them remains unknown. In this context, in the present
work we have tried to approach the study of the psychobiology of both systems
in order to generate a computational model for the recognition of emotions in
the dimension of valence. To this end, the electroencephalography (EEG) signal,
electrocardiography (ECG) signal and skin temperature of 24 subjects have been
studied. Each methodology has been evaluated individually, finding
characteristic patterns of positive and negative emotions in each of them.
After feature selection of each methodology, the results of the classification
showed that, although the classification of emotions is possible at both
central and peripheral levels, the multimodal approach did not improve the
results obtained through the EEG alone. In addition, differences have been
observed between cerebral and physiological responses in the processing
emotions by separating the sample by sex; though, the differences between men
and women were only notable at the physiological level.

		<content type="html">
 ASICs are proton-gated sodium channels expressed in neurons. Structures of chicken ASIC1 in three conformations have advanced understanding of proton-mediated gating; however, a molecular mechanism describing desensitization from open and pre-open states (steady-state desensitization or SSD) remains elusive. A distinct feature of the desensitized state is an 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; rotation of residues L415 and N416 in the β11- β12 linker that was proposed to mediate desensitization; whether and how it translates into desensitization has not been explored yet. Using electrophysiological measurements of injected &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes, we show that Q276 in β9 strand works with L415 and N416 to mediate both types of desensitization in ASIC1a, ASIC2a and ASIC3. Q276 functions as a valve that enables or restricts rotation of L415 and N416 to keep the linker compressed, its relaxation lengthens openings and leads to sustained currents. At low proton concentrations, the proposed mechanism working in only one of three subunits of the channel is sufficient to induce SSD.</content>

 To generate energy efficiently, the cell is uniquely challenged to co-ordinate the abundance of electron transport chain protein subunits expressed from both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. How an effective stoichiometry of this many constituent subunits is co-ordinated post-transcriptionally remains poorly understood. Here we show that &lt;i&gt;Cerox1&lt;/i&gt;, an unusually abundant cytoplasmic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), modulates the levels of mitochondrial complex I subunit transcripts in a manner that requires binding to microRNA-488-3p. Increased abundance of &lt;i&gt;Cerox1&lt;/i&gt; cooperatively elevates complex I subunit protein abundance and enzymatic activity, decreases reactive oxygen species production, and protects against the complex I inhibitor rotenone. &lt;i&gt;Cerox1&lt;/i&gt; function is conserved across placental mammals: human and mouse orthologues effectively modulate complex I enzymatic activity in mouse and human cells, respectively. &lt;i&gt;Cerox1&lt;/i&gt; is the first lncRNA demonstrated, to our knowledge, to regulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and, with miR-488-3p, represent novel targets for the modulation of complex I activity.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Prey are under selection to minimize predation losses. In aquatic environments many prey use chemical cues released by predators, which initiate predator-avoidance. A prominent example of behavioural predator-avoidance constitutes diel vertical migration (DVM) in the freshwater microcrustacean &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt; spp., which is induced by chemical cues (kairomones) released by planktivorous fish. In a bioassay-guided approach using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry we isolated the kairomone from fish incubation water and identified it as 5α-cyprinol sulfate inducing DVM in &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt; at picomolar concentrations. The role of 5α-cyprinol sulfate in lipid digestion in fish explains why from an evolutionary perspective fish has not stopped releasing 5α-cyprinol sulfate despite the disadvantages for the releaser. The identification of the DVM-inducing kairomone enables investigating its spatial and temporal distribution and the underlying molecular mechanism of its perception. Furthermore, it allows to test if fish-mediated inducible defenses in other aquatic invertebrates are triggered by the same compound.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Regulation of the outer kinetochore complex Ndc80 is essential to ensure correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments during mitosis. Here we present a novel mechanism of regulation that is intrinsic to its structure; tight bending of the Ndc80 complex inhibits its microtubule binding. Using single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we show that the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; Ndc80 complex can fluctuate between straight and bent forms, and that binding of the complex to microtubules selects for straightened forms. The loop region of the complex enables its bent conformation, as deletion of the loop promotes straightening. In addition, the kinetochore complex MIND enhances microtubule binding by opposing the tightly bent, auto-inhibited conformation of the Ndc80 complex. We suggest that prior to its assembly at the kinetochore, the Ndc80 complex interchanges between bent (auto-inhibited) and open conformations. Once assembled, its association with MIND stabilizes the Ndc80 complex in a straightened form for higher affinity microtubule binding.</content>

 Ten countries have reported &lt;i&gt;pfhrp2/pfhrp3&lt;/i&gt; gene deletions since the first observation of &lt;i&gt;pfhrp2&lt;/i&gt;-deleted parasites in 2012. In a previous study (Watson et al., 2017) we characterised the drivers selecting for &lt;i&gt;pfhrp2/3&lt;/i&gt; deletions, and mapped the regions in Africa with the greatest selection pressure. In February 2018, the World Health Organization issued guidance on investigating suspected false-negative rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) due to &lt;i&gt;pfhrp2/3&lt;/i&gt; deletions. However, no guidance is provided regarding the timing of investigations. Failure to consider seasonal variation could cause premature decisions to switch to alternative RDTs. In response, we have extended our methods and predict that the prevalence of false-negative RDTs due to &lt;i&gt;pfhrp2/3&lt;/i&gt; deletions is highest when sampling from younger individuals during the beginning of the rainy season. We conclude by producing a map of the regions impacted by seasonal fluctuations in &lt;i&gt;pfhrp2/3&lt;/i&gt; deletions and a database identifying optimum sampling intervals to support malaria control programmes.</content>

 Interactions lie at the heart of social organization, particularly in ant societies. Interaction rates are presumed to increase with density, but there is little empirical evidence for this. We manipulated density within carpenter ant colonies of the species &lt;i&gt;Camponotus pennsylvanicus&lt;/i&gt; by quadrupling nest space and by manually tracking 6.9 million ant locations and over 3200 interactions to study the relationship between density, spatial organization and interaction rates. Colonies divided into distinct spatial regions on the basis of their underlying spatial organization and changed their movement patterns accordingly. Despite a reduction in both overall and local density, we did not find the expected concomitant reduction in interaction rates across all colonies. Instead, we found divergent effects across colonies. Our results highlight the remarkable organizational resilience of ant colonies to changes in density, which allows them to sustain two key basic colony life functions, that is food and information exchange, during environmental change.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The human precuneus is involved in many high-level cognitive functions, which strongly suggests the existence of biologically meaningful subdivisions. However, the functional parcellation of the precuneus needs much to be investigated. In this study, we developed an eigen clustering (EIC) approach for the parcellation using precuneus–cortical functional connectivity from fMRI data of the Human Connectome Project. The EIC approach is robust to noise and can automatically determine the cluster number. It is consistently demonstrated that the human precuneus can be subdivided into six symmetrical and connected parcels. The anterior and posterior precuneus participate in sensorimotor and visual functions, respectively. The central precuneus with four subregions indicates a media role in the interaction of the default mode, dorsal attention, and frontoparietal control networks. The EIC-based functional parcellation is free of the spatial distance constraint and is more functionally coherent than parcellation using typical clustering algorithms. The precuneus subregions had high accordance with cortical morphology and revealed good functional segregation and integration characteristics in functional task-evoked activations. This study may shed new light on the human precuneus function at a delicate level and offer an alternative scheme for human brain parcellation.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human intelligence can be broadly subdivided into fluid (g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;) and crystallized (g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;) intelligence, each tapping into distinct cognitive abilities. Although neuroanatomical correlates of intelligence have been previously studied, differential contribution of cortical morphologies to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; has not been fully delineated. Here, we tried to disentangle the contribution of cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and cortical gyrification to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; in a large sample of healthy young subjects (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 740, Human Connectome Project) with high-resolution MRIs, followed by replication in a separate data set with distinct cognitive measures indexing g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;.

Specifically, higher performance in g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; was associated with cortical expansion in regions related to working memory, attention, and visuo-spatial processing, while g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; was associated with thinner cortex as well as higher cortical surface area in language-related networks. We discuss the results in a framework where “horizontal” cortical expansion enables higher resource allocation, computational capacity, and functional specificity relevant to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;, while lower cortical thickness possibly reflects cortical pruning facilitating “vertical” intracolumnar efficiency in knowledge-based tasks relevant mostly to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Socioeconomic status (SES) is a multidimensional construct that includes not only measures of material wealth, but also education, social prestige, and neighborhood quality. Socioeconomic correlates between wealth and cognitive functions have been well established in behavioral studies. However, functional and structural brain correlates of SES remain unclear. Here, we sought to uncover the most likely neural regions to be affected by low SES, specifically associated with age. Using effect size–seed-based d Mapping, we compiled studies that examined individuals with low SES and performed functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry meta-analyses. The results revealed that as from early to late age, individuals exposed to low SES are less likely to have sustained executive network activity yet a greater likelihood to enhanced activity within reward-related regions. A similar activity was shown for gray matter volume across early to older age. These findings provide the first quantitative integration of neuroimaging results pertaining to the neural basis of SES. Hypoactivation of the executive network and hyperactivation of the reward network in low SES individuals may support the scarcity hypothesis and animal models of the effects of early adversity.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Antibodies are an important class of therapeutics that have significant clinical impact for the treatment of severe diseases. Computational tools to support antibody drug discovery have been developing at an increasing rate over the last decade and typically rely upon a predetermined co-crystal structure of the antibody bound to the antigen for structural predictions. Here, we show an example of successful &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; affinity maturation of a hybridoma derived antibody, AB1, using just a homology model of the antibody fragment variable region and a protein-protein docking model of the AB1 antibody bound to the antigen, murine CCL20 (muCCL20). &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; affinity maturation, together with alanine scanning, has allowed us to fine-tune the protein-protein docking model to subsequently enable the identification of two single-point mutations that increase the affinity of AB1 for muCCL20. To our knowledge, this is one of the first examples of the use of homology modelling and protein docking for affinity maturation and represents an approach that can be widely deployed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b5y66R19uyc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Neural systems are organized in a modular way, serving multiple functionalities. This multiplicity requires that both positive (e.g. excitatory, phase-coherent) and negative (e.g. inhibitory, phase-opposing) interactions take place across brain modules. Unfortunately, most methods to detect modules from time series either neglect or convert to positive, any measured negative correlation. This may leave a significant part of the sign-dependent functional structure undetected. Here we present a novel method, based on random matrix theory, for the identification of sign-dependent modules in the brain. Our method filters out both local (unit-specific) noise and global (system-wide) dependencies that typically obfuscate the presence of such structure. The method is guaranteed to identify an optimally contrasted functional ‘signature’, i.e. a partition into modules that are positively correlated internally and negatively correlated across. The method is purely data-driven, does not use any arbitrary threshold or network projection, and outputs only statistically significant structure. In measurements of neuronal gene expression in the biological clock of mice, the method systematically uncovers two otherwise undetectable, negatively correlated modules whose relative size and mutual interaction strength are found to depend on photoperiod.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rrme1xi5QrM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Whole cell responses involve multiple subcellular processes (SCPs). To understand how balance between SCPs controls the dynamics of whole cell responses we studied neurite outgrowth in rat primary cortical neurons in culture. We used a combination of dynamical models and experiments to understand the conditions that permitted growth at a specified velocity and when aberrant growth could lead to the formation of dystrophic bulbs. We hypothesized that dystrophic bulb formation is due to quantitative imbalances between SCPs. Simulations predict redundancies between lower level sibling SCPs within each type of high level SCP. In contrast, higher level SCPs, such as vesicle transport and exocytosis or microtubule growth characteristic of each type need to be strictly coordinated with each other and imbalances result in stalling of neurite outgrowth. From these simulations, we predicted the effect of changing the activities of SCPs involved in vesicle exocytosis or microtubule growth could lead to formation of dystrophic bulbs. siRNA ablation experiments verified these predictions. We conclude that whole cell dynamics requires balance between the higher-level SCPs involved and imbalances can terminate whole cell responses such as neurite outgrowth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EVV2CgEFDJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that planned and corrective actions are recalibrated during some forms of motor adaptation. However, corrective (also known as reactive) movements in human locomotion are thought to simply reflect sudden environmental changes independently from sensorimotor recalibration. Thus, we asked whether corrective responses can indicate the motor system’s adapted state following prolonged exposure to a novel walking situation inducing sensorimotor adaptation. We recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals bilaterally on 15 leg muscles before, during, and after split-belts walking (i.e., novel walking situation), in which the legs move at different speeds. We exploited the rapid temporal dynamics of corrective responses upon unexpected speed transitions to isolate them from the overall motor output. We found that corrective muscle activity was structurally different following short versus long exposures to split-belts walking. Only after a long exposure, removal of the novel environment elicited corrective muscle patterns that matched those expected in response to a perturbation opposite to the one originally experienced. This indicated that individuals who recalibrated their motor system adopted split-belts environment as their new &quot;normal&quot; and transitioning back to the original walking environment causes subjects to react as if it was novel to them. Interestingly, this learning declined with age, but steady state modulation of muscle activity during split-belts walking did not, suggesting potentially different neural mechanisms underlying these motor patterns. Taken together, our results show that corrective motor commands reflect the adapted state of the motor system, which is less flexible as we age.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that a variety of central and afferent stimuli, including swallowing, can produce phase resetting in the respiratory rhythmicity. Also, there are reports about the intrinsic linkage between locomotion and respiration. However, little is known about the interaction between the central pattern generators (CPGs) for scratching and respiration. The present study aims to examine whether the activation of scratching CPG produces phase resetting of the respiratory rhythm. We employed decerebrate cats to apply brief tactile stimuli to the pinna during the inspiratory-expiratory transition. We observed that those stimuli to the pinna not eliciting fictive scratching did not reset the respiratory rhythm. However, when the pinna stimuli elicited fictive scratching, then the respiratory rhythm exhibited a significant phase resetting. We also found interneurons in the medulla oblongata exhibiting phase resetting related to scratching-CPG episodes. This second finding suggests that this type of resetting involves brainstem components of the respiratory CPG. These results shed new light on the resetting action from a spinal CPG on the respiratory rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region of the adult rodent brain that undergoes continuous neurogenesis. Seizures and loss or dysfunction of GABAergic synapses onto adult-born dentate granule cells (GCs) alter their dendritic growth and migration, resulting in dysmorphic and hyperexcitable GCs. Additionally, transplants of fetal GABAergic interneurons in the DG of mice with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) result in seizure suppression, but it is unknown whether increasing interneurons with these transplants restores GABAergic innervation to adult-born GCs. Here, we address this question by birth-dating GCs with retrovirus at different times up to 12 weeks after pilocarpine-induced TLE in adult mice. Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-expressing medial-ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived GABAergic interneurons from embryonic day (E)13.5 mouse embryos were transplanted into the DG of the TLE mice and GCs with transplant-derived inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) were identified by patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetic interrogation. Putative synaptic sites between GCs and GABAergic transplants were also confirmed by intracellular biocytin staining, immunohistochemistry, and confocal imaging. 3D reconstructions of dendritic arbors and quantitative morphometric analyses were carried out in &amp;gt;150 adult-born GCs. GABAergic inputs from transplanted interneurons correlated with markedly shorter GC dendrites, compared to GCs that were not innervated by the transplants. Moreover, these effects were confined to distal dendritic branches and a short time window of six to eight weeks. The effects were independent of seizures as they were also observed in naïve mice with MGE transplants. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased inhibitory currents over a smaller dendritic arbor in adult-born GCs may reduce their excitability and lead to seizure suppression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase in oxidative damage, leading to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. The oxidative status of RGCs is regulated intrinsically and also extrinsically by retinal glia. The mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) relieves oxidative and neuronal damage in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models. We hypothesized that deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; in either RGCs or retinal glia would increase retinal damage and RGC death in a mouse model of glaucoma. Paradoxically, we found the reverse, and deletion of mitochondrial &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; decreased oxidative protein modification and reduced RGC death in male and female mice. This paradox was resolved after finding that &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion also increased levels of mitophagy in cell culture and retinal tissue. Our data suggest that &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion facilitates increased mitochondrial function by improving quality control. An increase in mitochondrial function explains the resistance of &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt;-deleted retinas to glaucoma and may provide a therapeutic avenue for other chronic neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many unsolved neurodegenerative conditions result from defects in mitochondrial function. Molecular tools that can manipulate mitochondria will therefore be central to developing neuroprotective therapies. Among the most potent regulators of mitochondrial function are the uncoupling proteins, particularly UCP2. In this manuscript, we show that, while loss of &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; does increase mitochondrial membrane potential and the production of reactive oxygen species, it also initiates an increase in mitophagy that is ultimately neuroprotective. This novel protective consequence of uncoupling protein inhibition may lead to new therapeutic approaches to combat neurodegenerative disease, particularly because pharmacological compounds do exist that can selectively inhibit UCP2.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders offer insight into synaptic mechanisms. To unbiasedly uncover these mechanisms, we studied the 22q11.2 syndrome, a recurrent copy number variant, which is the highest schizophrenia genetic risk factor. We quantified the proteomes of 22q11.2 mutant human fibroblasts from both sexes and mouse brains carrying a 22q11.2-like defect, &lt;i&gt;Df(16)A&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Molecular ontologies defined mitochondrial compartments and pathways as some of top ranked categories. In particular, we identified perturbations in the SLC25A1-SLC25A4 mitochondrial transporter interactome as associated with the 22q11.2 genetic defect. Expression of SLC25A1-SLC25A4 interactome components was affected in neuronal cells from schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, hemideficiency of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; SLC25A1 or SLC25A4 orthologues, dSLC25A1-sea and dSLC25A4-sesB, affected synapse morphology, neurotransmission, plasticity, and sleep patterns. Our findings indicate that synapses are sensitive to partial loss of function of mitochondrial solute transporters. We propose that mitoproteomes regulate synapse development and function in normal and pathological conditions in a cell-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We address the central question of how to comprehensively define molecular mechanisms of the most prevalent and penetrant microdeletion associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. This complex mutation reduces gene dosage of ~63 genes in humans. We describe a disruption of the mitoproteome in 22q11.2 patients and brains of a 22q11.2 mouse model. In particular, we identify a network of inner mitochondrial membrane transporters as a hub required for synapse function. Our findings suggest that mitochondrial composition and function modulate the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The intention to forget can produce long-lasting effects. This ability has been linked to suppression of both rehearsal and retrieval of unwanted memories, processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Here, we describe an alternative account in which the intention to forget is associated with increased engagement with the unwanted information. We used pattern classifiers to decode human functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a task in which male and female participants viewed a series of pictures and were instructed to remember or forget each one. Pictures followed by a forget instruction elicited higher levels of processing in the ventral temporal cortex compared with those followed by a remember instruction. This boost in processing led to more forgetting, particularly for items that showed moderate (vs weak or strong) activation. This result is consistent with the nonmonotonic plasticity hypothesis, which predicts weakening and forgetting of memories that are moderately activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The human brain cannot remember everything. Forgetting has a critical role in curating memories and discarding unwanted information. Intentional forgetting has traditionally been linked to passive processes, such as the withdrawal of sustained attention or a stoppage of memory rehearsal. It has also been linked to active suppression of memory processes during encoding and retrieval. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and machine-learning methods, we show new evidence that intentional forgetting involves an enhancement of memory processing in the sensory cortex to achieve desired forgetting of recent visual experiences. This enhancement temporarily boosts the activation of the memory representation and renders it vulnerable to disruption via homeostatic regulation. Contrary to intuition, deliberate forgetting may involve more rather than less attention to unwanted information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The circadian clock organizes the physiology and behavior of organisms to their daily environmental rhythms. The central circadian timekeeping mechanism in eukaryotic cells is the transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL). In the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; TTFL, the transcription factors CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) play crucial roles in activating expression of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes. Many signaling pathways converge on the CLK/CYC complex and regulate its activity to fine-tune the cellular oscillator to environmental time cues. We aimed to identify factors that regulate CLK by performing tandem affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry using &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; S2 cells that stably express HA/FLAG-tagged CLK and V5-tagged CYC. We identified SNF4A, a homolog of mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase  (AMPK), as a factor that copurified with HA/FLAG-tagged CLK. The AMPK holoenzyme composed of a catalytic subunit AMPKα and two regulatory subunits, AMPKβ and AMPK, directly phosphorylated purified CLK &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Locomotor behavior analysis in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; revealed that knockdown of each AMPK subunit in pacemaker neurons induced arrhythmicity and long periods. Knockdown of AMPKβ reduced CLK levels in pacemaker neurons, and thereby reduced pre-mRNA and protein levels of CLK downstream core clock genes, such as &lt;i&gt;period&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;vrille&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, overexpression of CLK reversed the long-period phenotype that resulted from AMPKβ knockdown. Thus, we conclude that AMPK, a central regulator of cellular energy metabolism, regulates the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; circadian clock by stabilizing CLK and activating CLK/CYC-dependent transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Regulation of the circadian transcription factors CLK and CYC is fundamental to synchronize the core clock with environmental changes. Here, we show that the AMPK subunit of AMPK, a central regulator of cellular metabolism, copurifies with the CLK/CYC complex in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; S2 cells. Furthermore, the AMPK holoenzyme directly phosphorylates CLK &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. This study demonstrates that AMPK activity regulates the core clock in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; by activating CLK, which enhances circadian transcription. In mammals, AMPK affects the core clock by downregulating circadian repressor proteins. It is intriguing to note that AMPK activity is required for core clock regulation through circadian transcription enhancement, whereas the target of AMPK action is different in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and mammals (positive vs negative element, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;When one's central vision is deprived, a spared part of the peripheral retina acts as a pseudofovea for fixation. The neural mechanisms underlying this compensatory adjustment remain unclear. Here we report cortical reorganization induced by simulated central vision loss. Human subjects of both sexes learned to place the target at an eccentric retinal locus outside their blocked visual field for object tracking. Before and after training, we measured visual crowding—a bottleneck of object identification in peripheral vision, using psychophysics and fMRI. We found that training led to an axis-specific reduction of crowding. The change of the crowding effect was reflected in the change of BOLD signal, as a release of cortical suppression in multiple visual areas starting as early as V1. Our findings suggest that the adult visual system is capable of reshaping its oculomotor control and sensory coding to adapt to impoverished visual input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; By simulating central vision loss in normally sighted adults, we found that oculomotor training not only induces PRL, but also facilitates form processing in peripheral vision. As subjects learned to place the target at an eccentric retinal locus, &quot;visual crowding&quot;—the detrimental effect of clutter on peripheral object identification—was reduced. The reduction of the crowding effect was accompanied by a release of response suppression in the visual cortex. These findings indicate that the adult visual system is capable of reshaping the peripheral vision to adapt to central vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Daily life often requires the coordination of our actions with those of another partner. After 50 years (1968–2018) of behavioral neurophysiology of motor control, the neural mechanisms that allow such coordination in primates are unknown. We studied this issue by recording cell activity simultaneously from dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of two male interacting monkeys trained to coordinate their hand forces to achieve a common goal. We found a population of &quot;joint-action cells&quot; that discharged preferentially when monkeys cooperated in the task. This modulation was predictive in nature, because in most cells neural activity led in time the changes of the &quot;own&quot; and of the &quot;other&quot; behavior. These neurons encoded the joint-performance more accurately than &quot;canonical action-related cells&quot;, activated by the action per se, regardless of the individual versus interactive context. A decoding of joint-action was obtained by combining the two brains' activities, using cells with directional properties distinguished from those associated to the &quot;solo&quot; behaviors. Action observation-related activity studied when one monkey observed the consequences of the partner's behavior, i.e., the cursor's motion on the screen, did not sharpen the accuracy of joint-action cells' representation, suggesting that it plays no major role in encoding joint-action. When monkeys performed with a non-interactive partner, such as a computer, joint-action cells' representation of the other (non-cooperative) behavior was significantly degraded. These findings provide evidence of how premotor neurons integrate the time-varying representation of the self-action with that of a co-actor, thus offering a neural substrate for successful visuomotor coordination between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The neural bases of intersubject motor coordination were studied by recording cell activity simultaneously from the frontal cortex of two interacting monkeys, trained to coordinate their hand forces to achieve a common goal. We found a new class of cells, preferentially active when the monkeys cooperated, rather than when the same action was performed individually. These &quot;joint-action neurons&quot; offered a neural representation of joint-behaviors by far more accurate than that provided by the &quot;canonical action-related cells&quot;, modulated by the action per se regardless of the individual/interactive context. A neural representation of joint-performance was obtained by combining the activity recorded from the two brains. Our findings offer the first evidence concerning neural mechanisms subtending interactive visuomotor coordination between co-acting agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Values available for choice in different behavioral contexts can vary immensely. To compensate for this variability, neuronal circuits underlying economic decisions undergo adaptation. In orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), neurons encode the subjective value of offered and chosen goods in a quasilinear way. Previous experiments found that the gain of the encoding is lower when the value range is wider. However, the parameters OFC neurons adapted to remained unclear. Furthermore, previous studies did not examine additive changes in neuronal responses. Computational considerations indicate that these factors can directly impact choice behavior. Here we investigated how OFC neurons adapt to changes in the value range. We recorded from two male rhesus monkeys during a juice choice task. Each session was divided into two blocks of trials. In each block, juices were offered within a set range of values, and ranges changed between blocks. Across blocks, neuronal responses adapted to both the maximum and the minimum value, but only partially. As a result, the minimum neural activity was elevated in some value ranges relative to others. Through simulation of a linear decision model, we showed that increasing the minimum response increases choice variability, lowering the expected payoff. This effect is modulated by the balance between cells with positive and negative encoding. The presence of these two populations induces a non-monotonic relationship between the value range and choice efficacy, such that the expected payoff is highest for decisions in an intermediate value range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Economic decisions are thought to rely on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The values available for choice vary enormously in different contexts. Previous work showed that neurons in OFC encode values in a linear way, and that the gain of encoding is inversely related to the range of available values. However, the specific parameters driving adaptation remained unclear. Here we show that OFC neurons adapt to both the maximum and minimum value in the current context. However, adaptation is partial, leading to contextual changes in the response offset. Interestingly, increasing the activity offset negatively affects choices in a simulated network. Partial adaptation may allow the circuit to maintain information about context value at the cost of slightly reduced payoff.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To better examine circuit mechanisms underlying perception and behavior, researchers need tools to enable temporally precise control of action-potential generation of individual cells from neuronal ensembles. Here we demonstrate that such precision can be achieved with two-photon (2P) temporally focused computer-generated holography to control neuronal excitability at the supragranular layers of anesthetized and awake visual cortex in both male and female mice. Using 2P-guided whole-cell or cell-attached recordings in positive neurons expressing any of the three opsins ReaChR, CoChR, or ChrimsonR, we investigated the dependence of spiking activity on the opsin's channel kinetics. We found that in all cases the use of brief illumination (≤10 ms) induces spikes of millisecond temporal resolution and submillisecond precision, which were preserved upon repetitive illuminations up to tens of hertz. To reach high temporal precision, we used a large illumination spot covering the entire cell body and an amplified laser at high peak power and low excitation intensity (on average ≤0.2 mW/μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), thus minimizing the risk for nonlinear photodamage effects. Finally, by combining 2P holographic excitation with electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging using GCaMP6s, we investigated the factors, including illumination shape and intensity, opsin distribution in the target cell, and cell morphology, which affect the spatial selectivity of single-cell and multicell holographic activation. Parallel optical control of neuronal activity with cellular resolution and millisecond temporal precision should make it easier to investigate neuronal connections and find further links between connectivity, microcircuit dynamics, and brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent developments in the field of optogenetics has enabled researchers to probe the neuronal microcircuit with light by optically actuating genetically encoded light-sensitive opsins expressed in the target cells. Here, we applied holographic light shaping and temporal focusing to simultaneously deliver axially confined holographic patterns to opsin-positive cells in the living mouse cortex. Parallel illumination efficiently induced action potentials with high temporal resolution and precision for three opsins of different kinetics. We extended the parallel optogenetic activation at low intensity to multiple neurons and concurrently monitored their calcium dynamics. These results demonstrate fast and temporally precise &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; control of a neuronal subpopulation, opening new opportunities for revealing circuit mechanisms underlying brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to learn the relationships between actions and their outcomes. But little is known about what changes to population activity in PFC are specific to learning these relationships. Here we characterize the plasticity of population activity in the medial PFC (mPFC) of male rats learning rules on a Y-maze. First, we show that the population always changes its patterns of joint activity between the periods of sleep either side of a training session on the maze, regardless of successful rule learning during training. Next, by comparing the structure of population activity in sleep and training, we show that this population plasticity differs between learning and nonlearning sessions. In learning sessions, the changes in population activity in post-training sleep incorporate the changes to the population activity during training on the maze. In nonlearning sessions, the changes in sleep and training are unrelated. Finally, we show evidence that the nonlearning and learning forms of population plasticity are driven by different neuron-level changes, with the nonlearning form entirely accounted for by independent changes to the excitability of individual neurons, and the learning form also including changes to firing rate couplings between neurons. Collectively, our results suggest two different forms of population plasticity in mPFC during the learning of action–outcome relationships: one a persistent change in population activity structure decoupled from overt rule-learning, and the other a directional change driven by feedback during behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The PFC is thought to represent our knowledge about what action is worth doing in which context. But we do not know how the activity of neurons in PFC collectively changes when learning which actions are relevant. Here we show, in a trial-and-error task, that population activity in PFC is persistently changing, regardless of learning. Only during episodes of clear learning of relevant actions are the accompanying changes to population activity carried forward into sleep, suggesting a long-lasting form of neural plasticity. Our results suggest that representations of relevant actions in PFC are acquired by reward imposing a direction onto ongoing population plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to enhance learning and memory, yet the mechanisms behind these enhancements are unknown. Here, we present evidence that epigenetic modulation underlies VNS-induced improvements in cognition. We show that VNS enhances novelty preference (NP); alters the hippocampal, cortical, and blood epigenetic transcriptomes; and epigenetically modulates neuronal plasticity and stress–response signaling genes in male Sprague Dawley rats. Brain–behavior analysis revealed structure-specific relationships between NP test performance (NPTP) and epigenetic alterations. In the hippocampus, NPTP correlated with decreased histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11), a transcriptional repressor enriched in CA1 cells important for memory consolidation. In the cortex, the immediate early gene (IEG) ARC was increased in VNS rats and correlated with transcription of plasticity genes and epigenetic regulators, including HDAC3. For rats engaged in NPTP, ARC correlated with performance. Interestingly, blood ARC transcripts decreased in VNS rats performing NPTP, but increased in VNS-only rats. Because DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) facilitate transcription of IEGs, we investigated phosphorylated H2A.X (H2A.X), a histone modification known to colocalize with DSBs. In agreement with reduced cortical stress–response transcription factor NF-B1, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed reduced H2A.X in the ARC promoter. Surprisingly, VNS did not significantly reduce transcription of cortical or hippocampal proinflammatory cytokines. However, TNFRSF11B (osteoprotegerin) correlated with NPTP as well as plasticity, stress–response signaling, and epigenetic regulation transcripts in both hippocampus and cortex. Together, our findings provide the first evidence that VNS induces widespread changes in the cognitive epigenetic landscape and specifically affects epigenetic modulators associated with NPTP, stress–response signaling, memory consolidation, and cortical neural remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies have implicated vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in enhanced learning and memory. However, whereas epigenetic modifications are known to play an important role in memory, the particular mechanisms involved in VNS-enhanced cognition are unknown. In this study, we examined brain and behavior changes in VNS and sham rats performing a multiday novelty preference (NP) task. We found that VNS activated specific histone modifications and DNA methylation changes at important stress–response signaling and plasticity genes. Both cortical and hippocampal plasticity changes were predictive of NP test performance. Our results reveal important epigenetic alterations associated with VNS cognitive improvements, as well as new potential pharmacological targets for enhancing cortical and hippocampal plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/18/3434?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The firing rate of speed cells, a dedicated subpopulation of neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), is correlated with running speed. This correlation has been interpreted as a speed code used in various computational models for path integration. These models consider firing rate to be linearly tuned by running speed in real-time. However, estimation of firing rates requires integration of spiking events over time, setting constraints on the temporal accuracy of the proposed speed code. We therefore tested whether the proposed speed code by firing rate is accurate at short time scales using data obtained from open-field recordings in male rats and mice. We applied a novel filtering approach differentiating between speed codes at multiple time scales ranging from deciseconds to minutes. In addition, we determined the optimal integration time window for firing-rate estimation using a general likelihood framework and calculated the integration time window that maximizes the correlation between firing rate and running speed. Data show that these time windows are on the order of seconds, setting constraints on real-time speed coding by firing rate. We further show that optogenetic inhibition of either cholinergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca does not affect modulation of firing rates by running speed at each time scale tested. These results are relevant for models of path integration and for our understanding of how behavioral activity states may modulate firing rates and likely information processing in the MEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Path integration is the most basic form of navigation relying on self-motion cues. Models of path integration use medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB)-dependent MEC grid-cell firing patterns as the neurophysiological substrate of path integration. These models use a linear speed code by firing rate, but do not consider temporal constraints of integration over time for firing-rate estimation. We show that firing-rate estimation for speed cells requires integration over seconds. Using optogenetics, we show that modulation of firing rates by running speed is independent of MSDB inputs. These results enhance our understanding of path integration mechanisms and the role of the MSDB for information processing in the MEC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/18/3412?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve injury results in persistent motor deficits, even after the nerve regenerates and muscles are reinnervated. This lack of functional recovery is partly explained by brain and spinal cord circuit alterations triggered by the injury, but the mechanisms are generally unknown. One example of this plasticity is the die-back in the spinal cord ventral horn of the projections of proprioceptive axons mediating the stretch reflex (Ia afferents). Consequently, Ia information about muscle length and dynamics is lost from ventral spinal circuits, degrading motor performance after nerve regeneration. Simultaneously, there is activation of microglia around the central projections of peripherally injured Ia afferents, suggesting a possible causal relationship between neuroinflammation and Ia axon removal. Therefore, we used mice (both sexes) that allow visualization of microglia (CX3CR1-GFP) and infiltrating peripheral myeloid cells (CCR2-RFP) and related changes in these cells to Ia synaptic losses (identified by VGLUT1 content) on retrogradely labeled motoneurons. Microgliosis around axotomized motoneurons starts and peaks within 2 weeks after nerve transection. Thereafter, this region becomes infiltrated by CCR2 cells, and VGLUT1 synapses are lost in parallel. Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and genetic lineage tracing showed that infiltrating CCR2 cells include T cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes, the latter differentiating into tissue macrophages. VGLUT1 synapses were rescued after attenuating the ventral microglial reaction by removal of colony stimulating factor 1 from motoneurons or in CCR2 global KOs. Thus, both activation of ventral microglia and a CCR2-dependent mechanism are necessary for removal of VGLUT1 synapses and alterations in Ia-circuit function following nerve injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic plasticity and reorganization of essential motor circuits after a peripheral nerve injury can result in permanent motor deficits due to the removal of sensory Ia afferent synapses from the spinal cord ventral horn. Our data link this major circuit change with the neuroinflammatory reaction that occurs inside the spinal cord following injury to peripheral nerves. We describe that both activation of microglia and recruitment into the spinal cord of blood-derived myeloid cells are necessary for motor circuit synaptic plasticity. This study sheds new light into mechanisms that trigger major network plasticity in CNS regions removed from injury sites and that might prevent full recovery of function, even after successful regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/18/3394?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Transmitter release at auditory inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon synapses involves exocytosis of glutamatergic vesicles during voltage activation of L-type Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 calcium channels. At these synapses, the fast and indefatigable release of synaptic vesicles by IHCs is controlled by otoferlin, a six-C2-domain (C2-ABCDEF) protein that functions as a high-affinity Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor. The molecular events by which each otoferlin C2 domain contributes to the regulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle in IHCs are still incompletely understood. Here, we investigate their role using a cochlear viral cDNA transfer approach &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, where IHCs of mouse lacking otoferlin (&lt;i&gt;Otof&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice of both sexes) were virally transduced with cDNAs of various mini-otoferlins. Using patch-clamp recordings and membrane capacitance measurements, we show that the viral transfer of mini-otoferlin containing C2-ACEF, C2-EF, or C2-DEF partially restores the fast exocytotic component in &lt;i&gt;Otof&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mouse IHCs. The restoration was much less efficient with C2-ACDF, underlining the importance of the C2-EF domain. None of the mini-otoferlins tested restored the sustained component of vesicle release, explaining the absence of hearing recovery. The restoration of the fast exocytotic component in the transduced &lt;i&gt;Otof&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; IHCs was also associated with a recovery of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents with normal amplitude and fast time inactivation, confirming that the C-terminal C2 domains of otoferlin are essential for normal gating of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 channels. Finally, the reintroduction of the mini-otoferlins C2-EF, C2-DEF, or C2-ACEF allowed us to uncover and characterize for the first time a dynamin-dependent ultrafast endocytosis in IHCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Otoferlin, a large six-C2-domain protein, is essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis at auditory hair cell ribbon synapses. Here, we show that the viral expression of truncated forms of otoferlin (C2-EF, C2-DEF, and C2-ACEF) can partially rescue the fast and transient release component of exocytosis in mouse hair cells lacking otoferlin, yet cannot sustain exocytosis after long repeated stimulation. Remarkably, these hair cells also display a dynamin-dependent ultrafast endocytosis. Overall, our study uncovers the pleiotropic role of otoferlin in the hair cell synaptic vesicle cycle, notably in triggering both ultrafast exocytosis and endocytosis and recruiting synaptic vesicles to the active zone.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Peripherin 2 (PRPH2) is a tetraspanin protein concentrated in the light-sensing cilium (called the outer segment) of the vertebrate photoreceptor. The mechanism underlying the ciliary targeting of PRPH2 and the etiology of cone dystrophy caused by PRPH2 mutations remain elusive. Here we show that the late endosome (LE) is the main waystation that critically sorts newly synthesized PRPH2 to the cilium. PRPH2 is expressed in the luminal membrane of the LE. We delineate multiple C-terminal motifs of PRPH2 that distinctively regulate its LE and ciliary targeting through ubiquitination and binding to ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport) component Hrs. Using the newly developed TetOn-inducible system in transfected male and female mouse cones &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we show that the entry of nascent PRPH2 into the cone outer segment can be blocked by either cone dystrophy-causing C-terminal mutations of PRPH2, or by short-term perturbation of the LE or recycling endosomal traffic. These findings open new avenues of research to explore the biological role of the LE in the biosynthetic pathway and the etiology of cone dystrophy caused by PRPH2 mutations and/or malfunctions of the LE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Peripherin 2 (PRPH2) is a tetraspanin protein abundantly expressed in the light-sensing cilium, the outer segment, of the vertebrate photoreceptor. The mechanism underlying the ciliary transport of PRPH2 is unclear. The present study reveals a novel ciliary targeting pathway, in which the newly synthesized PRPH2 is first targeted to the lumen of the late endosome (LE) en route to the cilia. We deciphered the protein motifs and the machinery that regulates the LE trafficking of PRPH2. Using a novel TetOn-inducible system in transfected mouse cones, we showed that the LE pathway of PRPH2 is critical for its outer segment expression. A cone dystrophy-causing mutation impairs the LE and ciliary targeting of PRPH2, implicating the relevance of LE to cone/macular degenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/18/3360?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In the mature mammalian cochlea, inner hair cells (IHCs) are mainly innervated by afferent fibers that convey sound information to the CNS. During postnatal development, however, medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent fibers transiently innervate the IHCs. The MOC–IHC synapse, functional from postnatal day 0 (P0) to hearing onset (P12), undergoes dramatic changes in the sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh) and in the expression of key postsynaptic proteins. To evaluate whether there are associated changes in the properties of ACh release during this period, we used a cochlear preparation from mice of either sex at P4, P6–P7, and P9–P11 and monitored transmitter release from MOC terminals in voltage-clamped IHCs in the whole-cell configuration. The quantum content increased 5.6&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; from P4 to P9–P11 due to increases in the size and replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles without changes in their probability of release or quantum size. This strengthening in transmission was accompanied by changes in short-term plasticity properties, which switched from facilitation at P4 to depression at P9–P11. We have previously shown that at P9–P11, ACh release is supported by P/Q- and N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and negatively regulated by BK potassium channels activated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through L-type VGCCs. We now show that at P4 and P6–P7, release is mediated by P/Q-, R- and L-type VGCCs. Interestingly, L-type VGCCs have a dual role: they both support release and fuel BK channels, suggesting that at immature stages presynaptic proteins involved in release are less compartmentalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During postnatal development before the onset of hearing, cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) present spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; action potentials that release glutamate at the first auditory synapse in the absence of sound stimulation. The IHC Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; action potential frequency pattern, which is crucial for the correct establishment and function of the auditory system, is regulated by the efferent medial olivocochlear (MOC) system that transiently innervates IHCs during this period. We show here that developmental changes in synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity properties at the MOC–IHC synapse upon MOC fiber activation at different frequencies might be crucial for tightly shaping the pattern of afferent activity during this critical period.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Permutation of any two hidden units yields invariant properties in typical
deep generative neural networks. This permutation symmetry plays an important
role in understanding the computation performance of a broad class of neural
networks with two or more hidden units. However, a theoretical study of the
permutation symmetry is still lacking. Here, we propose a minimal model with
only two hidden units in a restricted Boltzmann machine, which aims to address
how the permutation symmetry affects the critical learning data size at which
the concept-formation (or spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics language)
starts, and moreover semi-rigorously prove a conjecture that the critical data
size is independent of the number of hidden units once this number is finite.
Remarkably, we find that the embedded correlation between two receptive fields
of hidden units reduces the critical data size. In particular, the
weakly-correlated receptive fields have the benefit of significantly reducing
the minimal data size that triggers the transition, given less noisy data.
Inspired by the theory, we also propose an efficient fully-distributed
algorithm to infer the receptive fields of hidden units. Overall, our results
demonstrate that the permutation symmetry is an interesting property that
affects the critical data size for computation performances of related learning
algorithms. All these effects can be analytically probed based on the minimal
model, providing theoretical insights towards understanding unsupervised
learning in a more general context.

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical network functioning critically depends on finely tuned interactions
to afford neuronal activity propagation over long distances while avoiding
runaway excitation. This importance is highlighted by the pathological
consequences and impaired performance resulting from aberrant network
excitability in psychiatric and neurological diseases, such as epilepsy. Theory
and experiment suggest that the control of activity propagation by network
interactions can be adequately described by a branching process. This
hypothesis is partially supported by strong evidence for balanced
spatiotemporal dynamics observed in the cerebral cortex, however, evidence of a
causal relationship between network interactions and cortex activity, as
predicted by a branching process, is missing in humans. Here we test this
cause-effect relationship by monitoring cortex activity under systematic
pharmacological reduction of cortical network interactions with antiepileptic
drugs. We report that cortical activity cascades, presented by the propagating
patterns of epileptic spikes, as well as temporal correlations decline
precisely as predicted for a branching process. Our results provide the missing
link to the branching process theory of cortical network function with
implications for understanding the foundations of cortical excitability and its
monitoring in conditions like epilepsy.

 &lt;p&gt;Neural coding is one of the central questions in systems neuroscience for
understanding how the brain processes stimulus from the environment, moreover,
it is also a cornerstone for designing algorithms of brain-machine interface,
where decoding incoming stimulus is needed for better performance of physical
devices. Traditionally, the neural signal of interest for decoding visual
scenes has been focused on fMRI data. However, our visual perception operates
in a fast time scale of millisecond in terms of an event termed neural spike.
So far there are few studies of decoding by using spikes. Here we fulfill this
aim by developing a novel decoding framework based on deep neural networks,
named spike-image decoder (SID), for reconstructing natural visual scenes,
including static images and dynamic videos, from experimentally recorded spikes
of a population of retinal ganglion cells. The SID is an end-to-end decoder
with one end as neural spikes and the other end as images, which can be trained
directly such that visual scenes are reconstructed from spikes in a highly
accurate fashion. In addition, we show that SID can be generalized to arbitrary
images by using image datasets of MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Furthermore,
with a pre-trained SID, one can decode any dynamic videos, with the aid of an
encoder, to achieve real-time encoding and decoding visual scenes by spikes.
Altogether, our results shed new light on neuromorphic computing for artificial
visual systems, such as event-based visual cameras and visual neuroprostheses.

 &lt;p&gt;The Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive processing and variational free
energy minimisation are typically used to describe perceptual processes based
on accurate generative models of the world. However, generative models need not
be veridical representations of the environment. We suggest that they can (and
should) be used to describe sensorimotor relationships relevant for behaviour
rather than precise accounts of the world.

 During development, neural crest (NC) cells are early precursors of several lineages including melanocytes. Along their differentiation from multipotent cells to mature melanocytes, NC cells will go through successive steps which require either proliferative or motile capacities. For example, they will undergo Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in order the separate from the neural tube and migrate to their final location in the epidermis (Larribere &amp;amp; Utikal, 2013; Skrypek, Goossens, De Smedt, Vandamme, &amp;amp; Berx, 2017). The differentiated melanocytes are the cells of origin of melanoma tumors which progress through several stages such as radial growth phase, vertical growth phase, metastasis formation, and often resistance to current therapies. Interestingly, depending on the stage of the disease, melanoma tumor cells share phenotypes with NC cells (proliferative, motile, EMT). These phenotypes are tightly controlled by specific signaling pathways and transcription factors which tend to be reactivated during the onset of melanoma. In this review, we summarize first the main transcription factors which control these common phenotypes. Then, we focus on the existing strategies used to generate human neural crests. Finally we discuss how identification and regulation of neural crest-associated genes provide an additional approach to improving current melanoma targeted therapies.</content>

 Differential regulation of the μ-opioid receptor (MOP) has been linked to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence which both limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics. At a cellular level, MOP regulation occurs via receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, plasma membrane redistribution and internalization. Here, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to detect and quantify ligand-dependent changes in the plasma membrane organization of MOP expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. The low internalizing agonist morphine and the antagonist naloxone did not alter constitutive MOP plasma membrane organization. In contrast, the internalizing agonist DAMGO changed MOP plasma membrane organization in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner and by two mechanisms. Firstly, it slowed MOP diffusion in a manner that was independent of internalization but dependent on GRK2/3. Secondly, DAMGO reduced the surface receptor number and the proportion of mobile receptors, and increased receptor clustering in a manner that was dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Overall, these results suggest the existence of distinct sequential MOP reorganization events at the plasma membrane and provide insights into the specific protein interactions that control MOP plasma membrane organization.</content>

 Stress and the circadian systems play a major role in an organism’s adaptation to environmental changes. The adaptive value of the stress system is reactive while that of the circadian system is predictive. Dysfunctions in these two systems may account for many clinically relevant disorders. Despite the evidence that interindividual differences in stress sensitivity and in the functioning of the circadian system are related, there is limited integrated research on these topics. Moreover, sex differences in these systems are poorly investigated. We used the perinatal stress (PRS) rat model, a well-characterized model of maladaptive programming of reactive and predictive adaptation, to examine the relationship of early life stress-by-sex-by-circadian system at the behavioral and molecular level. We monitored the running wheel behavior in male and female adult PRS rats, under a normal light/dark cycle as well as in response to a chronobiological stressor (6-hours phase advance/shift). We then analyzed across different time points the expression of genes involved in circadian clocks, stress response, signaling, and glucose metabolism regulation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In the unstressed control group, we found a sex-specific profile that was either enhanced or inverted by PRS. Also, PRS disrupted circadian wheel-running behavior by inducing a phase advance in the activity of males and hypoactivity in females and increased vulnerability to chronobiological stress in both sexes. We also observed circadian oscillations of several genes in the SCN of the unstressed group in both sexes. PRS affected males to a greater extent than females, with PRS males displaying a pattern similar to unstressed females. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for a specific profile of dysmasculinization induced by PRS at the behavioral and molecular level, thus advocating the necessity to include sex as a biological variable to study the set-up of circadian system in animal models.</content>

 Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is expressed in neurons. However, in a group of neurodegenerative diseases named tauopathies—characterized by an increase in aggregated and/or hyperphosphorylated Tau—the protein accumulates inside other cells, such as astrocytes and microglia. Given that these glial cells do not produce Tau, its presence can be explained by internalization from the extracellular medium and consequent formation of Tau aggregates. Among internalization mechanisms, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have been proposed to be responsible for fibrillary Tau uptake in various cell types. Here we studied whether monomeric Tau, which has been observed to be internalized by glial cells such as microglia, was also taken up by astrocytes. Although this Tau form was internalized from the extracellular medium by these cells, the mechanism of uptake was found to be independent of HSPGs.</content>

 In most task and resting state fMRI studies, a group consensus is often sought, where individual variability is considered a nuisance. None the less, biological variability is an important factor that cannot be ignored and is gaining more attention in the field. One recent development is the individual identification based on static functional connectome. While the original work was based on the static connectome, subsequent efforts using recurrent neural networks (RNN) demonstrated that the inclusion of temporal features greatly improved identification accuracy. Given that convolutional RNN (ConvRNN) seamlessly integrates spatial and temporal features, the present work applied ConvRNN for individual identification with resting state fMRI data. Our result demonstrates ConvRNN achieving a higher identification accuracy than conventional RNN, likely due to better extraction of local features between neighboring ROIs. Furthermore, given that each convolutional output assembles in-place features, they provide a natural way for us to visualize the informative spatial pattern and temporal information, opening up a promising new avenue for analyzing fMRI data.</content>

 Outgroup members (e.g., individuals whose racial identity differs from perceivers’) are stigmatized in Eastern and Western cultures. However, it remains an open question how specific cultural influences affect stigmatization. In this study, we assessed whether cultural learning (i.e., social information acquired from the people in one’s environment) associated with Chinese individuals’ relocation to the United States differentiated the response to multiple outgroups. Two types of cultural learning predict diverging responses to outgroups – awareness of stereotypes about different racial outgroups is associated with increased negative affect and cognitive control towards the stereotyped outgroup. Conversely, intergroup contact attenuates those responses, and does so to a greater extent for individuals from Western cultures. As Chinese-Americans would have had more opportunities to have contact with both White and Black individuals (relative to the Chinese participants), we explored their responses to outgroups as well. Because the neural regions associated with stereotyping and intergroup contact have been well-characterized, we used neuroimaging to disentangle these possibilities. Eighteen White American, 18 Chinese-American, and 17 Chinese participants – who had relocated to the United States less than one year prior – viewed images of Black and White individuals while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants also completed measures of awareness of cultural stereotypes in the United States about Black and White individuals, implicit bias, and experiences with White and Black individuals. Behaviorally, White American and Chinese-American participants had more intergroup contact with either race than did Chinese participants, but there was no effect of participant group on stereotype knowledge or implicit bias. When viewing faces of White (as compared to Black) individuals while undergoing fMRI, White American (relative to Chinese) participants had attenuated activation in regions of the brain associated with cognitive control, including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Chinese-Americans’ neural response to either race did not differ from White American or Chinese participants. Taken together, outgroup biases seemed to emerge in a culturally-dependent way based on variability in intergroup contact, but not necessarily awareness of stereotypes.</content>

 The postnatal development of cerebellar climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje neuron (PN) synapses is characterized by a substantial pruning during the first three weeks after birth, switching from multiple- to single-CF innervation. Previous studies suggested that CF maturation is governed by bidirectional changes of synaptic plasticity. The strengthening of surviving ‘winner’ CFs, which translocate from the PN soma to the dendrite, is thought to be guided by long-term potentiation (LTP), while weakening of to-be-eliminated ‘loser’ CFs, which remain on the soma, was proposed to be due to long-term depression (LTD). However, there are conflicting results from previous studies, whether or not strengthening of winner and weakening of loser CFs during postnatal development is accompanied by changes in short-term plasticity and, thus, whether pre- or postsynaptic forms of LTD and LTP are operational. We, therefore, analyzed the developmental profile of paired-pulse depression (PPD) in ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ CFs in 3- to 21-day old Igsf9-eGFP mice, which allow visual identification of GFP-labeled CFs. We found that in 3-8-day old mice strong CFs are marked by a stronger PPD compared to weak CFs. Surprisingly, PPD of strong CFs eases during maturation, while PPD in weak CFs remains unchanged. This easing of PPD is neither due to changes in presynaptic influx-release coupling nor to an increased saturation of postsynaptic receptors. Thus, our results imply that synaptic contacts of CFs show distinct features of PPD depending on their affiliation to winner or loser CFs and depending on their somatic or dendritic location.</content>

 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) activations induce fast and transient mitochondrial fragmentation under pathophysiological conditions. However, it has been still unknown whether NMDAR or AMPAR activity contributes to mitochondrial dynamics under physiological conditions. In the present study, MK801 (a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist) did not affect mitochondrial length in hippocampal neurons as well as phosphorylation levels of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-serine (S) 616, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and AMPAR. In contrast, perampanel (a non-competitive AMPAR antagonist) elongated mitochondrial length in neurons concomitant with diminishing phosphorylations of DRP1-S616, ERK1/2, and JNK, but not p38 MAPK. Perampanel also reduced protein phosphatase (PP) 1, PP2A and PP2B phosphorylations indicating activations of these PPs, which were unaffected by MK801. U0126 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) elongated mitochondrial length, accompanied by the reduced DRP1-S616 phosphorylation. SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) did not influence mitochondrial length and DRP1 phosphorylations. Okadaic acid (a PP1/PP2A inhibitor) reduced mitochondrial length with the up-regulated DRP1-S616 phosphorylation, while CsA (a PP2B inhibitor) increased it with the elevated DRP1-S637 phosphorylation. Co-treatment of okadaic acid or CsA with perampanel attenuated the reductions in DRP1-S616 and -S637 phosphorylation without changing DRP1 expression level, respectively. GYKI 52466 (another non-competitive AMPAR antagonist) showed the similar effects of perampanel on phosphorylations of DRP1, ERK1/2, JNK, PPs and GluR1 AMPAR subunits. Taken together, our findings suggest that blockade of AMPAR may regulate the cooperation of ERK1/2- and PP1/PP2A for the modulation of DRP1 phosphorylations, which facilitate mitochondrial fusion.</content>

 Since its discovery, the study of the biological role of α‑synuclein and its pathological implications has been the subject of increasing interest. The propensity to adopt different conformational states governing its aggregation and fibrillation makes this small 14 kDa cytosolic protein one of the main etiologic factors associated with degenerative disorders known as synucleinopathies. The structure, function and toxicity of α‑synuclein and the possibility of different therapeutic approaches to target the protein have been extensively investigated and reviewed. One intriguing characteristic of α‑synuclein is the different ways in which it interacts with lipids. Though in-depth studies have been carried out in this field, the information they have produced is puzzling and the precise role of lipids in α‑synuclein biology and pathology and vice versa is still largely unknown. Here we provide an overview and discussion of the main findings relating to α‑synuclein/lipid interaction and its involvement in the modulation of lipid metabolism and signaling.</content>

 Bone marrow megakaryocytes engulf neutrophils in a phenomenon termed emperipolesis. We show here that emperipolesis is a dynamic process mediated actively by both lineages, in part through the β2-integrin/ICAM-1/ezrin pathway. Tethered neutrophils enter in membrane-bound vesicles before penetrating into the megakaryocyte cytoplasm. Intracytoplasmic neutrophils develop membrane contiguity with the demarcation membrane system, thereby transferring membrane to the megakaryocyte and to daughter platelets. This phenomenon occurs in otherwise unmanipulated murine marrow in vivo, resulting in circulating platelets that bear membrane from non-megakaryocytic hematopoietic donors. Transit through megakaryocytes can be completed as rapidly as minutes, after which neutrophils egress intact. Emperipolesis is amplified in models of murine inflammation associated with platelet overproduction, contributing to platelet production in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify emperipolesis as a new cell-in-cell interaction that enables neutrophils and potentially other cells passing through the megakaryocyte cytoplasm to modulate the production and membrane content of platelets.</content>

 The concept of objects is fundamental to cognition and is defined by a consistent set of sensory properties and physical affordances. Although it is unknown how the abstract concept of an object emerges, most accounts assume that visual or haptic boundaries are crucial in this process. Here, we tested an alternative hypothesis that boundaries are not essential but simply reflect a more fundamental principle: consistent visual or haptic statistical properties. Using a novel visuo-haptic statistical learning paradigm, we familiarised participants with objects defined solely by across-scene statistics provided either visually or through physical interactions. We then tested them on both a visual familiarity and a haptic pulling task, thus measuring both within-modality learning and across-modality generalisation. Participants showed strong within-modality learning and 'zero-shot' across-modality generalisation which were highly correlated. Our results demonstrate that humans can segment scenes into objects, without any explicit boundary cues, using purely statistical information.</content>

 Axon degeneration sculpts neuronal connectivity patterns during development and is an early hallmark of several adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Substantial progress has been made in identifying effector mechanisms driving axon fragmentation, but less is known about the upstream signaling pathways that initiate this process. Here, we investigate the behavior of the actin-spectrin-based Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton (MPS), and effects of actin and spectrin manipulations in sensory axon degeneration. We show that trophic deprivation (TD) of mouse sensory neurons causes a rapid disassembly of the axonal MPS, which occurs prior to protein loss and independently of caspase activation. Actin destabilization initiates TD-related retrograde signaling needed for degeneration; actin stabilization prevents MPS disassembly and retrograde signaling during TD. Depletion of βII-spectrin, a key component of the MPS, suppresses retrograde signaling and protects axons against degeneration. These data demonstrate structural plasticity of the MPS and suggest its potential role in early steps of axon degeneration.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained impairments in military service members and veterans. Recent animal studies show that GABA-ergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons are susceptible to brain injury, with damage causing abnormal increases in spontaneous gamma-band (30–80 Hz) activity. We investigated spontaneous gamma activity in individuals with mTBI using high-resolution resting-state magnetoencephalography source imaging. Participants included 25 symptomatic individuals with chronic combat-related blast mTBI and 35 healthy controls with similar combat experiences. Compared with controls, gamma activity was markedly elevated in mTBI participants throughout frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, whereas gamma activity was reduced in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Across groups, greater gamma activity correlated with poorer performances on tests of executive functioning and visuospatial processing. Many neurocognitive associations, however, were partly driven by the higher incidence of mTBI participants with both higher gamma activity and poorer cognition, suggesting that expansive upregulation of gamma has negative repercussions for cognition particularly in mTBI. This is the first human study to demonstrate abnormal resting-state gamma activity in mTBI. These novel findings suggest the possibility that abnormal gamma activities may be a proxy for GABA-ergic interneuron dysfunction and a promising neuroimaging marker of insidious mild head injuries.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A single bout of cardiovascular exercise can enhance plasticity in human cortex; however, the intensity required for optimal enhancement is debated. We investigated the effect of exercise intensity on motor cortex synaptic plasticity, using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Twenty healthy adults (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 35.10 ± 13.25 years) completed three sessions. Measures of cortico-motor excitability (CME) and inhibition were obtained before and after a 20-min bout of either high-intensity interval exercise, moderate-intensity continuous exercise, or rest, and again after intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS). Results showed that high-intensity interval exercise enhanced iTBS plasticity more than rest, evidenced by increased CME and intracortical facilitation, and reduced intracortical inhibition. In comparison, the effect of moderate-intensity exercise was intermediate between high-intensity exercise and rest. Importantly, analysis of each participant’s plasticity response profile indicated that high-intensity exercise increased the likelihood of a facilitatory response to iTBS. We also established that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;Met polymorphism attenuated plasticity responses following high-intensity exercise. These findings suggest that high-intensity interval exercise should be considered not only when planning exercise interventions designed to enhance neuroplasticity, but also to maximize the therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation. Additionally, genetic profiling may enhance efficacy of exercise interventions for brain health.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 Evidence suggests that amyloid β is highly toxic to synapses in a phospho-Tau-dependent manner. Here, I present a hypothesis that links previous evidence from the first rise of amyloid β through to Tau tangles and neurodegeneration. In the immediate vicinity of plaques, concentrated soluble amyloid β occurs in equilibrium with deposited forms. Initially, plaques cover only a small percentage of brain volume. Microglia, by efficiently removing damaged synapses, may prevent spread of damage along the axon, restricting damage to the immediate vicinity of plaques.</content>

Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are driven by both common and distinct underlying mechanisms of pathobiology. Both diseases, exhibit heterogeneity underscored by the variable clinical responses to therapeutic interventions.
We aimed to identify disease-driving pathways and classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their pathobiology and response to treatment.
We applied hierarchical clustering of enrichment scores derived from gene set variation analysis of signatures representative of various immunological processes and activated cell types, to a colonic biopsy dataset that included healthy volunteers, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Patient stratification at baseline or after anti-TNF treatment in clinical responders and non-responders was queried. Signatures with significantly different enrichment scores were identified using a general linear model. Comparisons to healthy controls were made at baseline in all participants and then separately in responders and non-responders. Fifty-nine percent of the signatures were commonly enriched in both conditions at baseline, supporting the notion of a disease continuum within ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Signatures included T cells, macrophages, neutrophil activation and poly:IC signatures, representing acute inflammation and a complex mix of potential disease-driving biology. Collectively, identification of significantly enriched signatures allowed establishment of an inflammatory bowel disease molecular activity score which uses biopsy transcriptomics as a surrogate marker to accurately track disease severity. This score separated diseased from healthy samples, enabled discrimination of clinical responders and non-responders at baseline with 100% specificity and 78.8% sensitivity, and was validated in an independent data set that showed comparable classification. Comparing responders and non-responders separately at baseline to controls, 43% and 70% of signatures were enriched, respectively, suggesting greater molecular dysregulation in TNF non-responders at baseline. This methodological approach could facilitate better targeted design of clinical studies to test therapeutics, concentrating on patient subsets sharing similar underlying pathobiology, therefore increasing the likelihood of clinical response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BHO71DBxWqw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 To permit the recognition of antigens, T cells generate a vast diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) sequences. Upon binding of the TCR to an antigen–MHC complex, T cells clonally expand to establish an immune response. To study antigen-specific T cell clonality, we have developed a method that allows selection...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/-SwMr8rv6OA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Thoracic paravertebral sympathetic chain postganglionic neurons (tSPNs) comprise the final integrative output of the distributed sympathetic nervous system controlling vascular and thermoregulatory systems. Considered a non-integrating relay, what little is known of tSPN intrinsic excitability has been determined by sharp microelectrodes with presumed impalement injury. We thus undertook the first electrophysiological characterization of tSPN cellular properties using whole-cell recordings and coupled results with a conductance-based model to explore the principles governing their excitability in adult mice of both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recorded membrane resistance and time constant values were an order of magnitude greater than values previously obtained, leading to a demonstrable capacity for synaptic integration in driving recruitment. Variation in membrane resistivity was the primary determinant controlling cell excitability with vastly lower currents required for tSPN recruitment. Unlike previous microelectrode recordings in mouse which observed inability to sustain firing, all tSPNs were capable of repetitive firing. Computational modeling demonstrated that observed differences are explained by introduction of a microelectrode impalement injury conductance. Overall, tSPNs largely linearly encoded injected current magnitudes over a broad frequency range with distinct subpopulations differentiable based on repetitive firing signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, whole-cell recordings reveal tSPNs have more dramatically amplified excitability than previously thought, with greater intrinsic capacity for synaptic integration and with the ability for maintained firing to support sustained actions on vasomotor tone and thermoregulatory function. Rather than acting as a relay, these studies support a more responsive role and possible intrinsic capacity for tSPNs to drive sympathetic autonomic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Thoracic sympathetic postganglionic neurons (tSPNs) represent the final neural output for control of vasomotor and thermoregulatory function. We used whole-cell-recordings and computational modeling to provide broad insight on intrinsic cellular mechanisms controlling excitability and capacity for synaptic integration. Compared to past intracellular recordings using microelectrode impalement, we observed dramatically higher membrane resistivity with primacy in controlling enhanced tSPN excitability and recruitment via synaptic integration. Compared to reported phasic firing, all tSPNs fire repetitively and linearly encode injected current magnitude to firing frequency over a broad range. Modeling studies suggest microelectrode impalement injury accounts for differences in tSPN properties previously observed. Overall, intrinsic tSPN excitability plays a much greater role in the integration and maintenance of sympathetic output than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;It is not known why there is increased risk to have seizures with increased anxiety and stress after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Stressors cause the release of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) both from the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and from CNS neurons located in the central amygdala and GABAergic interneurons. We have previously shown that CRF signaling is plastic, becoming excitatory instead of inhibitory after the kindling model of epilepsy. Here, using Sprague-Dawley rats we have found that CRF signaling increased excitability after TBI. Following TBI, CRF type 1 receptor (CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) mediated activity caused abnormally large electrical responses in the amygdala including fast ripples which are considered to be epileptogenic. After TBI, we also found the ripple (120 Hz-250 Hz) and fast ripple activity (&amp;gt; 250 Hz) was cross frequency coupled with theta (3-8 Hz) oscillations. CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists reduced the incidence of phase coupling between ripples and fast ripples. Our observations indicate that pathophysiological signaling of the CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; increases the incidence of epileptiform activity after TBI. The use for CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist may be useful to reduce the severity and frequency of TBI associated epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The combination of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stress is known to increase the likelihood of post traumatic epilepsy. Here we show after moderate TBI that CRF increases the excitability of a number of limbic regions in the rat. In particular a tail pinch stress causes epileptiform activity that is characterized by the occurrence of fast ripples that are phase amplitude coupled to theta rhythm. This activity is blocked by CRF receptor 1 antagonist. Our data provide a possible mechanism by which stress exacerbates epileptiform activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Currently there is no effective therapy available for cognitive impairments in Down syndrome (DS), one of the most prevalent forms of mental retardation in humans associated with the chromosomes 21 trisomy. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that maintains glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion. Its natural cleavage product GLP-1 (9-36) lacks insulinotropic effects and has a low binding affinity for GLP-1 receptors (GLP1Rs); thus, GLP-1 (9-36) has historically been identified as an inactive metabolite. Conversely, recent work has demonstrated interesting physiological properties of GLP-1 (9-36) such as cardioprotection and neuroprotection. We have previously shown that GLP-1 (9-36) administration enhances neuronal plasticity in young WT mice and ameliorates cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD. Here, we report that systemic administration of GLP-1 (9-36) in Ts65Dn DS model mice of either sex resulted in decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress in hippocampus and improved dendritic spine morphology – increase of mature spines and reduction of immature spines. Importantly, these molecular alterations translated into functional changes in that long-term potentiation (LTP) failure and cognitive impairments in TsDn65 DS model mice were rescued with GLP-1 (9-36) treatment. We also show that chronic GLP-1 (9-36) treatment did not alter glucose tolerance in either WT or DS model mice. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 (9-36) treatment may have therapeutic potential for DS and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with increased neuronal oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Presently no effective treatment exists for cognitive defects in Down syndrome (DS), one of the most common forms of mental retardation. Here, we studied the effect of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) cleavage product, GLP-1 (9-36), on an established mouse model of DS. We found that GLP-1 (9-36) treatment significantly improved DS-associated memory deficits and synaptic plasticity impairments. Consistently, GLP-1 (9-36) treatment in DS model mice led to decreased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improved dendritic spine morphology. Our findings indicate that GLP-1 (9-36) may have therapeutic potential to improve memory and cognition in DS and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with increased neuronal oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic deep brain stimulation may alleviate bradykinesia in Parkinson patients. Research suggests that this stimulation effect may be mediated by brain networks like the corticocerebellar loop. This study investigated the connectivity between stimulation sites and cortical and subcortical structures to identify connections for effective stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively investigated 21 patients with Parkinson disease with bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation. Stimulation effectiveness in reducing bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity was evaluated for each electrode contact in brain hemispheres contralateral to the affected hemibody. Dysarthric side effects were also examined. Probabilistic tractography based on diffusion‐weighted imaging was performed in individual patient‐specific brains using electrode contacts as seeds. Connectivity profiles of contacts with effective and noneffective stimulation were compared.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connectivity profiles of effective and noneffective contacts differed. Moreover, the connectivity profile for bradykinesia differed from that for rigidity, tremor, or dysarthria. Regarding bradykinesia, effective contacts were significantly more often connected with the ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncle and the ipsilateral dentate nucleus, which correspond to the ipsilateral portion of the cerebellothalamocortical pathway. Rigidity was mitigated by stimulation of ascending brainstem and intralaminar thalamic connections. Tremor alleviation was related to connections with the internal capsule (anterior limb) and the pallidum. Dysarthric side effects were associated with connections to the supplementary motor area and the decussating cerebellothalamocortical pathway.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas bradykinesia seems to be mitigated by stimulation of the ascending, ipsilateral cerebellothalamocortical pathway, stimulation of the descending corticopontocerebellar pathway may be ineffective. Rigidity, tremor, and dysarthric side effects seem to be influenced by different neural networks. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the longitudinal course of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in women with a history of migraine in comparison to women without a history of migraine disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study sample consisted of 467 women with a self‐reported prior migraine diagnosis and 2,466 women without prior migraine diagnosis who were assessed longitudinally during menopausal transition as part of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Linear mixed regression models with backward elimination were used to evaluate longitudinal associations between VMS and migraine while adjusting for baseline and time‐varying demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and reproductive factors. Additional analyses were performed to further assess the specificity of the association between migraine and VMS that included evaluating the association between migraine and vaginal dryness and between back pain and VMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A history of migraine predicted an increased frequency of VMS but not vaginal dryness during menopausal transition. Significant interaction between history of migraine and menopausal status for the prediction of VMS was also identified. Burden of VMS was found to be higher during late‐stage perimenopause in women with migraine. In contrast, the history of back pain did not predict the frequency of VMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to delineate that a history of migraine predicts an increased frequency of VMS in women during menopausal transition. Hypothalamic abnormalities and thermoregulatory dysfunction against a milieu of decreasing estradiol concentrations during menopausal transition may explain the increased frequency of VMS in migraineurs during menopausal transition.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared outcomes after treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a recent cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an individual patient data analysis of seven prospective cohort studies. We included patients with AF and a recent cerebral ischemia (&amp;lt;3 months before starting oral anticoagulation) and a minimum follow‐up of 3 months. We analyzed the association between type of anticoagulation (DOAC versus VKA) with the composite primary endpoint (recurrent ischemic stroke [AIS], intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], or mortality) using mixed‐effects Cox proportional hazards regression models; we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 4,912 patients (median age, 78 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 71–84]; 2,331 [47.5%] women; median National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scale at onset, 5 [IQR, 2–12]); 2,256 (45.9%) patients received VKAs and 2,656 (54.1%) DOACs. Median time from index event to starting oral anticoagulation was 5 days (IQR, 2–14) for VKAs and 5 days (IQR, 2–11) for DOACs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.53). There were 262 acute ischemic strokes (AISs; 4.4%/year), 71 intracranial hemorrrhages (ICHs; 1.2%/year), and 439 deaths (7.4%/year) during the total follow‐up of 5,970 patient‐years. Compared to VKAs, DOAC treatment was associated with reduced risks of the composite endpoint (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67–1.00; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05) and ICH (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24–0.71; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); we found no differences for the risk of recurrent AIS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.70–1.19; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5) and mortality (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.03; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.09).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOAC treatment commenced early after recent cerebral ischemia related to AF was associated with reduced risk of poor clinical outcomes compared to VKA, mainly attributed to lower risks of ICH. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traditional mathematical approaches to studying analytically the dynamics of
neural networks rely on the mean-field approximation, which is rigorously
applicable only to networks of infinite size. However, all existing real
biological networks have finite size, and many of them, such as microscopic
circuits in invertebrates, are composed only of a few tens of neurons. Thus, it
is important to be able to extend to small-size networks our ability to study
analytically neural dynamics. Analytical solutions of the dynamics of
finite-size neural networks have remained elusive for many decades, because the
powerful methods of statistical analysis, such as the central limit theorem and
the law of large numbers, do not apply to small networks. In this article, we
critically review recent progress on the study of the dynamics of small
networks composed of binary neurons. In particular, we review the mathematical
techniques we developed for studying the bifurcations of the network dynamics,
the dualism between neural activity and membrane potentials, cross-neuron
correlations, and pattern storage in stochastic networks. Finally, we highlight
key challenges that remain open, future directions for further progress, and
possible implications of our results for neuroscience.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Human categorization is one of the most important and successful targets of
cognitive modeling in psychology, yet decades of development and assessment of
competing models have been contingent on small sets of simple, artificial
experimental stimuli. Here we extend this modeling paradigm to the domain of
natural images, revealing the crucial role that stimulus representation plays
in categorization and its implications for conclusions about how people form
categories. Applying psychological models of categorization to natural images
required two significant advances. First, we conducted the first large-scale
experimental study of human categorization, involving over 500,000 human
categorization judgments of 10,000 natural images from ten non-overlapping
object categories. Second, we addressed the traditional bottleneck of
representing high-dimensional images in cognitive models by exploring the best
of current supervised and unsupervised deep and shallow machine learning
methods. We find that selecting sufficiently expressive, data-driven
representations is crucial to capturing human categorization, and using these
representations allows simple models that represent categories with abstract
prototypes to outperform the more complex memory-based exemplar accounts of
categorization that have dominated in studies using less naturalistic stimuli.

 &lt;p&gt;In this work we study biological neural networks from an algorithmic
perspective, focusing on understanding tradeoffs between computation time and
network complexity. Our goal is to abstract real neural networks in a way that,
while not capturing all interesting features, preserves high-level behavior and
allows us to make biologically relevant conclusions. Towards this goal, we
consider the implementation of algorithmic primitives in a simple yet
biologically plausible model of $stochastic\ spiking\ neural\ networks$. In
particular, we show how the stochastic behavior of neurons in this model can be
leveraged to solve a basic $symmetry-breaking\ task$ in which we are given
neurons with identical firing rates and want to select a distinguished one. In
computational neuroscience, this is known as the winner-take-all (WTA) problem,
and it is believed to serve as a basic building block in many tasks, e.g.,
learning, pattern recognition, and clustering. We provide efficient
constructions of WTA circuits in our stochastic spiking neural network model,
as well as lower bounds in terms of the number of auxiliary neurons required to
drive convergence to WTA in a given number of steps. These lower bounds
demonstrate that our constructions are near-optimal in some cases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work covers and gives more in-depth proofs of a subset of results
originally published in [LMP17a]. It is adapted from the last chapter of C.
Musco's Ph.D. thesis [Mus18].

 &lt;p&gt;Cyborg in the brain-machine interface field has attracted more attention in
recent years. To control a creature via a machine called cyborg method, three
stages are considerable: stimulation of neurons, neural response, and the
behavioral reaction of the subject. Our main concern was to know how electrical
stimulation induces neural activity and leads to a behavioral response.
Additionally, we were interested to explore which type of electrical
stimulation is optimal from different aspects such as maximum response with
minimum induction stimulus field, minimum damage of the tissue and the
electrode, reduction of the noxiousness of stimuli or pain in the living
creature. In this article, we proposed a new model for the induction of neural
activity led to locomotion responses through electrical stimulation.
Furthermore, based on this model, we developed a new approach of electrical
neural stimulation to provide a better locomotion control of living beings.
This approach was verified through the empirical data of fish cyborg. We
stimulated the fish brain by use of an ultra-high frequency signal which
careered by a random low frequency. According to our model, we could control
the locomotion of fish in a novel and innovative way. In this study, we
categorized the different cyborg methods based on the nervous system areas and
the stimulation signal properties to reach the better and optimal behavioral
control of creature. According to this, we proposed a new stimulation method
theoretically and confirmed it experimentally.

		<content type="html">
 Globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurons in the basal ganglia are traditionally thought to play a significant role in the promotion and suppression of movement via a change in firing rates. Here, we hypothesize that a primary mechanism of movement control by GPi neurons is through specific modulations in their oscillatory patterns. We analyzed neuronal spiking activity of 83 GPi neurons recorded from two healthy nonhuman primates executing a radial center-out motor task. We found that, in directionally tuned neurons, the power in the gamma band is significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) greater than that in the beta band (a ‘cross-over’ effect), during the planning stages of movements in their preferred direction. This cross-over effect is not observed in the non-directionally tuned neurons or when tuned neurons are aligned to their non-preferred direction. These data suggest that, during movement planning, information encoding by GPi neurons may be governed by a sudden emergence and suppression of oscillatory activities, rather than simply by a change in average firing rates.</content>

 UBE3A is a gene implicated in the neurodevelopmental disorders. The protein product of UBE3A is the E3 ligase E6AP, and its expression in the brain is uniquely regulated via genetic imprinting. Loss of E6AP expression leads to the development of Angelman syndrome, clinically characterized by lack of speech, abnormal motor development, and the presence of seizures. Conversely, copy number variations (CNVs) that result in the overexpression of E6AP are strongly associated with the development of ASDs, defined by decreased communication, impaired social interest, and increased repetitive behavior. In this review, we focus on the neurobiological function of Ube3A/E6AP. As an E3 ligase, many functional target proteins of E6AP have been discovered, including p53, Arc, Ephexin5, and SK2. On a neuronal level, E6AP is widely expressed within the cell, including dendritic arbors, spines, and the nucleus. E6AP regulates neuronal morphological maturation, and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and cortical development. These molecular findings provide insight into our understanding of the molecular events underlying AS and ASDs.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease with high rates of mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to explore whether Sodium Benzoate (NaB) could reduce neural cell apoptosis and alleviate neurological deficits after ICH. To assess the therapeutic effects of NaB, first, we measured brain water content, neurobehavior, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity at 24 h after ICH in different groups. Then western blot and immunofluorescence staining (IF) were applied to test the levels of different proteins. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe ultra-structures within the cells in different groups. The results showed that levels of DJ-1, p-Akt and p-IκB kinase (IKK) increased after ICH and peaked at 24 h. Besides, NaB significantly upregulated DJ-1 in both cytoplasm and mitochondria, and also increased the levels of p-Akt, p-IKK and Bcl-2/Bax ratio, but decreased the levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Additionally, NaB decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) while increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which then improving the neurological functions at 24 h and long-term (21 days) memory and spatial learning ability after ICH. However, the results mentioned above could be greatly reversed by MK2206 and rotenone. Therefore, we concluded that NaB could attenuate secondary brain injury via inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and reducing mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress via DJ-1/Akt/IKK/NFκB pathway.</content>

 This study investigated the degree of brain functional impairment in persistent somatoform pain disorder (PSPD) by examining changes in the patterns of brain functional hubs by degree centrality (DC) analysis as well as the connectivity among these hubs by functional connectivity (FC) analysis and Granger causality analysis (GCA). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 21 PSPD patients with headache as the main symptom and 17 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. DC, seed-based FC, and GCA were performed to characterize abnormal brain networks in PSPD (Gaussian random field corrected: P &amp;lt; 0.001, Z &amp;gt; 3.09). The relationships between DC and connectivity and clinical parameters were also examined. DC values in the bilateral inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), bilateral calcarine fissure (CAL), and left paracentral lobule (PCL) and FC values of right IOG–left CAL, right IOG–right CAL, right IOG–left IOG, left CAL–right CAL, left CAL–left IOG, left CAL–left PCL, right CAL–left PCL, and left IOG–left PCL were lower in PSPD patients as compared to controls. A negative causal effect from the left CAL to the left paracentral lobule and a positive effect from the right CAL to the right IOG were observed in PSPD patients. Abnormal DC, FC, and signed-path coefﬁcients in PSPD patients were negatively correlated with self-rating anxiety and depression scale scores. These results indicate that altered functional hubs and connectivity patterns in the somatosensory cortex may reflect emotional disturbance in PSPD patients.</content>

 The selection of the appropriate hemodynamic response function (HRF) for signal modeling in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is important. Although the use of the boxcar-shaped hemodynamic response function (BHRF) and canonical hemodynamic response (CHRF) has gained increasing popularity in rodent fMRI studies, whether the selected HRF affects the results of rodent fMRI has not been fully elucidated. Here we investigated the signal change and t-statistic sensitivities of BHRF, CHRF, and impulse response function (IRF). The effect of HRF selection on different tasks was analyzed by using data collected from two groups of rats receiving either 3 mA whisker pad or 3 mA forepaw electrical stimulations (n = 10 for each group). Under whisker pad stimulation with large blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal change (4.31% ± 0.42%), BHRF significantly underestimated signal changes (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and t-statistics (P &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with CHRF or IRF. CHRF and IRF did not provide significantly different t-statistics (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Under forepaw stimulation with small BOLD signal change (1.71% ± 0.34%), different HRFs provided insignificantly different t-statistics (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Therefore, the selected HRF can influence data analysis in rodent fMRI experiments with large BOLD responses but not in those with small BOLD responses.</content>

 Background: Significant progress towards the recovery of useful vision in blind patients with severe degenerative retinal diseases caused by photoreceptor death has been achieved with the development of visual prostheses that stimulate the retina electrically. However, currently used prostheses do not provide feedback about the retinal activity before and upon stimulation and do not adjust to changes during the remodeling processes in the retina. Both features are desirable to improve the efficiency of the electrical stimulation therapy offered by these devices. Accordingly, devices that not only enable electrical stimulation but at the same time provide information about the retinal activity are required. Given the above, a bidirectional communication strategy, in which inner retinal cells are stimulated and the output neurons of the retina, the ganglion cells, are recorded using penetrating microelectrode arrays (MEAs) is proposed.  Methods: Custom-made penetrating MEAs with four silicon-based shanks, each one with three or four iridium oxide electrodes were used to record the activity of light-adapted wildtype mice retinas and degenerated retinas from rd10 mice in vitro. In addition, responses to high potassium concentration and to light stimulation in wildtype retinas were examined. Furthermore, voltage-controlled electrical stimulation was performed. Results: The spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells was recorded at different depths of penetration inside the retina. Physiological responses during an increase of the extracellular potassium concentration and phasic and tonic responses during light stimulation were captured. Moreover, pathologic rhythmic activity was recorded from degenerated retinas. Finally, electrical stimulation of the inner retina and simultaneous recording of the activity of retinal ganglion cells was accomplished. Conclusions: The access to different layers of the retina with penetrating electrodes while recording at the same time the spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells broadens the use and the field of action of multi-shank and multi-site penetrating MEAs for retinal applications. It enables a bidirectional strategy to stimulate inner retinal cells electrically and to record from the spiking retinal ganglion cells simultaneously (BiMEA). This opens the possibility of a feedback loop system to acknowledge the success of electrical stimulation carried out by retinal prostheses.</content>

 In-ear EEG offers a promising path toward usable, discreet brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for both healthy individuals and persons with disabilities. To test the promise of this modality, we produced a brain-based authentication system using custom-fit EEG earpieces. In a sample of N=7 participants, we demonstrated that our system has high accuracy, higher than prior work using non-custom earpieces. We demonstrated that both inherence and knowledge factors contribute to authentication accuracy, and performed a simulated attack to show our system's robustness against impersonation. From an authentication standpoint, our system provides three factors of authentication in a single step. From a usability standpoint, our system does not require a cumbersome, head-worn device.</content>

 Lower back problems are common in the world, which leads to the development of various lumbar support exoskeletons to alleviate this problem. In general, previous studies evaluating lumbar support devices quantified assistance by reporting the reduction in back muscle activity and perceived fatigue. However, despite the beneficial effects of such devices, the effects of using such exoskeletons on muscle coordination are not well-studied. In this study, we examined the short-term change in muscle coordination of subjects using a bioelectrically-controlled lumbar support exoskeleton in a fatiguing stoop lifting task with muscle synergy analysis. Results indicate that muscle coordination changes were dominated by changes in timing coefficients, with minimal change in muscle synergy vectors. Analysis on muscle coordination changes would be useful to design future generations of exoskeletons.</content>

 Basic and applied research are increasingly adopting transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) for modulating perceptual, cognitive, affective, and motor processes. Industry and defense applications of tES hold potential for accelerating training and knowledge acquisition and sustaining work-related performance in the face of fatigue, workload, and stress. This mini-review describes the promises and perils of tES, and reviews research testing its influence on two broad applied areas: sustaining and dividing attention, and operating in virtual environments. Also included is a discussion of challenges related to viable mechanistic explanations for tES effectiveness, attempts at replication and consideration of null results, and the potential importance of individual differences in predicting tES influences on human performance. Finally, future research directions are proposed to address these challenges and help develop a fuller understanding of tES viability for enhancing real-world performance.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Facial attractiveness refers to a positive and joyful emotional experience induced by the face of a target person and the extent to which other people are driven to be close to their wishes. Since the 1970s, face attractiveness has gradually emerged in western psychological research, but most of the studies were confined to heterosexuals. More recently, some scholars have pointed out that sexual orientation may affect the judgment of facial attractiveness of individuals. Based on previous literature, this study proposed to explore the different facial attractiveness of individuals with different sexual orientation and sexual roles. Participants in this study were divided into two types (according to sexual orientation and sexual role) by the Sex Role Inventory for College Students (CSRI). Also, the eye-tracking technique was used to record the path of eye movements, where face images were manipulated by sexual dimorphism clues. The results showed that (1) compared to heterosexual men, homosexual men were significantly more likely to choose masculine faces as more attractive faces in paired faces; (2) male homosexuals are likely to have the feminization bias, and female homosexuals are likely to have the masculinization bias; (3) The masculine faces are more attractive than feminine faces to participants whose sex role in feminine type and androgynous type.</content>

 Brain models music as a hierarchy of dynamical systems that encode probability distributions and complexity (i.e., entropy and uncertainty). Through musical experience over lifetime, a human is intrinsically motivated in optimizing the internalized probabilistic model for efficient information processing and the uncertainty resolution, which has been regarded as rewords. Human’s behavior, however, appears to be not necessarily directing to efficiency but sometimes act inefficiently in order to explore a maximum rewards of uncertainty resolution. Previous studies suggest that the drive for novelty seeking behavior (high uncertain phenomenon) reflects human’s curiosity, and that the curiosity rewards encourage humans to create and learn new regularities. That is to say, although brain generally minimizes uncertainty of music structure, we sometimes derive pleasure from music with uncertain structure due to curiosity for novelty seeking behavior by which we anticipate the resolution of uncertainty. Few studies, however, investigated how curiosity for uncertain and novelty seeking behavior modulates musical creativity. The present study investigated how the probabilistic model and the uncertainty in music fluctuate over a composer’s lifetime (all of the 32 piano sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven). In the late periods of the composer’s lifetime, the transitional probabilities (TPs) of sequential patterns that ubiquitously appear in all of his music (familiar phrase) were decreased, whereas the uncertainties of the whole structure were increased. Furthemore, these findings were prominent in higher-, rather than lower-, order models of TP distribution. This may suggest that the higher-order probabilistic model is susceptible to experience and psychological phenomena over the composer’s lifetime. The present study first suggested the fluctuation of uncertainty of musical structure over a composer’s lifetime. It is suggested that human’s curiosity for uncertain and novelty seeking behavior may modulate optimization and creativity in human’s brain.</content>

 ADAM10, a member of the disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM) family, has been reported to mediate proteolytic shedding of cell surface proteins. An increasing body of evidence indicates that ADAM10 is involved in various neurological disorders including epilepsy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ADAM10 expression in the epileptic brain remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ADAM10 is targeted by microRNA-23a (miR-23a) in the hippocampus. Inhibition of miR-23a increased hippocampal ADAM10 expression while an increase in miR-23a suppressed hippocampal ADAM10 expression in pilocarpine-induced Status Epilepticus (SE) mice. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-23a suppressed spontaneous recurrent seizures through upregulation of ADAM10 in pilocarpine-induced SE mice. Our findings suggest that miR-23a targeting of ADAM10 contributes to epileptogenesis in temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, the miR-23a-ADAM10 pathway in the epileptic brain may provide a novel target for the treatment of epilepsy.</content>

 Current anti-seizure drugs (ASDs) are believed to reduce neuronal excitability through modulation of ion channels and transporters that regulate excitability at the synaptic level. While most patients with epilepsy respond to ASDs, many remain refractory to medical treatment but respond favorably to a high-fat, low-carbohydrate metabolism-based therapy known as the ketogenic diet (KD). The clinical effectiveness of the KD has increasingly underscored the thesis that metabolic factors also play a crucial role in the dampening neuronal hyperexcitability that is a hallmark feature of epilepsy. This notion is further amplified by the clinical utility of other related metabolism-based diets such as the modified Atkins diet and the low-glycemic index treatment (LGIT). Traditional high-fat diets are characterized by enhanced fatty acid oxidation (which produces ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate) and a reduction in glycolytic flux, whereas the LGIT is predicated mainly on the latter observation of reduced blood glucose levels. As dietary implementation is not without challenges regarding clinical administration and patient compliance, there is an inherent desire and need to determine whether specific metabolic substrates and/or enzymes might afford similar clinical benefits, hence validating the concept of a “diet in a pill”. Here, we discuss the evidence for one glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and one metabolic substrate, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exerting direct effects on neuronal excitability, highlight their mechanistic differences, and provide the strengthening scientific rationale for their individual or possibly combined use in the clinical arena of seizure management.</content>

 Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide, yet there are currently no effective treatments. Because risk of neurodegenerative disease substantially increases with age, greater life expectancy with a concomitant aging population means more individuals will be affected in the coming decades. Thus, there is an urgent need for understanding the mechanisms driving neurodegenerative diseases in order to develop improved treatment strategies. Inflammation in the nervous system, termed “neuroinflammation,” has become increasingly recognized as being associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Early attention focused primarily on morphological changes in astrocytes and microglia; however, brain and CNS resident mast cells are now receiving attention as a result of being ‘first responders’ to injury. Mast cells also exert profound effects on their microenvironment and neighboring cells including behavior and/or activation of astrocytes, microglia and neurons, which, in turn, are implicated in neuroinflammation, neurogenesis and neurodegeneration. Mast cells also affect disruption/permeability of the blood brain barrier enabling toxin and immune cell entry exacerbating an inflammatory microenvironment. Here we discuss the roles of mast cells in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration with a focus on development and progression of four prominent neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Huntington’s Disease.</content>

 Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental encephalopathy caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene and characterized by early-onset epilepsy and intellectual and motor impairments. No cure is currently available for CDD patients, as limited knowledge of the pathology has hindered the development of therapeutics. Cdkl5 knockout (KO) mouse models, recently created to investigate the role of CDKL5 in the etiology of CDD, recapitulate various features of the disorder. Previous studies have shown alterations in synaptic plasticity and dendritic pattern in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus, but the knowledge of the molecular substrates underlying these alterations is still limited. Here, we have examined for the first time synaptic function and plasticity, dendritic morphology, and signal transduction pathways in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) of this mouse model. Being interconnected with a wide range of cortical and subcortical structures and involved in various cognitive processes, PRC provides a very interesting framework for examining how CDKL5 mutation leads to deficits at the synapse, circuit, and behavioral level. We found that long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired, and that the TrkB/PLCγ1 pathway could be mechanistically involved in this alteration. PRC neurons in mutant mice showed a reduction in dendritic length, dendritic branches, PSD-95-positive puncta, GluA2-AMPA receptor levels, and spine density and maturation. These functional and structural deficits were associated with impairment in visual recognition memory. Interestingly, an in vivo treatment with a TrkB agonist (the 7,8-DHF prodrug R13) to trigger the TrkB/PLCγ1 pathway rescued defective LTP, dendritic pattern, PSD-95 and GluA2-AMPA receptor levels, and restored visual recognition memory in Cdkl5 KO mice. Present findings demonstrate a critical role of TrkB signaling in the synaptic development alterations due to CDKL5 mutation, and suggest the possibility of TrkB-targeted pharmacological interventions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Excessive alcohol consumption is often linked to anxiety states and has a major relay center in the anterior part of bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST). We analyzed the impact of (i) genetic predisposition to high alcohol preference and consumption, and (ii) alcohol intake on anterior BNST, namely anterolateral (AL), anteromedial (AM), and anteroventral (lateral + medial subdivisions: AVl, AVm) subnuclei. We used two rat lines selectively bred for low- and high- alcohol preference and consumption, named Sardinian alcohol-non preferring (sNP) and -preferring (sP), respectively, the latter showing also inherent anxiety-related behaviors. We analyzed the modulation of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; exerting anxiogenic effects in BNST), neuropeptide Y (NPY; exerting mainly anxiolytic effects), and microglia activation (neuroinflammation marker, thought to increase anxiety).
CGRP-immunofluorescent fibers/terminals did not differ between alcohol-naive sP and sNP rats. Fiber/terminal NPY-immunofluorescent intensity was lower in BNST-AM and BNST-AVm of alcohol-naive sP rats. Activation of microglia (revealed by morphological analysis) was decreased in BNST-AM and increased in BNST-AVm of alcohol-naive sP rats. 
Prolonged (30 consecutive days), voluntary alcohol intake under the homecage 2-bottle “alcohol vs water” regimen strongly increased CGRP intensity in BNST of sP rats in a subnucleus-specific manner: in BNST-AL, BNST-AVm, and BNST-AM. CGRP area sum, however, decreased in BNST-AM, without changes in other subnuclei. Alcohol consumption increased NPY expression, in a subnucleus-specific manner, in BNST-AL, BNST-AVl, and BNST-AVm. Alcohol consumption increased many size/shape parameters in microglial cells, indicative of microglia de-activation. Finally, microglia density was increased in ventral anterior BNST (BNST-AVl, BNST-AVm) by alcohol consumption. 
In conclusion, genetic predisposition of sP rats to high alcohol intake could be in part mediated by anterior BNST subnuclei showing lower NPY expression and differential microglia activation. Alcohol intake in sP rats produced complex subnucleus-specific changes in BNST, affecting CGRP/NPY expression and microglia and leading to hypothesize that these changes might contribute to the anxiolytic effects of voluntarily consumed alcohol repeatedly observed in sP rats.</content>

 The mouse somatosensory cortex is an excellent model to study the structural basis of cortical information processing, since it possesses anatomically recognizable domains that receive different thalamic inputs, which indicates spatial segregation of different processing tasks. In this work we examined three genetically labeled, non-overlapping subpopulations of GABAergic neurons: parvalbumin- (PV+), somatostatin- (SST+) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) cells. Each of these subpopulations displayed a unique cellular distribution pattern across layers. In terms of columnar localization, the distribution of these three populations was not quantitatively different between barrel-related versus septal compartments in most layers. However, in layer IV, SST+ and VIP+, but not PV+ neurons preferred the septal compartment over barrels. The examined cell types showed a tendency toward differential distribution in supragranular and infragranular barrel-related versus septal compartments, too. Our data suggests that the location of GABAergic neuron cell bodies correlates with the spatial pattern of cortical domains receiving different kinds of thalamic input. Thus, at least in layer IV, lemniscal inputs present a close spatial relation preferentially to PV+ cells whereas paralemniscal inputs target compartments in which more SST+ and VIP+ cells are localized. Our findings suggest pathway-specific roles for neocortical GABAergic neurons.</content>

 Background Disruptions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow during aging could compromise protein clearance from the brain and contribute to the etiology of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).  Objective To determine whether CSF flow is associated with cognitive deficit in elderly patients (&amp;gt;70 years).  Methods We studied 92 patients admitted to our geriatric unit for non-acute reasons using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) to calculate their ventricular and spinal CSF flow, and assessed their global cognitive status, memory, executive functions and praxis. Multivariable regressions with backward selection (criterion p&amp;lt;0.15) were performed to determine associations between cognitive tests and ventricular and spinal CSF flow, adjusting for depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular risk factors. Results  The cohort comprised 71 women (77%) and 21 (33%) men, aged 84.1±5.2 years (range, 73¬–96). Net ventricular CSF flow was 52±40µL/cc (range, 0¬–210), and net spinal CSF flow was 500±295µL/cc (range, 0–1420). Ventricular CSF flow was associated with the number of BEC96 figures recognized (β=0.18, CI, 0.02–0.33; p=0.025). Spinal CSF flow was associated with the WAIS Digit Span Backward test (β=0.06, CI, 0.01–0.12; p=0.034), and categoric verbal fluency (β=0.53, CI, 0.07–0.98; p=0.024) and semantic verbal fluency (β=0.55, CI, 0.07–1.02; p=0.024).  Conclusions Patients with lower CSF flow had significantly worse memory, visuo-constructive capacities, and verbal fluency. Alterations in CSF flow could contribute to some of the cognitive deficit observed in patients with AD. Diagnosis and treatment of CSF flow alterations in geriatric patients with neurocognitive disorders could contribute to the prevention of their cognitive decline.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) mutations are the primary cause of Rett syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Cortical parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons (PV) make exuberant somatic connections onto pyramidal cells in the visual cortex of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt;-deficient mice, which contributes to silencing neuronal cortical circuits. This phenotype can be rescued independently of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; by environmental, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation. It remains unknown how &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; mutation can result in abnormal inhibitory circuit refinement. In the present manuscript, we examined the development of GABAergic circuits in the primary visual cortex of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt;-deficient mice. We identified that PV circuits were the only GABAergic interneurons to be upregulated, while other interneurons were downregulated. Acceleration of PV cell maturation was accompanied by increased PV cells engulfment by perineuronal nets (PNNs) and by an increase of PV cellular and PNN structural complexity. Interestingly, selective deletion of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; from PV cells was sufficient to drive increased structure complexity of PNN. Moreover, the accelerated PV and PNN maturation was recapitulated in organotypic cultures. Our results identify a specific timeline of disruption of GABAergic circuits in the absence of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt;, indicating a possible cell-autonomous role of MeCP2 in the formation of PV cellular arbors and PNN structures in the visual cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Dopaminergic modulation of prefrontal cortex plays an important role in numerous cognitive processes, including attention. The frontal eye field (FEF) is modulated by dopamine and has an established role in visual attention, yet the underlying circuitry upon which dopamine acts is not known. We compared the expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (D1Rs and D2Rs) across different classes of FEF neurons, including those projecting to dorsal or ventral extrastriate cortex. First, we found that both D1Rs and D2Rs are more prevalent on pyramidal neurons than on several classes of interneurons and are particularly prevalent on putatively long-range projecting pyramidals. Second, higher proportions of pyramidal neurons express D1Rs than D2Rs. Third, overall a higher proportion of inhibitory neurons expresses D2Rs than D1Rs. Fourth, among inhibitory interneurons, a significantly higher proportion of parvalbumin+ neurons expresses D2Rs than D1Rs, and a significantly higher proportion of calbindin+ neurons expresses D1Rs than D2Rs. Finally, compared with D2Rs, virtually all of the neurons with identified projections to both dorsal and ventral extrastriate visual cortex expressed D1Rs. Our results demonstrate that dopamine tends to act directly on the output of the FEF and that dopaminergic modulation of top-down projections to visual cortex is achieved predominately via D1Rs.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 The intrauterine environment provides a key interface between the mother and the developing fetus during pregnancy, and is a target for investigating mechanisms of fetal programming. Studies have demonstrated an association between prenatal stress and neurodevelopmental disorders. The role of the intrauterine environment in mediating this effect is still being elucidated. In this review, we discuss emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting the existence of microbial communities in utero.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Humans can simultaneously combine automatic/habitual and voluntary/goal-directed aspects of behavioral control. Habitual routines permit us to perform well practiced task-components with minimal or no voluntary attention. Evidence from animal and human investigations indicates that dopaminergic neurons in lateral substantia nigra, which innervate the sensorimotor striatum, are engaged during the acquisition and performance of automatized skills and habits. Typically, in Parkinson disease (PD), there is a differential loss of dopamine, which occurs earliest and most severely in the caudal sensorimotor striatum, a subdivision of the striatum implicated in habitual control.</content>

		<content type="html">
 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) is an essential component in the diagnostic work-up of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). With the development of pattern recognition technology, analysis of brain images using deep learning are becoming more and more popular. However, existing computer-aided-diagnosis technologies often overfit and have poor generalizability. Therefore, we aimed to improve a framework based on Group Lasso Sparse Deep Belief Network (GLS-DBN) for discriminating PD and normal control (NC) subjects. In this study, 225 NC and 125 PD cohorts from Huashan and Wuxi 904 hospitals were selected. They were divided into the training &amp;amp; validation dataset and 2 test datasets. First, in the training &amp;amp; validation set, subjects were randomly partitioned 80:20, with multiple training iterations for the deep learning model. Next, Locally Linear Embedding was used as a dimension reduction algorithm. Then, GLS-DBN was used for feature learning and classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, different sparse DBN models were used to compare datasets. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were examined to validate the results. Output variables of the network were also correlated with longitudinal changes of cognitive measurements (UPDRS, H&amp;amp;Y). As a result, accuracy of prediction (90% in Test 1, 86% in Test 2) for classification of PD and NC patients outperformed conventional approaches. Output scores of the network were strongly correlated with longitudinal changes in cognitive measurements (R = 0.705, p &amp;lt; 0.001; R = 0.697, p &amp;lt; 0.001 in Test 1; R = 0.592, p = 0.0018, R = 0.528, p = 0.0067 in Test 2). These results show the feasibility of GLS-DBN as a practical tool for early diagnosis of PD.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain development is likely impacted by micronutrients. This is supported by the effects of the ω-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during early neuronal differentiation, when it increases neurite growth. Aiming to delineate DHA roles in postnatal stages, we selected the visual cortex due to its stereotypic maturation. Immunohistochemistry showed that young mice that received dietary DHA from birth exhibited more abundant presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations. DHA also increased density and size of synapses in a dose-dependent manner in cultured neurons. In addition, dendritic arbors of neurons treated with DHA were more complex. In agreement with improved connectivity, DHA enhanced physiological parameters of network maturation in vitro, including bursting strength and oscillatory behavior. Aiming to analyze functional maturation of the cortex, we performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings from awake mice to measure responses to patterned visual inputs. Dietary DHA robustly promoted the developmental increase in visual acuity, without altering light sensitivity. The visual acuity of DHA-supplemented animals continued to improve even after their cortex had matured and DHA abolished the acuity plateau. Our findings show that the ω-3 fatty acid DHA promotes synaptic connectivity and cortical processing. These results provide evidence that micronutrients can support the maturation of neuronal networks.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 Although iron is crucial for neuronal functioning, many aspects of cerebral iron biology await clarification. The ability to quantify specific iron forms in the living brain would open new avenues for diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and understanding pathogenesis of diseases. A modality that allows assessment of brain tissue composition in vivo, in particular of iron deposits or myelin content on a submillimeter spatial scale, is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multimodal strategies combining MRI with complementary analytical techniques ex vivo have emerged, which may lead to improved specificity.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Magnetoreception, the perception of the geomagnetic field, is a sensory modality well-established across all major groups of vertebrates and some invertebrates, but its presence in humans has been tested rarely, yielding inconclusive results. We report here a strong, specific human brain response to ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields. Following geomagnetic stimulation, a drop in amplitude of electroencephalography (EEG) alpha-oscillations (8–13 Hz) occurred in a repeatable manner. Termed alpha-event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), such a response has been associated previously with sensory and cognitive processing of external stimuli including vision, auditory and somatosensory cues. Alpha-ERD in response to the geomagnetic field was triggered only by horizontal rotations when the static vertical magnetic field was directed downwards, as it is in the Northern Hemisphere; no brain responses were elicited by the same horizontal rotations when the static vertical component was directed upwards. This implicates a biological response tuned to the ecology of the local human population, rather than a generic physical effect. Biophysical tests showed that the neural response was sensitive to static components of the magnetic field. This rules out all forms of electrical induction (including artifacts from the electrodes) which are determined solely on dynamic components of the field. The neural response was also sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. This rules out free-radical &quot;quantum compass&quot; mechanisms like the cryptochrome hypothesis, which can detect only axial alignment. Ferromagnetism remains a viable biophysical mechanism for sensory transduction and provides a basis to start the behavioral exploration of human magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Blocking inhibitory factors within central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions is regarded as a promising strategy to promote remyelination. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is an inhibitory factor present in demyelinating lesions. Noggin, an endogenous antagonist to BMP, has previously been shown to increase the number of oligodendrocytes and promote remyelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo.&lt;/i&gt; However, it remains unclear how BMP4 signaling inhibits remyelination. Here we investigated the downstream signaling pathway that mediates the inhibitory effect that BMP4 exerts upon remyelination through pharmacological and transgenic approaches. Using the cuprizone mouse model of central demyelination, we demonstrate that selectively blocking BMP4 signaling via the pharmacological inhibitor LDN-193189 significantly promotes oligodendroglial differentiation and the extent of remyelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. This was accompanied by the downregulation of transcriptional targets that suppress oligodendrocyte differentiation. Further, selective deletion of BMPRIA receptors within primary mouse OPCs significantly enhanced their differentiation and subsequent myelination &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Together, results of this study identify that BMP4 signals via BMPRIA within OPCs to inhibit oligodendroglial differentiation and their capacity to myelinate axons, and suggest that blocking BMP4/BMPRIA pathway in OPCs is a promising strategy to promote CNS remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Blocking inhibitory factors within central demyelinating lesions is a promising strategy to promote remyelination. Previous studies have established that exogenous BMPs inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation during CNS development and after injury. Here, we demonstrate that blocking endogenous BMP4 signaling via a selective pharmacological approach promotes oligodendroglial differentiation and the rate of remyelination after a central demyelinating insult &lt;i&gt;in vivo.&lt;/i&gt; Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; analysis, we identify that OPC-expressed BMPRIA receptors mediate this effect. Together, our data propose that blocking the BMP4 signaling pathway and/or BMPRIA receptors in OPCs is a promising strategy to promote CNS remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt; is a trimeric transporter essential for clearing glutamate from neuronal synapses. Recurrent de novo &lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt; missense variants cause a severe, early onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy via an unclear mechanism. We demonstrate that all 3 variants implicated in this condition localize to the trimerization domain of &lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt;, and that the Leu85Pro variant acts via a dominant negative mechanism to reduce, but not eliminate, wild‐type &lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt; protein localization and function. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of a 20‐month‐old &lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related epilepsy patient with the SLC1A2‐modulating agent ceftriaxone did not result in a significant change in daily spasm count.

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The histologic features of thrombus in stroke patients with cancer are not well known. Using immunohistochemical staining of thrombi retrieved during mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients, thrombus compositions were compared between 16 patients with active cancer, 16 patients with inactive cancer, and 16 patients without any history of cancer. The active cancer group showed higher platelet and lower erythrocyte fractions than the inactive cancer or the control group. Four patients with vegetation showed very high platelet and low erythrocyte fractions. Patients with cryptogenic etiology in the active cancer group showed a similar pattern to those with vegetation. These findings may aid the determination of treatment strategies in cancer‐associated stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To define a distinct, dominantly inherited, mild skeletal myopathy associated with prominent and consistent tremor in two unrelated, three‐generation families.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical evaluations as well as exome and panel sequencing analyses were performed in affected and non‐affected members of two families to identify genetic variants segregating with the phenotype. Histological assessment of a muscle biopsy specimen was performed in one patient and quantitative tremor analysis was carried out in two patients. Molecular modeling studies and biochemical assays were performed for both mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two novel missense mutations in &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; (p.E248K in family‐1 and p.Y247H in family‐2) were identified and shown to segregate perfectly with the myopathy/tremor phenotype in the respective families. &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; encodes slow Myosin Binding Protein‐C (sMyBP‐C), a modular sarcomeric protein playing structural and regulatory roles via its dynamic interaction with actin and myosin filaments. The Y247H and E248K mutations are located in the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐terminal M‐motif of sMyBP‐C. Both mutations result in markedly increased binding of the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐terminus to myosin, possibly interfering with normal cross‐bridge cycling as the first muscle‐based step in tremor genesis. The clinical tremor features seen in all mutation carriers together with the tremor physiology studies performed in family‐2 suggest amplification by an additional central loop modulating the clinical tremor phenomenology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we link two novel missense mutations in &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; with a dominant, mild skeletal myopathy invariably associated with a distinctive tremor. The molecular, genetic and clinical studies are consistent with a unique sarcomeric origin of the tremor, which we classify as “myogenic tremor”.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 NAbstract NAD+ (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) administration is highly beneficial in numerous models of diseases and aging.  It is becoming increasingly important to determine if NAD+ treatment may directly increase the antioxidant capacity of cells under basal conditions.  In current study we tested our hypothesis that NAD+ can directly enhance the antioxidant capacity of cells under basal conditions by using PC12 cells as a cellular model.  We found that NAD+ treatment can increase the GSH/GSSG ratios in the cells under basal conditions.  NAD+ can also increase both the mRNA and protein level of -glutamylcysteine ligase – a key enzyme for glutathione synthesis, which appears to be mediated by the NAD+-induced increase in Nrf2 activity.  These NAD+-induced changes can be prevented by both SIRT2 siRNA and the SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2.  The NAD+-induced changes can also be blocked by the ERK signaling inhibitor U0126.  Moreover, the NAD+-induced ERK activation can be blocked by both SIRT2 siRNA and AGK2.  Collectively, our study has provided the first evidence that NAD+ can enhance directly the antioxidant capacity of the cells under basal conditions, which is mediated by SIRT2, ERK, and Nrf2.  These findings have suggested not only the great nutritional potential of NAD+, but also a novel mechanism underlying the protective effects of the NAD+ administration in the disease models: The NAD+ administration can enhance the resistance of the normal cells to oxidative insults by increasing the antioxidant capacity of the cells.</content>

 Understanding underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases is fundamental to develop effective therapeutic intervention. Yet they remain largely elusive, but metabolic and transcriptional dysregulation are common events. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent lysine deacetylase, regulating transcription and critical for the cellular adaptations to metabolic stress. SIRT1 regulates the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), connecting the energetic state with cell growth and function. The activity of the transcription initiation factor-IA (TIF-IA) is important for the transcriptional regulation of rDNA genes in the nucleolus, and is also sensitive to changes in the cellular energetic state. Moreover TIF-IA is responsive to nutrient-deprivation, neurotrophic stimulation and oxidative stress. Hence, both SIRT1 and TIF-IA connect changes in cellular stress with transcriptional regulation and metabolic adaptation. Moreover, they finely tune the activity of the transcription factor p53, and maintain mitochondrial function and oxidative stress responses.  Here we reviewed and discussed evidence that SIRT1 and TIF-IA are regulated by shared pathways and their activities preserve neuronal homeostasis in response to metabolic stressors. We provide evidence that loss of rDNA transcription due to altered TIF-IA function alters SIRT1 expression and propose a model of interdependent feedback mechanisms. An imbalance of this signaling might be a critical common event in neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, we provide a novel perspective for the prediction of the therapeutic benefits of the modulation of SIRT1- and nucleolar-dependent pathways in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.</content>

 Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive hereditary retinal degenerative disease in which photoreceptor cells undergo degeneration and apoptosis, eventually resulting in irreversible loss of visual function. Currently, no effective treatment exists for this disease. Neuroprotection and inflammation suppression have been reported to delay the development of RP. Metformin is a well-tested drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, and it has been reported to exert beneficial effects in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. In the present study, we used immunofluorescence staining, electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and RNA-Seq to explore the effects of metformin on photoreceptor degeneration and its mechanism in rd1 mice. We found that metformin significantly reduced apoptosis in photoreceptors and delayed the degeneration of photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells in rd1 mice, thus markedly improving the visual function of rd1 mice at P14, P18 and P22 when tested with a light/dark transition test and ERG. Microglial activation in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina of rd1 mice was significantly suppressed by metformin. RNA-Seq showed that metformin markedly downregulated inflammatory genes and upregulated the expression of crystallin proteins, which have been demonstrated to be important neuroprotective molecules in the retina, revealing the therapeutic potential of metformin for RP treatment. αA-crystallin proteins were further confirmed to be involved in the neuroprotective effects of metformin in a Ca2+ ionophore-damaged 661W photoreceptor cell line. These data suggest that metformin exerts a protective effect in rd1 mice via both immunoregulatory and new neuroprotective mechanisms.</content>

 Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) is the most common infectious disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in the worldwide. However, the pathogenesis of HSE is not clear. Research has reported that the immune response mediated by the TLR3 signaling pathway is an essential immune response to CNS against HSV infection. But if it is overreacted, it will cause tissue damage and related pathological changes. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism of Corilagin to control HSE by controlling TLR3 signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. When cells and mice were activated by Polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) or HSV-1, and then treated with Corilagin, the mRNA and protein levels of TLR3, TRIF, TRADD, TRAF3, TRAF6, NEMO, P38, IRF3 were decreased. Interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), type 1 IFN (IFN-β) were also decreased. Furthermore the expression of TLR3 molecule was silenced or over-expressed, Corilagin could still inhibit the expression of TLR3 and downstream mediators. Additionally the mice brain tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry and haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical (IHC), Corilagin could lessen the degree of brain inflammation. This results indicate that Corilagin can regulate the immune response in the pathogenesis of HSE and relieve inflammatory injury by affecting the TLR3 signaling pathway.</content>

 Purinergic signaling is critically involved in neuroinflammation associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and its major inflammatory animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Herein, we explored the expression of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase1 (NTPDase1/CD39) in the spinal cord, at the onset (Eo), peak (Ep) and end (Ee) of EAE. Several-fold increase in mRNA and in NTPDase1 protein levels were observed at Eo and Ep. In situ hybridization combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry showed that reactive microglia and infiltrated mononuclear cells mostly accounted for the observed increase. Colocalization analysis revealed that up to 80% of Iba1 immunoreactivity and ~ 50% of CD68 immunoreactivity  was colocalized with  NTPDase1, while flow cytometric analysis revealed that ~ 70% of mononuclear infiltrates were NTPDase1+ at Ep. Given the main role of NTPDase1 to degrade proinflammatory ATP, we hypothesized that the observed up-regulation of NTPDase1 may be associated with the transition between proinflammatory M1-like to neuroprotective M2-like phenotype of microglia/macrophages during EAE. Functional phenotype of reactive microglia/macrophages that overexpress NTPDase1 was assessed by multi-image colocalization analysis using iNOS and Arg1 as selective markers for M1 and M2 reactive states, respectively. At the peak of EAE NTPDase1 immunoreactivity showed much higher co-occurrence with Arg1 immunoreactivity in microglia and macrophages, compared to iNOS, implying its stronger association with M2-like reactive phenotype. Additionally, in ~80% of CD68 positive cells NTPDase1 was coexpressed with Arg1 compared to negligible fraction coexpresing iNOS and ~15% coexpresing both markers, additionally indicating prevalent association of NTPDase1 with M2-like microglial/macrophages phenotype at Ep. Together, our data suggest an association between NTPDase1 up-regulation by reactive microglia and infiltrated macrophages and their transition towards antiinflammatory phenotype in EAE.</content>

 Traumatic brain injury (TBI), consisting of damage caused by a blow or jolt that disrupts normal brain function (1), is an emerging health epidemic with ~2.5 million cases occurring annually in the USA that are severe enough to cause hospitalization or death (2). Most common causes of TBI include contact sports, vehicle crashes, domestic violence or war injuries (3). TBI is one of the most consistent candidates for initiating the molecular and cellular cascades that result in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (4).  Not every TBI event is alike with effects varying from person to person. The majority of people recover from mild TBI within a short period of time but repeated incidents can have deleterious long-lasting effects which depend on factors such as the number of TBI’s sustained, time till medical attention, age, gender and genetics of the individual (5). Despite extensive research many questions still remain regarding diagnosis, treatment and prevention of long-term effects from TBI as well as recovery of brain function. In this review, we discuss using Drosophila melanogaster as a model to study TBI (6) and outline the current TBI inducing methods used to inflict brain trauma. The relatively small brain sized (~100,000 neurons and glia), conserved neurotransmitter signaling mechanisms, and sophisticated genetics of Drosophila melanogaster allows for cell biological, molecular, and genetic analyses that are impractical in mammalian models of TBI.</content>

 Decoding laminar information across deep brain structures and cortical regions is necessary in order to understand the neuronal ensembles that represent cognition and memory. Large animal models are essential for translational research due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. A lack of long-length probes with appropriate stiffness to penetrate to deeper structures with minimal damage to the neural interface is one of the major technical limitations to applying the approaches currently utilized in lower order animals to large animals. We therefore tested the performance of multichannel silicon probes of various solutions and designs that were developed specifically for large animal electrophysiology. Neurophysiological signals from dorsal hippocampus were recorded in chronically implanted awake behaving Yucatan pigs. Single units and local field potentials were analyzed to evaluate performance of given silicon probes over time. EDGE-style probes had the highest yields during intra-hippocampal recordings in pigs, making them the most suitable for chronic implantations and awake behavioral experimentation. In addition, the cross-sectional area of silicon probes was found to be a crucial determinant of silicon probe performance over time, potentially due to reduction of damage to the neural interface. Novel 64-channel EDGE-style probes tested acutely produced an optimal single unit separation and a denser sampling of the laminar structure, identifying these research silicon probes as potential candidates for chronic implantations. This study provides an analysis of multichannel silicon probes designed for large animal electrophysiology of deep laminar brain structures, and suggests that current designs are reaching the physical thresholds necessary for long-term (~ 1 month) recordings with single-unit resolution.</content>

 Advances in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of devices containing arrays of thousands of closely spaced recording electrodes, which afford subcellular resolution of electrical signals in neurons and neuronal networks. Rationalizing the electrode size and configuration in such arrays demands consideration of application-specific requirements and inherent features of the electrodes. Tradeoffs among size, spatial density, sensitivity, noise, attenuation, and other factors are inevitable. Although recording extracellular signals from neurons with planar metal electrodes is fairly well established, the effects of the electrode characteristics on the quality and utility of recorded signals, especially for small, densely packed electrodes, have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we present a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidating how electrode size, and size-dependent parameters, such as impedance, baseline noise, and transmission characteristics, influence recorded neuronal signals. Using arrays containing platinum electrodes of different sizes, we experimentally evaluated the electrode performance in the recording of local-field-potentials (LFPs) and extracellular-action-potentials (EAPs) from the following cell preparations: acute brain slices, dissociated cell cultures, and organotypic slice cultures. Moreover, we simulated the potential spatial decay of point-current sources to investigate signal averaging using known signal sources. We demonstrated that the noise and signal attenuation depend more on the electrode impedance than on electrode size, per se, especially for electrodes &amp;lt; 10 µm in width or diameter to achieve high-spatial-resolution readout. By minimizing electrode impedance in small electrodes (&amp;lt; 10 µm), via surface modification, we could maximize the signal-to-noise ratio to electrically visualize the propagation of axonal EAPs and to isolate single-unit spikes. Due to the large amplitude of LFP signals, recording quality was high and nearly independent of electrode size. These findings should be of value in configuring in vitro and in vivo microelectrode arrays for extracellular recordings with high spatial resolution in various applications.</content>

 Objective: Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) is an adaptive method for the online or offline correction of artifacts comprising multichannel EEG recordings. It repeatedly computes a principal component analysis on covariance matrices to detect artifacts based on their statistical properties in the component subspace. We adapted the existing ASR implementation by using Riemannian geometry for covariance matrix processing. EEG data that were recorded on smartphone in both outdoors and indoors conditions were used for evaluation (N = 27). A direct comparison between the original artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) and Riemannian ASR (rASR) was conducted for three performance measures: reduction of eye-blinks (sensitivity), improvement of visual-evoked potentials (specificity), and computation time (efficiency). Compared to ASR, our rASR algorithm performed favourably on all three measures. We conclude that rASR is suitable for the offline and online correction of multichannel EEG data acquired in laboratory and in field conditions.</content>

 There are two main paradigms for brain-related science, with different implications for brain-focused intervention or advancement.  The paradigm of homeostasis (“stability through constancy,” Walter Cannon), originating from laboratory-based experimental physiology pioneered by Claude Bernard, shows that living systems tend to maintain system functionality in the direction of constancy (or similitude).  The aim of physiology is elucidate the factors that maintain homeostasis, and therapeutics aim to correct abnormal factor functions.  The homeostasis paradigm does not formally recognize influences outside its controlled experimental frames and it is variable in its modelling of neural contributions.  The paradigm of allostatic orchestration (PAO) extends the principle of allostasis (“stability through change”) as originally put forth by Peter Sterling.  The PAO originates from an evolutionary perspective and recognizes that biological set points change in anticipation of changing environments.  The brain is the organ of central command, orchestrating cross-system operations to support optimal behavior at the level of the whole organism.  Alternative views of blood pressure regulation and posttraumatic stress disorder illustrate differences between the paradigms.  For the PAO, complexities of top-down neural effects and environmental context are foundational (not to be “factored out”), and anticipatory regulation is the principle of their interface.  The allostatic state represents the integrated totality of brain-body interactions.  Health itself is an allostatic state of optimal anticipatory oscillation, hypothesized to relate to the state of criticality, a mathematical point of poise between phases, on the border between order and disorder (or the “edge of chaos”).  Diseases are allostatic states of impaired anticipatory oscillations, demonstrated as rigidifications of set points across the brain and body (disease comorbidity).  Conciliation of the paradigms is possible, with “reactive homeostasis” resolved as an illusion stemming from anticipation of environmental monotony.  Considerations are presented with respect to implications of the two paradigms for brain-focused intervention or advancement; the hypothesis that the state of criticality is a vehicle for evolutionary processes; concordance with a philosophy of freedom based on ethical individualism as well as self-creativity, non-obsolescence, empowerment, and citizenship; and concluding reflections on the science and ethics of the placebo, and the potential for virtuous cycles of brain-Anthropocene interactions.</content>

 Epilepsy surgery is a clinical procedure that aims to remove the brain tissue responsible for the emergence of seizures, the epileptogenic zone (EZ). It is preceded by an evaluation to determine the brain tissue that must be resected. The identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) from intracranial EEG recordings stands as one of the key proxies for the EZ. In this study we used computational models of epilepsy to assess to what extent the SOZ may or may not represent the EZ. We considered a set of different synthetic networks (e.g. regular, small-world, random, and scale-free networks) to represent large-scale brain networks and a phenomenological network model of seizure generation. In the model, the SOZ was inferred from the seizure likelihood (SL), a measure of the propensity of single nodes to produce epileptiform dynamics, whilst a surgery corresponded to the removal of nodes and connections from the network. We used the concept of node ictogenicity (NI) to quantify the effectiveness of each node removal on reducing the network’s propensity to generate seizures. This framework enabled us to systematically compare the SOZ and the seizure control achieved by each considered surgery. Specifically, we compared the distributions of SL and NI across different networks. We found that SL and NI were concordant when all nodes were similarly ictogenic, whereas when there was a small fraction of nodes with high NI, the SL was not specific at identifying these nodes. We further considered networks with heterogeneous node excitabilities, i.e. nodes with different susceptibilities of being engaged in seizure activity, to understand how such heterogeneity may affect the relationship between SL and NI. We found that while SL and NI are concordant when there is a small fraction of hyper-excitable nodes in a network that is otherwise homogeneous, they do diverge if the network is heterogeneous, such as in scale-free networks. We observe that SL is highly dependent on node excitabilities, whilst the effect of surgical resections as revealed by NI is mostly determined by network structure. Together our results suggest that the SOZ is not always a good marker of the EZ.</content>

 Objective: Stimulus visual patterns, such as size, content, color, luminosity, and interval, play key roles for brain–computer interface (BCI) performance. However, the three primary colors to be intercompared as a single variable or factor on the same platform are poorly studied. In this work, we configured the visual stimulus patterns with red, green, and blue and designed a novel layout of the BCI interface to study the waveforms and performance of the evoked related potential (ERP). Approach: Twelve subjects participated in our experiment, which was composed of three different color sub-experiments. Four blocks of the interface were presented along the edge of the screen, and the other four were assembled in the center, to investigate the problem of adjacency distraction. Repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni correction were applied for statistical analysis.  Main results: The averaged online accuracy was 98.44% for red paradigm, higher than 92.71% for green paradigm and 93.23% for blue paradigm. Furthermore, significant differences in online accuracy (p&amp;lt;0.05) and information transfer rate (p&amp;lt;0.05) were found between red and green paradigms. Significance: The red stimulus paradigm yielded the best performance. The proposed design of ERP-based BCI was practical and effective for many potential applications.</content>

 Background: Chronic inflammation plays a significant role in accelerating the aging process and is closely associated with the initiation and progression of a broad range of age-related diseases. Physical exercise is considered beneficial in alleviating these conditions, but the effects of aerobic exercise on inflammatory markers in a healthy population should be furtherly clarified. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise on inflammatory markers in middle-aged and older adults. Methods: The literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception through April 2018, and the reference lists were screened to identify appropriate studies. Only randomized controlled trials that investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on inflammatory markers in middle-aged and older adults were eligible for this review. Results: Eleven studies involving 1250 participants were retrieved from the databases for analysis. The pooled results showed that aerobic exercise significantly reduced inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP): SMD = 0.53, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.11, p = 0.0002; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α): SMD = 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.19, p = 0.0007; interleukin 6（IL-6): SMD = 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.19, p = 0.0007). No significant improvement was found in relation to interleukin 4 (IL-4). Conclusions: Aerobic exercise may have a positive effect on reduction of CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 in middle-aged and older adults. Further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) need to be conducted to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on additional inflammatory markers in the population of middle-aged and older adults.</content>

 Age-related hearing loss is associated with cognitive decline and has been proposed as a risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms that relate hearing loss to cognitive decline remain elusive. Here, we propose that the impairment of the cochlear amplifier mechanism is associated with structural brain changes and cognitive impairment. Ninety-six subjects aged over 65 years old (63 female and 33 male) were evaluated using brain magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and audiological assessments, including distortion product otoacoustic emissions as a measure of the cochlear amplifier function. All the analyses were adjusted by age, gender and education. The group with cochlear amplifier dysfunction showed greater brain atrophy in the cingulate cortex and in the parahippocampus. In addition, the atrophy of the cingulate cortex was associated with cognitive impairment in episodic and working memories and in language and visuoconstructive abilities. We conclude that the neural abnormalities observed in presbycusis subjects with cochlear amplifier dysfunction extend beyond core auditory network and are associated with cognitive decline in multiple domains. These results suggest that a cochlear amplifier dysfunction in presbycusis is an important mechanism relating hearing impairments to brain atrophy in the extended network of effortful hearing.</content>

 Abstract Background: Cerebral amyloid beta (Aβ) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ can be detected in vivo with amyloid imaging or cerebrospinal fluid assessments. However, these technologies can be both expensive and invasive, and their accessibility is limited in many clinical settings. Hence the current study aims to identify multivariate cost-efficient markers for Aβ positivity among non-demented individuals using machine learning (ML) approaches. Methods: The relationship between cost-efficient candidate markers and Aβ status was examined by analyzing 762 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 cohort at baseline visit (286 cognitively normal, 332 with mild cognitive impairment, and 144 with AD; mean age 73.2 years, range 55–90). Demographic variables (age, gender, education, and APOE status) and neuropsychological test scores were used as predictors in an ML algorithm. Cerebral Aβ burden and Aβ positivity were measured using 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography images. The adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) ML algorithm was implemented to identify cognitive performance and demographic variables and distinguish individuals from the population at high risk for cerebral Aβ burden. For generalizability, results were further checked by randomly dividing the data into training sets and test sets and checking predictive performances by 10-fold cross-validation. Results: Out of neuropsychological predictors, visuospatial ability and episodic memory test results were consistently significant predictors for Aβ positivity across subgroups with demographic variables and other cognitive measures considered. The adaptive LASSO model using out-of-sample classification could distinguish abnormal levels of Aβ. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.754 in the mild change group, 0.803 in the moderate change group, and 0.864 in the severe change group, respectively. Conclusions: Our results showed that the cost-efficient neuropsychological model with demographics could predict Aβ positivity, suggesting a potential surrogate method for detecting Aβ deposition non-invasively with clinical utility. More specifically, it could be a very brief screening tool in various settings to recruit participants with potential biomarker evidence of AD brain pathology. These identified individuals would be valuable participants in secondary prevention trials aimed at detecting an anti-amyloid drug effect in the non-demented population.</content>

 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent pathology and associated with poor outcome in the aged population. We recently observed accelerated cerebral inflammation in aged mice in response to TBI. Candesartan is a potent specific inhibitor of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) which limits cerebral inflammation and brain damage in juvenile animals after experimental TBI. In the present study, we show significantly lower posttraumatic AT1 mRNA levels in aged (21 months) compared to young (2 months) mice. Despite low cerebral At1 expression, pharmacologic blockade by treatment with candesartan (daily, beginning 30 minutes after experimental TBI by controlled cortical impact [CCI]) was highly effective in both young and aged animals and reduced histological brain damage by -20 % after five days. In young mice neurological improvement was enhanced by AT1 inhibition five days after CCI. In old animals, candesartan treatment reduced functional impairment already on day 3 after TBI and post-traumatic body weight loss was attenuated. Candesartan reduced microglial activation (-40 %) in young and aged animals, and neutrophil infiltration (-40 - 50 %) in aged mice, whereas T-cell infiltration was not changed in both age groups. In young animals, markers of anti-inflammatory microglia M2a polarization (arginase 1 [Arg1], chitinase3-like 3 [Ym1]) were increased by candesartan at days 1 and 5 after insult. In aged mice five days after insult expression of Arg1 was significantly higher independent of the treatment, whereas Ym1 gene expression was further enhanced by AT1 inhibition. Despite age dependent posttraumatic differences in At1 expression levels, inhibition of AT1 was highly effective in a posttreatment paradigm. Targeting inflammation with candesartan is therefore a promising therapeutic strategy to limit secondary brain damage independent of the age.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The functional heterogeneity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) suggests it may include distinct functional subregions. To date these have not been well elucidated. Regions with differentiable connectivity (and as a result likely dissociable functions) may be identified using emergent data-driven approaches. However, prior parcellations of the vmPFC have only considered hard splits between distinct regions, although both hard and graded connectivity changes may exist. Here we determine the full pattern of change in structural and functional connectivity across the vmPFC for the first time and extract core distinct regions. Both structural and functional connectivity varied along a dorsomedial to ventrolateral axis from relatively dorsal medial wall regions to relatively lateral basal orbitofrontal cortex. The pattern of connectivity shifted from default mode network to sensorimotor and multimodal semantic connections. This finding extends the classical distinction between primate medial and orbital regions by demonstrating a similar gradient in humans for the first time. Additionally, core distinct regions in the medial wall and orbitofrontal cortex were identified that may show greater correspondence to functional differences than prior hard parcellations. The possible functional roles of the orbitofrontal cortex and medial wall are discussed.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;c‐Jun‐amino‐terminal kinase‐interacting protein 3 (JIP3), encoded by &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt;, is an adaptor protein of the kinesin‐1 complex and essential for axonal transport in neurons. However, an association between &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt; variants and human disease has not been established. We identified 5 individuals from four families with recurrent de novo variants c.1732C&amp;gt;T (p.Arg578Cys) and c.3436C&amp;gt;T (p.Arg1146Cys) in &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt;. The core phenotype includes spastic diplegia, intellectual disability, cerebral atrophy, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Zebrafish embryos overexpressing human mutant JIP3 showed axon varicosities of the posterior lateral line nerve, suggesting an adverse effect on the developing axons.

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Type III taste cells in mammalian taste buds are implicated in the detection and communication of sour and some salty stimuli, as well as carbonation and water. With this variety of proposed roles, it is unclear what information activated Type III cells are communicating to the central nervous system. To better elucidate the role of Type III cells in the taste bud, we use a Type III cell-specific protein (polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1, PKD2L1) to drive Cre-dependent expression of light sensitive channelrhodopsin (Ai32) in mouse Type III taste cells. Activation of these cells with light produces a taste nerve response in both the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves, and elicits a slight but significant aversion in two-bottle preference tests in both male and female mice. Unlike previous reports (Zocchi et al., 2017), our mice did not react to blue light stimulation with sustained drinking responses. These data suggest that Type III cells are capable of communicating the presence of aversive stimuli in the oral cavity, which is in line with their responsiveness to sour and high concentrations of salt stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The sour-sensing Type III cells of the mammalian taste bud are historically difficult to study in vivo, as sour stimulation of the tongue causes intracellular acidification in all epithelial cells, not just Type III cells. The present study circumvents this issue by using Cre-dependent expression of channelrhodopsin in Type III cells, so that they can be activated by blue light, rather than acid (sour). Our data suggest that Type III cells communicate an aversive signal to the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are age-associated neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) and tau, respectively. The coexistence of aSyn and tau aggregates suggests a strong overlap between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. Interestingly, misfolded forms of aSyn and tau can propagate from cell to cell, and throughout the brain, thereby templating the misfolding of native forms of the proteins. The exact mechanisms involved in the propagation of the two proteins show similarities, and are reminiscent of the spreading characteristic of prion diseases. Recently, several models were developed to the study the spreading of aSyn and tau. Here, we discuss the mechanisms involved, the similarities and differences between the spreading of the two proteins and that of the prion protein, and the different cell and animal models used for studying these processes. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved may lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of devastating neurodegenerative diseases.</content>

 Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and fibromyalgia (FM) present overlapped symptoms. Although the connection between these two disorders has not been elucidated yet, the disruption of neuroplastic processes that mediate the equilibrium in the inhibitory systems stands out as a possible mechanism. Thus, the purpose of this cross-sectional exploratory study was: i) to compare the motor cortex inhibition indexed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures [short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation  (ICF)], as well as the function of descending pain modulatory systems (DPMS) among FM, MDD, and healthy subjects (HS); ii) to compare SICI, ICF and the role of DPMS evaluated by the change on Numerical Pain Scale (NPS) during the conditioned pain modulation test (CPM-test) between FM and MDD considering the BDNF-adjusted index; iii) to assess the relationship between the role of DPMS and the BDNF-adjusted index, despite  clinical diagnosis.  Patients and methods:  A cohort of 63 women, aged 18 to 75 years [FM (n=18), MDD (n=19) and HC (n=29)].   Results: The MANCOVA analysis revealed that the mean of SICI was 53.40% larger in FM compared to MDD [1.03 (0.50) vs. 0.55(0.43)] and 66.99% larger compared to HC [1.03 (0.50) vs. 0.34 (0.19), respectively. The inhibitory potency of the DPMS assessed by the change on the NPS during CPM-test was 112.29 % lower in the FM compared to MDD [0.22 (1.37) vs. - 0.87 (1.49)]. The mean of BDNF from FM compared to MDD was 35.70% higher [49.82 (16.31) vs. 14.12 (8.86)]. In FM, the Spearman`s coefficient between the change in the NPS during CPM-test with the SICI was Rho=-0.49, [confidence interval (CI) 95%; -0.78 to -0.03)]. The BDNF-adjusted index was positively correlated with the disinhibition of the DPMS.   Conclusion: These findings support the hypothesis that in FM a deteriorated function of cortical inhibition, indexed by a higher SICI parameter, a lower function of the DPMS, together with a higher level of BDNF indicate that FM has different pathological substrates from depression. They suggest that an up-regulation phenomenon of intracortical inhibitory networks associated with a disruption of the DPMS function occurs in FM.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The dorsal striatum exhibits bidirectional corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, NMDAR and endocannabinoids (eCB) mediated, necessary for the encoding of procedural learning. Therefore, characterizing factors controlling corticostriatal plasticity is of crucial importance. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, the tropomyosine receptor kinase-B (TrkB), shape striatal functions, and their dysfunction deeply affects basal ganglia. BDNF/TrkB signaling controls NMDAR plasticity in various brain structures including the striatum. However, despite cross-talk between BDNF and eCBs, the role of BDNF in eCB plasticity remains unknown. Here, we show that BDNF/TrkB signaling promotes eCB-plasticity (LTD and LTP) induced by rate-based (low-frequency stimulation) or spike-timing–based (spike-timing–dependent plasticity, STDP) paradigm in striatum. We show that TrkB activation is required for the expression and the scaling of both eCB-LTD and eCB-LTP. Using 2-photon imaging of dendritic spines combined with patch-clamp recordings, we show that TrkB activation prolongs intracellular calcium transients, thus increasing eCB synthesis and release. We provide a mathematical model for the dynamics of the signaling pathways involved in corticostriatal plasticity. Finally, we show that TrkB activation enlarges the domain of expression of eCB-STDP. Our results reveal a novel role for BDNF/TrkB signaling in governing eCB-plasticity expression in striatum and thus the engram of procedural learning.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell therapy is an attractive strategy for enhancing post‐stroke recovery. Different cell types and several treatment strategies have been successfully applied in animal models, but efficacy in stroke patients has not yet been confirmed. We hypothesize that the significant design differences between preclinical and clinical trials may account for this situation. Using a meta‐analysis approach and comparing preclinical with clinical trials, we reveal and discuss preliminary evidence for such design differences. While available datasets are not yet numerous enough to draw definitive conclusions, these findings may represent signposts on the route to efficacy by harmonizing preclinical and clinical study designs.&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Dependence on opioids and the number of opioid overdose deaths are serious and escalating public health problems, but medication-assisted treatments for opioid addiction remain inadequate for many patients. Glucagon-like pepide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut hormone and neuropeptide with actions in peripheral tissues and in the brain, including regulation of blood glucose and food intake. GLP-1 analogs, which are approved diabetes medications, can reduce the reinforcing and rewarding effects of alcohol, cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine in rodents. Investigations on effects of GLP-1 analogs on opioid reward and reinforcement have not been reported. We assessed the effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist Exendin-4 (Ex4) on opioid-related behaviors in male mice, i.e., morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP), intravenous self-administration (IVSA) of the short-acting synthetic opioid remifentanil, naltrexone-precipitated morphine withdrawal, morphine analgesia (male and female mice), and locomotor activity. Ex4 treatment had no effect on morphine-induced CPP, withdrawal, or hyperlocomotion. Ex4 failed to decrease remifentanil self-administration, if anything reinforcing effects of remifentanil appeared increased in Ex4-treated mice relative to saline. Ex4 did not significantly affect analgesia. In contrast, Ex4 dose dependently decreased oral alcohol self-administration, and suppressed spontaneous locomotor activity. Taken together, Ex4 did not attenuate the addiction-related behavioral effects of opioids, indicating that GLP-1 analogs would not be useful medications in the treatment of opioid addiction. This difference between opioids and other drug classes investigated to date may shed light on the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor treatment in the addictive effects of alcohol, central stimulants, and nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging is a key method in neuroscience for investigating patterns of neuronal activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Still, existing algorithms to detect and extract activity signals from calcium-imaging movies have major shortcomings. We introduce the HNCcorr algorithm for cell identification in calcium-imaging datasets that addresses these shortcomings. HNCcorr relies on the combinatorial clustering problem HNC (Hochbaum’s Normalized Cut), which is similar to the Normalized Cut problem of Shi and Malik, a well known problem in image segmentation. HNC identifies cells as coherent clusters of pixels that are highly distinct from the remaining pixels. HNCcorr guarantees a globally optimal solution to the underlying optimization problem as well as minimal dependence on initialization techniques. HNCcorr also uses a new method, called &quot;similarity squared&quot;, for measuring similarity between pixels in calcium-imaging movies. The effectiveness of HNCcorr is demonstrated by its top performance on the Neurofinder cell identification benchmark. We believe HNCcorr is an important addition to the toolbox for analysis of calcium-imaging movies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Microglia are in a privileged position to both affect and be affected by neuroinflammation, neuronal activity and injury, which are all hallmarks of seizures and the epilepsies. Hippocampal microglia become activated after prolonged, damaging seizures known as status epilepticus (SE). However, since SE causes both hyperactivity and injury of neurons, the mechanisms triggering this activation remain unclear, as does the relevance of the microglial activation to the ensuing epileptogenic processes. In this study, we use electroconvulsive shock (ECS) to study the effect of neuronal hyperactivity without neuronal degeneration on mouse hippocampal microglia. Unlike SE, ECS did not alter hippocampal CA1 microglial density, morphology, or baseline motility. In contrast, both ECS and SE produced a similar increase in ATP-directed microglial process motility in acute slices, and similarly upregulated expression of the chemokine C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of hippocampal CA1&lt;i&gt;sr&lt;/i&gt; microglia showed that ECS enhanced purinergic currents mediated by P2X7 receptors in the absence of changes in passive properties or voltage-gated currents, or changes in receptor expression. This differs from previously described alterations in intrinsic characteristics which coincided with enhanced purinergic currents following SE. These ECS-induced effects point to a &quot;seizure signature&quot; in hippocampal microglia characterized by altered purinergic signaling. These data demonstrate that ictal activity per se can drive alterations in microglial physiology without neuronal injury. These physiological changes, which up until now have been associated with prolonged and damaging seizures, are of added interest as they may be relevant to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which remains a gold-standard treatment for depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal cholinergic circuits have been implicated in cognitive function and neurological disease, but the role of cholinergic signaling in other cellular populations within the brain has not been as fully defined. Here, we show that cholinergic signaling mechanisms are involved in mediating the function of the choroid plexus, the brain structure responsible for generating CSF and releasing various factors into the brain. The choroid plexus was found to express markers of endogenous cholinergic signaling, including multiple nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes in a region-specific manner, and application of nicotine was found to induce cellular activation, as evidenced by calcium influx in primary tissue. During intravenous nicotine self-administration in male rats, nicotine increased expression of transthyretin, a protein selectively produced and released by the choroid plexus, and microRNA-204 (mir-204), a transcript found in high levels in the choroid plexus and CSF. Finally, human choroid plexus tissue from both sexes was found to exhibit similar nAChR, transthyretin and mir-204 expression profiles, supporting the translational relevance of the findings. Together, these studies demonstrate functionally active cholinergic signaling mechanisms in the choroid plexus, the resulting effects on transthyretin and mir-204 expression, and reveal the direct mechanism by which nicotine modulates function of this tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Itch consists of both sensory and affective components. For chronic itch patients, the affective component of itch affects both quality of life (leading to psychological comorbidities) and disease prognosis (by promoting scratching of itchy skin). We found that acute itch stimuli, such as histamine, induced anxiety-like behavior and increased activity (c-Fos expression) in the amygdala in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Itch stimuli also increased activity in projection areas to the amygdala, suggesting that these regions form a circuit for affective itch processing. Electrophysiological characterization of histamine-responsive amygdala neurons showed that this population was active on a behaviorally relevant timescale and partially overlapped with pain signaling. Selective optogenetic activation of histamine-responsive amygdala neurons in adult male and female Fos:CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;;R26&lt;sup&gt;Ai14&lt;/sup&gt; mice using the Targeted Recombination in Active Populations system enhanced both scratching and anxiety-like behavior. These results highlight the importance of itch-responsive amygdala neurons in modulating itch-related affect and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The sensation of itch includes an affective component that leads to stress and anxiety in chronic itch patients. We investigated the neuronal basis of affective itch in mice, with a focus on the amygdala, the key brain region for the generation of anxiety. A subpopulation of amygdala neurons responded to itch stimuli such as histamine. Optogenetic activation of histamine-responsive amygdala neurons affected both scratching and anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, this population appears to be important for mediating the affective component of itch.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) often present with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The major aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on cognitive outcomes in UCDs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prospective, observational, multicenter study includes data from 503 individuals with UCDs who had comprehensive neurocognitive testing with a cumulative follow‐up of 702 patient‐years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mean cognitive standard deviation score (cSDS) was lower in symptomatic than in asymptomatic (p&amp;lt;0.001, t‐test) individuals with UCDs. Intellectual disability (Intellectual quotient &amp;lt; 70; cSDS &amp;lt; ‐2.0) was associated with the respective subtype of UCD and early disease onset, while height of the initial peak plasma ammonium concentration was inversely associated with neurocognitive outcomes in mitochondrial (i.e. proximal) rather than cytosolic (i.e. distal) UCDs. In ornithine transcarbamylase and argininosuccinate synthetase 1 deficiencies, we did not find evidence that monoscavenger therapy with sodium or glycerol phenylbutyrate was superior to sodium benzoate in providing cognitive protection. Early liver transplantation appears to be beneficial for UCDs. Noteworthy, individuals with argininosuccinate synthetase 1 and argininosuccinate lyase deficiencies identified by newborn screening had better neurocognitive outcomes than those diagnosed after the manifestation of first symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function is related to interventional and non‐interventional variables. Early detection by newborn screening and early liver transplantation appear to offer greater cognitive protection, but none of the currently used nitrogen scavengers was superior with regard to long‐term neurocognitive outcome. Further confirmation could determine these variables as important clinical indicators of neuroprotection for individuals with UCDs.&lt;/p&gt;

 Although several agents have been identified to provide therapeutic benefits in Huntington Disease (HD), the number of conventionally used treatments remains limited and only symptomatic. Thus, it is plausible that the need to identify new therapeutic targets for the development of alternative and more effective treatments is becoming increasingly urgent.  Recently, sphingosine-1-phosphate axis has been reported to be a valid potential novel molecular target for therapy development in HD.  Modulation of aberrant metabolism of S1P in HD has been proved to exert neuroprotective action in vitro settings including human HD iPSC-derived neurons.  In this study, we investigated whether promoting S1P production by stimulating Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SPHK1) by the selective activator, K6PC-5, may have therapeutic benefit in-vivo in R6/2 HD mouse model. Our findings indicate that chronic administration of 0.05 mg/kg K6PC-5 exerted an overall beneficial effect in R6/2 mice. It significantly slowed down the progressive motor deficit associated with disease progression, modulated S1P metabolism, evoked the activation of pro-survival pathways and markedly reduced the toxic mutant huntingtin aggregation. These results suggest that K6PC-5 may represent a future therapeutic option in HD and may potentially counteract the perturbed brain function induced by deregulated S1P pathways</content>

 Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous N-acylethanolamide that modulates ethanol-seeking behavior and ethanol-induced neuroinflammation. In the present study we further analyze the role of OEA in hippocampal neurogenesis, BDNF-ERK signaling and spatial memory that are affected by alcohol. Additionally, we addressed the effects of OEA on the association of alcohol and cannabis, a frequent combination in human alcohol addicts, and whose long-term effects are far from being understood. To this end, OEA (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was pharmacologically administered for 5 days/week in a preclinical model of adolescent rats with binge-like consumption (1 day/week) of ethanol (3 g/kg, i.g.) combined or not with acute administrations of Δ9-THC (5 mg/kg, i.p.) for 5 weeks. OEA restored ethanol/THC-related decreases in both short-term spatial memory (spontaneous alternation by Y-maze) and circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), reduced cell proliferation (Mki67 and IdU+ cells) and maturation (Dcx, Calb1), and improved cell survival (Casp3 and BrdU+ cells) in the dorsal hippocampus. Interestingly, OEA alone or combined with THC also decreased the mRNA levels of neurotrophic factors (Bdnf, Ntf3) and the NT3 receptor TrkC, but increased the BDNF receptor TrkB in the hippocampus of ethanol-exposed rats. These effects were likely associated with a OEA-specific phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1, key signaling regulators of cell proliferation and survival. These results suggest a regulatory role of OEA in short-term spatial memory and hippocampal neurogenesis through BDNF/AKT/ERK1 signaling in response to acute THC in an alcoholic context during adolescence.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of hereditary and progressive neurological disorders characterized by a loss of balance and motor coordination typically associated with cerebellar atrophy. The most prevalent SCA types are all polyQ disorders like Huntington’s disease, sharing the most relevant events in pathogenesis with this basal ganglia disorder, but with most of the damage concentrated in cerebellar neurons, and in their afferent and efferent connections (e.g. brainstem nuclei). SCAs have no cure and effective symptom-alleviating and disease-modifying therapies are not currently available. However, based on results obtained in studies conducted in murine models and information derived from analyses in post-mortem tissue samples from patients, which show notably higher levels of CB1 receptors found in different cerebellar neuronal subpopulations, the blockade of these receptors has been proposed for acutely modulating motor incoordination in cerebellar ataxias, whereas their chronic activation for preserving specific neuronal losses. Additional studies in post-mortem tissues from SCA patients have also demonstrated elevated levels of CB2 receptors in Purkinje neurons, as well as in glial elements in the granular layer and in the cerebellar white matter, with a similar profile found for endocannabinoid hydrolyzing enzymes, then suggesting that activating CB2 receptors and/or inhibiting these enzymes may also serve to develop cannabinoid-based neuroprotective therapies. The present review will address both aspects. On one hand, that the endocannabinoid signaling becomes dysregulated in the cerebellum and also in other CNS structures (e.g. brainstem, basal ganglia) in SCAs, which may contribute to the progression of pathogenic events in these diseases. On the other hand, that these endocannabinoid alterations may be pharmacologically corrected or enhanced, and this may have therapeutic consequences, either alleviating specific symptoms or eliciting neuroprotective effects, an objective presently under investigation.</content>

 The cerebellum is an essential component in the control of motor patterns. Despite dramatic alteration of basal ganglia morpho-functionality in Parkinson’s disease (PD), cerebellar function appears to be unaffected by the disease. Only recently this brain structure has been proposed to play compensatory roles in PD-induced motor dysfunction, particularly during the initial asymptomatic stages of PD. In PD subjects and animal models of Parkinson’s disease, such the MPTP-treated mice, brain structures other than basal ganglia are also affected by the disease, including cortical areas not involved in motor control. Thus, it is noteworthy that the cerebellum remains unaffected. In the present study, we have analysed the lipid composition of membrane microdomains (lipid rafts and non-raft domains) and assessed the expression levels of genes encoding for the synthesis of membrane-related lipids. The outcomes revealed that membrane domain lipids in cerebellum are highly preserved both in control and MPTP-treated mice as compared to control animals. Likewise, only small, mostly not significant, changes were observed in the expression of lipid-related genes in the cerebellum. Indeed, most changes were related to aging rather than to the exposure to the neurotoxin. Conversely, in the same animals, lipid composition and gene expression were dramatically altered in the occipital cortex, a brain area unrelated to the control of motor function. Immunohistochemistry of both brain areas revealed that the dopamine transporter (DAT) was expressed in occipital cortex but not in the cerebellum, as did DAT mRNAs. As MPTP neurotoxicity requires the expression of dopamine transporter to access intracellular compartments, we hypothesized that the absence of DAT in cerebellum hampers MPTP-induced toxicity. We conclude that cerebellum is endowed with efficient mechanisms to preserve nerve cell lipid homeostasis, which greatly maintain the stability of membrane microdomains involved in synaptic transmission, signal transduction and intercellular communication, which together may participate in the compensatory role of cerebellum in PD symptomatology.</content>

 Medial frontal cortex is currently viewed as the main hub of the performance monitoring system; upon detection of an error committed, it establishes functional connections with brain regions involved in task performance, thus leading to neural adjustments in them. Previous research has identified targets of such adjustments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cortical regions, motor cortical areas, and subthalamic nucleus. Yet most of such studies involved visual tasks with relatively moderate cognitive load and strong dependence on motor inhibition – thus highlighting sensory, executive and motor effects while underestimating sensorimotor transformation and related aspects of decision making. Currently there is ample evidence that posterior parietal cortical areas are involved in task-specific neural processes of decision making (including evidence accumulation, sensorimotor transformation, attention, etc.) – yet, to our knowledge, no EEG studies have demonstrated post-error increase in functional connectivity in the theta-band between midfrontal and posterior parietal areas during performance on non-visual tasks. In the present study, we recorded EEG while subjects were performing an auditory version of the cognitively demanding attentional condensation task; this task involves rather non-straightforward stimulus-to-response mapping rules, thus, creating increased load on sensorimotor transformation. We observed strong pre-response alpha-band suppression in the left parietal area, which presumably reflected involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in task-specific decision-making processes. Negative feedback was followed by increased midfrontal theta-band power and increased functional coupling in the theta band between midfrontal and left parietal regions. This could be interpreted as activation of the performance monitoring system and top-down influence of this system on the posterior parietal regions involved in decision making, respectively. This inter-site coupling related to negative feedback was stronger for subjects who tended to commit errors with slower response times. Generally, current findings support the idea that slower errors are related to the state of outcome uncertainty caused by failures of task-specific processes, associated with posterior parietal regions.</content>

 Extensive research using penetrating electrodes implanted in the central and peripheral nervous systems has been performed for many decades with significant advances made in recent years. While penetrating devices provide proximity to individual neurons in vivo, they suffer from declining performance over the course of months and often fail within a year. 2D histology studies using serial tissue sections have been extremely insightful in identifying and quantifying factors such as astroglial scar formation and neuronal death around the implant sites that may be contributing to failures. However, 2D histology has limitations in providing a holistic picture of the problems occurring at the electrode-tissue interface and struggles to analyze tissue below the electrode tips where the electrode tracks are no longer visible. In this study, we present 3D reconstruction of serial sections to overcome the limitations of 2D histological analysis. We used a cohort of software: XuvStitch, AutoAligner, and Imaris coupled with custom MATLAB programming to correct warping effects. Once the 3D image volume was reconstructed, we were able to use Imaris to quantify neuronal densities around the electrode tips of a hybrid microelectrode array incorporating Blackrock, Microprobes, and NeuroNexus electrodes in the same implant. This paper presents proof-of-concept and detailed methodological description of a technique which can be used to quantify neuronal densities in future studies of implanted electrodes.</content>

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been categorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. AD is a significant health-care burden because of its increased occurrence (specifically in the elderly population) and the lack of effective treatments and preventive methods. With an increase in life expectancy, the CDC expects AD cases to rise to 15 million by 2060. Aging has been previously associated with susceptibility to AD, and there are ongoing efforts to effectively differentiate between normal and AD age-related brain degeneration and memory loss. AD targets neuronal function and can cause neuronal loss due to the buildup of amyloid-beta  plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles.   Our study aims to identify temporal changes within gene expression profiles of healthy controls and AD subjects. We conducted a meta-analysis using publicly available microarray expression data from AD and healthy cohorts. For our meta-analysis, we selected datasets that reported donor age and gender, and used Affymetrix and Illumina microarray platforms (8 datasets, 2,088 samples). Raw microarray expression data were re-analyzed, and normalized across arrays. We then performed an analysis of variance, using a linear model that incorporated age, tissue type, sex, and disease state as effects, as well as study to account for batch effects, and including binary interaction between factors.  Our results identified 3,735 statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted p&amp;lt;0.05) gene expression differences between AD and healthy controls, which we filtered for biological effect (10% two-tailed quantiles of mean differences between groups) to obtain 352 genes. Interesting pathways identified as enriched comprised of neurodegenerative diseases pathways (including AD), and also mitochondrial translation and dysfunction, synaptic vesicle cycle and GABAergic synapse, and gene ontology terms enrichment in neuronal system, transmission across chemical synapses and mitochondrial translation.  Overall our approach allowed us to effectively combine multiple available microarray datasets and identify gene expression differences between AD and healthy individuals including full age and tissue type considerations. Our findings provide potential gene and pathway associations that can be targeted to improve AD diagnostics and potentially treatment or prevention. (US).</content>

 Introduction: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes partial or complete damage to sensory and motor pathways and induces immediate changes in cortical function. Current rehabilitative strategies do not address this early alteration, therefore impacting the degree of neuroplasticity and subsequent recovery. The following study aims to test if a non-invasive brain stimulation technique such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in promoting plasticity and rehabilitation, and can be used as an early intervention strategy in a rat model of SCI.   Methods: A contusion SCI was induced at segment T9 in adult rats. An rTMS coil was positioned over the brain to deliver high frequency stimulation. Behavior, motor and sensory functions were tested in three groups: SCI rats that received high-frequency (20 Hz) rTMS within 10 minutes post injury (acute-TMS; n=7); SCI rats that received TMS starting two weeks post injury (chronic-TMS; n=5), and SCI rats that received sham TMS (no-TMS, n=5). Locomotion was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) and gridwalk tests. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the forepaw across all groups to measure integrity of motor pathways. Functional MRI (fMRI) responses to contralateral tactile hindlimb stimulation were measured in an 11.7T horizontal bore small-animal scanner.   Results: The acute-TMS group demonstrated the fastest improvements in locomotor performance in both the BBB and gridwalk tests compared to chronic and no-TMS groups. MEP responses from forepaw showed significantly greater difference in the inter-peak latency between acute-TMS and no-TMS groups, suggesting increases in motor function. Finally, the acute-TMS group showed increased fMRI-evoked responses to hindlimb stimulation over the right and left hindlimb primary somatosensory representations (S1), respectively; the chronic-TMS group showed moderate sensory responses in comparison, and the no-TMS group exhibited the lowest sensory responses to both hindlimbs.  Conclusion: The results suggest that rTMS therapy beginning in the acute phase after spinal cord injury promotes neuroplasticity and is an effective rehabilitative approach in a rat model of SCI.</content>

 Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a rare neurological disorder due to deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Frataxin deficiency results in impaired mitochondrial function and iron deposition in affected tissues. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine which was mostly known as a key regulator of erythropoiesis until cumulative evidence showed additional neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. These features offered the rationale for advancement of EPO in clinical trials in different neurological disorders in the past years, including FRDA. Several mechanisms of action of EPO may be beneficial in FRDA. First of all, EPO exposure results in frataxin upregulation in vitro and in vivo. By promoting erythropoiesis, EPO influences iron metabolism and induces shifts in iron pool which may ameliorate conditions of free iron excess and iron accumulation. Furthermore, EPO signaling is crucial for mitochondrial gene activation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Up to date nine clinical trials investigated the effects of EPO and derivatives in FRDA. The majority of these studies had a proof-of-concept design. Considering the natural history of FRDA, all of them were too short in duration and not powered for clinical changes. However, these studies addressed significant issues in the treatment with EPO, such as (1) the challenge of the dose finding, (2) stability of frataxin up-regulation, (3) continuous versus intermittent stimulation with EPO/regimen, or (4) tissue changes in vivo after EPO exposure (muscle biopsy, brain imaging). Despite several clinical trials in the past, no treatment is available for the treatment of FRDA.  Current lines of research focus on gene therapy, frataxin replacement strategies and on regulation of key metabolic checkpoints such as NrF2. Due to potential crosstalk with all these mechanisms, interventions on EPO pathway still represent a valuable research field. The recent development of small EPO mimetics which maintain cytoprotective properties without erythropoietic action may open a new era in EPO research for the treatment of FRDA.</content>

 The aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) is a major factor behind the onset of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Sublocalization of this protein may be relevant for the formation of multimeric α-syn oligomeric configurations, insoluble aggregates that form Lewy bodies in PD brains. Processing of this protein aggregation is regulated by associations with distinct lipid classes. For instance, instability of lipid raft (LR) microdomains, membrane regions with a particular lipid composition, is an early event in the development of PD. However, the relevance of membrane microdomains in the regulation and trafficking of the distinct α-syn configurations associated with PD remains unexplored. In this study, using 6- and 14-month-old healthy and MPTP-treated animals as a model of PD, we have investigated the putative molecular alterations of raft membrane microstructures, and their impact on α-syn dynamics and conformation. A comparison of lipid analyses of LR microstructures and non-raft (NR) fractions showed alterations in gangliosides, cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and phospholipids in the midbrain and cortex of aged and MPTP-treated mice. In particular, the increase of PUFA and phosphatidylserine (PS) during aging correlated with α-syn multimeric formation in NR. In these aggregates, α-syn was phosphorylated in pSer129, the most abundant post-transductional modification of α-syn promoting toxic aggregation. Interestingly, similar variations in PUFA and PS content correlating with α-syn insoluble accumulation were also detected in membrane microstructures from the human cortex of incidental Parkinson Disease (iPD) and PD, as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, structural changes in membrane lipid microenvironments may induce rearrangements in raft-interacting proteins involved in other neuropathologies. Therefore, we also investigated the dynamic of other protein markers involved in cognition and memory impairment such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), ionotropic NMDA receptor (NMDAR2B), prion protein (PrPc) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose activity depends on membrane lipid organization. We observed a decline of these protein markers in LR fractions with the progression of aging and pathology. Overall, our findings demonstrate that lipid alterations in membranous compartments promoted by brain aging and PD-like injury may have an effect on α-syn aggregation and segregation in abnormal multimeric structures.</content>

 The safe charge injection capacity and charge density of neural stimulating electrodes is based on empirical evidence obtained from stimulating feline cortices.  Stimulation induced tissue damage may be caused by electrochemical or biological mechanisms.  Separating these mechanisms requires greater understanding of charge transfer at the electrode-tissue interface.  Clinical devices typically use a biphasic waveform with controlled current.  Therefore, the charge injection mechanism and charge injection capacity of platinum was assessed on a commercial potentiostat by chronopotentiometry (controlled current stimulation).  Platinum is a non-ideal electrode, charge injection by chronopotentiometry can be passed via capacitive and Faradaic mechanisms.  Electrodes were tested under a variety of conditions to assess the impact on charge injection capacity.  The change in electrode potential (charge injection capacity) was affected by applied charge density, pulse length, pulse polarity, electrode size, polishing method, electrolyte composition and oxygen concentration.  The safe charge injection capacity and charge density could be increased by changing the electrode-solution composition and stimulation parameters.  However, certain conditions (eg acid polished electrodes) allowed the electrode to exceed the water electrolysis potential despite the stimulation protocol being deemed safe according to the Shannon plot.  Multiple current pulses led to a shift or ratcheting in electrode potential due to changes in the electrode-solution composition. An accurate measure of safe charge injection capacity and charge density of an implantable electrode can only be obtained from suitable conditions (an appropriately degassed electrolyte and clinically relevant electrode structure).  Cyclic voltammetric measurement of charge injection capacity can be performed on implantable electrodes, but will not provide information on electrode stability to multiple chronopotentiometric pulses.  In contrast, chronopotentiometry will provide details on electrode stability, but the minimum time resolution of typical commercial potentiostats (ms range) is greater than used in a clinical stimulator (µs range) so that extrapolation to short stimulation pulses is required.  A chronopotentiometic biphasic protocol is typically used as an impedance test.  Here it is shown that the measured potential is a function of many parameters.  Subsequently, impedance test results allow electrode comparison and to indicate electrode failure, but use of Ohm’s law to calculate an impedance value is not valid.</content>

 Spreading depolarizations (SD) are characterized by near-complete breakdown of the transmembrane ion gradients, neuronal oedema and activity loss (=depression). The SD extreme in ischemic tissue, termed ‘terminal SD’, shows prolonged depolarization, in addition to a slow baseline variation called ‘negative ultraslow potential’ (NUP). The NUP is the largest bioelectrical signal ever recorded from the human brain and is thought to reflect the progressive recruitment of neurons into death in the wake of SD. However, it is unclear whether the NUP is a field potential or results from contaminating sensitivities of platinum electrodes. In contrast to Ag/AgCl-based electrodes in animals, platinum/iridium electrodes are the gold standard for intracranial direct current (DC) recordings in humans. Here, we investigated the full continuum including short-lasting SDs under normoxia, long-lasting SDs under systemic hypoxia, and terminal SD under severe global ischemia using platinum/iridium electrodes in rats to better understand their recording characteristics. Sensitivities for detecting SDs or NUPs were 100% for both electrode types. Nonetheless, the platinum/iridium-recorded NUP was ten times smaller in rats than humans. The SD continuum was then further investigated by comparing subdural platinum/iridium and epidural titanium peg electrodes in patients. In seven patients with either aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage or malignant hemispheric stroke, two epidural peg electrodes were placed 10mm from a subdural strip. We found that 31/67 SDs (46%) on the subdural strip were also detected epidurally. SDs that had longer negative DC shifts and spread more widely across the subdural strip were more likely to be observed in epidural recordings. One patient displayed an SD-initiated NUP while undergoing brain death despite continued circulatory function. The NUP’s amplitude was -150mV subdurally and -67mV epidurally. This suggests that the human NUP is a bioelectrical field potential rather than an artefact of electrode sensitivity to other factors, since the dura separates the epidural from the subdural compartment and the epidural microenvironment was unlikely changed, given that ventilation, arterial pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation remained constant during the NUP. Our data provide further evidence for the clinical value of invasive electrocorticographic monitoring, highlighting important possibilities as well as limitations of less invasive recording techniques.</content>

 There is a principle in science, known as Occam’s razor, that says the correct solution is usually the one with the simplest explanation. The microbiota-gut-brain axis, an interdependent series of communication loops between the enteric nervous system, the microbiota, the gut, and the brain, offers important insight into how changes in our gut affect distant organs like our brains. The inherent complexity of this axis with the crosstalk between the immune system, inflammatory states, and the thousands of bacteria, viral, and fungal species that together make up the microbiota make studying the interactions that govern this axis difficult and far from parsimonious. It is becoming increasingly clear that the microbiota is integral to this axis. Disruption of the healthy flora, a phenomenon collectively referred to as dysbiosis, has been implicated as a driver for several diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, and neurological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Teasing apart these complex interactions as they pertain to PD is critical for our understanding of this debilitating disease, but more importantly, for the development of future treatments. So far, treatments have been unable to stop this neurodegenerative disease, succeeding only in briefly dampening symptoms and buying patients time before the inevitable loss of function ensues. Given that the 10-year prognosis for death or life-limiting disability with someone diagnosed with PD is upwards of 80%, there is a desperate need for curative treatments that go beyond symptom management. If PD does begin in the periphery with bidirectional communication between the microbiota and the immune system, as recent literature suggests, there is an exciting possibility that progression could be stopped before it reaches the brain. This systematic review assesses the current literature surrounding the role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of alpha-synucleinopathies and explores the hypothesis that alpha-synuclein folding is modulated by the microbiota. Furthermore, we discuss how changes in the gut environment can lead to pathology and outline the implications that advances in understanding the interactions between host and microbiota will have on future research and the development of potential biomarkers.</content>

 Reproducibly generating human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based functional neuronal circuits, solely obtained from single individuals, poses particular challenges to achieve personalized and patient specific functional neuronal in vitro models. A hallmark of functional neuronal assemblies, synchronous neuronal activity, can be non-invasively studied by microelectrode array (MEA) technology, reliably capturing physiological and pathophysiological aspects of human brain function. In our here presented manuscript, we demonstrate a procedure to generate 3D neural aggregates comprising astrocytes, oligodendroglial cells and neurons obtained from the same human tissue sample. Moreover, we demonstrate the robust ability of those neurons to create a highly synchronously active neuronal network within 3 weeks in vitro, without additionally applied astrocytes. The fusion of MEA-technology with functional neuronal circuits solely obtained from one individuals cells represent isogenic person-specific human neuronal sensor chips that pave the way for specific personalized in vitro neuronal networks as well as neurological and neuropsychiatric disease modelling.</content>

 Mitochondrial quality control is important in neurological diseases, but in the genetic Parkinson´s disease caused by mutations in PINK and parkin mitochondrial degradation through autophagy is crucial.. Reductions in autophagy and mitophagy are implicated in aging, age related diseases and Parkinson. The parkin null mice (PK-KO) show only a subtle phenotype, apparent with age or with stressors. We have studied the changes in the lipidomic composition of the mitochondrial membranes isolated from the brains of young and old PK-KO mice and compared them to wild type in order to determine possible implications for Parkinson´s disease pathology. We observed an increase in the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine in the young PK-KO mice that is lost in the old and correlate to changes in the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. PK-KO old mice mitochondria showed lower phosphatidylglicerol and phosphatidylinositol levels and higher levels of some forms of hydroxylated ceramides. Regarding cardiolipins there were changes in the degree of saturation mainly with age. The lipidomic composition discriminates between the study groups using partial least square discriminant analysis. We discuss the relevance of the lipid changes for the autophagic activity, the mitophagy, the mitochondrial activity and the Parkinson´s disease pathology in absence of parkin.</content>

 Contralateral intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) can potentially improve swallowing disorders with unilateral lesion of the swallowing cortex. However, the after-effects of iTBS on brain excitability remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the alterations of temporal dynamics of inter-regional connectivity induced by iTBS following continuous TBS (cTBS) in the contralateral suprahyoid muscle cortex. A total of 20 right-handed healthy subjects underwent cTBS over the left suprahyoid muscle motor cortex and then immediately afterwards, iTBS was applied to the contralateral homologous area. All of the subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) before and post-TBS implemented on a different day. We compared the static and dynamic functional connectivity (FC) between the post-TBS and the baseline. The whole-cortical time series and a sliding-window correlation approach were used to quantify the dynamic characteristics of FC. Compared with the baseline, for static FC measurement, increased FC was found in the precuneus (BA 19), left fusiform gyrus (BA 37), and right pre/post-central gyrus (BA 4/3), and decreased FC was observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC) (BA 29) and left inferior parietal lobule (BA 39). However, in the dynamic FC analysis, post-TBS showed reduced FC in the left angular and PCC in the early windows, and in the following windows, increased FC in multiple cortical areas including bilateral pre- and postcentral gyri and paracentral lobule and non-sensorimotor areas including the prefrontal, temporal and occipital gyrus, and brain stem. Our results indicate that iTBS reverses the after-effects induced by cTBS on the contralateral suprahyoid muscle cortex. Dynamic FC analysis displayed a different pattern of alteration compared with the static FC approach in brain excitability induced by TBS. Our results provide novel evidence for us in understanding the topographical and temporal aftereffects linked to brain excitability induced by different TBS protocols and might be valuable information for their application in the rehabilitation of deglutition.</content>

 We describe the steps involved in analysis of multi-modal, multi-subject human neuroimaging data using the SPM12 free and open source software (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and a publically-available dataset organised according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117/). The dataset contains electroencephalographic (EEG), magnetoencephalographic (MEG), and functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 16 subjects who undertook multiple runs of a simple task performed on a large number of famous, unfamiliar and scrambled faces. We demonstrate: 1) batching and scripting of preprocessing of multiple runs/subjects of combined MEG and EEG data, 2) creation of trial-averaged evoked responses, 3) source-reconstruction of the power (induced and evoked) across trials within a time-frequency window around the “N/M170” evoked component, using structural MRI for forward modelling and simultaneous inversion (fusion) of MEG and EEG data, 4) group-based optimisation of spatial priors during M/EEG source reconstruction using fMRI data on the same paradigm, and 5) statistical mapping across subjects of cortical source power increases for faces versus scrambled faces.</content>

 Real-time visualization of large-scale neural dynamics in whole mammalian brains is hindered with existing neuroimaging methods having limited capacity when it comes to imaging large tissue volumes at high speeds. Optoacoustic imaging has been shown to be capable of real-time three-dimensional imaging of multiple cerebral hemodynamic parameters in rodents. However, optoacoustic imaging of calcium activity deep within the mammalian brain is hampered by strong blood absorption in the visible light spectrum as well as lack of activity labels excitable in the near-infrared window. We have developed and validated an isolated whole mouse brain preparation labelled with genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f, which can closely resemble in vivo conditions. An optoacoustic imaging system coupled to a superfusion system was further designed and used for rapid volumetric monitoring of stimulus-evoked calcium dynamics in the brain. Our new technique captures calcium fluxes as true three-dimensional information across the entire brain with temporal resolution of 10ms and spatial resolution of 150µm, thus enabling large-scale neural recording at penetration depths and spatio-temporal resolution scales not covered with any existing neuroimaging techniques.</content>

 Objective: Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease, which is prone to relapse and affects individuals of all ages worldwide, particularly the very young and elderly. Up to one-third of these patients are medically intractable and require resection surgery. However, the outcomes of epilepsy surgery rely upon the clear identification of epileptogenic zone (EZ). The combination of cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) and electrocorticography (ECoG) provides an opportunity to observe the connectivity of human brain network and more comprehensive information that may help the clinicians localize the epileptogenic focus more precisely. However, there is no standard analysis method in the clinical application of CCEPs, especially for the quantitative analysis of abnormal connectivity of epileptic networks. The aim of this paper was to present an approach on the batch processing of CCEPs and provide information relating to the localization of EZ for clinical study. Methods: Eight medically intractable epilepsy patients were included in this study. Each patient was implanted with subdural grid electrodes and electrical stimulations were applied directly to their cortex to induce CCEPs. After signal preprocessing, we constructed three effective brain networks at different spatial scales for each patient, regarding the amplitudes of CCEPs as the connection weights. Graph theory was then applied to analyze the brain network topology of epileptic patients, and the topological metrics of EZ and non-EZ (NEZ) were compared. Results: The effective connectivity network reconstructed from CCEPs was asymmetric, and both the number and the amplitudes of effective CCEPs decreased with increasing distance between stimulating and recording sites. Besides, the distribution of CCEP responses were associated with the locations of EZ which tended to have higher degree centrality and shortest path length than NEZ. Conclusions: Our results indicated that the brain networks of epileptics were asymmetric and mainly composed of short-distance connections. The degree centrality and shortest path length were highly consistent to the distribution of the EZ, and these topological parameters have great potential to be readily applied to the clinical localization of the epileptogenic zone.</content>

 Accurate and automatic segmentation of infant hippocampal subfields from magnetic resonance (MR) images is an important step for studying memory related infant neurological diseases. However, existing hippocampus subfield segmentation methods were generally designed based on adult subjects and would compromise performance when applied to infant subjects due to insufficient tissue contrast and fast changing structural patterns of early hippocampal development. In this paper, we propose a new fully convolutional network (FCN) for infant hippocampus subfield segmentation by embedding the dilated dense network in the U-net, namely DUnet. The embedded dilated dense network can generate multi-scale features while keeping high spatial resolution, which is useful in fusing the low-level features in the contracting path with the high-level features in the expanding path. To further improve the performance, we group every two convolutional layers with one residual connection in the DUnet, and obtain the Residual DUnet (ResDUnet). Experimental results show that the proposed DUnet and ResDUnet improve the average Dice coefficient by 2.1% and 2.5% for infant hippocampus subfield segmentation, respectively, when compared with the 3D U-net. The results also demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods.</content>

 Current discussions of the ethical aspects of big data are shaped by concerns regarding the social consequences of both the widespread adoption of machine learning and the ways in which biases in data can be replicated and perpetuated. We instead focus here on the ethical issues arising from the use of big data in international neuroscience collaborations. Neuroscience innovation relies upon neuroinformatics, large-scale data collection and analysis enabled by novel and emergent technologies. Each step of this work involves aspects of ethics, ranging from concerns for adherence to informed consent or animal protection principles and issues of data re-use at the stage of data collection, to data protection and privacy during data processing and analysis, and issues of attribution and intellectual property at the data-sharing and publication stages. Significant dilemmas and challenges with far-reaching implications are also inherent, including reconciling the ethical imperative for openness and validation with data protection compliance, and considering future innovation trajectories or the potential for misuse of research results. Furthermore, these issues are subject to local interpretations within different ethical cultures applying diverse legal systems emphasising different aspects. Neuroscience big data require a concerted approach to research across boundaries, wherein ethical aspects are integrated within a transparent, dialogical data governance process. We address this by developing the concept of ‘responsible data governance’, applying the principles of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) to the challenges presented by governance of neuroscience big data in the Human Brain Project (HBP).</content>

 The abnormality occurs at molecular, cellular as well as network levels in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prior to diagnosis. Most previous connectivity studies were conducted at 1 out of 3 (local, meso and global) scales in subjects covering only part of the entire AD spectrum (subjective cognitive decline, SCD; amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI; and then fully manifest AD). Data interpretation within the framework of disease progression is thus difficult. The current study included 3 age- and sex-matched cohorts: SCD (n=32), aMCI (n=37) and fully-established AD (n=30). A group of healthy elderly subjects (n=40) was included as normal control (NC). Network connectivity was examined at the local (degree centrality), meso (subgraph centrality), and global (eigenvector and page-rank centralities) levels. In compared to NC, SCD subjects had isolated decrease of subgraph centrality in primary (somatomotor and visual) networks. aMCI subjects had decreased centralities at all 3 scales in associative (frontoparietal control, dorsal attention, limbic and default) networks. AD subjects had increased centrality at the global scale in all 7 networks. There was a positive association between MoCA scores and DC in the frontoparietal control network in SCD, a negative relationship between MMSE scores and EC in the somatomotor network in AD. These findings suggest that the primary network is impaired as early as in SCD. Impairment in the associative network also starts at the local level at this stage and may contribute to the cognitive decline. As associative network impairment extends from local to meso and global scales in aMCI, compensatory mechanisms in the primary network are activated.</content>

 Combined non-invasive brain stimulation and rehabilitation interventions have the potential to improve function in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP), however their effects on developing brain function are not well understood. In a proof-of-principle study, we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure changes in corticospinal excitability and relationships to motor performance following a randomized controlled trial consisting of 10 days of combined constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the contralesional motor cortex. Twenty children and young adults (mean age = 12 years, 9 month, range = 7 years 7 months, 21 year, 7 months) with UCP participated. TMS testing was performed before, after, and six months after the intervention to measure motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and cortical silent period (CSP) duration. The association between neurophysiologic and motor outcomes, and differences in excitability between hemispheres were examined. Contralesional MEP amplitude decreased as hypothesized in 5 of 5 participants receiving active tDCS immediately after and 6 months after the intervention, however no statistically significant differences between intervention groups were noted for MEP amplitude (mean difference = -323.9 µV, 95% CI = [-989, 341], p = 0.34) or CSP duration (mean difference = 3.9 ms, 95% CI = [-7.7, 15.5], p = 0.51). Changes in corticospinal excitability were not statistically associated with improvements in hand function after the intervention. Across all participants, MEP amplitudes measured in the more-affected hand from both contralesional (mean difference = -474.5 µV) and ipsilesional hemispheres (-624.5 µV) were smaller compared to the less-affected hand. Assessing neurophysiologic changes after tDCS in children with UCP provides an understanding of long-term effects on brain excitability to help determine its potential as a therapeutic intervention. Additional investigation into the neurophysiologic effects of tDCS in larger samples of children with UCP are needed to confirm these findings.</content>

 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to have mixed effects on working memory (WM) capacity in healthy individuals. Different stimulation paradigms may account for these discrepancies, with certain features being favored. To determine the effect in the context of anodal tDCS, we investigated whether anodal tDCS induced cortical oscillatory changes during a WM task. Specifically, we tested whether anodal offline tDCS over the left prefrontal cortex enhances WM capacity by modulating the oscillatory activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using magnetoencephalography (MEG). This study employed a double-blind, randomized, crossover design, in which 24 healthy right-handed participants conducted MEG recordings during a 3-back task after administration of 2 mA tDCS or sham stimulation as a placebo. Our results showed that the effect of tDCS did not appear in the behavioral indices – WM accuracy (d´) or reaction time. From the results of the time-frequency analysis, significant event-related synchronization (ERS) in the high-gamma band (82 - 84 Hz) of the left DLPFC was found under the tDCS condition; however, ERS was not correlated with WM capacity. Furthermore, we calculated the modulation index (MI), which indicates the strength of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). tDCS significantly decreased MI of the left DLPFC, representing the theta-gamma PAC during the n-back task using color names as verbal stimuli. Our results suggest that although tDCS increased the gamma-band oscillation indicating greater neural activity in the left DLPFC, it did not lead to an improvement of WM capacity; this may be due to the inability of gamma-band oscillation to couple with the task-induced theta wave. WM capacity might not increase unless theta-gamma PAC is not enhanced by tDCS.</content>

 In the near future, vehicles will gradually gain more autonomous functionalities. Drivers’ activity will be less about driving than about monitoring intelligent systems to which driving action will be delegated. Road safety, therefore, remains dependent on the human factor and we should identify the limits beyond which driver’s functional state (DFS) may no longer be able to ensure safety. Depending on the level of automation, estimating the DFS may have different targets, e.g. assessing driver’s situation awareness in lower levels of automation and his ability to respond to emerging hazard or assessing driver’s ability to monitor the vehicle performing operational tasks in higher levels of automation. Unfitted DFS (e.g., drowsiness) may impact the driver ability respond to taking over abilities. This paper reviews the most appropriate psychophysiological indices in naturalistic driving while considering the DFS through exogenous sensors, providing the more efficient trade-off between reliability and intrusiveness. The DFS also originates from kinematic data of the vehicle, thus providing information that indirectly relates to drivers behaviour. The whole data should be synchronously processed, providing a diagnosis on the DFS, and bringing it to the attention of the decision maker in real time. Next, making the information available can be permanent or intermittent (or even undelivered), and may also depend on the automation level. Such interface can include recommendations for decision support or simply give neutral instruction. Mapping of relevant psychophysiological and behavioural indicators for DFS will enable practitioners and researchers provide reliable estimates, fitted to the level of automation.</content>

 The cerebellum is involved in some forms of motor coordination and learning, and in cognitive and emotional functions. To elucidate the functions of the cerebellum, it is important to unravel the detailed connections of the cerebellar neurons. Although the cerebellar neural circuit structure is generally conserved among vertebrates, it is not clear whether the cerebellum receives and processes the same or similar information in different vertebrate species. Here, we performed monosynaptic retrograde tracing with recombinant rabies viruses to identify the afferent connections of the zebrafish cerebellar neurons. We used a G-deleted rabies virus that expressed GFP. The virus was also pseudotyped with EnvA, an envelope protein of avian sarcoma and leucosis virus (ALSV-A). For the specific infection of cerebellar neurons, we expressed the rabies virus glycoprotein (G) gene and the envelope protein TVA, which is the receptor for EnvA, in Purkinje cells (PCs) or granule cells (GCs), using the promoter for aldolase Ca (aldoca) or cerebellin 12 (cbln12), respectively. When the virus infected PCs in the aldoca line, GFP was detected in the PCs’ presynaptic neurons, including granule cells (GCs) and neurons in the inferior olivary nuclei (IOs), which send climbing fibers (CFs). These observations validated the rabies virus tracing method in zebrafish. When the virus infected GCs in the cbln12 line, GFP was again detected in their presynaptic neurons, including neurons in the pretectum nuclei, the nucleus lateralis valvulae (NLV), the central gray (CG), the medial octavolateralis nucleus (MON), and the descending octaval nucleus (DON). GFP was not observed in these neurons when the virus infected PCs in the aldoca line. These precerebellar neurons generally agree with those reported for other teleost species and are at least partly conserved with those in mammals. Our results demonstrate that the rabies virus system can be used for connectome analyses in zebrafish, and provide fundamental information about the cerebellar neural circuits, which will be valuable for elucidating the functions of cerebellar neural circuits in zebrafish.</content>

 Actions are shaped not only by the content of our percepts but also by our confidence in them. To study the cortical representation of perceptual precision in decision making, we acquired functional imaging data whilst participants performed two vibrotactile forced-choice discrimination tasks: a fast-slow judgement, and a same-different judgement. The first task requires a comparison of the perceived vibrotactile frequencies to decide which one is faster. However, the second task requires that the estimated difference between those frequencies is weighed against the precision of each percept – if both stimuli are very precisely perceived, then any slight difference is more likely to be identified than if the percepts are uncertain. We additionally presented either pure sinusoidal or temporally degraded “noisy” stimuli, whose frequency/period differed slightly from cycle to cycle. In this way, we were able to manipulate the perceptual precision. We report a constellation of cortical regions in rostral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior frontal gyrus associated with the perception of stimulus difference, the presence of stimulus noise and the interaction between these factors. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of these data suggested a nonlinear, hierarchical model, whereby activity in the rostral prefrontal cortex (evoked by the presence of stimulus noise) mutually interacts with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (evoked by stimulus differences). This model of effective connectivity outperformed competing models with serial and parallel interactions, hence providing a unique insight into the hierarchical architecture underlying the representation and appraisal of perceptual belief and precision in the prefrontal cortex.</content>

 The neocortex is capable of anticipating the sensory results of movement but the neural mechanisms are poorly understood. In the entorhinal cortex, grid cells represent the location of an animal in its environment, and this location is updated through movement and path integration. In this paper, we propose that sensory neocortex incorporates movement using grid cell-like neurons that represent the location of sensors on an object. We describe a two-layer neural network model that uses cortical grid cells and path integration to robustly learn and recognize objects through movement and predict sensory stimuli after movement. A layer of cells consisting of several grid cell-like modules represents a location in the reference frame of a specific object. Another layer of cells which processes sensory input receives this location input as context and uses it to encode the sensory input in the object’s reference frame. Sensory input causes the network to invoke previously learned locations that are consistent with the input, and motor input causes the network to update those locations. Simulations show that the model can learn hundreds of objects even when object features alone are insufficient for disambiguation. We discuss the relationship of the model to cortical circuitry and suggest that the reciprocal connections between layers 4 and 6 fit the requirements of the model. We propose that the subgranular layers of cortical columns employ grid cell-like mechanisms to represent object specific locations that are updated through movement.</content>

 Obstructive hydrocephalus is a brain disorder in which circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is altered in a manner that causes expansion of fluid-filled intracranial compartments particularly the ventricles. The pyramidal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex are excitatory in nature and their dendritic spines are target of excitatory synapses. This study evaluated the effect of hydrocephalus on dendritic arborization and synaptic structure of the pyramidal neurons of the sensorymotor cortex of neonatal hydrocephalic mice.. Sterile kaolin suspension (0.01ml of 250mg/mL) was injected intracisternally into day old mice. Control animals mice received sham injections. Pups were weighed and sacrificed on postnatal days (PND) 7, 14, 21. Fixed brain tissue blocks were silver impregnated using a modified golgi staining technique and immunolabelled with synaptophysin to determine dendritic morphology and synaptic integrity respectively Data were analysed using ANOVA at α0.05. Golgi staining revealed diminished arborization of the basal dendrites and loss of dendritic spinesin the pyramidal neurons of hydrocephalic mice. There was significant reduction in the percentage immunoreactivity of anti-synaptophysin in hydrocephalic mice at PND 7 (14.26±1.91%), PND 14 (4.19±1.57%) and PND 21 (17.55±2.76%) compared to age-matched controls (62.57±9.40%, 93.01±1.66% and 99.11±0.63% respectively). These alterations may  may impair neuronal connections that are essential for the development of cortical circuits and may contribute to deficits observed in neonatal hydrocephalus.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objectives. Studies have shown preliminary support for mindfulness-based interventions benefitting people with dementia and their caregivers. However, most studies focus on these two groups separately. This study examined whether it would be possible and beneficial for people with dementia and their caregiver to jointly undergo an adjusted Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training, named TANDEM.   Method. The 8-week MBSR training was adjusted based on a literature review and interviews with experts (clinicians and mindfulness trainers). Seven couples (a person with early-stage dementia and their caregiver) participated together in the 8-week TANDEM program. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted after completion. Questionnaires (administered before and after the intervention) assessed the primary outcomes of quality of life and psychological distress (stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms). Secondary outcomes were mindfulness, self-compassion, positive mental health, worrying, and perceived burden (for caregivers). Results. All participants completed the program and reported beneficial effects (relaxation, awareness, acceptance, and resilience). Most managed to integrate exercises into their daily lives and planned to continue their practice. Participating in a group was considered valuable and supportive. Furthermore, it was appreciated that participants could follow the training together (as a couple). The quantitative results showed a small effect on increased quality of life for caregivers. No substantial decrease in psychological distress was apparent. Caregivers displayed a large increase in mindfulness.  Conclusions. The results of this mixed-methods study suggest that an adjusted mindfulness program is feasible and well-received among couples of persons with early-stage dementia and their caregiver, warranting further research in this area.</content>

 Background: Urine samples are ideal for exploration of non-invasive biomarkers to confirm amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) status of patients versus unimpaired ones. Objective: We aimed to detect differentially metabolized amino acids from urine of aMCI patients, which may give clinicians the possibility to intervene with early treatments that curb Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Methods: The study included 208 subjects, 98 of them were aMCI patients, and 110 were control subjects without dementia. Urine samples were taken from each participant and supernatant was obtained for analysis. The concentrations of amino acids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: Urine arginine levels and its metabolites, ornithine in aMCI patients are obviously lower than in normal controls (q&amp;lt;0.2 and p＜0.05). Meanwhile, aMCI patients had significant reduced urine global arginine bioavailability ratio (GABR), and GABR in urine displayed a positive correlation with the score of MMSE. Conclusion: Urine dysregulated arginine metabolism that may serve as a helpful clinical diagnostic biomarker for aMCI in older adults.</content>

 Cells translate extracellular signals to regulate processes such as differentiation, metabolism and proliferation, via transmembranar receptors. G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) belong to the largest family of transmembrane receptors, with over 800 members in the human species. Given the variety of key physiological functions regulated by GPCRs, these are main targets of existing drugs. During normal aging, alterations in the expression and activity of GPCRs have been observed. The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly affected by these alterations, which results in decreased brain functions, neuroregeneration, and increased vulnerability to neuropathologies, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson diseases. GPCRs signal via heterotrimeric G proteins, as Go, the most abundant heterotrimeric G protein in CNS. We here review age-induced effects of GPCRs signaling via the Gi/o subfamily at the CNS. During the aging process, a reduction in protein density is observed for almost half of the Gi/o-coupled GPCRs, particularly in age-vulnerable regions such as the frontal cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and striatum. Gi/o levels also tend to decrease with aging, particularly in regions such as the frontal cortex. Alterations in the expression and activity of GPCRs and coupled G proteins result from altered proteostasis, peroxidation of membranar lipids and age-associated neuronal degeneration and death, and have impact on aging hallmarks and age-related neuropathologies. Further, due to oligomerization of GPCRs at the membrane and their cooperative signaling, down-regulation of a specific Gi/o-coupled GPCR may affect signaling and drug targeting of other types/subtypes of GPCRs with which it dimerizes. Gi/o-coupled GPCRs receptorsomes are thus the focus of more effective therapeutic drugs aiming to prevent or revert the decline in brain functions and increased risk of neuropathologies at advanced ages.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The underlying mechanism that links up the two conditions seems to be the de-sensitisation of insulin signalling. In patients with AD, insulin signalling was found to be de-sensitised in the brain, even if they did not have diabetes. Insulin is an important growth factor that regulates cell growth, energy utilisation, mitochondrial function and replacement, autophagy, oxidative stress management, synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Insulin desensitisation therefore can enhance the risk of developing neurological disorders in later life. Other risk factors such as high blood pressure or brain injury also enhance the likelihood of developing AD. All of those risk factors have one thing in common – they induce a chronic inflammation response in the brain. Pro-inflammatory cytokines block growth factor signalling and enhance oxidative stress. The underlying molecular processes for this are described in the review. Treatments to re-sensitise insulin signalling in the brain are also described, such as nasal insulin tests in AD patients, or treatments with re-sensitising hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). First clinical trials show promising results and are a proof of concept that utilising such treatments is valid.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: The brain atrophy and lesion index (BALI) has been developed to assess whole-brain structural deficits that are commonly seen on MRI in aging. It is unclear whether such changes can be detected at younger ages and how they might relate to other exposures. Here, we investigate how BALI scores, and the subcategories that make the total score, compare across adulthood and whether they are related to the level of cardiovascular risks, in both young and old adulthood. Methods: Data were from 229 subjects (72% men; 24-80 years of age) whose annual health evaluation included a routine anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. A brain atrophy and lesion index (BALI) score was generated for each subject from T2-weighted MRI. Differences in the BALI total score and categorical subscores were examined by age and by the level of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). Regression analysis was used to evaluate relationships between continuous variables. Relative risk ratios (RRR) of CVRF on BALI were examined using a multinomial logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to estimate the classification accuracy. Results: Nearly 90% of the participants had at least one CVRF. Mean CVRF scores increased with age (slope=0.03; r=0.36, 95% confidence intervals: 0.23-0.48; p&amp;lt;0.001). The BALI total score was closely related to age (slope=0.18; r=0.69, 95% confidence intervals: 0.59-0.78; p&amp;lt;0.001), as so were the categorical subscores (r’s= 0.41-0.61, p&amp;lt;0.001); each differed by the number of CVRF (t-test: 4.16-14.83, Chi2: 6.9-43.9, p’s&amp;lt;0.050). Multivariate analyses adjusted for age and sex suggested an independent impact of age and the CVRF on the BALI score (for each year of advanced age, RRR=1.20, 95% CI= 1.11-1.29; for each additional CVRF, RRR=3.63, 95% CI=2.12-6.23). The CVRF and BALI association remained significant even in younger adults. Conclusion: The accumulation of MRI-detectable structural brain deficits can be evident from young adulthood. Age and the number of CVFR are independently associated with BALI score. Further research is needed to understand the extent to which other age-related health deficits can increase the risk of abnormalities in brain structure and function, and how these, with BALI scores relate to cognition.</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Mutations and copy number variants of the CUB and Sushi Multiple Domains 2 (&lt;i&gt;CSMD2&lt;/i&gt;) gene are associated with neuropsychiatric disease. &lt;i&gt;CSMD2&lt;/i&gt; encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain comprising repeats of CUB and Sushi domains. High expression of &lt;i&gt;CSMD2&lt;/i&gt; in the developing and mature brain suggests possible roles in neuron development or function, but the cellular functions of CSMD2 are not known. In this study, we show that mouse &lt;i&gt;Csmd2&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the forebrain. Csmd2 protein exhibits a somatodendritic localization in the neocortex and hippocampus, with smaller puncta localizing to the neuropil. Using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that Csmd2 localizes to dendritic spines and is enriched in the postsynaptic density. Accordingly, we show that the cytoplasmic tail domain of Csmd2 interacts with synaptic scaffolding proteins of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. The association between Csmd2 and MAGUK member PSD-95 is dependent on a PDZ-binding domain on the Csmd2 tail, which is also required for synaptic targeting of Csmd2. Finally, we show that knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Csmd2&lt;/i&gt; expression in hippocampal neuron cultures results in reduced complexity of dendritic arbors and deficits in dendritic spine density. Knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Csmd2&lt;/i&gt; in immature developing neurons results in reduced filopodia density, whereas &lt;i&gt;Csmd2&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in mature neurons causes significant reductions in dendritic spine density and dendrite complexity. Together, these results point toward a function for Csmd2 in development and maintenance of dendrites and synapses, which may account for its association with certain psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Variants in the CUB and Sushi multiple domains (&lt;i&gt;CSMD&lt;/i&gt;) genes have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders that negatively affect cognitive and social performance. However, the mechanisms by which CSMD proteins contribute to proper brain function have yet to be understood. This study demonstrates that mouse Csmd2 is a synaptic protein that interacts with synaptic scaffold protein PSD-95. We also determine that Csmd2 is required for the development and maintenance of the dendritic arbor and dendritic spines of neurons. These results indicate that Csmd2 participates in the development and maintenance of synapses in the mammalian forebrain. Perturbation or loss of Csmd2 function could result in pathological conditions associated with neuropsychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 In the mammalian retina, amacrine cells represent the most diverse cell class and are involved in the spatio-temporal processing of visual signals in the inner plexiform layer. They are connected to bipolar, other amacrine and ganglion cells, forming complex networks via electrical and chemical synapses. The small-field A8 amacrine cell was shown to receive non-selective glutamatergic input from OFF and ON cone bipolar cells at its bistratified dendrites in sublamina 1 and 4 of the inner plexiform layer. Interestingly, it was also shown to form electrical synapses with ON cone bipolar cells, thus resembling the rod pathway-specific AII amacrine cell. In contrast to the AII cell, however, the electrical synapses of A8 cells are poorly understood. Therefore, we made use of the Ier5-GFP mouse line, in which A8 cells are labeled by GFP, to study the gap junction composition and frequency in A8 cells. We found that A8 cells form less than 20 gap junctions per cell and these gap junctions consist of connexin36. Connexin36 is present at both OFF and ON dendrites of A8 cells, preferentially connecting A8 cells to type 1 OFF and type 6 and 7 ON bipolar cells and presumably other amacrine cells. Additionally, we show that the OFF dendrites of A8 cells co-stratify with the processes of dopaminergic amacrine cells from which they may receive GABAergic input via GABA-A receptor subunit α3. As we found A8 cells to express dopamine receptor D1 (but not D2), we also tested whether A8 cell coupling is modulated by D1 receptor agonists and antagonists as was shown for the coupling of AII cells. However, this was not the case. In summary, our data suggests that A8 coupling is differently regulated than AII cells and may even be independent of ambient light levels and serve signal facilitation rather than providing a separate neuronal pathway.</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Proliferation and migration during adult neurogenesis are regulated by a microenvironment of signaling molecules originating from local vasculature, from cerebrospinal fluid produced by the choroid plexus, and from local supporting cells including astrocytes. Here, we focus on the function of OTX2 homeoprotein transcription factor in the mouse adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) which generates olfactory bulb neurons. We find that OTX2 secreted by choroid plexus is transferred to supporting cells of the V-SVZ and rostral migratory stream. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Otx2&lt;/i&gt; in choroid plexus affects neuroblast migration and reduces the number of olfactory bulb newborn neurons. Adult neurogenesis was also decreased by expressing secreted single-chain antibodies to sequester OTX2 in the cerebrospinal fluid, demonstrating the importance of non-cell autonomous OTX2. We show that OTX2 activity modifies extracellular matrix components and signaling molecules produced by supporting astrocytes. Thus, we reveal a multi-level and non-cell autonomous role of a homeoprotein and reinforce the choroid plexus and astrocytes as key niche compartments affecting adult neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cerebrospinal fluid, local vasculature and non-neurogenic astrocytes are niche compartments that provide a microenvironment for regulating adult mouse neurogenesis. We show that OTX2 homeoprotein secreted by choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid is transferred into non-neurogenic astrocytes of the ventricular-subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream where it regulates extracellular matrix and signaling factors. This non-cell-autonomous activity impacts the number of newborn neurons that integrate the olfactory bulb. Thus, we reveal a multi-level role for OTX2 and reinforce the choroid plexus as a key niche compartment affecting adult neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Flow diverters are new generation stents that have recently garnered a large amount of interest for use in treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Flow diverters reduce blood flow into the aneurysm, with redirection along the path of the parent vessel. Flow stagnation into the aneurysm and neck coverage with subsequent endothelialization are the important synergistic mechanisms by which the therapy acts. Several studies have examined the mechanisms by which flow diverters subsequently lead to aneurysm occlusion. This review aims to provide a general overview of the flow diverters and their mechanism of action and potential implications. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate identification of the ischemic penumbra, the therapeutic target in acute clinical stroke, is of critical importance to identify patients who might benefit from reperfusion therapies beyond the established time windows. Therefore, we aimed to validate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mismatch–based penumbra detection against full quantitative positron emission tomography (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET), the gold standard for penumbra detection in acute ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten patients (group A) with acute and subacute ischemic stroke underwent perfusion‐weighted (PW)/diffusion‐weighted MRI and consecutive full quantitative &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET within 48 hours of stroke onset. Penumbra as defined by &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction, and oxygen metabolism was used to validate a wide range of established PW measures (eg, time‐to‐maximum [Tmax]) to optimize penumbral tissue detection. Validation was carried out using a voxel‐based receiver‐operating‐characteristic curve analysis. The same validation based on penumbra as defined by quantitative &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET CBF was performed for comparative reasons in 23 patients measured within 48 hours of stroke onset (group B).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PW map Tmax (area‐under‐the‐curve = 0.88) performed best in detecting penumbral tissue up to 48 hours after stroke onset. The optimal threshold to discriminate penumbra from oligemia was Tmax &amp;gt;5.6 seconds with a sensitivity and specificity of &amp;gt;80%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of the best PW measure Tmax to detect the upper penumbral flow threshold in ischemic stroke is excellent. Tmax &amp;gt;5.6 seconds–based penumbra detection is reliable to guide treatment decisions up to 48 hours after stroke onset and might help to expand reperfusion treatment beyond the current time windows.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease is most commonly caused by duplication of a chromosomal segment surrounding &lt;i&gt;Peripheral Myelin Protein 22&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; gene, which is classified as CMT1A. Several candidate therapies reduce &lt;i&gt;Pmp22&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels in CMT1A rodent models, but development of biomarkers for clinical trials in CMT1A is a challenge given its slow progression and difficulty in obtaining nerve samples. Quantitative PCR measurements of &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in dermal nerves were performed using skin biopsies in human clinical trials for CMT1A, but this approach did not show increased &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in CMT1A patients compared to controls. One complicating factor is the variable amounts of Schwann cells (SCs) in skin. The objective of the study was to develop a novel method for precise evaluation of &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; levels in skin biopsies that can discriminate CMT1A patients from controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed methods to normalize &lt;i&gt;PMP22&lt;/i&gt; transcript levels to SC‐specific genes that are not altered by CMT1A status. Several CMT1A‐associated genes were assembled into a custom Nanostring panel to enable precise transcript measurements that can be normalized to variable SC content.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital expression data from Nanostring analysis showed reproducible elevation of PMP22 levels in CMT1A versus control skin biopsies, particularly after normalization to SC‐specific genes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This platform should be useful in clinical trials for CMT1A as a biomarker of target engagement that can be used to optimize dosing, and the same normalization framework is applicable to other types of CMT. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Knowledge about the collective dynamics of cortical spiking is very informative about the underlying coding principles. However, even most basic properties are not known with certainty, because their assessment is hampered by spatial subsampling, i.e., the limitation that only a tiny fraction of all neurons can be recorded simultaneously with millisecond precision. Building on a novel, subsampling-invariant estimator, we fit and carefully validate a minimal model for cortical spike propagation. The model interpolates between two prominent states: asynchronous and critical. We find neither of them in cortical spike recordings across various species, but instead identify a narrow “reverberating” regime. This approach enables us to predict yet unknown properties from very short recordings and for every circuit individually, including responses to minimal perturbations, intrinsic network timescales, and the strength of external input compared to recurrent activation “thereby informing about the underlying coding principles for each circuit, area, state and task.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

However, the relationship between epigenetic regulation and neuropathology is largely correlational due to the presence of mixed cell populations within brain regions and the genome-wide effects of classical approaches to manipulate the epigenome. Locus-specific epigenetic editing allows direct epigenetic regulation of specific genes to elucidate the direct causal relationship between epigenetic modifications and transcription. This review discusses some of the latest innovations in the efficacy and flexibility in this approach that hold promise for neurobiological application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

During neuronal differentiation, spatially and temporally regulated transcription allows neuronal migration, the growth of dendrites and axons, and at later stages, synaptic formation and the establishment of neuronal circuitry. Genome topology and relocation of gene loci within the nucleus are now regarded as key factors that contribute to transcriptional regulation. Here, we review recent work supporting the hypothesis that the dynamic organization of chromatin within the nucleus impacts gene activation in response to extrinsic signalling and during neuronal differentiation. The consequences of disruption of the genome architecture on neuronal health will be also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 The group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor subtypes, mGlu1 and mGlu5, strongly regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Both harbour PDZ (PSD-95/discs-large/ ZO-1) motifs at their extreme carboxyl terminals, which allow interaction with the PDZ domain of Tamalin, regulate the cell surface expression of group I mGlu receptors, and may modulate their coupling to signalling proteins. We investigated the functional role of this interaction in hippocampal long-term depression (LTD). Acute intracerebral treatment of adult rats with a cell permeable PDZ-blocking peptide (pep-mGluR-STL), designed to competitively inhibit the interaction between Tamalin and group 1 mGlu receptors, prevented expression of LTD in the hippocampal CA1 region without affecting long-term potentiation or basal synaptic transmission. Pep-mGluR-STL prevented facilitation by the group I mGlu receptor agonist, DHPG, and the mGlu5 agonist, CHPG, of short-term depression into LTD, suggesting that Tamalin preferentially acts by mediating signalling through mGlu5. These data support that Tamalin is essential for the persistent expression of LTD and that Tamalin subserves the effective signalling of group 1 mGlu receptors.</content>

 The hippocampus controls fundamental learning and memory processes, including memory for visuospatial navigation (spatial memory) and flexible memory for facts and autobiographical events (declarative memory). Emerging evidence reveals that hippocampal-dependent memory function is regulated by various peripheral biological systems that are traditionally known for their roles in appetite and body weight regulation. Here we argue that these effects are consistent with a framework that it is evolutionarily advantageous to encode and recall critical features surrounding feeding behavior, including the spatial location of a food source, social factors, post-absorptive processing, and other episodic elements of a meal. We review evidence that gut-to-brain communication from the vagus nerve and from feeding-relevant endocrine systems, including ghrelin, insulin, leptin, and glucagon-like peptide-1, promote hippocampal-dependent spatial and declarative memory via neurotrophic and neurogenic mechanisms. The collective literature reviewed herein supports a model in which various stages of feeding behavior and hippocampal-dependent memory function are closely linked.</content>

 Aim: Chronic pain associated with knee osteoarthritis may develop in connection with a maladaptive process of pain sensitization in the central nervous system. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed to treat various pain syndromes related to central sensitization phenomenon, but was never applied in the context of knee osteoarthritis. Methods: A 71-year-old woman presenting clinical evidence of central sensitization of pain associated with left knee osteoarthritis underwent monthly sessions of rTMS delivered at 10 Hz over the right motor cortex.  Results: From the week following the 3rd session, she began to improve on various clinical aspects, including pain. After 10 sessions (i.e. almost one year of follow-up), pain was reduced by 67%, especially regarding neuropathic components, while sleep disorders and fatigue also improved by 57-67%. The Central Sensitization Inventory score was reduced by 70% Conclusion: This observation suggests that high-frequency motor cortex rTMS could be a therapeutic option to treat neuropathic pain and psychological symptoms associated with central sensitization developing in the context of chronic osteoarthritis of the knee joint.</content>

 Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Although the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease is not entirely clear, the aberrant aggregation of α-synuclein has long been considered as an important risk factor. Elucidating the mechanisms that influence the aggregation of α-synuclein is essential for developing effective diagnostic, preventative and therapeutic strategy to treat this devastating disease. The aggregation of α-synuclein is influenced by several post-translational modifications. Here, we summarized the major post-translational modifications (Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, Truncation, Nitration, O-GlcNAcylation) of α-synuclein and the effect of these modifications on α-synuclein aggregation, which may provide potential targets for future therapeutics.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Implantable neuroprostheses such as cochlear implants, deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, and retinal implants use charge-balanced alternating current (AC) pulses to recover delivered charge and thus mitigate toxicity from electrochemical reactions occurring at the metal-tissue interface. At low pulse rates, these short duration pulses have the effect of evoking spikes in neural tissue in a phase-locked fashion.  When the therapeutic goal is to suppress neural activity, implants typically work indirectly by delivering excitation to populations of neurons that then inhibit the target neurons, or by delivering very high pulse rates that suffer from a number of undesirable side effects.   Direct current (DC) neural modulation is an alternative methodology that can directly modulate extracellular membrane potential.  This neuromodulation paradigm can excite or inhibit neurons in a graded fashion while maintaining their stochastic firing patterns. DC can also sensitize or desensitize neurons to input.  When applied to a population of neurons, DC can modulate synaptic connectivity. Because DC delivered to metal electrodes inherently violates safe charge injection criteria, its use has not been explored for practical applicability of DC-based neural implants.  Recently, several new technologies and strategies have been proposed that address this safety criteria and deliver ionic-based direct current (iDC).  This, along with the increased understanding of the mechanisms behind the transcutaneous DC-based modulation of neural targets, has caused a resurgence of interest in the interaction between iDC and neural tissue both in the central and the peripheral nervous system. In this review we assess the feasibility of in-vivo iDC delivery as a form of neural modulation. We present the current understanding of DC/neural interaction. We explore the different design methodologies and technologies that attempt to safely deliver iDC to neural tissue and assess the scope of application for direct current modulation as a form of neuroprosthetic treatment in disease.  Finally, we examine the safety implications of long duration iDC delivery.   We conclude that DC-based neural implants are a promising new modulation technology that could benefit from further chronic safety assessments and a better understanding of the basic biological and biophysical mechanisms that underpin DC-mediated neural modulation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The amygdala is a structure involved in emotions, fear, learning and memory and is highly interconnected with other brain regions, for example the motor cortex and the basal ganglia that are often targets of treatments involving electrical stimulation. Deep brain stimulation of the basal ganglia is successfully used to treat movement disorders, but can carry along non-motor side effects. The origin of these non-motor side effects is not fully understood yet, but might be altered oscillatory communication between specific motor areas and the amygdala. Oscillations in various frequency bands have been detected in the amygdala during cognitive and emotional tasks, which can couple with oscillations in cortical regions or the hippocampus. However, data on oscillatory coupling between the amygdala and motor areas are still lacking. This review provides a summary of oscillation frequencies measured in the amygdala and their possible functional relevance in different species, followed by evidence for connectivity between the amygdala and motor areas, such as the basal ganglia and the motor cortex. We hypothesize that the amygdala could communicate with motor areas through coherence of low frequency bands in the theta-alpha range. Furthermore, we discuss a potential role of the amygdala in therapeutic approaches based on electrical stimulation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Intercellular communication within complex biological and pathological systems via extracellular vesicles (EV) and secreted factors is a highly attractive area of research. However, cell models enabling investigation of such communication in vitro are limited. Commonly utilized is the supplementation of super physiologically concentrated EVs or other extracellular factors to the recipient cell cultures. This approach requires purification of the secreted complexes and is confounded by the contamination of media components. Two-chamber co-cultures of donor and recipient cells separated by a pore membrane may represent a more physiological and better-controlled system for the investigation of intercellular communication. Yet, distinct culture conditions for different neural cell types often make them incompatible for co-culturing. Here we optimized short-term co-cultures of patient-derived low-passage glioma-initiating stem cells with normal cells of the brain microenvironment, such as primary neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and brain endothelial cells. We demonstrate the culture compatibility of these cell types and internalization of glioma-derived extracellular RNA by the normal recipient cells. The presented protocols are valuable for the investigation of intercellular communication between glioma brain tumor and cells of its microenvironment, including but not limited to the EVs-mediated communication.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Fine morphological reconstructions of individual neurons across the entire brain are needed for mapping the brain circuits. Inference of presynaptic axonal boutons, as a key part of single-neuron fine reconstructions, is critical for interpreting the patterns of neural circuit wiring schemes. However, automated bouton identification remains challenging for current neuron reconstruction tools, as they are being focused mainly on neurite skeleton drawing and have difficulties to accurately quantify bouton morphology. Here, we developed an automatic method for recognizing single-neuron axonal boutons in whole-brain fluorescence microscopy datasets. The method is based on deep convolutional neural networks and density-peak clustering. High-dimensional feature representations of bouton morphology can be learned adaptively through the convolutional networks and used for the bouton recognition and bouton subtype classification. We demonstrated that the approach is effective in detecting single-neuron boutons at the brain-wide scale for both long-range projection pyramidal neurons and local interneurons.</content>

 The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of motor training on motor imagery, by comparing motor performance and motor cortex excitability changes with and without intermanual transfer of motor learning. Intermanual transfer was investigated in terms of excitability changes in the motor cortex and motor performance from right hand training to left hand performance. Participants were assigned to a transfer training group and a control group. We recorded motor evoked potentials induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation, applied to the left extensor carpi radialis both with and without intermanual transfer. The results showed that after learning by the right hand, motor evoked potentials decreased during left hand motor imagery. Motor evoked potentials during motor imagery were significantly decreased by unilateral training in the transfer training group. Since intermanual transfer plays an important role in stabilizing performance by the contralateral side, this result suggests that unilateral training decreases motor evoked potentials during motor imagery on the contralateral side. In the control group, without right hand training, motor evoked potentials significantly increased after left hand training during motor imagery. In the trained side, we found increased excitability in the agonist muscle area of the primary motor cortex. However, in the untrained side, excitability decreased in the homonymous muscle area of the primary motor cortex. This constitutes an increase in inhibitory effects and suggests that excitability changes in the respective neural circuit contribute to skilled performance by the ipsilateral and contralateral sides in the same motor task.</content>

 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique which provides unique potential to directly improve human capability on a temporary, at needs, basis. The purpose of this paper is to consider the utility of tDCS through analysis of the potential risks and benefits in the context of defence service personnel. First, we look at the potential benefits to Defence, focusing primarily on warfighter survivability and enriching cognition quality in support of command and control. Second, we look at the potential detriments to tDCS military use, focusing on adverse effects, safety considerations, and risk. Third, we examine how the level of risk can be mitigated through military doctrine development focusing on safety parameters and exclusion criteria. Finally, we explore the future prospects of military tDCS use, particularly in terms of addressing gaps in the literature so that tDCS can be used ethically and efficaciously at the level of individual personnel.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Both abnormities of resting-state cerebral blood flow (CBF) and functional connectivity in Wilson’s disease (WD) have been identified by several studies. Whether the coupling of CBF and functional connectivity is imbalanced in WD remains largely unknown. To assess this possibility, 27 patients with WD and 27 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were recruited to acquire functional MRI and arterial spin labeling imaging data. Functional connectivity strength (FCS) and CBF were calculated based on standard gray mask. Compared to healthy controls, the CBF-FCS correlations of patients with WD were significantly decreased in basal ganglia and cerebellum, and slightly increased in prefrontal cortex and thalamus. In contrast, decreased CBF of patients with WD occurred predominately in subcortical, and cognitive- and emotional-related brain regions, including basal ganglia, thalamus, insular, and inferior prefrontal cortex, whereas increased CBF occurred primarily in the temporal cortex. The FCS decrease of WD patients was predominately in basal ganglia and thalamus, and the increase was primarily in prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that aberrant neurovascular coupling in the brain may be a possible neuropathological mechanism underlying WD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease that is characterized by high morbidity and high mortality. ICH has an annual incidence of 10–30/100 000 people and accounts for approximately 10% to 30% of all types of stroke. ICH mostly occurs at the basal ganglia, which is rich in nerve fibres; thus, hemiplegia is quite common in ICH patients with partial sensory disturbance and ectopic blindness. In the clinic, those symptoms are considered to originate from the white matter injury in the area, but the exact mechanisms are unknown, and currently, no effective drug treatments are available to improve the prognosis. Clarifying the mechanisms will contribute to the development of new treatment methods for patients. The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel is a non-selective cation channel that play a role in inflammatory pain sensation and nociception, and may be a potential regulator in emotion, cognition and social behaviour. Here, we report that TRPA1 is involved in myelin damage and oxidative stress injury in a mouse ICH model. Intervention with the TRPA1 channel may be a new method to improve the motor function of patients in the early stage of ICH.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Group-level repeated measurements are common in neuroimaging, yet their analysis remains complex. Although a variety of specialised tools now exist, it is surprising that to-date there has been no clear discussion of how repeated-measurements can be analysed appropriately using the standard general linear model approach, as implemented in software such as SPM and FSL. This is particularly surprising given that these implementations necessitate the use of multiple models, even for seemingly conventional analyses, and that without care it is very easy to specify contrasts that do not correctly test the effects of interest. Despite this, interest in fitting these types of models using conventional tools has been growing in the neuroimaging community. As such it has become even more important to elucidate the correct means of doing so. To begin, this paper will discuss the key concept of the expected mean squares (EMS) for defining suitable F-ratios for testing hypotheses. Once this is understood, the logic of specifying correct repeated measurements models in the GLM should be clear. The ancillary issue of specifying suitable contrast weights in these designs will also be discussed, providing a complimentary perspective on the EMS. A set of steps will then be given alongside an example of specifying a 3-way repeated-measures ANOVA in SPM. Equivalency of the results compared to other statistical software will be demonstrated. Additional issues, such as the inclusion of continuous covariates and the assumption of sphericity, will also be discussed. The hope is that this paper will provide some clarity on this confusing topic, giving researchers the confidence to correctly specify these forms of models within traditional neuroimaging analysis tools.</content>

 This work presents a pieces of Python code to rapidly simulate the spiking responses of large numbers of single cutaneous tactile afferents with millisecond precision. To simulate the spike responses of all the major types of cutaneous tactile afferents, we proposed an electromechanical circuit model, in which a two-channel filter was developed to characterize the mechanical selectivity of tactile receptors, and a spike synthesizer was designed to recreate the action potentials evoked in afferents. The parameters of this model were fitted using previous neurophysiological datasets. Several simulation examples were presented in this paper to reproduce action potentials, sensory adaptation, frequency characteristics and spiking timing for each afferent type. The results indicated that the simulated responses matched previous neurophysiological recordings well. The model allows for a real-time reproduction of the spiking responses of about 4000 tactile units with a timing precision of less than 6 ms. The current work provides a valuable guidance to designing highly realistic tactile interfaces such as neuroprosthesis and haptic devices.</content>

 This study examines whether a decrease in brain development is observable after players have reduced their video gaming time over a period of one year. Both video gaming experts and non-experts were recruited, whose resting-state fMRI data were collected at the beginning and the end of the study. Immediately after the first scan, the participants were instructed to spend no smore than three hours on video gaming weekly for one year. The results showed decreased self-reported video gaming skills and decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in the experts at the end of the study, demonstrating that a reduction in video gaming time over a period of one year produced a decrease in brain development. The non-experts served as a control group and had no significant changes. The findings support the adaptive effect of video gaming experience on brain and cognitive development.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Behavioral and imaging studies in alphabetic languages have shown that morphological processing is a discrete and independent element of lexical access. However, there is no explicit marking of morphological structure in Chinese complex words, such that the extent to which morpheme meaning is related to word meaning is unknown. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used in the present study to investigate the dissociation of morphemic and whole-word meaning in an auditory-auditory primed lexical decision task. All the priming and target words are compounds consisting of two Chinese morphemes. The relationship between morpheme and whole-word meaning was manipulated while controlling the phonology and orthography of the first syllable in each prime-target pair. A clear dissociation was found between morphemic and whole-word meaning on N400 amplitude and topography. Specifically, sharing a morpheme produced a larger N400 in the anterior-central electrode sites, while sharing whole-word meaning produced a smaller N400 in central-posterior electrode sites. In addition, the morphological N400 effect was negatively correlated with the participants’ reading ability, with better readers needing less orthographic information to distinguish different morphemes in compound words. These findings indicate that morphological and whole-word meaning are dissociated in spoken Chinese compound word recognition, and that even in the spoken language modality, good readers are better able to access the meaning of individual morphemes in Chinese compound word processing.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective: P300-speller is the most commonly used brain-computer interface for providing a means of communication to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the performance of the P300-speller brain-computer interface is still inadequate. We investigated whether the performance of P300-speller can be further improved by increasing the mental effort required of the user. Methods: We designed two active mental tasks for a P300-speller based on a differently colored smiling cartoon-face paradigm. The tasks were based on color distinction, and their difficulty was modulated. One of the active mental tasks (DC task) required participants to focus on and distinguish the color of a target, while the other task (CN+DC task) required participants to simultaneously count the number of times a target flashed and distinguish its color.  Results: The amplitudes of the event-related potentials in both DC and CN+DC tasks were higher than that in the CN task. The significant difference in the amplitudes between the DC and CN tasks was observed around the parietal-central area from 440 ms to 800 ms (late positive component), and that between the CN+DC and CN tasks was observed around the left-frontal and right-frontal areas from 320 ms to 480 ms (P3a) and the parietal-central area from 480 ms to 800 ms (P3b and late positive component). The latency of the P300 potential in the CN+DC task was significantly longer than that in the CN task at F3, Fz, F4, C4, Pz, and P4 (P&amp;lt;0.05). Offline (P&amp;lt;0.05 at superposing once, twice, and thrice) and online (P&amp;lt;0.001) classification results showed that the average accuracies in the CN+DC task were significantly greater than that in the CN task. Similar results were found for online information transfer rates (P&amp;lt;0.001). In addition, we found that the average online accuracies in the DC task were greater than those in the CN task, although the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.051). Significance: The active mental task based on task difficulty modulation can significantly improve the performance of the P300-speller, and that based on color distinction shows a trend of improved performance.</content>

 EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) show promise for providing an alternative communication channel between the brain and an external device. It is well acknowledged that BCI control is a skill and could be improved through practice and training. In this study, we explored the change of BCI behavioral performance as well as the electrophysiological properties across three training sessions in a pool of 42 human subjects. Our results show that the group average of BCI accuracy and the information transfer rate improved significantly in the third session compared to the first session; especially the significance was reached in a smaller subset of low BCI performance group (average accuracy&amp;lt;70%) as well. There was a significant difference of event-related desynchronization (ERD) lateralization for BCI control between the left and right-hand imagination task in the last two sessions, but this significant difference was not shown for the first training sessions. No significant change of R-square value or event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) for either channel C3 or channel C4, which were used for online control, was found across the training sessions. The change of ERD lateralization was neither significant across the training sessions. The present results indicate that BCI training could induce the change of behavioral performance and electrophysiological properties quickly, in just a few hours’ training distributed into three sessions. Multiple training sessions might be especially beneficial for the low BCI performers.</content>

 Postural instability in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by impaired postural responses to transient perturbations, increased postural sway in stance and difficulty transitioning between tasks.  In addition, some studies suggest that loss of dopamine in the basal ganglia due to PD results in difficulty using proprioceptive information for motor control.  Here, we quantify the ability of subjects with PD and age-matched control subjects to use and re-weight sensory information for postural control during steady-state conditions of continuous rotations of the stance surface or visual surround.  We measure the postural sway of subjects in response to a pseudorandom, surface-tilt stimulus with eyes closed, and in response to a pseudorandom, visual-tilt stimulus.  We use a feedback control model of the postural control system to interpret our results, focusing on sensory weighting as a function of stimulus amplitude.  We find that subjects with PD can re-weight their dependence upon sensory information in response to changes in surface- or visual-stimulus amplitude.  Specifically, subjects with PD behaved like age-matched control subjects by decreasing proprioceptive contribution to stance control with increasing surface-tilt amplitude, and decreasing visual contribution with increasing visual-tilt amplitude.  However, subjects with PD do not decrease their reliance on proprioception as much as age-matched controls for small increases in surface-stimulus amplitudes.  Levodopa medication did not affect sensory re-weighting behaviors for postural control.  The impairment in PD subject’s ability to respond differently to small changes in surface rotation amplitudes is consistent with an increased threshold for perceiving proprioceptive signals, which may result from decreased signal-to-noise in the dopaminergic pathways associated with sensory processing and/or sensory integration.</content>

 In an auditory environment, humans are frequently exposed to overlapping sound sequences such as those made by human voices and musical instruments, and we can acquire information embedded in these sequences via attentional and nonattentional accesses. Whether the knowledge acquired by attentional accesses interacts with that acquired by nonattentional accesses is unknown, however. The present study examined how the statistical learning of two overlapping sound sequences is reflected in neurophysiological and behavioural responses, and how the learning effects are modulated by attention to each sequence. Statistical learning in this experimental paradigm was reflected in a neuromagnetic response predominantly in the right hemisphere, and the learning effects were not retained when attention to the tone streams was switched during the learning session. These results suggest that attentional and nonattentional learning scarcely interact with each other, and that there may be a specific system for nonattentional learning, which is independent of attentional learning.</content>

 Long-range neuronal circuits play an important role in motor and sensory information processing. Determining direct synaptic inputs of excited and inhibited neurons is important for understanding circuit mechanisms involved in regulating movement. Here, we used monosynaptic rabies tracing technique combined with fluorescent micro-optical sectional tomography to characterize the brain-wide input to motor cortex. The whole brain dataset showed that main excited and inhibited neurons in the motor cortex receive inputs from similar brain regions with quantitative difference. With 3D reconstruction, we found that the distribution of input neurons that target the primary and secondary motor cortex had different patterns. In cortex, the neurons projecting to primary motor cortex mainly distributed in the lateral and anterior portion, while those to secondary motor cortex distributed in the medial and posterior portion. The input neurons in subcortical areas also showed the topographic shift model, as in thalamus the neurons distributed as outer and inner shells and the neurons in claustrum and amygdala were in ventral and dorsal part respectively. These results lay the anatomical foundation for understanding the organized pattern of motor circuits and the functional differences between primary and secondary motor cortex.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Vascular dementia (VD) is a common type of disease in the elderly. Numerous clinical trials have suggested that hyperbaric oxygen was effective and safe complementary therapies for aging-related disorders. However, there is no systematic evidence regarding HBOT for the treatment of VD. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to value the clinical efficacy and safety of HBOT in treating VD. Methods: We methodically retrieved the clinical studies from eight databases (PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, Sino-Med, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WanFang) from their inception to November 2018. RevMan 5.3.5 was used for quality assessment and data analysis. Stata 15.1 was employed for publication bias detection.  Results: Twenty-five randomized clinical trials involving 1954 patients met our inclusion criteria. These articles researched the HBOT + Oxiracetam + CT versus Oxiracetam + CT(n=13), HBOT + Butylphthalide +CT versus Butylphthalide + CT(n=5), HBOT + Donepezil + CT versus Donepezil + CT(n=4), HBOT + Nicergoline + CT versus Nicergoline + CT (n=2) and HBOT + CT versus CT(n=1). The results indicated that additional HBOT strikingly improved the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (MD = 4.00; 95% CI=3.28-4.73; P＜0.00001), the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (MD = -5.91; 95% CI=-6.45, -5.36; P＜0.00001), BADL (MD = 13.86; 95% CI=5.63- 22.10; P=0.001), and increased the total efficacy rate (OR =4.84, 95% CI= 3.19-7.33, P&amp;lt; 0.00001), and the adverse events rates were not statistically significant between the two groups (OR =0.85, 95% CI= 0.26-2.78, P= 0.79). Conclusion: In view of the effectiveness and safety of HBOT, the present meta-analysis suggested that HBOT can be recommended as an effective complementary therapy for the treatment of VD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Purpose: To analyze the relationship between blood pressure (BP) variables, including circadian pattern, and cognition in 90+ year-olds. Methods: 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was completed on 121 participants drawn from a longitudinal study of aging and dementia in the oldest-old. Various measures of BP and its variability, including nocturnal dipping, were calculated. Each person was given both a neuropsychological test battery covering different cognitive domains and a neurological examination to determine cognitive status. Seventy-one participants had a brain MRI scan. Results: Participants ranged in age from 90 to 102 years (mean=93), about two-thirds were female, and nearly 80% had at least some college education. Mean nocturnal dips differed significantly between cognitively normal (n=97) and impaired individuals (n=24), with cognitively normal participants having on average greater nocturnal dips (6.6% vs 1.3%, p=0.006 for SBP; 11% vs 4.4%, p=0.002 for DBP). Nocturnal dips were also related to performance on select cognitive test scores (especially those related to language, recent memory and visual-spatial ability), with individuals who performed below previously established median norms having significantly smaller nocturnal dips (both SBP and DBP) than those above the median.  DBP reverse dippers had larger mean white matter hyperintensisites (WMH as percent of total brain volume) (1.7% vs 1.2%, 1.1% and 1.0% in extreme dippers, dippers, non-dippers) and a greater proportion had lobar cerebral microbleeds (CMB) (44% vs 0%, 7%, 16%, p&amp;lt;0.05). Impaired participants had higher mean WMH than those with normal cognition (1.6% vs 1.0% p=0.03) and more tended to have CMB (31% vs 20%, p=n.s.).  Conclusion: These findings suggest that cognitive dysfunction is associated with dysregulation in the normal circadian BP pattern. Further study of the potential role of WMH and CMB as mediators of this association is warranted.</content>

 In a recent study, Masuda and colleagues (Nature 2019;566:388–392) used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile microglia across different anatomical compartments, developmental stages, and types of brain pathology in mice. Moreover, the authors performed a novel transcriptomic characterization of microglia from multiple sclerosis patients and identified phenotypically conserved microglial subsets between species. These findings, together with seminal prior results from various groups, provide valuable insights into the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of microglia during brain development and disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) is a non-invasive method used to stimulate the vestibular system. The vestibular system includes the sensors, neural pathways, vestibular nuclei and the cortical areas receiving integrated vestibular inputs. In addition to its role in postural control or gaze stabilization, the vestibular system is involved in some cognitive functions and in emotion processing.  Several studies have revealed a modulating effect of vestibular stimulation on mood state, emotional control, and anxiety level. Nevertheless, GVS is known to induce motion sickness symptoms such as nausea. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a GVS protocol to be used potentially as a treatment for anxiety, and also to test the impact of stimulation parameters (duration) on anxiety. Twenty-two students underwent three stimulation conditions: 1) a sham session (no stimulation), 2) a single-duration session (38 min of GVS), and 3) a double-duration session (76 min of GVS). Before and after each stimulation, participants completed a Graybiel Scale form for motion sickness symptoms evaluation, and a visual analog scale form for anxiety. We observed a significant diminution of anxiety level after a 38-min session of GVS, while a low level of motion sickness was only found following a 76-min session of GVS. Our preliminary study confirms the feasibility of using GVS to modulate anxiety and corroborates the involvement of the vestibular system in the emotional process.</content>

 Presynaptic Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) is a key step in synaptic transmission that links action potential-derived depolarization to vesicle release. However, investigation of presynaptic Ca2+ influx by patch clamp recordings is difficult due to the small size of the majority of synaptic boutons along thin axons that hamper clamp control. Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECI) in combination with live cell imaging provide an alternative method to study Ca2+ transients in individual presynaptic terminals. The indicator GCaMP6f was developed for fast speed and high sensitivity in detecting Ca2+ transients even in subcellular compartments. We conjugated GCaMP6f to synaptophysin (synGCaMP6f) to enrich the calcium indicator in presynaptic boutons of transfected primary hippocampal neurons to study presynaptic Ca2+ changes in response to individual action potentials (AP) or short bursts. Changes in fluorescence intensity were evaluated by normalization to control level or, alternatively, by normalization to maximal fluorescence using the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Measurements revealed robust Ca2+ transients with amplitudes that depend on parameters like the number of APs, stimulation frequency or external calcium concentration. Our findings indicate an appropriate sensitivity of synGCaMP6f for studying total presynaptic Ca2+ transients induced by single APs or short bursts that showed little rundown of the response after repeated bursts. Moreover, these recordings are fast enough to even study short-term plasticity like paired pulse facilitation and frequency dependence of Ca2+ transients. In addition, synGCaMP6f could be used to dissect the contribution of different subtypes of VGCCs to presynaptic Ca2+ influx. Our results demonstrate that synGCaMP6f allows the reliable analysis of changes in presynaptic calcium concentration at many individual synaptic boutons in parallel and provides the possibility to study the regulation of this important step in synaptic transmission.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00360"/>

		<content type="html">
 The dopaminergic and histaminergic systems are the first to appear during the development of the nervous system. Through the activation of H1 receptors (H1Rs), histamine increases neurogenesis of the cortical deep layers, while reducing the dopaminergic phenotype (cells immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase, TH+) in embryo ventral mesencephalon. Although the function of histamine in neuronal differentiation has been studied, the role of H1Rs in neurogenesis has not been addressed. For this purpose, the H1R antagonist/inverse agonist chlorpheniramine was systemically administered (5 mg/kg, i.p.) to pregnant Wistar rats (gestational days 12-14, E12-14), and control and experimental embryos (E14 and E16) and pups (21-day-old) were evaluated for changes in nigro-striatal development. Western blot and immunohistochemistry determinations showed a significant increase in the dopaminergic markers’ TH and PITX3 in embryos from chlorpheniramine-treated rats at E16. Unexpectedly, 21-day-old pups from the chlorpheniramine-treated group, showed a significant reduction in TH immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta and dorsal striatum. Furthermore, striatal dopamine content, evoked [3H]-dopamine release and metha-amphetamine-stimulated motor activity were significantly lower compared to the control group. These results indicate that H1R blockade at E14-16 favors the differentiation of dopaminergic neurons, but hampers their migration, leading to a decrease in dopaminergic innervation of the striatum in post-natal life.</content>

 Prior methods in characterizing age-related white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesions on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance images (MRI) have mainly been limited to understanding the sizes of, and occasionally the locations of WMH lesions. Systematic morphological characterization has been missing. In this work, we proposed innovative methods to fill this knowledge gap. We developed an innovative and proof-of-concept method to characterize and quantify the shape (based on Zernike transformation) and texture (based on fuzzy logic) of WMH lesions. We have also developed a multi-dimension feature vector approach to cluster WMH lesions into distinctive groups based on their shape and then texture features. We then developed an approach to calculate the potential growth index (PGI) of WMH lesions based on the image intensity distributions at the edge of the WMH lesions using a region-growing algorithm. High-quality T2 FLAIR images containing clearly identifiable WMH lesions with various sizes from six cognitively normal older adults were used in our method development Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) showed significant differences in PGI among WMH group clusters in terms of either the shape (P = 1.06×10-2) or the texture (P &amp;lt; 1×10-20) features. In conclusion, we propose a systematic framework on which the shape and texture features of WMH lesions can be quantified and may be used to predict lesion growth in older adults.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Intracortical data recorded with multi-electrode arrays provide rich information about kinematic and kinetic states of movement in the brain-machine interface (BMI) systems. Direct estimation of kinetic information such as the force from cortical data has the same importance as kinematic information to make a functional BMI system. Various types of the information including single unit activity (SUA), multiunit activity (MUA) and local field potential (LFP) can be used as an input information to extract motor commands for control of the external devices in BMI. Here we combine LFP and MUA information to improve decoding accuracy of the force signal from the multi-channel intracortical data of freely moving rats. We suggest a weighted common average referencing (CAR) algorithm in order to valid interpretation of the force decoding from different data types. The proposed spatial filter adaptively identifies contribution of the common noise on the channels employing Kalman filter method. We evaluated the efficacy of the proposed artifact algorithm on both simulation and real data. In the simulation study, the average R2 between the original and reconstructed signal of all channels after applying the proposed artifact removal method was computed for input SNRs in the range of -45 to 0 dB. Weighted CAR method can effectively reconstruct the original signal with average R2 higher than 0.5 for input SNRs higher than -10 dB in case of adding simulated outlier and motion artifacts. We also show that the proposed artifact removal algorithm 33 percent improves the accuracy of force decoding in terms of R2 value compared to standard CAR filters.</content>

 Spinal cord injury（SCI) often leads to severe and permanent paralysis and places a heavy burden on individuals, families and society. Until now, the therapy of SCI is still a big challenge for the researchers. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a hot spot for the treatment of spinal cord injury, but many problems and risks have not been resolved. Some studies have reported that the therapeutic effect of MSCs on spinal cord injury is related to the paracrine secretion of cells. The exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells have therapeutic potential on many diseases. There are abundant pericytes which possess the characteristics of stem cell in the neurovascular unit. Due to the close relationship between pericytes and endothelial cells, the exosomes of pericytes can be uptake by endothelial cells more easily. There are fewer studies about the therapeutic potential of the exosomes derived from pericytes on spinal cord injury now. In this study, exosomes of pericytes were transplanted into the mice with SCI to study the restoration of motor function and explore the underlying mechanism. We found that the exosomes derived from pericytes could reduce pathological changes, improve the motor function, the blood flow and oxygen deficiency after SCI. In addition, the exosomes could improve the endothelial ability to regulate blood flow, protect the blood-spinal cord barrier, reduce edema, decrease the expression of HIF-1α, Bax, Aquaporin-4 and MMP2, increase the expression of Claudin-5, bcl-2 and inhibit apoptosis. The experiments in vitro proved that exosomes derived from pericytes could protect the barrier of spinal cord microvascular endothelial cells under hypoxia condition, which was related to PTEN/AKT pathway. In summary, our study showed that exosomes of pericytes had therapeutic prospects for spinal cord injury.</content>

 The recent enhanced sophistication of non-invasive mapping of human motor cortex using MRI-guided Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) techniques, has not been matched by refinement of methods for generating maps from motor evoked potential (MEP) data, or in quantifying map features. This is despite continued interest in understanding cortical reorganization for natural adaptive processes such as skill learning, or in the case of motor recovery, such as after lesion affecting the corticospinal system. With the observation that TMS-MEP map calculation and quantification methods vary, and that no readily available commercial or free software exists, we sought to establish and make freely available a comprehensive software package that advances existing methods, and could be helpful to scientists and clinician-researchers. Therefore, we developed NeuroMeasure, an open source interactive software application for the analysis of TMS motor cortex mapping data collected from Nexstim® and BrainSight®, two commonly used neuronavigation platforms. NeuroMeasure features four key innovations designed to improve motor mapping analysis: de-dimensionalization of the mapping data, fitting a predictive model, reporting measurements to characterize the motor map, and comparing those measurements between datasets. This software provides a powerful and easy to use workflow for characterizing and comparing motor maps generated with neuronavigated TMS. The software can be downloaded on our github page: https://github.com/EdwardsLabNeuroSci/NeuroMeasure.</content>

&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; In steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces, prolonged repeated flicker stimulation would reduce the system performance. To reduce the visual discomfort and fatigue, while ensuring recognition accuracy, and information transmission rate (ITR), a novel motion paradigm based on the steady-state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEPs) is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; The novel SSMVEP paradigm of the radial zoom motion was realized using the sinusoidal form to modulate the size of the stimuli. The radial zoom motion-based SSMVEP paradigm was compared with the flicker-based SSVEP paradigm and the SSMVEP paradigm based on Newton's ring motion. The canonical correlation analysis was used to identify the frequency of the eight targets, the recognition accuracy of different paradigms with different stimulation frequencies, and the ITR under different stimulation durations were calculated. The subjective comfort scores and fatigue scores, and decrease in the accuracy due to fatigue was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; The average recognition accuracy of the novel radial zoom motion-based SSMVEP paradigm was 93.4%, and its ITR reached 42.5 bit/min, which was greater than the average recognition accuracy of the SSMVEP paradigm based on Newton's ring motion. The comfort score of the novel paradigm was greater than both the flicker-based SSVEP paradigm and SSMVEP paradigm based on Newton's ring motion. The decrease in the recognition accuracy due to fatigue was less than that of the SSSMVEP paradigm based on Newton's ring motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; The SSMVEP paradigm based on radial zoom motion has high recognition accuracy and ITR with low visual discomfort and fatigue scores. The method has potential advantages in overcoming the performance decline caused by fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a id=&quot;h2&quot; name=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;The brain-computer interface (BCI) allows for direct communication between the brain and external devices. In particular, recent BCIs based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have high application value in neuro engineering and rehabilitation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B9&quot;&gt;Daly and Huggins, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). The paradigm design of the BCI is the key issues to the research and development of BCI systems. The commonly used reactive BCIs are realized though specific audio or visual tasks, inducing corresponding event-related potentials (ERPs) in the brain (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B5&quot;&gt;Celesia et al., 1996&lt;/a&gt;), which can be identified to determine the communication or control intention (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B14&quot;&gt;Muller and Hillyard, 2000&lt;/a&gt;). Visual stimuli can induce electrical responses in the occipital cortex, called visual evoked potentials (VEPs). A single visual stimulus can induce a transient visual evoked potential (TVEP), while repeated visual stimuli (RVS) at a certain frequency can be used to induce a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B25&quot;&gt;Zhu et al., 2010&lt;/a&gt;). The paradigm based on VEPs has been widely used as it is a natural response of the visual pathway without any training. The RVS in the SSVEP paradigm is designed using color alternation or graphic flicker at a certain frequency (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B5&quot;&gt;Celesia et al., 1996&lt;/a&gt;). Its periodic spectrum characteristics are not easily affected by eye blinks or other artifacts, and thus can be used to achieve high recognition accuracies and information transmission rates (ITR) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B8&quot;&gt;Cheng et al., 2002&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B21&quot;&gt;Vialatte et al., 2010&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B16&quot;&gt;Ng et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B19&quot;&gt;Sengelmann et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;However, as BCI is a human-computer interaction system, the comfort interface of the SSVEP paradigm is also important. During frequent use of the SSVEP interaction paradigm for a long time, the subject passively experiences repeated flicker stimulation, which reduces the performance due to visual fatigue and eye discomfort (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B17&quot;&gt;Punsawad and Wongsawat, 2012&lt;/a&gt;). In order to alleviate the visual discomfort caused by flicker-based SSVEP paradigm, Xie et al. proposed a BCI paradigm based on steady state motion visual evoked potentials (SSMVEP) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B23&quot;&gt;Xie et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;). Similar to the perception of light and contrast, the visual system is also sensitive to the perception of motion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B12&quot;&gt;Kremláek et al., 2004&lt;/a&gt;). Heinrich et al. demonstrated that SSMVEP can quickly record the brain's response to motion without obvious adaptation phenomena, which can significantly reduce visual fatigue (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B11&quot;&gt;Heinrich and Bach, 2003&lt;/a&gt;). Using periodic Newtonian ring motion as an SSMVEP paradigm (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B23&quot;&gt;Xie et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;), as the lower stimulation intensity may alleviate visual fatigue and discomfort, a control accuracy of 86% for a four target control system can be obtained. Compared with the flicker-based SSVEP paradigm (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B22&quot;&gt;Xie et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;), the results showed that although the SSMVEP-BCI has a lower accuracy than that of the SSVEP-BCI system, the amplitude decrease due to fatigue is more significant in SSVEP compared with SSMVEP. However, the comparison did not consider the shape of the stimuli and as previous studies have showed, stimuli with contours and sharp edges have a more sensitive visual response (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B18&quot;&gt;Regan, 2000&lt;/a&gt;), and the SSVEPs of circular and square stimulations are different (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B2&quot;&gt;Bieger and Molina, 2010&lt;/a&gt;). The different performances of circular-based SSMVEP and square-based SSVEP paradigms may be related to the shape of the stimulus pattern, and an SSMVEP based on various graphical shapes should be compared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;Moreover, the SSMVEP induced by different motor paradigm is related to the motion onset visual evoked potentials (mVEP) at the start time of the motion, which reflect the brain's processing mechanism of motion information (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B20&quot;&gt;Snowden and Freeman, 2004&lt;/a&gt;). Beveridge et al. demonstrated that the start time of horizontal or radial motions can induce mVEPs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B1&quot;&gt;Beveridge et al., 2016&lt;/a&gt;). Among these, the expansion and contraction motions are the typical radial motions that are experienced as the relative distance changes along the visual axis, and can produce the greatest response. Yan et al. proposed several SSMVEP paradigms based on a circular swing, a spiral, and rotation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B24&quot;&gt;Yan et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;), and showed that any stimulus with periodic motion can induce SSMVEP, while the recognition accuracy of the paradigm based on radial contraction-expansion was 80.7%. The low recognition accuracy of the SSMVEP based on radial motion may be related to the graphic itself, and whether these complex graphical motion paradigms are superior to the flicker-based paradigm for visual comfort. There are no studies on SSMVEPs based on simple graphical radial motion. Methods to reduce visual discomfort and fatigue, while ensuring recognition accuracy and ITR, are yet to be realized (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B6&quot;&gt;Chang et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb0&quot;&gt;In the present study, a paradigm that uses the sinusoidal form to modulate the block stimulus size to achieve periodic radial zoom motion is proposed. The performance of the novel SSMVEP stimulation paradigm based on simple graphical radial zoom motion was compared to the flicker-based SSVEP paradigm and the SSMVEP paradigm based on Newton's ring motion. Due to the difference caused by the shape, each kind of paradigm has two stimulation shapes; square and circular blocks. The recognition accuracies, subjective comfort scores, and decreases in the recognition accuracy due to fatigue were evaluated for all of the paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id=&quot;h3&quot; name=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;pt0&quot;&gt;Paradigm Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;The psych toolbox in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc.) was used to design the six stimulus paradigms (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B3&quot;&gt;Brainard, 1997&lt;/a&gt;), in which the motion modes were the square block flicker, square block radial zoom motion, square Newton's ring motion and circle block flicker, circle block radial zoom motion, and Newton's ring motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb0&quot;&gt;The flicker stimulus sequence was generated by modulating the luminance of the stimulus block (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B7&quot;&gt;Chen et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;), and the radial zoom motion was generated by modulating the size of the stimulus block. For the flicker, the dynamic range of the stimulation luminance was 0–1, where 0 and 1 represent darkness and the highest luminance, respectively. For the zoom motion, the dynamic range of the stimulation size was from 0 to 1, where 0 and 1 represent the minimum and maximum sizes, respectively. We define the stimulus frequency, &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;; screen refresh rate, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;; current frame number, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;; and stimulation signal, ∅ (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) was calculated as in equation (1):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;The square ring stimulus was generated using the modulation method of Newton's ring motion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B23&quot;&gt;Xie et al., 2012&lt;/a&gt;). The square ring stimulus is made up of a series of concentric black and white squares, and is given by equation (2):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;where λ is a constant equal to 0.05, and &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; is a 360 × 360 square matrix. The ring oscillation motion is formed by ∅(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;). When ∅(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) increases with &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, its phase shifts from 0 to π, and Newton's ring motion is achieved with a phase shift from π back to 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb0&quot;&gt;The stimuli reversal procedure in one stimulus period is shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#F1&quot;&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;, as for a 12 Hz motion reversal frequency there are ten frames per cycle. The first line shows the flicker-based SSVEP paradigm; the size of the block for each of the ten frames was the same, while the luminance changed with the sinusoidal function modulation. The second line shows the SSMVEP paradigm based on radial zoom motion; the block luminance in each of the ten frames was the same (a white block in a black background), while the side length changed corresponding to the sinusoidal function modulation. The third line shows the SSMVEP paradigm based on Newton's ring motion, with the square ring changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Experiment Protocol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;Four males and four females (22–27 years old) were recruited as subjects in this study. The participants were right-handed, healthy, and had normal color and visual perception. No subjects had previously participated in any SSVEP-based BCI experiments. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Beihang University Ethics Committee with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by Beihang University Ethics Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;The EEG signals were sampled at 1000 Hz using Neuroscan (USA). During the experiment, the electrode impedances were kept below 10 kΩ before data recording. EEGs were collected from the following eight channels: PO8, PO4, PO7, PO8, POz, O1, Oz, and O2. The experiment was performed in a quiet room, the stimulus paradigm were presented on a LCD screen (23.6 inch, 1,080 pixels) with a refresh rate of 60 Hz, and the subjects were positioned 70 cm from the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb0&quot;&gt;Each paradigm set was comprised of eight stimulus targets (with a flip frequency of 8–15Hz and frequency interval of 1 Hz). The size and location of the stimulus block are shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#F2&quot;&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;. The Experimental time sequence are shown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#F3&quot;&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;. Subjects were asked to stare at one target for 4 s per trial, with an interval of 1.5 s, and then stare at another stimuli. For each paradigm run, there were 40 trials with five trials for each target. Before the start of each trial, a red “+” symbol appeared randomly at the location of the stimulus target for a duration of 0.5 s, then the block of the corresponding position was presented for 4 s as a single trial. Each trial was isolated by a black screen and the interval time was fixed to 1 s. Each paradigm set was isolated by rest and the interval time was 10 min. After finishing each paradigm set, the subject was asked to fill out a comfort questionnaire to obtain their feelings on the stimulation. They each provided a score between 1 (not) and 7 (very) for each of the following four questions after gazing at each of the stimulation in turn (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B2&quot;&gt;Bieger and Molina, 2010&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. How much do you like this stimulation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. How much will this stimulation increase your tiredness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. How long could you look at this stimulation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. How annoying is this stimulation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Data Processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;Band-passed filter between 3 and 40 Hz was used to preprocess the collected EEG. The average time-domain waveform of the SSMVEP was obtained by averaging all of the data segments for each stimulation frequency. The Welch power spectrum was then calculated using the average waveform of the SSVEP or SSMVEP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb0&quot;&gt;To investigate the applicability of the proposed SSMVEP-based BCI, a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used for offline target detection (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B13&quot;&gt;Lin et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;). CCA is a non-parametric multivariable method to reveal the underlying correlation between two sets of multidimensional variables. In the study, EEG signals from eight occipital region channels; PO3, PO4, PO7, PO8, POz, O1, Oz, and O2, were calculated as one set of variables, presented at frequencies (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 Hz, respectively.

&lt;p class=&quot;mb0&quot;&gt;The frequency domain for the SSVEPs or SSMVEPs induced by the six paradigms was analyzed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#F4&quot;&gt;Figure 4&lt;/a&gt; shows the spectra of the different frequencies for subject 6 in channel Oz. It can be seen from the power spectrum that the amplitudes were significant at each frequency for the six paradigms, and there were also some harmonic components. The peak amplitude value of SSMVEP was smaller than the amplitude of the SSVEP induced by the square and circular flickers. For SSVEP there was significant amplitude at second harmonic, while the half harmonic component induced by SSMVEP was significant.&lt;/p&gt;

The average recognition accuracy of the SSVEP paradigm based on flicker was 99.1%, and there were no significant differences between the circular and square stimuli. The average recognition accuracy of SSMVEP based on Newton's ring motion is 77.5%, and the average recognition accuracy of the square ring Newtonian motion was 76.3%. The average recognition accuracy of the SSMVEP based on the radial zoom motion of the square and circular stimuli were 89.7 and 93.4%, respectively, and there were also no significant differences between the different shapes. However, the recognition accuracy of the SSMVEP paradigm based on radial zoom motion was significantly greater than the SSMVEP paradigm based on Newtonian motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Visual Comfort Evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#F7&quot;&gt;Figure 7&lt;/a&gt; shows the score for each comfort question. There was no significant differences in the comfort scores of the square and circle flicker SSVEP paradigms. The comfort score of the SSMVEP based on radial zoom motion was significantly greater than that of the flicker-based SSVEP paradigm, and slightly greater than the SSMVEP paradigm based on Newton's ring motion, for which the average comfort score of the circular radial zoom motion was the greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a id=&quot;h5&quot; name=&quot;h5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;The zoom motion paradigm at a certain frequency can induce an SSMVEP. There are two parallel visual pathways in the visual system. Compared with the traditional stimulus generated by the brightness change of the graphic, the size of the sinusoidal modulation is used to generate the zoom motion, which not only activates the “what” path that perceives shape and color, but also activates the “where” path that perceives motion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B11&quot;&gt;Heinrich and Bach, 2003&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B15&quot;&gt;Müller-Putz et al., 2005&lt;/a&gt;). Due to the depth perception of the human eye (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B6&quot;&gt;Chang et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;), the zoom motion paradigm causes a space movement sensation. Although the spectral response of the SSMVEP based on the radial zoom motion was not significantly greater than that of the SSVEP based on flicker, utilizing the CCA-based target frequency recognition algorithm for the sinusoidal motion paradigm could be used to achieve a higher accuracy and ITR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;Compared with the SSMVEP paradigm based on Newton's ring motion, the SSMVEP based on zoom motion had no obvious differences. In the experiment, one subject reported that the Newton's ring motion caused a feeling of vertigo, and provided a very low recognition accuracy of the square ring motion. Even if the sample was excluded, the average recognition accuracy of Newton's ring motion for the eight targets was still significantly lower than that of the recognition accuracy of the four targets in a previous study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B12&quot;&gt;Kremláek et al., 2004&lt;/a&gt;), the SSMVEP paradigm based on Newton's ring motion may not be suitable for a multiple target BCI system. The low recognition accuracy of Newton's ring motion-based SSMVEP may be related to its complicated graphic and motion patterns. In this paper, the target recognition accuracy of the SSMVEP based on the circular radial zoom motion reached 93.4%, which was greater than the recognition accuracy of the radial contraction-expansion motion paradigm in a previous study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B6&quot;&gt;Chang et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;). This may be due to the complexity of the stimulus graphics, whether the SSMVEP induced by the same motion pattern of different graphics were different; this requires further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb15&quot;&gt;From the subjective comfort evaluation, the differences in the accuracy, and comfort between different shapes of flicker-based SSVEPs were insignificant, which is consistent with previous studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B10&quot;&gt;Duszyk et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;). However, the comfort of the flicker paradigm was significantly lower than that of the SSMVEP-based paradigm, while the visual comfort based on the Newton's ring motion paradigm was lower than that of the radial zoom motion paradigm. The SSMVEP target recognition accuracy based on circular radial zoom motion was significantly higher than that of the SSMVEP paradigm based on square radial zoom motion. The SSMVEP paradigm based on radial zoom motion was as editable as the traditional flicker-based SSVEP paradigm. The visual comfort and recognition accuracy of the SSMVEP paradigm can be improved by changing the stimulus color, shape, and size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb0&quot;&gt;Regardless of the chosen SSVEP or SSMVEP-based BCI system, the performance and accuracy of the recognition was affected by increasing the duration. Therefore, the development of a visual stimulation paradigm with a lower accuracy reduction due to visual fatigue is required (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/rss#B4&quot;&gt;Cao et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;). The SSMVEP paradigm based on radial zoom motion proposed in this paper is not only more comfortable than the traditional flicker-based SSVEP paradigm, but also its recognition accuracy is greater than the Newton's ring SSMVEP paradigm in the previous study. Moreover, its accuracy decrease caused by fatigue was also less. The SSMVEP stimulation paradigm for a longer duration should be tested, and the objective fatigue evaluation will be addressed in a future study. Obtaining comparisons with other various SSMVEP paradigm, the potential advantages of the novel SSMVEP paradigm in fatigue-induced performance degradation problems would be proved.&lt;/p&gt;

 It has been suggested that the human nervous system controls motions in the task (or operational) space. However, little attention has been given to the separation of the control of the task-related and task-irrelevant degrees of freedom. Aim: We investigate how muscle synergies may be used to separately control the task-related and redundant degrees of freedom in a computational model. Approach: We generalize an existing motor control model, and assume that the task and redundant spaces have orthogonal basis vectors. This assumption originates from observations that the human nervous system tightly controls the task-related variables, and leaves the rest uncontrolled. In other words, controlling the variables in one space does not affect the other space; thus, the actuations must be orthogonal in the two spaces. We implemented this assumption in the model by selecting muscle synergies that produce force vectors with orthogonal directions in the task and redundant spaces. Findings: Our experimental results show that the orthogonality assumption performs well in reconstructing the muscle activities from the measured kinematics/dynamics in the task and redundant spaces. Specifically, we found that approximately 70% of the variation in the measured muscle activity can be captured with the orthogonality assumption, while allowing efficient separation of the control in the two spaces. Implications: The developed motor control model is a viable tool in real-time simulations of musculoskeletal systems, as well as model-based control of bio-mechatronic systems, where a computationally efficient representation of the human motion controller is needed.</content>

 Nature exhibits countless examples of adaptive networks, whose topology evolves constantly coupled with the activity due to its function. The brain is  an illustrative example of a system in which a dynamic complex network develops by the generation and pruning of synaptic contacts between neurons while memories are acquired and consolidated. Here, we consider a recently proposed brain developing model to study how  mechanisms responsible for the evolution of brain structure affect and are affected by memory storage processes. Following recent experimental observations, we assume that the basic rules for adding and removing synapses depend on local synaptic currents at the respective neurons in addition to global mechanisms depending on the mean connectivity. In this way a feedback loop between ``form'' and ``function'' spontaneously emerges that influences the ability of the system to optimally store and retrieve sensory information in patterns of brain activity or memories. In particular, we report here that, as a consequence of such  a feedback-loop, oscillations in the activity of the system among the memorized patterns can occur, depending on parameters, reminding  mind dynamical processes. Such oscillations have their origin in the destabilization of memory attractors due to the pruning dynamics, which induces a kind of structural disorder or noise in the system at a long-term scale. This constantly modifies the synaptic disorder induced by the interference among the many patterns of activity memorized in the system.  Such new intriguing oscillatory behavior is to be associated only to long-term synaptic mechanisms during the network evolution dynamics, and it does not depend on short-term synaptic processes, as assumed in other studies, that are not present in our model.</content>

 This study aimed to investigate the changes of α-synuclein in serum and its relationship with default mode network connectivity after acute mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI). Fifty-two patients with mild TBI at acute phase and forty-seven matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All participants received resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessments. Relations between the levels of α-synuclein in serum and clinical assessments were obtained using multivariate linear regression. Results showed that the patients with lower α-synuclein presented more complaints on post-concussion symptoms and depression. Moreover, patients with high levels of α-synuclein exhibited significantly decreased functional connectivity in the left precuneus and increased functional connectivity in both the left anterior cingulate cortex and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex compared with patients with low levels of α-synuclein. These findings supported that α-synuclein may modulate the functional connectivity within the default mode network and suggest the feasibility of using α-synuclein as objective biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of mild TBI.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The thalamocortical circuit is of central importance in relaying information to the cortex. In development, subplate neurons form an integral part of the thalamocortical pathway. These early born cortical neurons are the first neurons to receive thalamic inputs and excite neurons in the cortical plate. This feed-forward circuit topology of subplate neurons supports the role of subplate neurons in shaping the formation and plasticity of thalamocortical connections. Recently it has been shown that subplate neurons also receive inputs from the developing cortical plate and project to the thalamus. The cortical inputs to subplate neurons in early ages are mediated by NMDA-receptor only containing synapses while at later ages AMPA-receptors are present. Thus, subplate neurons perform a changing integrative function over development. NMDA-receptor only synapses are crucially influenced by the resting potential and thus insults to the developing brain that cause depolarizations, e.g. hypoxia, can influence the integrative function of SPNs. Since, such insults in humans cause symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders, NMDA-receptor only synapses on SPNs might provide a crucial link between early injuries and later circuit dysfunction. We thus here review subplate associated circuits, their changing functions, and discuss possible roles in development and disease.</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00040"/>

		<content type="html">
 Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) is best remembered for his belief that bumps on the skull reflect the growth of small, underlying brain areas, though among some historians more positively for introducing the concept of cortical localization of function. All but one of Gall's 27 settled-upon cortical faculties involved the cerebral cortex, the exception being his most primitive faculty, reproductive instinct, which he associated with the cerebellar cortex. This article examines Gall's earlier subcortical organs, with an emphasis on why he associated the cerebellum with this drive. It draws from accounts by several physicians, who attended his Vienna lectures or heard him speak in Germany and the Netherlands in 1805-1806 (i.e., before he published his finalized list in his Anatomie et Physiologie (1810-19). These early accounts show that early on he localized at least four faculties in brainstem structures, including reproductive drive in the cerebellar cortex. He based his structure-function association primarily on cranial differences between men and women, and what he found in males and females of other species, although cranioscopy was not his sole method. It is also shown that, in opposition to his cerebellar-reproductive drive association, Marie Jean Pierre Flourens linked coordinated skeletal movements to the cerebellum after conducting lesion experiments, mainly on birds. Flourens did not design his experiments to challenge Gall’s ideas on localization of function but they did just that. Gall responded that ablation methods lack precision and lead to misguided conclusions. How Gall continued to associate the reproductive instinct with the cerebellar cortex, even after deleting his other brainstem-based associations from his faculties of mind, tells us much about him and the faith he had in his methods and doctrine.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Choline acetyltransferase, the enzyme synthesizing acetylcholine, has an exon-skipping splice variant which is expressed preferentially in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and thus termed peripheral choline acetyltransferase (pChAT). A previously produced rabbit antiserum against rat pChAT (rpChAT) has been used for immunohistochemistry to study peripheral cholinergic structures in various animals. The present study was undertaken to develop a specific antiserum against a predicted human pChAT (hpChAT) protein. A novel mouse antiserum has been successfully raised against a unique 14 amino acids sequence of hpChAT protein. Our Western blot using this antiserum (termed here anti-hpChAT serum) on human colon extracts revealed only a single band of 47 kDa, matching the deduced size of hpChAT protein. By immunohistochemistry, the antiserum gave intense staining in many neuronal cells and fibers of human colon but not brain, and such a pattern of staining seemed identical with that reported in colon of various animals using anti-rpChAT serum. In the antibody-absorption test, hpChAT-immunoreactive staining in human colon was completely blocked by using the antiserum pre-absorbed with the antigen peptide. Double immunofluorescence in human colon moreover indicated that structures stained with anti-hpChAT were also stained with anti-rpChAT, and vice versa. hpChAT antiserum allowed to identify cell types, as Dogiel type cells in intramural plexuses, and fiber innervation of colon muscles and mucosae. The present results demonstrate the specificity and reliability of the hpChAT antiserum as a novel tool for immunohistochemical studies in human colon, opening venues to map cholinergic innervation in other human PNS tissues.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The lack of biomarkers in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) makes it difficult to determine the stage of the disease in patients and, therefore, it delays therapeutic trials. Microvesicles (MVs) are possible biomarkers implicated in physiological and pathological functions, however, their role in ALS remains unclear. We investigated whether plasma derived microvesicles could be overrepresented in a group of 40 patients affected by ALS compared to 28 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients and 36 healthy volunteers. Leukocyte derived MVs (LMVs) compared to endothelial, platelet, erythrocyte derived MVs, were mostly present in ALS patients compared to AD patients and healthy donors. Correlation analysis corrected for the presence of confounding variables (riluzole, age at onset, site of onset, gender) was tested between PRL (Progression Rate at the Last visit) and LMVs, and a statistically significant value was found (Pearson partial correlation r=0.407, p=0.006). We also investigated SOD-1, TDP-43 intravesicular protein level in LMVs. Misfolded SOD-1 was selectively transported by LMVs and its protein level was associated with the percentage of LMVs in slow progressing patients (r=0.545, p=0.033). Our findings suggest that LMVs are upregulated in ALS patients and they can be considered possible markers of disease progression.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Publication date: August 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Kristina Sakers, Cagla Eroglu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroligins are a family of cell adhesion molecules, which are best known for their functions as postsynaptic components of the trans-synaptic neurexin–neuroligin complexes. Neuroligins are highly conserved across evolution with important roles in the formation, maturation and function of synaptic structures. Mutations in the genes that encode for neuroligins have been linked to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, which stem from synaptic pathologies. Owing to their essential functions in regulating synaptic connectivity and their link to synaptic dysfunction in disease, previous studies on neuroligins have focused on neurons. Yet a recent work reveals that neuroligins are also expressed in the central nervous system by glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and perform important roles in controlling synaptic connectivity in a non-cell autonomous manner. In this review, we will highlight these recent findings demonstrating the important roles of glial neuroligins in regulating the development and connectivity of healthy and diseased brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Publication date: August 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Peri T Kurshan, Kang Shen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During synaptogenesis, presynaptic and postsynaptic assembly are driven by diverse molecular mechanisms, mediated by intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors. How these processes are initiated and coordinated are open questions. Synapse specificity, or synaptic partner selection, is widely understood to be determined by the trans-synaptic binding of cell adhesion molecules. However, &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; evidence that cell adhesion molecules subsequently function to initiate synapse assembly, as initially proposed, is lacking. Here, we present a summary of our current understanding of synaptogenic pathways that mediate presynaptic and postsynaptic assembly and the coordination of these processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
