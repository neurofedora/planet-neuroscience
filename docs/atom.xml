High-throughput sequencing of B- and T-cell receptors makes it possible to track immune repertoires across time, in different tissues, and in acute and chronic diseases or in healthy individuals. However, quantitative comparison between repertoires is confounded by variability in the read count of each receptor clonotype due to sampling, library preparation, and expression noise. Here, we present a general Bayesian approach to disentangle repertoire variations from these stochastic effects. Using replicate experiments, we first show how to learn the natural variability of read counts by inferring the distributions of clone sizes as well as an explicit noise model relating true frequencies of clones to their read count. We then use that null model as a baseline to infer a model of clonal expansion from two repertoire time points taken before and after an immune challenge. Applying our approach to yellow fever vaccination as a model of acute infection in humans, we identify candidate clones participating in the response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WuV350R5zIY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Uncertainty in the structure and parameters of networks is ubiquitous across computational biology. In constraint-based reconstruction and analysis of metabolic networks, this uncertainty is present both during the reconstruction of networks and in simulations performed with them. Here, we present Medusa, a Python package for the generation and analysis of ensembles of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. Medusa builds on the COBRApy package for constraint-based reconstruction and analysis by compressing a set of models into a compact ensemble object, providing functions for the generation of ensembles using experimental data, and extending constraint-based analyses to ensemble scale. We demonstrate how Medusa can be used to generate ensembles and perform ensemble simulations, and how machine learning can be used in conjunction with Medusa to guide the curation of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. Medusa is available under the permissive MIT license from the Python Packaging Index (https://pypi.org) and from github (https://github.com/opencobra/Medusa), and comprehensive documentation is available at https://medusa.readthedocs.io/en/latest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AD9jIGbNviM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In most neuronal models, ion concentrations are assumed to be constant, and effects of concentration variations on ionic reversal potentials, or of ionic diffusion on electrical potentials are not accounted for. Here, we present the electrodiffusive Pinsky-Rinzel (edPR) model, which we believe is the first multicompartmental neuron model that accounts for electrodiffusive ion concentration dynamics in a way that ensures a biophysically consistent relationship between ion concentrations, electrical charge, and electrical potentials in both the intra- and extracellular space. The edPR model is an expanded version of the two-compartment Pinsky-Rinzel (PR) model of a hippocampal CA3 neuron. Unlike the PR model, the edPR model includes homeostatic mechanisms and ion-specific leakage currents, and keeps track of all ion concentrations (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), electrical potentials, and electrical conductivities in the intra- and extracellular space. The edPR model reproduces the membrane potential dynamics of the PR model for moderate firing activity. For higher activity levels, or when homeostatic mechanisms are impaired, the homeostatic mechanisms fail in maintaining ion concentrations close to baseline, and the edPR model diverges from the PR model as it accounts for effects of concentration changes on neuronal firing. We envision that the edPR model will be useful for the field in three main ways. Firstly, as it relaxes commonly made modeling assumptions, the edPR model can be used to test the validity of these assumptions under various firing conditions, as we show here for a few selected cases. Secondly, the edPR model should supplement the PR model when simulating scenarios where ion concentrations are expected to vary over time. Thirdly, being applicable to conditions with failed homeostasis, the edPR model opens up for simulating a range of pathological conditions, such as spreading depression or epilepsy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HWagifW_BaU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Motor learning and adaptation are important functions of the nervous system. Classical studies have characterized how humans adapt to changes in the environment during tasks such as reaching, and have documented improvements in behavior across movements. However, little is known about how quickly the nervous system adapts to such disturbances. In particular, recent work has suggested that adaptation could be sufficiently fast to alter the control strategies of an ongoing movement. To further address the possibility that learning occurred within a single movement, we designed a series of human reaching experiments to extract from muscles recordings the latency of feedback adaptation. Our results confirmed that participants adapted their feedback responses to unanticipated force fields applied randomly. In addition, our analyses revealed that the feedback response was specifically and finely tuned to the ongoing perturbation not only across trials with the same force field, but also across different kinds of force fields. Finally, changes in muscle activity consistent with feedback adaptation occurred in ~250 ms following reach onset. The adaptation that we observed across trials presented in a random context was similar to the one observed when the force fields could be anticipated, suggesting that these two adaptive processes may be closely linked to each other. In such case, our measurement of 250 ms may correspond to the latency of motor adaptation in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in either &lt;i&gt;TSC1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;TSC2&lt;/i&gt;. TSC affects multiple systems of the body, and patients with TSC display a range of neurologic and behavioral manifestations including seizures, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and mood disorders. Whereas behavioral phenotypes of many mouse models have been studied, the effects of sex have, for the most part, not been explored. We studied adult male and female &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous and control mice to investigate the influence of sex and genotype on behavior. On a test of social preference, &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, regardless of sex, demonstrated lower preference for the stranger mouse than control mice. In the open field, &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous males and control females habituated to the open field with decreasing anxiety-like behavior over time, whereas &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous females did not show habituation to the open field environment. We did not find any statistically significant effects of genotype on open field activity, learning and memory or motor function. Our results highlight phenotype differences in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, some of which are influenced by sex. A consideration of how sex influences the behavioral phenotypes of TSC is critical to develop a more complete understanding of the disorder and better target future pharmacological treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients often suffer from sleep disturbances. Alterations in sleep, especially rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), can precede the onset of dementia. To accurately characterize the sleep impairments accompanying AD and their underlying mechanisms using animal models, it is crucial to use models in which brain areas are affected in a manner similar to that observed in the actual patients. Here, we focused on &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, in which expression levels and patterns of mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) follow the endogenous patterns. We characterized the sleep architecture of male &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; homozygous and heterozygous mice at two ages (six and 12 months). At six months, homozygous mice exhibited reduced REMS, which was further reduced at 12 months together with a slight reduction in non-REMS (NREMS). By contrast, heterozygous mice exhibited an overall normal sleep architecture. Homozygous mice also exhibited decreased electroencephalogram  to  power ratio during REMS from six months, resembling the electroencephalogram slowing phenomenon observed in preclinical or early stages of AD. In addition, homozygous mice showed learning and memory impairments in the trace fear conditioning (FC) at both ages, and task performance strongly correlated with REMS amount at 12 months. Finally, histologic analyses revealed that amyloid-β accumulation in the pontine tegmental area and ventral medulla followed a course similar to that of the REMS reduction. These findings support the notion that changes in REMS are an early marker of AD and provide a starting point to address the mechanism of sleep deficits in AD and the effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin, HCRT) deficiency causes sleep disorder narcolepsy with cataplexy in humans and murine. As another integral group of sleep/wake-regulating neurons in the same brain area, the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons’ involvement in cataplexy remains ambiguous. Here we used the live animal deep-brain calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) imaging tool to record MCH neuron dynamics during cataplexy by expressing calcium sensor GCaMP6s into genetically defined MCH neurons in orexin knock-out mice, which are a model of human narcolepsy. Similar to wild-type mice, MCH neurons of the narcoleptic mice displayed significantly higher Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient fluorescent intensity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and active waking (AW) episodes compared with non-REM (NREM) sleep. Moreover, MCH neurons displayed significantly lower Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals during cataplexy. Importantly, a pre-cataplexy elevation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals from MCH neurons was not a prerequisite for cataplexy initiation. Our results demonstrated the inactivation status of MCH neurons during cataplexy and suggested that MCH neurons are not involved in the initiation and maintenance of cataplexy in orexin knock-out mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Up to now, modern Machine Learning is based on fitting high dimensional
functions to enormous data sets, taking advantage of huge hardware resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that biologically inspired neuron models such as the
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons provide novel and efficient ways of
information encoding. They can be integrated in Machine Learning models, and
are a potential target to improve Machine Learning performance. Thus, we
systematically analyze the LIF neuron. We start by deriving simple integration
equations to which even a gradient can be assigned. Additionally, we prove that
a Long-Short-Term-Memory unit can be tuned to show similar spiking properties.
Additionally, LIF units are applied to an image classification task, trained
with backpropagation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this study we want to contribute to the current efforts to enhance
Machine Intelligence by integrating principles from biology.

 &lt;p&gt;Hearing is often believed to be more sensitive than touch. This assertion is
based on a comparison of sensitivities to weak stimuli. The respective stimuli,
however, are not easily comparable since hearing is gauged using acoustic
pressure and touch using skin displacement. We show that under reasonable
assumptions the auditory and tactile detection thresholds can be reconciled on
a level playing field. The results indicate that the capacity of touch and
hearing to detect weak stimuli varies according to the size of a sensed object
as well as to the frequency of its oscillations. In particular, touch is found
to be more effective than hearing at detecting small and slow objects.

 &lt;p&gt;In this work, we present a simple and general search space shrinking method,
called Angle-Based search space Shrinking (ABS), for Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). Our approach progressively simplifies the original search space by
dropping unpromising candidates, thus can reduce difficulties for existing NAS
methods to find superior architectures. In particular, we propose an
angle-based metric to guide the shrinking process. We provide comprehensive
evidences showing that, in weight-sharing supernet, the proposed metric is more
stable and accurate than accuracy-based and magnitude-based metrics to predict
the capability of child models. We also show that the angle-based metric can
converge fast while training supernet, enabling us to get promising shrunk
search spaces efficiently. ABS can easily apply to most of popular NAS
approaches (e.g. SPOS, FariNAS, ProxylessNAS, DARTS and PDARTS). Comprehensive
experiments show that ABS can dramatically enhance existing NAS approaches by
providing a promising shrunk search space.

 &lt;p&gt;We provide two characterizations, one axiomatic and the other
neuro-computational, of the dependence of choice probabilities on deadlines,
within the widely used softmax representation \[ p_{t}\left( a,A\right)
=\dfrac{e^{\frac{u\left( a\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right) }+\alpha \left(
a\right) }}{\sum_{b\in A}e^{\frac{u\left( b\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right)
}+\alpha \left( b\right) }}% \] where $p_{t}\left( a,A\right) $ is the
probability that alternative $a$ is selected from the set $A$ of feasible
alternatives if $t$ is the time available to decide, $\lambda$ is a time
dependent noise parameter measuring the unit cost of information, $u$ is a time
independent utility function, and $\alpha$ is an alternative-specific bias that
determines the initial choice probabilities and possibly reflects prior
information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our axiomatic analysis provides a behavioral foundation of softmax (also
known as Multinomial Logit Model when $\alpha$ is constant). Our
neuro-computational derivation provides a biologically inspired algorithm that
may explain the emergence of softmax in choice behavior. Jointly, the two
approaches provide a thorough understanding of soft-maximization in terms of
internal causes (neurophysiological mechanisms) and external effects (testable
implications).

 &lt;p&gt;Hanabi is a cooperative game that challenges exist-ing AI techniques due to
its focus on modeling the mental states ofother players to interpret and
predict their behavior. While thereare agents that can achieve near-perfect
scores in the game byagreeing on some shared strategy, comparatively little
progresshas been made in ad-hoc cooperation settings, where partnersand
strategies are not known in advance. In this paper, we showthat agents trained
through self-play using the popular RainbowDQN architecture fail to cooperate
well with simple rule-basedagents that were not seen during training and,
conversely, whenthese agents are trained to play with any individual
rule-basedagent, or even a mix of these agents, they fail to achieve

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Society has come to rely on algorithms like classifiers for important
decision making, giving rise to the need for ethical guarantees such as
fairness. Fairness is typically defined by asking that some statistic of a
classifier be approximately equal over protected groups within a population. In
this paper, current approaches to fairness are discussed and used to motivate
algorithmic proposals that incorporate fairness into genetic programming for
classification. We propose two ideas. The first is to incorporate a fairness
objective into multi-objective optimization. The second is to adapt lexicase
selection to define cases dynamically over intersections of protected groups.
We describe why lexicase selection is well suited to pressure models to perform
well across the potentially infinitely many subgroups over which fairness is
desired. We use a recent genetic programming approach to construct models on
four datasets for which fairness constraints are necessary, and empirically
compare performance to prior methods utilizing game-theoretic solutions.
Methods are assessed based on their ability to generate trade-offs of subgroup
fairness and accuracy that are Pareto optimal. The result show that genetic
programming methods in general, and random search in particular, are well
suited to this task.

 &lt;p&gt;The human brain exhibits large-scale spontaneous fluctuations that account
for most of its total energy metabolism. Independent of any overt function,
this immense ongoing activity likely creates or maintains a potential
functional brain reserve to facilitate normal brain function. An important
property of spontaneous brain activity is the long-range temporal coherence,
which can be characterized by resting state fMRI-based brain entropy mapping
(BEN), a relatively new method that has gained increasing research interest.
The purpose of this study was to leverage the large resting state fMRI and
behavioral data publicly available from the human connectome project to address
three important but still unknown questions: temporal stability of
rsfMRI-derived BEN; the relationship of resting BEN to latent functional
reserve; associations of resting BEN to neurocognition. Our results showed that
rsfMRI-derived BEN was highly stable across time; resting BEN in the default
mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN) was related to brain
reserve in a negative correlation to education years; and lower DMN/ECN BEN
corresponds to higher fluid intelligence and better task performance. These
results suggest that resting BEN is a temporally stable brain trait; BEN in
DMN/ECN may provide a means to measure the latent functional reserve that
bestows better brain functionality and may be enhanced by education.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a fast transient hydrostatic stress analysis for
electromigration (EM) failure assessment for multi-segment interconnects using
generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our work leverages the image synthesis
feature of GAN-based generative deep neural networks. The stress evaluation of
multi-segment interconnects, modeled by partial differential equations, can be
viewed as time-varying 2D-images-to-image problem where the input is the
multi-segment interconnects topology with current densities and the output is
the EM stress distribution in those wire segments at the given aging time.
Based on this observation, we train conditional GAN model using the images of
many self-generated multi-segment wires and wire current densities and aging
time (as conditions) against the COMSOL simulation results. Different
hyperparameters of GAN were studied and compared. The proposed algorithm,
called {\it EM-GAN}, can quickly give accurate stress distribution of a general
multi-segment wire tree for a given aging time, which is important for
full-chip fast EM failure assessment. Our experimental results show that the
EM-GAN shows 6.6\% averaged error compared to COMSOL simulation results with
orders of magnitude speedup. It also delivers 8.3X speedup over
state-of-the-art analytic based EM analysis solver.

 &lt;p&gt;Due to the fast-growing volume of text documents and reviews in recent years,
current analyzing techniques are not competent enough to meet the users' needs.
Using feature selection techniques not only support to understand data better
but also lead to higher speed and also accuracy. In this article, the Whale
Optimization algorithm is considered and applied to the search for the optimum
subset of features. As known, F-measure is a metric based on precision and
recall that is very popular in comparing classifiers. For the evaluation and
comparison of the experimental results, PART, random tree, random forest, and
RBF network classification algorithms have been applied to the different number

 &lt;p&gt;Rapid online adaptation to changing tasks is an important problem in machine
learning and, recently, a focus of meta-reinforcement learning. However,
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle in POMDP environments because
the state of the system, essential in a RL framework, is not always visible.
Additionally, hand-designed meta-RL architectures may not include suitable
computational structures for specific learning problems. The evolution of
online learning mechanisms, on the contrary, has the ability to incorporate
learning strategies into an agent that can (i) evolve memory when required and
(ii) optimize adaptation speed to specific online learning problems. In this
paper, we exploit the highly adaptive nature of neuromodulated neural networks
to evolve a controller that uses the latent space of an autoencoder in a POMDP.
The analysis of the evolved networks reveals the ability of the proposed
algorithm to acquire inborn knowledge in a variety of aspects such as the
detection of cues that reveal implicit rewards, and the ability to evolve
location neurons that help with navigation. The integration of inborn knowledge
and online plasticity enabled fast adaptation and better performance in
comparison to some non-evolutionary meta-reinforcement learning algorithms. The
algorithm proved also to succeed in the 3D gaming environment Malmo Minecraft.

 &lt;p&gt;Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, and MAP-Elites (ME) in particular, have
proven very useful for a broad range of applications including enabling real
robots to recover quickly from joint damage, solving strongly deceptive maze
tasks or evolving robot morphologies to discover new gaits. However, present
implementations of MAP-Elites and other QD algorithms seem to be limited to
low-dimensional controllers with far fewer parameters than modern deep neural
network models. In this paper, we propose to leverage the efficiency of
Evolution Strategies (ES) to scale MAP-Elites to high-dimensional controllers
parameterized by large neural networks. We design and evaluate a new hybrid
algorithm called MAP-Elites with Evolution Strategies (ME-ES) for post-damage
recovery in a difficult high-dimensional control task where traditional ME
fails. Additionally, we show that ME-ES performs efficient exploration, on par
with state-of-the-art exploration algorithms in high-dimensional control tasks

 &lt;p&gt;In this paper, we introduce TextBrewer, an open-source knowledge distillation
toolkit designed for natural language processing. It works with different
neural network models and supports various kinds of supervised learning tasks,
such as text classification, reading comprehension, sequence labeling.
TextBrewer provides a simple and uniform workflow that enables quick setting up
of distillation experiments with highly flexible configurations. It offers a
set of predefined distillation methods and can be extended with custom code. As
a case study, we use TextBrewer to distill BERT on several typical NLP tasks.
With simple configurations, we achieve results that are comparable with or even

 &lt;p&gt;We describe an implementation of gradient boosting and neural guidance of
saturation-style automated theorem provers that does not depend on consistent
symbol names across problems. For the gradient-boosting guidance, we manually
create abstracted features by considering arity-based encodings of formulas.
For the neural guidance, we use symbol-independent graph neural networks (GNNs)
and their embedding of the terms and clauses. The two methods are efficiently
implemented in the E prover and its ENIGMA learning-guided framework.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide competitive real-time performance of the GNNs, we have developed a
new context-based approach to evaluation of generated clauses in E. Clauses are
evaluated jointly in larger batches and with respect to a large number of
already selected clauses (context) by the GNN that estimates their collectively
most useful subset in several rounds of message passing. This means that
approximative inference rounds done by the GNN are efficiently interleaved with
precise symbolic inference rounds done inside E. The methods are evaluated on
the MPTP large-theory benchmark and shown to achieve comparable real-time
performance to state-of-the-art symbol-based methods. The methods also show
high complementarity, solving a large number of hard Mizar problems.

 &lt;p&gt;A self-editing algorithm is one that edits its program. The present paper
studies evolution of self-editing algorithms that undergo some form of natural
or artificial selection. We show that such an algorithm may be simply
programmed, by a procedure we call diagonalization, so as to use selection as
an information, to adjust accordingly its genetic behavior. We provide a lot of
examples regarding this principle, including ones that diagonalization is used
to evolve its own mechanism. (This last one being possible due to self-editing
property and to the general nature of this procedure).

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks are good at solving prediction problems. However,
finding a network that suits a problem is quite hard because their performance
is strongly affected by their architecture configuration. Automatic
architecture optimization methods help to find the most suitable design, but
they are not extensively adopted because of their high computational cost. In
this work, we introduce the Random Error Sampling-based Neuroevolution (RESN),
an evolutionary algorithm that uses the mean absolute error random sampling, a
training-free approach to predict the expected performance of an artificial
neural network, to optimize the architecture of a network. We empirically
validate our proposal on three prediction problems, and compare our technique
to training-based architecture optimization techniques and to neuroevolutionary
approaches. Our findings show that we can achieve state-of-the-art error
performance and that we reduce by half the time needed to perform the
optimization.

			<subtitle type="html">Nature Reviews Neuroscience is the leading review journal in the neurosciences. It publishes articles that review recent progress in brain and nervous system research. Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry. One of the unique features of Nature Reviews Neuroscience is its extraordinary breadth and depth of coverage. This very broad scope – from molecules to mind – captures the essence of modern neuroscience, and allows the journal to attract readers from all areas of this ever-expanding discipline.</subtitle>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP) is a complex syndrome whose neural correlates are still under investigation. One hypothesis, mainly based on lesion mapping studies, is that AHP reflects a breakdown of neural systems of the right hemisphere involved in motor function. However, more recent theories have suggested that AHP may represent a disorder of cognitive systems involved in belief updating, self-referential or body processing. Two recent studies, using a method to estimate the degree of white matter disconnection from lesions, have indeed shown that patients with AHP suffer from damage of several long-range white matter pathways in association cortex. Here, we use a similar indirect disconnection approach to study a group of patients with motor deficits without anosognosia (hemiparesis or hemiplegia, HP, n = 35), or motor deficits with AHP (n = 28). The HP lesions came from a database of stroke patients, while cases of AHP were selected from the published literature. Lesions were traced into an atlas from illustrations of the publications using a standard method. There was no region in the brain that was more damaged in AHP than HP. In terms of structural connectivity, AHP patients had a similar pattern of disconnection of motor pathways to HP patients. However, AHP patients also showed significant disconnection of the right temporo-parietal junction, right insula, right lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. These associative cortical regions were connected through several white matter tracts, including superior longitudinal fasciculus III, arcuate, fronto-insular, frontal inferior longitudinal, and frontal aslant. These tracts connected regions of different cognitive networks: default, ventral attention, and cingulo-opercular. These results were not controlled for clinical variables as concomitant symptoms and other disorders of body representation were not always available for co-variate analysis. In conclusion, we confirm recent studies of disconnection demonstrating that AHP is not limited to dysfunction of motor systems, but involves a much wider set of large-scale cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects selected cortical and spinal neuronal populations, leading to progressive paralysis and death. A growing body of evidences suggests that the disease may originate in the cerebral cortex and propagate in a corticofugal manner. In particular, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies revealed that ALS patients present with early cortical hyperexcitability arising from a combination of increased excitability and decreased inhibition. Here, we discuss the possibility that initial cortical circuit dysfunction might act as the main driver of ALS onset and progression, and review recent functional, imaging and transcriptomic studies conducted on ALS patients, along with electrophysiological, pathological and transcriptomic studies on animal and cellular models of the disease, in order to evaluate the potential cellular and molecular origins of cortical hyperexcitability in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence suggested that neuroinflammation played a crucial role in dopaminergic neuronal death in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been proposed as a key molecule in the onset and sustainment of the inflammatory response. Engagement of RAGE contributed to neuroinflammation by upregulating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) as well as cytokines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of RAGE in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice and elucidate the RAGE signal pathway involved in the inflammation. Results showed that RAGE protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) were upregulated in MPTP-treated mice. Further experiments showed that RAGE ablation inhibited phosphorylation of IκB and p38 and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons against cell death in the substantia nigra (SN). These results suggested that RAGE participated in the pathogenesis of PD by neuroinflammation and p38MAPK-NFκB signal pathway may be involved in the process. Moreover, interfering with RAGE signaling pathway may be a reasonable therapeutic option in slowing PD development and progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The neurovascular unit (NVU), composed of vascular cells, glial cells, and neurons, is the minimal functional unit of the brain. The NVU maintains integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and regulates supply of the cerebral blood flow (CBF), both of which are keys to maintaining normal brain function. BBB dysfunction and a decreased CBF are early pathophysiological changes in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this review, we primarily focus on the NVU in AD as much research has been performed on the connection between NVU dysfunction and AD. We also discuss the role of NVU dysfunction in the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD and ALS. As most neurodegenerative diseases are difficult to treat, we discuss several potential drug targets that focus on the NVU that may inform novel vascular-targeted therapies for AD, PD, and ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Despite great advances in brain tumor segmentation and clear clinical need, translation of state-of-the-art computational methods into clinical routine and scientific practice remains a major challenge. Several factors impede successful implementations, including data standardization and preprocessing. However, these steps are pivotal for the deployment of state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms. To overcome these issues, we present BraTS Toolkit. BraTS Toolkit is a holistic approach to brain tumor segmentation and consists of three components: First, the BraTS Preprocessor facilitates data standardization and preprocessing for researchers and clinicians alike. It covers the entire image analysis workflow prior to tumor segmentation, from image conversion and registration to brain extraction. Second, BraTS Segmentor enables orchestration of BraTS brain tumor segmentation algorithms for generation of fully-automated segmentations. Finally, Brats Fusionator can combine the resulting candidate segmentations into consensus segmentations using fusion methods such as majority voting and iterative SIMPLE fusion. The capabilities of our tools are illustrated with a practical example to enable easy translation to clinical and scientific practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional MRI is increasingly being used in the assessment of brain activation and connectivity following stroke. Many of these studies rely on the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast. However, the stability, as well as the accuracy of the BOLD response to motor task in the ipsilesional hemisphere, remains ambiguous. In this work, the BOLD signal acquired from both healthy and affected hemispheres was analyzed in 7-year-old children who sustained a Neonatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke (NAIS). Accordingly, a repetitive motor task of the contralesional and the ipsilesional hands was performed by 33 patients with unilateral lesions. These patients were divided into two groups: those without cerebral palsy (NAIS), and those with cerebral palsy (CP). The BOLD signal time course was obtained from distinctly defined regions of interest (ROIs) extracted from the functional activation maps of 30 healthy controls with similar age and demographic characteristics as the patients. An ROI covering both the primary motor cortex (M1) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) was also tested. Compared with controls, NAIS patients without CP had similar BOLD amplitude variation for both the contralesional and the ipsilesional hand movements. However, in the case of NAIS patients with CP, a significant difference in the averaged BOLD amplitude was found between the healthy and affected hemisphere. In both cases, no progressive attenuation of the BOLD signal amplitude was observed throughout the task epochs. Besides, results also showed a correlation between the BOLD signal percentage variation of the lesioned hemisphere and the dexterity level. These findings suggest that for patients who sustained a NAIS with no extensive permanent motor impairment, BOLD signal-based data analysis can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of functional brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Novelty is central to the study of memory, but the wide range of experimental manipulations aimed to reveal its effects on learning produced inconsistent results. The novelty/encoding hypothesis suggests that novel information undergoes enhanced encoding and thus leads to benefits in memory, especially in recognition performance; however, recent studies cast doubts on this assumption. On the other hand, data from animal studies provided evidence on the robust effects of novelty manipulations on the neurophysiological correlates of memory processes. Conceptualizations and operationalizations of novelty are remarkably variable and were categorized into different subtypes, such as stimulus, context, associative or spatial novelty. Here, we summarize previous findings about the effects of novelty on memory and suggest that predictive coding theories provide a framework that could shed light on the differential influence of novelty manipulations on memory performance. In line with predictive coding theories, we emphasize the role of unexpectedness as a crucial property mediating the behavioral and neural effects of novelty manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previous research showed that the ability to make inferences about our own and other’s mental states rely on common brain pathways; particularly in the case of close relationships (e.g., romantic relationships). Despite the evidence for shared neural representations of self and others, less is known about the distributed processing within these common neural networks, particularly whether there are specific patterns of internode communication when focusing on other vs. self. This study aimed to characterize context-sensitive coupling among social brain regions involved in self and other understanding. Participants underwent an fMRI while watching emotional video vignettes of their romantic partner and elaborated on their partner’s (other-condition) or on their own experience (self-condition). We used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to quantify the associated changes in effective connectivity (EC) in a network of brain regions involved in social cognition including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the posterior cingulate (PCC)/precuneus and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). DCM revealed that: the PCC plays a central coordination role within this network, the bilateral MTG receives driving inputs from other nodes suggesting that social information is first processed in language comprehension regions; the right TPJ evidenced a selective increase in its sensitivity when focusing on the other’s experience, relative to focusing on oneself.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The human auditory system is highly skilled at extracting and processing information from speech in both single-speaker and multi-speaker situations. A commonly studied speech feature is the amplitude envelope which can also be used to determine which speaker a listener is attending to in those multi-speaker situations. Non-invasive brain imaging (electro-/magnetoencephalography [EEG/MEG]) has shown that the phase of neural activity below 16 Hz tracks the dynamics of speech, whereas invasive brain imaging (electrocorticography [ECoG]) has shown that such processing is strongly reflected in the power of high frequency neural activity (around 70-150 Hz; known as high gamma). The first aim of this study was to determine if high gamma power scalp recorded EEG carries useful stimulus-related information, despite its reputation for having a poor signal to noise ratio. Specifically, linear regression was used to investigate speech envelope and attention decoding in low frequency EEG, high gamma power EEG, and in both EEG signals combined. The second aim was to assess whether the information reflected in high gamma power EEG may be complementary to that reflected in well-established low frequency EEG indices of speech processing. Exploratory analyses were also completed to examine how low frequency and high gamma power EEG may be sensitive to different features of the speech envelope. While low frequency speech tracking was evident for almost all subjects as expected, high gamma power also showed robust speech tracking in some subjects. This same pattern was true for attention decoding using a separate group of subjects who participated in a cocktail party attention experiment. For the subjects who showed speech tracking in high gamma power EEG, the spatiotemporal characteristics of that high gamma tracking differed from that of low-frequency EEG. Furthermore, combining the two neural measures led to improved measures of speech tracking for several subjects. Our results indicated that high gamma power EEG can carry useful information regarding speech processing and attentional selection in some subjects. Combining high gamma power and low frequency EEG can improve the mapping between natural speech and the resulting neural responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The mouse optic nerve crush (ONC) model has been widely used to study optic neuropathies and central nervous system (CNS) axon injury and repair. Previous histological studies of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata in retina and axons in ON demonstrate significant neurodegeneration after ONC, but longitudinal morphological and functional assessment of RGCs in living animals is lacking. It is essential to establish these assays to provide more clinically relevant information for early detection and monitoring the progression of CNS neurodegeneration. Here, we present in vivo data gathered by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and pattern electroretinogram (PERG) at different time points after ONC in mouse eyes and corresponding histological quantification of the RGC somata and axons. Not surprisingly, direct visualization of RGCs by SLO fundus imaging correlated best with histological quantification of RGC somata and axons. Unexpectedly, OCT did not detect obvious retinal thinning until late time points (14 and 28-days post ONC) and instead detected significant retinal swelling at early time points (1–5 days post-ONC), indicating a characteristic initial retinal response to ON injury. PERG also demonstrated an early RGC functional deficit in response to ONC, before significant RGC death, suggesting that it is highly sensitive to ONC. However, the limited progression of PERG deficits diminished its usefulness as a reliable indicator of RGC degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;White matter (WM) microstructure is a sensitive marker to distinguish individuals at risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The association of objective physical fitness (PF) measures and WM microstructure has not been explored and mixed results reported with physical activity (PA). Longitudinal studies of WM with PA and PF measures have had limited investigation. This study explored the relationship between objective PF measures over 24-months with “normal-appearing” WM microstructure. Data acquired on magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure “normal-appearing” WM microstructure at baseline and 24-months. Clinical variables such as cognitive and blood-based measures were collected longitudinally. Also, as part of the randomized controlled trial of a PA, extensive measures of PA and fitness were obtained over the 24 months. Bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) and the corpus callosum showed a significant association between PF performance over 24-months and baseline WM microstructural measures. There was no significant longitudinal effect of the intervention or PF performance over 24-months. Baseline WM microstructural measures were significantly associated with PF performance over 24-months in this cohort of participants with vascular risk factors and at risk of Alzheimer’s disease with distinctive patterns for each PF test.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Brains depend on blood flow for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients essential for proper neuronal and synaptic functioning. French physiologist Rouget was the first to describe pericytes in 1873 as regularly arranged longitudinal amoeboid cells on capillaries that have a muscular coat, implying that these are contractile cells that regulate blood flow. Although there have been &amp;gt;30 publications from different groups, including our group, demonstrating that pericytes are contractile cells that can regulate hemodynamic responses in the brain, the role of pericytes in controlling cerebral blood flow (CBF) has not been confirmed by all studies. Moreover, recent studies using different optogenetic models to express light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) cation channels in pericytes were not conclusive; one, suggesting that pericytes expressing ChR2 do not contract after light stimulus, and the other, demonstrating contraction of pericytes expressing ChR2 after light stimulus. Since two-photon optogenetics provides a powerful tool to study mechanisms of blood flow regulation at the level of brain capillaries, we re-examined the contractility of brain pericytes in vivo using a new optogenetic model developed by crossing our new inducible pericyte-specific CreER mouse line with ChR2 mice. We induced expression of ChR2 in pericytes with tamoxifen, excited ChR2 by 488 nm light, and monitored pericyte contractility, brain capillary diameter changes, and red blood cell (RBC) velocity in aged mice by in vivo two-photon microscopy. Excitation of ChR2 resulted in pericyte contraction followed by constriction of the underlying capillary leading to approximately an 8% decrease (p = 0.006) in capillary diameter. ChR2 excitation in pericytes substantially reduced capillary RBC flow by 42% (p = 0.03) during the stimulation period compared to the velocity before stimulation. Our data suggests that pericytes contract in vivo and regulate capillary blood flow in the aging mouse brain. By extension, this might have implications for neurological disorders of the aging human brain associated with neurovascular dysfunction and pericyte loss such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Micturition requires precise control of bladder and urethral sphincter via parasympathetic, sympathetic and somatic motoneurons. This involves a spino-bulbospinal control circuit incorporating Barrington's nucleus in the pons (Barr). Ponto-spinal glutamatergic neurons that express corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) form one of the largest Barr cell populations. Barr&lt;sup&gt;CRH&lt;/sup&gt; neurons can generate bladder contractions, but it is unknown whether they act as a simple switch or provide a high-fidelity pre-parasympathetic motor drive and whether their activation can actually trigger voids. Combined opto- and chemo-genetic manipulations along with multisite extracellular recordings in urethane anaesthetised CRH&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mice show that Barr&lt;sup&gt;CRH&lt;/sup&gt; neurons provide a probabilistic drive that generates co-ordinated voids or non-voiding contractions depending on the phase of the micturition cycle. CRH itself provides negative feedback regulation of this process. These findings inform a new inferential model of autonomous micturition and emphasise the importance of the state of the spinal gating circuit in the generation of voiding.</content>

 Doc2a and Doc2b are high-affinity calcium-binding proteins that interact with SNARE proteins and phospholipids. Experiments performed on cultured cells indicated that Doc2 proteins promote spontaneous vesicle fusion and asynchronous neurotransmitter release, regulate vesicle priming, mediate augmentation, and regulate transmission during sustained activity. Here, we assess the role of Doc2 proteins in synaptic transmission under physiological conditions at mature synapses made by Purkinje cells onto neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (PC to DCN synapses). PCs express Doc2b but not Doc2a. Surprisingly, spontaneous neurotransmitter release, synaptic strength, the time course of evoked release, responses evoked by sustained high-frequency stimulation, and short-term plasticity were normal in Doc2b KO mice. Thus, in stark contrast to numerous functions previously proposed for Doc2, here we find that Doc2b removal does not influence transmission at PC-to-DCN synapses, indicating that conclusions based on studies of Doc2b in cultured cells do not necessarily generalize to mature synapses under physiological conditions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Tetraploidy has long been of interest to both cell and cancer biologists, partly because of its documented role in tumorigenesis. A common model proposes that the extra centrosomes that are typically acquired during tetraploidization are responsible for driving tumorigenesis. However, tetraploid cells evolved in culture have been shown to lack extra centrosomes. This observation raises questions about how tetraploid cells evolve and more specifically about the mechanisms(s) underlying centrosome loss. Here, using a combination of fixed cell analysis, live cell imaging, and mathematical modeling, we show that populations of newly formed tetraploid cells rapidly evolve &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;to retain a near-tetraploid chromosome number while losing the extra centrosomes gained at the time of tetraploidization. This appears to happen through a process of natural selection in which tetraploid cells that inherit a single centrosome during a bipolar division with asymmetric centrosome clustering are favored for long-term survival.</content>

 During vertebrate retinal development, subsets of progenitor cells produce progeny in a non-stochastic manner, suggesting that these decisions are tightly regulated. However, the gene-regulatory network components that are functionally important in these progenitor cells are largely unknown. Here we identify a functional role for the OTX2 transcription factor in this process. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to produce somatic mutations of OTX2 in the chick retina and identified similar phenotypes to those observed in human patients. Single cell RNA sequencing was used to determine the functional consequences OTX2 gene editing on the population of cells derived from OTX2-expressing retinal progenitor cells. This confirmed that OTX2 is required for the generation of photoreceptors, but also for repression of specific retinal fates and alternative gene regulatory networks. These include specific subtypes of retinal ganglion and horizontal cells, suggesting that in this context, OTX2 functions to repress sister cell fate choices.</content>

 Because chromatin determines whether information encoded in DNA is accessible to transcription factors, dynamic chromatin states in development may constrain how gene regulatory networks impart embryonic pattern. To determine the interplay between chromatin states and regulatory network function, we performed ATAC-seq on &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos during the establishment of the segmentation network, comparing wild-type and mutant embryos in which all graded maternal patterning inputs are eliminated. While during the period between zygotic genome activation and gastrulation many regions maintain stable accessibility, cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) within the network undergo extensive patterning-dependent changes in accessibility. A component of the network, Odd-paired (&lt;i&gt;opa&lt;/i&gt;), is necessary for pioneering accessibility of late segmentation network CRMs. &lt;i&gt;opa-&lt;/i&gt;driven changes in accessibility are accompanied by equivalent changes in gene expression. Interfering with the timing of &lt;i&gt;opa&lt;/i&gt; activity impacts the proper patterning of expression. These results indicate that dynamic systems for chromatin regulation directly impact the reading of embryonic patterning information.</content>

 The developmental potential of early embryos is mainly dictated by the quality of the oocyte. Here, we explore the utility of the maternal spindle transfer (MST) technique as a reproductive approach to enhance oocyte developmental competence. Our proof-of-concept experiments show that replacement of the entire cytoplasm of oocytes from a sensitive mouse strain overcomes massive embryo developmental arrest characteristic of non-manipulated oocytes. Genetic analysis confirmed minimal carryover of mtDNA following MST. Resulting mice showed low heteroplasmy levels in multiple organs at adult age, normal histology and fertility. Mice were followed for 5 generations (F5), revealing that heteroplasmy was reduced in F2 mice and was undetectable in the subsequent generations. This pre-clinical model demonstrates the high efficiency and potential of the MST technique, not only to prevent the transmission of mtDNA mutations, but also as a new potential treatment for patients with certain forms of infertility refractory to current clinical strategies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Odorant-dependent behaviors in insects are triggered by the binding of odorant ligands to the variable subunits of heteromeric olfactory receptors. Previous studies have shown, however, that specific odor binding to ORco, the common subunit of odorant receptor heteromers, may alter allosterically olfactory receptor function and affect profoundly subsequent behavioral responses. Here we report on the identification of several antagonists of the odorant receptor co-receptor of the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, AgamORco, in a small collection of natural volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a relevant insect cell-based screening platform. Because some of the identified antagonists were previously shown to strongly repel Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes, here we examined the bioactivities of the identified antagonists against Aedes, the third major genus of the Culicidae family. The tested antagonists were found to inhibit the function of Ae. aegypti ORco ex vivo and repel Asian tiger, Ae. albopictus, adult mosquitoes. Specific antagonist binary mixtures elicited higher repellency than single antagonists. Binding competition assays suggested antagonist binding to distinct ORco sites as a likely cause for the enhanced repellence of the blends. These findings demonstrate that a simple screening assay may be used for the identification of allosteric modifiers of olfactory-driven behaviors capable of providing enhanced indoor and outdoor protection against multiple mosquito borne infectious diseases.</content>

Lineage tracing involves the identification of all ancestors and descendants of a given cell, and is an important tool for studying biological processes such as development and disease progression. However, in many settings, controlled time-course experiments are not feasible, for example when working with tissue samples from patients. Here we present ImageAEOT, a computational pipeline based on autoencoders and optimal transport for predicting the lineages of cells using time-labeled datasets from different stages of a cellular process. Given a single-cell image from one of the stages, ImageAEOT generates an artificial lineage of this cell based on the population characteristics of the other stages. These lineages can be used to connect subpopulations of cells through the different stages and identify image-based features and biomarkers underlying the biological process. To validate our method, we apply ImageAEOT to a benchmark task based on nuclear and chromatin images during the activation of fibroblasts by tumor cells in engineered 3D tissues. We further validate ImageAEOT on chromatin images of various breast cancer cell lines and human tissue samples, thereby linking alterations in chromatin condensation patterns to different stages of tumor progression. Our results demonstrate the promise of computational methods based on autoencoding and optimal transport principles for lineage tracing in settings where existing experimental strategies cannot be used.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P97F_QvFAac&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We shed light on the potential of entorhinal grid cells to efficiently encode variables of dimension greater than two, while remaining faithful to empirical data on their low-dimensional structure. Our model constructs representations of high-dimensional inputs through a combination of low-dimensional random projections and “classical” low-dimensional hexagonal grid cell responses. Without reconfiguration of the recurrent circuit, the same system can flexibly encode multiple variables of different dimensions while maximizing the coding range (per dimension) by automatically trading-off dimension with an exponentially large coding range. It achieves high efficiency and flexibility by combining two powerful concepts, modularity and mixed selectivity, in what we call “mixed modular coding”. In contrast to previously proposed schemes, the model does not require the formation of higher-dimensional grid responses, a cell-inefficient and rigid mechanism. The firing fields observed in flying bats or climbing rats can be generated by neurons that combine activity from multiple grid modules, each representing higher-dimensional spaces according to our model. The idea expands our understanding of grid cells, suggesting that they could implement a general circuit that generates on-demand coding and memory states for variables in high-dimensional vector spaces.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JtlFgqKoNz0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mechanical interactions between flowing and coagulated blood (thrombus) are crucial in dictating the deformation and remodeling of a thrombus after its formation in hemostasis. We propose a fully-Eulerian, three-dimensional, phase-field model of thrombus that is calibrated with existing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experimental data. This phase-field model considers spatial variations in permeability and material properties within a single unified mathematical framework derived from an energy perspective, thereby allowing us to study effects of thrombus microstructure and properties on its deformation and possible release of emboli under different hemodynamic conditions. Moreover, we combine this proposed thrombus model with a particle-based model which simulates the initiation of the thrombus. The volume fraction of a thrombus obtained from the particle simulation is mapped to an input variable in the proposed phase-field thrombus model. The present work is thus the first computational study to integrate the initiation of a thrombus through platelet aggregation with its subsequent viscoelastic responses to various shear flows. This framework can be informed by clinical data and potentially be used to predict the risk of diverse thromboembolic events under physiological and pathological conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OYT2XpKBMGM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The mechanisms underlying virus emergence are rarely well understood, making the appearance of outbreaks largely unpredictable. Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), an arthropod-borne virus of ruminants, emerged in livestock in northern Europe in 2006, spreading to most European countries by 2009 and causing losses of billions of euros. Although the outbreak was successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010, puzzlingly, a closely related BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France in 2015, triggering a second outbreak that is still ongoing. The origin of this virus and the mechanisms underlying its re-emergence are unknown. Here, we performed phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the two outbreaks. We demonstrate consistent clock-like virus evolution during both epizootics but found negligible evolutionary change between them. We estimate that the ancestor of the second outbreak dates from the height of the first outbreak in 2008. This implies that the virus had not been replicating for multiple years prior to its re-emergence in 2015. Given the absence of any known natural mechanism that could explain BTV-8 persistence over this long period without replication, we hypothesise that the second outbreak could have been initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material contaminated with virus from approximately 2008. Our work highlights new targets for pathogen surveillance programmes in livestock and illustrates the power of genomic epidemiology to identify pathways of infectious disease emergence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qHT7Q40nPnc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prospective time‐delayed cross‐over design trial of GS to assess the efficacy of GS as a first‐line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders took place between 12/01/2015 – 09/27/2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for four months followed by GS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34 individuals were assessed at interim review&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; The genetic origin of two patient's leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients stratified to the immediate intervention group and 23 patients to the delayed‐GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the Immediate (5 of 9 [56%] vs. 0 of 9 [0%]; Wild‐Seber p &amp;lt; 0.005) and Delayed (control) arms (14 of 23 [61%] vs 5 of 23 [22%]; Wild‐Seber p &amp;lt; 0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate‐GS group (log rank test, p=0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5% [95% CI = 58.8% to 89.3%]) in less than 4 months, greater than historical norms of less than 50% over 5 years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single‐arm observational study.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, first‐line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders. We provide an evidence‐based diagnostic testing algorithm to enable appropriate clinical GS utilization in this population.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of Na,K‐ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bde1d677-be62-4389-bc1d-4ce3e4a27c1f/cne24924-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase comprises α (&lt;i&gt;Atp1a&lt;/i&gt;), β (&lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt;), and FXYD subunits, and each subunit has isoforms. In situ hybridization for α and β subunit isoforms revealed regional‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of the isoforms in the mouse brain. The photograph shows &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; (red) and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; (green) expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (stained with DAPI, blue).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase is a ubiquitous molecule contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the plasma membrane and maintenance of the membrane potential, a prerequisite of neuronal activity. Na,K‐ATPase comprises three subunits (α, β, and FXYD). The α subunit has four isoforms in mice, with three of them (α1, α2, and α3) expressed in the brain. However, the functional and biological significances of the different brain isoforms remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed the association of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding α3 subunit, with neurological disorders. To map the cellular distributions of the α subunit isoforms and their coexpression patterns, we evaluated the mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; by in situ hybridization in the mouse brain. &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; were expressed in neurons, whereas &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt; was almost exclusively expressed in glial cells. Most neurons coexpressed &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, with highly heterogeneous expression levels across the brain regions and neuronal subtypes. We identified parvalbumin (PV)‐expressing GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex as an example of a neuronal subtype expressing low &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and high &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt; isoforms was also heterogeneous across brain regions and cellular subtypes. The PV‐expressing neurons expressed a high level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b1&lt;/i&gt; and a low level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1b3&lt;/i&gt;. These findings provide basic information on the region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐dependent expression of Na,K‐ATPase α and β subunit isoforms, as well as a rationale for the selective involvement of neurons expressing high levels of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Occipital alpha is a prominent rhythm (~10 Hz) detected in electroencephalography (EEG) during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. The rhythm is generated by a subclass of thalamic pacemaker cells that burst at the alpha frequency, orchestrated by the interplay of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) and calcium channels in response to elevated levels of ambient acetylcholine (ACh). These oscillations are known to have a lower peak frequency and coherence in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Interestingly, calcium signaling, HCN channel expression and ACh signaling, crucial for orchestrating the alpha rhythm, are also known to be aberrational in AD. In a biophysically detailed network model of the thalamic circuit, we investigate the changes in molecular signaling and the causal relationships between them that lead to a disrupted thalamic alpha in AD. Our simulations show that lowered HCN expression leads to a slower thalamic alpha, which can be rescued by increasing ACh levels, a common therapeutic target of AD drugs. However, this rescue is possible only over a limited range of reduced HCN expression. The model predicts that lowered HCN expression can modify the network activity in the thalamic circuit leading to increased GABA release in the thalamus and disrupt the calcium homeostasis. The changes in calcium signaling make the network more susceptible to noise, causing a loss in rhythmic activity. Based on our results, we propose that reduced frequency and coherence of the occipital alpha rhythm seen in AD may result from downregulated HCN expression, rather than modified cholinergic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The specific mechanisms underlying compulsive behavior in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are unknown. It has been suggested that such compulsivity may have its origin in cognitive dysfunction such as impaired processing of feedback information, received after the completion of goal-directed actions. The signal attenuation (SA) task models such a processing deficit in animals by attenuating the association strength between food reward and audiovisual feedback (signal) presented after performance of an operant response. The compulsive-like responding resulting from SA is well characterized in rats, but was so far not established in mice, a species for which powerful genetic OCD models exist. Thus, first, we demonstrate that the SA task can be implemented in mice and show that attenuation of reward-associated response feedback produces similar behavior in C57BL/6 mice as previously reported in rats. Second, we tested the hypothesis that &lt;i&gt;SAPAP3&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice (SAPAP3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;), prone to exhibit several OCD-like abnormalities including excessive grooming, show enhanced compulsive-like behavior in the SA task compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates. However, task-related compulsivity measures in SAPAP3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and WT did not yield significant differences, neither following SA nor during &quot;regular&quot; extinction of operant behavior. Thus, compulsive-like instrumental behavior following feedback distortion was not potentiated in compulsively grooming mice, implicating specifically that (1) a general deficit in feedback processing is not related to excessive grooming in SAPAP3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and (2) different manifestations of compulsivity may be driven by independent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Sperm–oocyte fusion is a critical event in mammalian fertilization, categorized by three indispensable proteins. Sperm membrane protein IZUMO1 and its counterpart oocyte membrane protein JUNO make a protein complex allowing sperm to interact with the oocyte, and subsequent sperm–oocyte fusion. Oocyte tetraspanin protein CD9 also contributes to sperm–oocyte fusion.

&lt;p&gt;The intercollicular region, which lies between the inferior and superior colliculi in the midbrain, contains neurons that respond to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli.

&lt;p&gt;The intercollicular region, which lies between the inferior and superior colliculi in the midbrain, contains neurons that respond to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Golgi studies have been used to parse this region into three distinct nuclei: the intercollicular tegmentum (ICt), the rostral pole of the inferior colliculus (ICrp), and the nucleus of the brachium of the IC (NBIC). Few reports have focused on these nuclei, especially the ICt and the ICrp, possibly due to lack of a marker that distinguishes these areas and is compatible with modern methods. Here, we found that staining for GABAergic cells and perineuronal nets differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs. Further, we found that the proportions of four subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate intercollicular nuclei from each other and from adjacent inferior collicular subdivisions. Our results support earlier studies that suggest distinct morphology and functions for intercollicular nuclei, and provide staining methods that differentiate intercollicular nuclei and are compatible with most modern techniques. We hope that this will help future studies to further characterize the intercollicular region.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic development in progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) has been hampered by a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor neurodegeneration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)‐derived retinal measures have been proposed as promising biomarkers to fulfill this role. However, it is unclear whether retinal atrophy persists in PMS, exceeds normal aging, or can be distinguished from relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;178 RRMS, 186 PMS, and 66 control participants were followed with serial OCT for a median follow‐up of 3.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated proportion of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thinning in multiple sclerosis (MS) attributable to normal aging increased from 42.7% and 16.7% respectively at age 25 years, to 83.7% and 81.1% at age 65 years. However, independent of age, PMS was associated with faster pRNFL (−0.34 ± 0.09%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (−0.27 ± 0.07%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) thinning, as compared to RRMS. In both MS and controls, higher baseline age was associated with faster inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning. INL and ONL thinning were independently faster in PMS, as compared to controls (INL:−0.09 ± 0.04%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; ONL:−0.12 ± 0.06%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04), and RRMS (INL:−0.10 ± 0.04%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01; ONL:−0.13 ± 0.05%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01), whereas they were similar in RRMS and controls. Unlike RRMS, disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact rates of retinal layer atrophy in PMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PMS is associated with faster retinal atrophy independent of age. INL and ONL measures may be novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration in PMS that appear to be unaffected by conventional DMTs. The effects of aging on rates of retinal layer atrophy should be considered in clinical trials incorporating OCT outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) is primarily responsible for initiating an immune response following pathogen recognition. However, TLR4 is also expressed on neural progenitor cells and has been reported to regulate hippocampal neurogenesis as young male TLR4 knockout mice show increases in cell proliferation and doublecortin positive cells. Whether these effects occur in both sexes and are sustained with normal aging is currently unknown. The present study evaluated whether TLR4 deficiency alters adult hippocampal neurogenesis in young (3–4 months) and aged (18–20 months), male and female, TLR4 deficient (TLR4−/−; B6.B10ScN‐Tlr4lps‐del/JthJ) and wild type (WT) mice. Additionally, neurogenesis within the dorsal and the ventral hippocampal subdivisions was evaluated to determine if TLR4 has differential effects across the hippocampus. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered to quantify new cell survival as well as cell differentiation. Ki‐67 was measured to evaluate cell proliferation. Results show that young TLR4−/− females had higher rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus relative to WT females. Young TLR4−/− males show elevated proliferation and neuronal differentiation mainly in the ventral hippocampus. While young TLR4−/− mice show enhanced neurogenesis compared to young WT mice, the increase was not apparent in the aged TLR4−/− mice. Both aged WT and TLR4−/− mice showed a decrease in proliferation, new cell survival, and neuronal differentiation compared to young WT and TLR4−/− mice. The data collectively indicate that TLR4 regulates hippocampal neurogenesis in young adults, but that these effects are region‐specific in males and that females show broader changes in neurogenesis throughout the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in regenerative medicine is replacing cells lost through injury or disease. While significant progress has been made, much remains unknown about the accuracy of native regenerative programs in cell replacement. Here, we capitalized on the regenerative capacity and stereotypic retinal organization of zebrafish to determine the specificity with which retinal Müller glial cells replace lost neuronal cell types. By utilizing a targeted genetic ablation technique, we restricted death to all or to distinct cone photoreceptor types (red, blue or UV‐sensitive cones), enabling us to compare the composition of cones that are regenerated. We found that Müller glia produce cones of all types upon non‐discriminate ablation of these photoreceptors, or upon selective ablation of red or UV cones. Pan‐ablation of cones led to regeneration of the various cone types in relative abundances that resembled those of non‐ablated controls, i.e. red&amp;gt;green&amp;gt;UV ~ blue cones. Moreover, selective loss of red or UV cones biased production toward the cone type that was ablated. In contrast, ablation of blue cones alone largely failed to induce cone production at all, although it did induce cell division in Müller glia. The failure to produce cones upon selective elimination of blue cones may be due to their low abundance compared to other cone types. Alternatively, it may be that blue cone death alone does not trigger a change in progenitor competency to support cone genesis. Our findings add to the growing notion that cell replacement during regeneration does not perfectly mimic programs of cell generation during development.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing applies insights from neuroscience to uncover
innovations in computing technology. In the brain, billions of interconnected
neurons perform rapid computations at extremely low energy levels by leveraging
properties that are foreign to conventional computing systems, such as temporal
spiking codes and finely parallelized processing units integrating both memory
and computation. Here, we showcase the Pohoiki Springs neuromorphic system, a
mesh of 768 interconnected Loihi chips that collectively implement 100 million
spiking neurons in silicon. We demonstrate a scalable approximate k-nearest
neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for searching large databases that exploits
neuromorphic principles. Compared to state-of-the-art conventional CPU-based
implementations, we achieve superior latency, index build time, and energy
efficiency when evaluated on several standard datasets containing over 1
million high-dimensional patterns. Further, the system supports adding new data
points to the indexed database online in O(1) time unlike all but brute force
conventional k-NN implementations.

 &lt;p&gt;Feedforward Convolutional Neural Networks (ffCNNs) have become
state-of-the-art models both in computer vision and neuroscience. However,
human-like performance of ffCNNs does not necessarily imply human-like
computations. Previous studies have suggested that current ffCNNs do not make
use of global shape information. However, it is currently unclear whether this
reflects fundamental differences between ffCNN and human processing or is
merely an artefact of how ffCNNs are trained. Here, we use visual crowding as a
well-controlled, specific probe to test global shape computations. Our results
provide evidence that ffCNNs cannot produce human-like global shape
computations for principled architectural reasons. We lay out approaches that
may address shortcomings of ffCNNs to provide better models of the human visual
system.

 &lt;p&gt;During the last years our society was often exposed to the coherent
information waves of high amplitudes. These are waves of huge social energy.
Often they are of the destructive character, a kind of information tsunami.
But, they can carry as well positive improvements in the human society, as
waves of decision making matching rational recommendations of societal
institutes. The main distinguishing features of these waves are their high
amplitude, coherence (homogeneous character of social actions generated by
them), and short time needed for their generation and relaxation. Such waves
can be treated as large scale exhibition of the Bandwagon effect. We show that
this socio-psychic phenomenon can be modeled on the basis of the recently
developed {\it social laser theory}. This theory can be used to model {\it
stimulated amplification of coherent social actions}. &quot;Actions&quot; are treated
very generally, from mass protests to votes and other collective decisions, as,
e.g., acceptance (often unconscious) of some societal recommendations. In this
paper, we concentrate on theory of laser resonators, physical vs. social. For
the latter, we analyze in very detail functioning of the internet based
Echo-Chambers. Their main purpose is increasing of the power of the quantum
information field as well as its coherence. Of course, the Bandwagon effect is
well known and well studied in social psychology. However, the social laser
theory gives the possibility to model it by using the general formalism of
quantum field theory. The paper contains minimum of mathematics and it can be
readable by researchers working in psychology, cognitive, social, and political
sciences; it might also be interesting for experts in information theory and
artificial intelligence.

 &lt;p&gt;Evolutionary algorithms are bio-inspired algorithms that can easily adapt to
changing environments. In this paper, we study single- and multi-objective
baseline evolutionary algorithms for the classical knapsack problem where the
capacity of the knapsack varies over time. We establish different benchmark
scenarios where the capacity changes every $\tau$ iterations according to a
uniform or normal distribution. Our experimental investigations analyze the
behavior of our algorithms in terms of the magnitude of changes determined by
parameters of the chosen distribution, the frequency determined by $\tau$, and
the class of knapsack instance under consideration. Our results show that the
multi-objective approaches using a population that caters for dynamic changes
have a clear advantage in many benchmarks scenarios when the frequency of
changes is not too high. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distribution
handling techniques in advance algorithms such as NSGA-II and SPEA2 do not
necessarily result in better performance and even prevent these algorithms from
finding good quality solutions in comparison with simple multi-objective
approaches.

 &lt;p&gt;Recently deep neural networks demonstrate competitive performances in
classification and regression tasks for many temporal or sequential data.
However, it is still hard to understand the classification mechanisms of
temporal deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose two new frameworks to
visualize temporal representations learned from deep neural networks. Given
input data and output, our algorithm interprets the decision of temporal neural
network by extracting highly activated periods and visualizes a sub-sequence of
input data which contributes to activate the units. Furthermore, we
characterize such sub-sequences with clustering and calculate the uncertainty
of the suggested type and actual data. We also suggest Layer-wise Relevance
from the output of a unit, not from the final output, with backward Monte-Carlo
dropout to show the relevance scores of each input point to activate units with
providing a visual representation of the uncertainty about this impact.

 &lt;p&gt;The dynamics of local cortical networks are irregular, but correlated.
Dynamic excitatory--inhibitory balance is a plausible mechanism that generates
such irregular activity, but it remains unclear how balance is achieved and
maintained in plastic neural networks. In particular, it is not fully
understood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in
turn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How does the dynamics
of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does
correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of
weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address
these questions, we develop a general theory of plasticity in balanced
networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity
induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly, but
significantly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain
plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and
synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable
manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the
initial state of the network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also
describe the dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons
receive targeted optogenetic input.

 &lt;p&gt;Recently, AlphaZero has achieved landmark results in deep reinforcement
learning, by providing a single self-play architecture that learned three
different games at super human level. AlphaZero is a large and complicated
system with many parameters, and success requires much compute power and
fine-tuning. Reproducing results in other games is a challenge, and many
researchers are looking for ways to improve results while reducing
computational demands. AlphaZero's design is purely based on self-play and
makes no use of labeled expert data ordomain specific enhancements; it is
designed to learn from scratch. We propose a novel approach to deal with this
cold-start problem by employing simple search enhancements at the beginning
phase of self-play training, namely Rollout, Rapid Action Value Estimate (RAVE)
and dynamically weighted combinations of these with the neural network, and
Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms (RHEA). Our experiments indicate that
most of these enhancements improve the performance of their baseline player in
three different (small) board games, with especially RAVE based variants
playing strongly.

 &lt;p&gt;Monitoring the technical condition of infrastructure is a crucial element to
its maintenance. Currently, the applied methods are outdated, labour intensive
and highly inaccurate. At the same time, the latest methods using Artificial
Intelligence techniques, despite achieving satisfactory results in the
detection of infrastructure damage, are severely limited in their application
due to two main factors - labour-intensive gathering of new datasets and high
demand for computing power. In the presented work, we propose to utilize
Transfer Learning techniques and computer vision to overcome these limiting
factor and fully harness the advantages of Artificial Intelligence methods. We
describe a framework which enables hassle-free development of unique
infrastructure defects detectors on digital images, achieving the accuracy of
above 90%. The framework supports semi-automatic creation of new datasets and
has modest computing power requirements. It is implemented in the form of a
ready-to-use software package distributed under an open software licence and
available for the public. Thus, it can be used to immediately implement the
methods proposed in this paper in the process of infrastructure management by
government units, regardless of their financial capabilities. With the help of
introduced framework it is possible to improve the efficiency of infrastructure
management and the quality of its life cycle documentation globally, leading to
a more accurate mapping of the processes taking place in the infrastructure's
life cycle for better infrastructure planning in the future.

 &lt;p&gt;In real-world applications, many optimization problems have the time-linkage
property, that is, the objective function value relies on the current solution
as well as the historical solutions. Although the rigorous theoretical analysis
on evolutionary algorithms has rapidly developed in recent two decades, it
remains an open problem to theoretically understand the behaviors of
evolutionary algorithms on time-linkage problems. This paper starts the first
step to rigorously analyze evolutionary algorithms for time-linkage functions.
Based on the basic OneMax function, we propose a time-linkage function where
the first bit value of the last time step is integrated but has a different
preference from the current first bit. We prove that with probability $1-o(1)$,
randomized local search and \oea cannot find the optimum, and with probability
$1-o(1)$, $(\mu+1)$ EA is able to reach the optimum.

 &lt;p&gt;Evolving Counter-Propagation Neuro-Controllers (CPNCs), rather than the
traditional Feed-Forward Neuro-Controllers (FFNCs), has recently been suggested
and tested using simulated robot navigation. It has been demon-strated that
both convergence rate and final performance obtained by evolving CPNCs are
superior to those obtained by evolving FFNCs. In this paper the maze
generalization features of both types of evolved navigation controllers are
examined. For this purpose the controllers are tested in an environment that
drastically differs from the one used for their training. Moreover, a
comparison is carried out of results obtained by single-objective and
multi-objective evolution approaches. Using a simulated case-study, the maze
generalization capability of the evolved CPNCs is highlighted in both the
single and multi-objective cases. In contrast, the evolved FFNCs are found to

 &lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for solving
knapsack problem. The proposed method consists of a state aggregation step
based on tabular reinforcement learning to extract features and construct
states. The state aggregation policy is applied to each problem instance of the
knapsack problem, which is used with Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) algorithm to
train a policy through which the items are sequentially selected at each time
step. The method is a constructive solution approach and the process of
selecting items is repeated until the final solution is obtained. The
experiments show that our approach provides close to optimal solutions for all
tested instances, outperforms the greedy algorithm, and is able to handle
larger instances and more flexible than an existing DRL approach. In addition,
the results demonstrate that the proposed model with the state aggregation
strategy not only gives better solutions but also learns in less timesteps,
than the one without state aggregation.

 &lt;p&gt;Many real-world optimisation problems involve dynamic and stochastic
components. While problems with multiple interacting components are omnipresent
in inherently dynamic domains like supply-chain optimisation and logistics,
most research on dynamic problems focuses on single-component problems. With
this article, we define a number of scenarios based on the Travelling Thief
Problem to enable research on the effect of dynamic changes to sub-components.
Our investigations of 72 scenarios and seven algorithms show that -- depending
on the instance, the magnitude of the change, and the algorithms in the
portfolio -- it is preferable to either restart the optimisation from scratch
or to continue with the previously valid solutions.

 &lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the possibility to run advanced AI on embedded systems allows
natural interaction between humans and machines, especially in the automotive
field. We present a custom portable EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
that exploits Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) induced with an oddball
experimental paradigm to control the infotainment menu of a car. A preliminary
evaluation of the system was performed on 10 participants in a standard
laboratory setting and while driving on a closed private track. The task
consisted of repeated presentations of 6 different menu icons in oddball
fashion. Subject-specific models were trained with different machine learning
approaches on cerebral data from either only laboratory or driving experiments
(in-lab and in-car models) or a combination of the two (hybrid model) to
classify EEG responses to target and non-target stimuli. All models were tested
on the subjects' last in-car sessions that were not used for the training.
Analysis of ERPs amplitude showed statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05)
differences between the EEG responses associated with target and non-target
icons, both in the laboratory and while driving. Classification Accuracy (CA)
was above chance level for all subjects in all training configurations, with a
deep CNN trained on the hybrid set achieving the highest scores (mean CA = 53
$\pm$ 12 %, with 16 % chance level for the 6-class discrimination). The ranking
of the features importance provided by a classical BCI approach suggests an
ERP-based discrimination between target and non-target responses. No
statistical differences were observed between the CAs for the in-lab and in-car
training sets, nor between the EEG responses in these conditions, indicating
that the data collected in the standard laboratory setting could be readily
used for a real driving application without a noticeable decrease in
performance.

 &lt;p&gt;Brain metabolic DNA (BMD) is continuously synthesized by reverse transcription in presynaptic synaptosomes and astroglia, and is partly transferred to nuclei after acquiring the double stranded configuration. Synthesis and turnover of BMD are markedly dependent on brain activity, as shown by circadian oscillations, environmental enrichment and impoverishment, and a variety of learning protocols. In rodents learning a two-way active avoidance task, BMD synthesis doubles, thus raising the possibility that sequences of learning BMD may differ from control BMD. The hypothesis has now been examined by sequencing cytoplasmic BMD. The present data indicate that most high-quality mapped BMD fragments hosting more than seven sequences are present in all mice. Three of them are exclusively present in learning BMD and four in control BMD. In addition, the annotated genes closest to them are mostly involved in modulating synaptic activity. The data support the conclusion that learning BMD sequences encode brain responses to the modified environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Opioid analgesics represent a critical treatment for chronic pain in the analgesic ladder of the World Health Organization. However, their use can result in a number of unwanted side-effects including incomplete efficacy, constipation, physical dependence, and overdose liability. Cannabinoids enhance the pain-relieving effects of opioids in preclinical studies and dampen unwanted side-effects resulting from excessive opioid intake. We recently reported that a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; positive allosteric modulator (PAM) exhibits antinociceptive efficacy in models of pathological pain and lacks the adverse side effects of direct CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. In the present study, we evaluated whether a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PAM would enhance morphine’s therapeutic efficacy in an animal model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and characterized its impact on unwanted side-effects associated with chronic opioid administration. In paclitaxel-treated mice, both the CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PAM GAT211 and the opioid analgesic morphine reduced paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivities to mechanical and cold stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Isobolographic analysis revealed that combinations of GAT211 and morphine resulted in anti-allodynic synergism. In paclitaxel-treated mice, a sub-threshold dose of GAT211 prevented the development of tolerance to the anti-allodynic effects of morphine over 20 days of once daily dosing. However, GAT211 did not reliably alter somatic withdrawal signs (i.e., jumps, paw tremors) in morphine-dependent neuropathic mice challenged with naloxone. In otherwise naïve mice, GAT211 also prolonged antinociceptive efficacy of morphine in the tail-flick test and reduced the overall right-ward shift in the ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for morphine to produce antinociception in the tail-flick test, consistent with attenuation of morphine tolerance. Pretreatment with GAT211 did not alter somatic signs of μ opioid receptor dependence in mice rendered dependent upon morphine via subcutaneous implantation of a morphine pellet. Moreover, GAT211 did not reliably alter μ-opioid receptor-mediated reward as measured by conditioned place preference to morphine. Our results suggest that a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PAM may be beneficial in enhancing and prolonging the therapeutic properties of opioids while potentially sparing unwanted side-effects (e.g., tolerance) that occur with repeated opioid treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) is a relatively uncommon but important cause of transient ischemic attack and cerebral infarction. The majority of cases of symptomatic ICAO requires surgical treatment. In this study we performed an investigation of the efficacy and safety of hybrid surgery which is a surgical method for symptomatic chronic complete ICAO.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five patients with symptomatic chronic ICAO treated by hybrid surgery from 2016 to 2019 were included. We recorded and analyzed the patients’ clinical characteristics, angiographic data, recanalization rate, complications, and outcomes. Catheter angiography or computed tomography angiography was used to assess the patency of the recanalized ICA during follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The total success rate of recanalization was 78.2% (43/55). The occlusions were significantly shorter in the success than failure group (5.40 ± 1.50 vs. 7.56 ± 0.99 cm, respectively; P &amp;lt; 0.001). The median duration of ICA occlusion was significantly shorter in the success than failure group (90 vs. 200 days, respectively). The success rates of distal ICA recanalization at the petrous segment or below, cavernous segment, and clinoid segment or above were 100, 33.3, and 14.3%, respectively (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the level of distal ICA reconstitution was the only factor affecting the recanalization success rate. Periprocedural complications included hyperperfusion syndrome (n = 1) and laryngeal nerve injury (n = 1). ICA reocclusion occurred in one patient (2.3%). Significant postoperative improvement in symptoms was observed in the success group, with a median modified Rankin scale score of 0 at the 3-month follow-up compared with before recanalization (median, 1) (P&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Hybrid surgery might be safe and effective for patients with symptomatic chronic complete ICAO. The level of distal ICA reconstitution is a predictor of successful recanalization in hybrid operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The multiple hit hypothesis for Parkinson’s disease (PD) suggests that an interaction between multiple (genetic and/or environmental) risk factors is needed to trigger the pathology. Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is an interesting protein to study in this context and is the focus of this review. More than 15 years of intensive research have identified several cellular pathways in which LRRK2 is involved, yet its exact physiological role or contribution to PD is not completely understood. Pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of PD but most likely require additional triggers to develop PD, as suggested by the reduced penetrance of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. LRRK2 expression is high in immune cells such as monocytes, neutrophils, or dendritic cells, compared to neurons or glial cells and evidence for a role of LRRK2 in the immune system is emerging. This has led to the hypothesis that an inflammatory trigger is needed for pathogenic LRRK2 mutations to induce a PD phenotype. In this review, we will discuss the link between LRRK2 and inflammation and how this could play an active role in PD etiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, with approximately six million people affected worldwide. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) dysfunction has recently become a hot topic in the pathophysiology of PD, and the advent of transgenic mice has also accelerated the development of behavioral studies in animal models. However, there are only a few systematic behavioral tests that embrace abundant motor and non-motor performance in a unique mutant mouse model which correspond to the varied symptoms observed in human PD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the responsibility of the unique reduction of dopamine in the varied motor and non-motor symptoms of PD via a transgenic mice model. We analyzed neurotransmitter concentrations in the brain tissue of 18-month-old mutant mice, with selective inactivation of one allele of Vmat2 in dopaminergic neurons (VMAT2&lt;sup&gt;DATcre&lt;/sup&gt;-HET) to confirm the selective reduction of dopamine, and then examined behavioral functions. Neurochemical tests showed lower dopamine concentrations in specific brain regions of VMAT2&lt;sup&gt;DATcre&lt;/sup&gt;-HET mice, especially the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra and striatum, together with relatively unchanging concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin, demonstrating the dopaminergic specificity of this mouse model. Behavioral tasks showed impairments in several motor functions and major defects in olfactory abilities in the VMAT2&lt;sup&gt;DATcre&lt;/sup&gt;-HET mice. However, no significant changes were found in the majority of non-motor tests, such as emotional performance and sleep patterns. We concluded from this study that the selective inactivation of one allele of the Vmat2 gene in dopaminergic neurons was related to dopamine reduction, resulting in phenotypes resembling some of the major deficits in PD, especially those of motor symptoms and olfactory functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) is perhaps the most widely used brain-imaging technique for pediatric populations. However, EEG signals are prone to distortion by motion. Compared to adults, infants’ motion is both more frequent and less stereotypical yet motion effects on the infant EEG signal are largely undocumented. Here, we present a systematic assessment of naturalistic motion effects on the infant EEG signal. EEG recordings were performed with 14 infants (12 analyzed) who passively watched movies whilst spontaneously producing periods of bodily movement and rest. Each infant produced an average of 38.3 s (SD = 14.7 s) of rest and 18.8 s (SD = 17.9 s) of single motion segments for the final analysis. Five types of infant motions were analyzed: Jaw movements, and Limb movements of the Hand, Arm, Foot, and Leg. Significant movement-related distortions of the EEG signal were detected using cluster-based permutation analysis. This analysis revealed that, relative to resting state, infants’ Jaw and Arm movements produced significant increases in beta (∼15 Hz) power, particularly over peripheral sites. Jaw movements produced more anteriorly located effects than Arm movements, which were most pronounced over posterior parietal and occipital sites. The cluster analysis also revealed trends toward decreased power in the theta and alpha bands observed over central topographies for all motion types. However, given the very limited quantity of infant data in this study, caution is recommended in interpreting these findings before subsequent replications are conducted. Nonetheless, this work is an important first step to inform future development of methods for addressing EEG motion-related artifacts. This work also supports wider use of naturalistic paradigms in social and developmental neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accurate segmentation is an essential task when working with medical images. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks achieved a state-of-the-art performance for many segmentation benchmarks. Regardless of the network architecture, the deep learning-based segmentation methods view the segmentation problem as a supervised task that requires a relatively large number of annotated images. Acquiring a large number of annotated medical images is time consuming, and high-quality segmented images (i.e., strong labels) crafted by human experts are expensive. In this paper, we have proposed a method that achieves competitive accuracy from a “weakly annotated” image where the weak annotation is obtained via a 3D bounding box denoting an object of interest. Our method, called “3D-BoxSup,” employs a positive-unlabeled learning framework to learn segmentation masks from 3D bounding boxes. Specially, we consider the pixels outside of the bounding box as positively labeled data and the pixels inside the bounding box as unlabeled data. Our method can suppress the negative effects of pixels residing between the true segmentation mask and the 3D bounding box and produce accurate segmentation masks. We applied our method to segment a brain tumor. The experimental results on the BraTS 2017 dataset (Menze et al., 2015; Bakas et al., 2017a,b,c) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Augmented reality (AR) enhances the user’s environment by projecting virtual objects into the real world in real-time. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that enable users to control external devices with their brain signals. BCIs can exploit AR technology to interact with the physical and virtual world and to explore new ways of displaying feedback. This is important for users to perceive and regulate their brain activity or shape their communication intentions while operating in the physical world. In this study, twelve healthy participants were introduced to and asked to choose between two motor-imagery tasks: mental drawing and interacting with a virtual cube. Participants first performed a functional localizer run, which was used to select a single fNIRS channel for decoding their intentions in eight subsequent choice-encoding runs. In each run participants were asked to select one choice of a six-item list. A rotating AR cube was displayed on a computer screen as the main stimulus, where each face of the cube was presented for 6 s and represented one choice of the six-item list. For five consecutive trials, participants were instructed to perform the motor-imagery task when the face of the cube that represented their choice was facing them (therewith temporally encoding the selected choice). In the end of each run, participants were provided with the decoded choice based on a joint analysis of all five trials. If the decoded choice was incorrect, an active error-correction procedure was applied by the participant. The choice list provided in each run was based on the decoded choice of the previous run. The experimental design allowed participants to navigate twice through a virtual menu that consisted of four levels if all choices were correctly decoded. Here we demonstrate for the first time that by using AR feedback and flexible choice encoding in form of search trees, we can increase the degrees of freedom of a BCI system. We also show that participants can successfully navigate through a nested menu and achieve a mean accuracy of 74% using a single motor-imagery task and a single fNIRS channel.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Several studies have illustrated that transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) can elicit therapeutic effects that are similar to those produced by its invasive counterpart, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). VNS is an FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of both depression and epilepsy, but it is limited to the management of more severe, intervention-resistant cases as a second or third-line treatment option due to perioperative risks involved with device implantation. In contrast, tVNS is a non-invasive technique that involves the application of electrical currents through surface electrodes at select locations, most commonly targeting the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) and the cervical branch of the vagus nerve in the neck. Although it has been shown that tVNS elicits hypo- and hyperactivation in various regions of the brain associated with anxiety and mood regulation, the mechanism of action and influence of stimulation parameters on clinical outcomes remains predominantly hypothetical. Suppositions are largely based on correlations between the neurobiology of the vagus nerve and its effects on neural activity. However, tVNS has also been investigated for several other disorders, including tinnitus, migraine and pain, by targeting the vagus nerve at sites in both the ear and the neck. As most of the described methods differ in the parameters and protocols applied, there is currently no firm evidence on the optimal location for tVNS or the stimulation parameters that provide the greatest therapeutic effects for a specific condition. This review presents the current status of tVNS with a focus on stimulation parameters, stimulation sites, and available devices. For tVNS to reach its full potential as a non-invasive and clinically relevant therapy, it is imperative that systematic studies be undertaken to reveal the mechanism of action and optimal stimulation modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Quantitative assessment of tissue microstructure is important in studying human brain diseases and disorders. Ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data obtained using a multi-echo gradient echo sequence have been shown to contain information on myelin, axonal, and extracellular compartments in tissue. Quantitative assessment of water fraction, relaxation time (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*), and frequency shift using multi-compartment models has been shown to be useful in studying white matter properties via specific tissue parameters. It remains unclear how tissue parameters vary with model selection based on 7T multiple echo time gradient-recalled echo (GRE) MRI data. We applied existing signal compartment models to the corpus callosum and investigated whether a three-compartment model can be reduced to two compartments and still resolve white matter parameters [i.e., myelin water fraction (MWF) and g-ratio]. We show that MWF should be computed using a three-compartment model in the corpus callosum, and the g-ratios obtained using three compartment models are consistent with previous reports. We provide results for other parameters, such as signal compartment frequency shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The sliding-window-based dynamic functional connectivity networks (D-FCNs) derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are effective methods for diagnosing various neurological diseases, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, traditional D-FCNs are low-order networks based on pairwise correlation between brain regions, thus overlooking high-level interactions across multiple regions of interest (ROIs). Moreover, D-FCNs suffer from the temporal mismatching issue, i.e., subnetworks in the same temporal window do not have temporal correspondence across different subjects. To address the above problems, we first construct a novel high-order D-FCNs based on the principle of “correlation’s correlation” to further explore the higher level and more complex interaction relationships among multiple ROIs. Furthermore, we propose to use a central-moment method to extract temporal-invariance properties contained in either low- or high-order D-FCNs. Finally, we design and train an ensemble classifier by fusing the features extracted from conventional FCN, low-order D-FCNs, and high-order D-FCNs for the diagnosis of ASD and normal control subjects. Our method achieved the best ASD classification accuracy (83%), and our results revealed the features extracted from different networks fingerprinting the autistic brain at different connectional levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Non-human primate models are widely used in studying the brain mechanism underlying brain development, cognitive functions, and psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, play an important role in the examinations of brain structure and functions. As an indispensable tool for brain imaging data analysis, brain atlases have been extensively investigated, and a variety of versions constructed. These atlases diverge in the criteria based on which they are plotted. The criteria range from cytoarchitectonic features, neurotransmitter receptor distributions, myelination fingerprints, and transcriptomic patterns to structural and functional connectomic profiles. Among them, brainnetome atlas is tightly related to brain connectome information and built by parcellating the brain on the basis of the anatomical connectivity profiles derived from structural neuroimaging data. The pipeline for building the brainnetome atlas has been published as a toolbox named ATPP (A Pipeline for Automatic Tractography-Based Brain Parcellation). In this paper, we present a variation of ATPP, which is dedicated to monkey brain parcellation, to address the significant differences in the process between the two species. The new toolbox, MonkeyCBP, has major alterations in three aspects: brain extraction, image registration, and validity indices. By parcellating two different brain regions (posterior cingulate cortex) and (frontal pole) of the rhesus monkey, we demonstrate the efficacy of these alterations. The toolbox has been made public (https://github.com/bheAI/MonkeyCBP_CLI, https://github.com/bheAI/MonkeyCBP_GUI). It is expected that the toolbox can benefit the non-human primate neuroimaging community with high-throughput computation and low labor involvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Acoustic therapy in tinnitus treatment is poorly characterized, and efficacy assessment depends on subjective descriptions. Narrow-band noise, notched sound, and white noise have positive therapeutic effects on monotonous tinnitus. Considering the tonotopic characteristics of the auditory system and the spectral characteristics of these three masking sounds, the activation pattern of the auditory cortex and the mechanism of inhibiting tinnitus may be different. This study aimed to compare the activation patterns of three spectrally different masking noises and study the correlation between the masking effects and variational amplitude of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) in the corresponding cortical regions. We also assessed near-infrared spectroscopy brain function imaging (NIRS) as an objective assessment tool in acoustic therapy. Patients with persistent non-pulsatile tinnitus and control volunteers without tinnitus were enrolled in this study. The subjects were seated in a sound-proof room, with two optode arrays covering the bilateral temporal lobe. Auditory stimuli were presented; stimulation sequences followed the block design: different noises appeared randomly and repeated in five cycles. Tinnitus match and residual inhibition were performed in the tinnitus group. The data analyses were conducted using the NIRS_SPM toolbox. The group analysis results showed that the narrow-band noise caused a marginally significant decrease in HbO signal in the Brodmann 21 region (BA21), while white noise caused a significant increase in HbO signal in BA21. Notched sound did not cause significant changes in the HbO signal in the temporal cortex. And none of the three masking noises caused significant changes in the HbR signal in the temporal cortex. The depth of residual inhibition induced by the narrow-band noise and white noise significantly correlated with ΔHbO in the region of interest (ROI). However, neither the depth nor duration of the residual inhibition induced by notched sound correlated with the ΔHbO. Thus, NIRS showed three cortical activation patterns induced by three different masking noises, and correlations between residual inhibition effects and change of HbO amplitude were found. NIRS could therefore be applied in objective assessment of acoustic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology aims to address the limitations, such as stimulation-induced side effects, by delivering selective, focal modulation via segmented contacts. However, DBS programming becomes more complex and time-consuming for clinical feasibility. Local field potentials (LFPs) might serve a functional role in guiding clinical programming.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;In this pilot study, we investigated the spectral dynamics of directional LFPs in subthalamic nucleus (STN) and their relationship to motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recorded intraoperative STN-LFPs from 8-contact leads (Infinity-6172, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, United States) in 8 PD patients at rest. Directional LFPs were referenced to their common average and time-frequency analysis was computed using a modified Welch periodogram method. The beta band (13–35 Hz) features were extracted and their correlation to preoperative UPDRS-III scores were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Normalized beta power (13–20 Hz) and normalized peak power (13–35 Hz) were found to be higher in anterior direction despite lack of statistical significance (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Results of the Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated positive trends with bradykinesia/rigidity in dorsoanterior direction (r = 0.659, p = 0.087) and with axial scores in the dorsomedial direction (r = 0.812, p = 0.072).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Given that testing all possible combinations of contact pairs and stimulation parameters is not feasible in a single clinic visit, spatio-spectral LFP dynamics obtained from intraoperative recordings might be used as an initial marker to select optimal contact(s).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: This study evaluated the bibliometric data of the most common publication types of the neuroimaging literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed was searched to identify all published papers with “neuroimaging” as their MeSH Major Topics, and they were further searched by the following publication types: case report, clinical trial, comparative study, editorial, evaluation study, guideline, meta-analysis, multicenter study, randomized controlled trial, review, technical report, and validation study. The proportion of papers belonging to each publication type published in neuroimaging journals was calculated. Year-adjusted mean citation counts for each publication type were computed using data from Web of Science. Publication trend and its correlation with citation performance were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Review and comparative study were the most common publication types. Publication types with the highest proportion in neuroimaging journals were guideline, validation study, and technical reports. Since the year 2000, multicenter study, review, and meta-analysis showed the strongest linear increase in annual publication count. These publication types also had the highest year-adjusted citation counts (4.7–10.0). Publication types with the lowest year-adjusted citation counts were editorial and case report (0.5–1.0). It was estimated that 12.5% of the publications labeled as case reports were incorrectly labeled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Neuroimaging literature has been expanding with papers of higher levels of evidence, such as meta-analyses, multicenter studies, and randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Beyond normal and non-imitative singing, the imitation of the timbre of another singer’s voice, such as in Karaoke singing, involves the demanding reproduction of voice quality features and strongly depends on singing experience and practice. We show that precise voice imitation in a highly proficient and experienced vocal imitator, even in the absence of external auditory voice feedback, largely drew on internal cortico-subcortical auditory resources to control voicing errors based on imagined voice performance. Compared to the experienced vocal imitator, singers of a control group without experience in voice imitation used only sensorimotor feedback and demanding monitoring resources for imitation in the absence of voice feedback, a neural strategy that led, however, to a significantly poorer vocal performance. Thus, only long-term vocal imitation experience allows for the additional use of internal auditory brain resources, which result from training-induced brain plasticity, and which enable accurate vocal performance even under difficult performance conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Dyslexia is a reading disorder characterized by significant difficulty in reading, as well as reports of altered executive functions (EF). Children with reading difficulties (RD) experience a broad range of social and emotional problems. Recently it was suggested that children with RD have altered functional connections within the amygdala, which is related to emotional processing. Altered brain laterality related to reading was previously reported in children with RD. Hence, we sought to determine the differences in functional connectivity between the right and left emotional network as related to emotional challenges and the other reported difficulties in reading and EF in children with RD compared to typical readers.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Sixty-four 8 to 12 year old children, 27 children with RD and 37 age-matched typical readers, participated in the study. Reading, emotional, and EF abilities were assessed. Global efficiency of the emotional network was calculated and compared between the groups, and left vs. right functional connectivity of the amygdala was tested using the CONN toolbox. Functional connectivity measures were then associated with measures of reading, emotional, and EF abilities.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Children with RD showed significantly decreased emotional and EF abilities compared to typical readers. A negative correlation between reading, emotional, and EF abilities was determined in both groups. Neuroimaging results showed decreased global efficiency measures within the emotional network in children with RD, who also showed lower functional connectivity between the amygdala and the left and right frontal pole regions. Results also indicated increased functional connectivity of the right vs. left amygdala with left and right pre-central and post-central gyri regions, which were related to decreased reading, emotional, and EF abilities in both typical readers and children with RD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The positive relationship between EF and emotional abilities in children with RD strengthens the relationship between EF difficulties and emotional stress, which in turn may lower EF abilities (monitoring, inhibition, and attention) as well as decreased reading abilities. The emotional challenges in children with RD were associated with decreased functional connectivity of the left amygdala with pre/post central gyrus and cognitive-control regions. These findings suggest that although the right hemisphere is thought to be related to emotional stress, it was the decreased control of the left hemisphere that was related to emotional disturbance in children with RD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the peripherin-2 gene (PRPH2, also known as rds) cause a heterogeneous range of autosomal dominant retinal diseases. PRPH2 encodes a photoreceptor-specific tetraspanin protein, PRPH2, that is a main structural component of the photoreceptor outer segment. PRPH2 distributes to the rims of outer segment disc membranes as they undergo the process of disc membrane enclosure. Within these rims, PRPH2 exists in homo-oligomeric form or as a hetero-oligomer with another tetraspanin protein, ROM1. While complete loss of PRPH2 prevents photoreceptor outer segment formation, mutations affecting the state of its oligomerization, including C150S, C213Y and Y141C, produce outer segment structural defects. In this study, we addressed whether any of these mutations also affect disc enclosure. We employed recently developed methodology for ultrastructural analysis of the retina, involving tissue processing with tannic acid, to assess the status of disc enclosure in knockin mouse models bearing either one or two alleles of the C150S, C213Y and Y141C PRPH2 mutations. While varying degrees of outer segment structural abnormalities were observed in each of these mouse models, they contained both newly forming “open” discs and mature “enclosed” discs. These data demonstrate that normal PRPH2 oligomerization is not essential for photoreceptor disc enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitability contributes to rhythm generation in central pattern generating networks (CPGs). In spinal cord CPGs, such intrinsic excitability partly relies on persistent sodium currents (I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt;), whereas respiratory CPGs additionally depend on calcium-activated cation currents (I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt;). Here, we investigated the contributions of I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; to spontaneous rhythm generation in neuronal networks of the spinal cord and whether they mainly involve Hb9 neurons. We used cultures of ventral and transverse slices from the E13–14 embryonic rodent lumbar spinal cord on multielectrode arrays (MEAs). All cultures showed spontaneous bursts of network activity. Blocking synaptic excitation with the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX suppressed spontaneous network bursts and left asynchronous intrinsic activity at about 30% of the electrodes. Such intrinsic activity was completely blocked at all electrodes by both the I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; blocker riluzole as well as by the I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; blocker flufenamic acid (FFA) and the more specific TRPM4 channel antagonist 9-phenanthrol. All three antagonists also suppressed spontaneous bursting completely and strongly reduced stimulus-evoked bursts. Also, FFA reduced repetitive spiking that was induced in single neurons by injection of depolarizing current pulses to few spikes. Other antagonists of unspecific cation currents or calcium currents had no suppressing effects on either intrinsic activity (gadolinium chloride) or spontaneous bursting (the TRPC channel antagonists clemizole and ML204 and the T channel antagonist TTA-P2). Combined patch-clamp and MEA recordings showed that Hb9 interneurons were activated by network bursts but could not initiate them. Together these findings suggest that both I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; through Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels and I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; through putative TRPM4 channels contribute to spontaneous intrinsic and repetitive spiking in spinal cord neurons and thereby to the generation of network bursts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;In this study, we assessed plasma biomarkers to identify cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients by applying ultra-sensitive immunomagnetic reduction-based immunoassay (IMR).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 60 PD patients and 28 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Complete cognitive function assessments were performed on participants using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating. PD patients with an MMSE score of ≦26 were defined as having cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, a 99mTc-TRODAT-1 scan was performed and plasma levels of Aβ-40, Aβ-42, T-tau, and α-synuclein were evaluated using IMR, subsequent correlation analyses were then performed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with normal adults, PD patients have higher plasma levels of α-synuclein and T-tau, and a lower level of Aβ-40 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Plasma levels of α-synuclein (r = −0.323, p = 0.002), Aβ-40 (r = 0.276, p = 0.01), and T-tau (r = −0.322, p = 0.002) are significantly correlated with MMSE scores. The TRODAT scan results, including visual inspection and quantification, revealed significant correlations between Aβ-40 and PD. Multiple regression analysis showed that the plasma levels of Aβ-40 (OR = 0.921, 95% CI = 0.879–0.962), α-synuclein (OR = 3.016, 95% CI = 1.703–5.339), and T-tau (OR = 1.069, 95% CI = 1.026–1.115) were independently associated with PD patients with cognitive impairment. The cutoff values for predicting cognitive deficits in PD patients were 45.101 pg/ml of Aβ-40, (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.791), 0.389 pg/ml of α-synuclein, (AUC = 0.790), and 30.555 pg/ml of T-tau (AUC = 0.726).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Plasma levels of α-synuclein, Aβ-40, and T-tau are potential biomarkers to detect cognitive impairment in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Physical activity closely relates to cognition and brain structure as we age. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship in humans remain less clear. Functional connectivity (FC), measured by task-free functional MRI (tf-fMRI) is a dynamic marker of network activity and may be a sensitive indicator of the brain’s response to exercise over time. We aimed to test the longitudinal relationship between physical activity and FC trajectories in functionally normal older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Two hundred and twelve functionally normal, longitudinally-followed older adults completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and tf-fMRI scans at each visit [mean = 1.5 visits (range:1–3)]. We studied FC of the default mode network (DMN), frontal-parietal (FP), subcortical networks (SubCort), and frontal-subcortical inter-network connectivity (FS), given that previous studies implicate these regions in age-related changes. Linear mixed-effects models examined the relationship between within-person changes in PASE and FC (in SD units), covarying for age, sex, education and systemic cardiovascular risk factors (heart rate, BMI and systolic blood pressure). We additionally examined models covarying for DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of tracts underlying networks of interest, as a marker of cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, we examined the longitudinal relationship between PASE and neuropsychological trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In our first model, within-subject increases in physical activity tracked with increasing SubCort (β = 0.33, p = 0.007) and FS inter-network (β = 0.27, p = 0.03) synchrony, while between-subject parameters did not reach significance (β = −0.042 to −0.07, ps &amp;gt; 0.37). No significant longitudinal associations were observed between PASE and DMN (β = −0.02 p = 0.89) or FP networks (β = 0.15, p = 0.23). Adjusting for markers of cerebrovascular health (FA/MD) did not change estimated effects (SubCort: β = 0.31, p = 0.01, FS inter-network: β = 0.28, p = 0.03). Associations between changes in physical activity and neuropsychological trajectories were small (β = −0.14 to 0.002) and did not reach statistical significance (p-values &amp;gt;0.42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings suggest that changes in exercise over time are specifically associated with frontal-subcortical processes in older adults. This relationship appears to be independent of cardio- or cerebrovascular disease, possibly driven by a more direct neural response to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is an important risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms that relate these disorders are still unknown. As a proxy of this relationship, we studied the structural brain changes associated with functional impairment in activities of daily living in subjects with age related hearing loss, or presbycusis. One hundred eleven independent, non-demented subjects older than 65 years recruited in the ANDES cohort were evaluated using a combined approach including (i) audiological tests: hearing thresholds and cochlear function measured by pure tone averages and the distortion product otoacoustic emissions respectively; (ii) behavioral variables: cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and functional impairment in activities of daily living measured by validated questionnaires; and (iii) structural brain imaging—assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. The mean age of the recruited subjects (69 females) was 73.95 ± 5.47 years (mean ± SD) with an average educational level of 9.44 ± 4.2 years of schooling. According to the audiometric hearing thresholds and presence of otoacoustic emissions, we studied three groups: controls with normal hearing (n = 36), presbycusis with preserved cochlear function (n = 33), and presbycusis with cochlear dysfunction (n = 38). We found a significant association (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.17) between the number of detected otoacoustic emissions and apathy symptoms. The presbycusis with cochlear dysfunction group had worse performance than controls in global cognition, language and executive functions, and severe apathy symptoms than the other groups. The neuropsychiatric symptoms and language deficits were the main determinants of functional impairment in both groups of subjects with presbycusis. Atrophy of insula, amygdala, and other temporal areas were related with functional impairment, apathy, and language deficits in the presbycusis with cochlear dysfunction group. We conclude that (i) the neuropsychiatric symptoms had a major effect on functional loss in subjects with presbycusis, (ii) cochlear dysfunction is relevant for the association between hearing loss and behavioral impairment, and (iii) atrophy of the insula and amygdala among other temporal areas are related with hearing loss and behavioral impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Freezing phenomenon is a striking feature of Parkinson’s disease. However, it has never been studied in people with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We designed a freezing of speech single questionnaire (FOSSQ) and investigated the frequency and association of freezing of speech (FOS) in patients with DLB and other types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective analysis of data from the project of history-based artificial intelligent computerized dementia diagnostic system. We compared the frequencies of FOS among non-demented (ND) participants, patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and DLB. Further, we explored the association factors of FOS in all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 666 individuals with the following disease distribution: 190, ND; 230, AD; 183, VaD; and 63, DLB. Compared to individuals with ND (2.1%), patients with AD (6.1%), or VaD (18.0%), DLB (54.0%) showed a significantly higher frequency of positive FOS (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). The association factors of FOS were older age, more severe dementia, more severe motor dysfunction, fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, attention, mental manipulation, and language.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that the informant-based FOSSQ may be a practical screening tool for discriminating DLB from individuals with ND or other forms of dementia. The FOSSQ can be applied in clinical practice as well as on the artificial intelligent platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 A key challenge in precise genome editing is the low efficiency of homology-directed repair (HDR). Here we describe a strategy for increasing the efficiency of HDR in cells by using a chromatin donor template instead of a naked DNA donor template. The use of chromatin, which is the natural form of DNA in the nucleus, increases the frequency of HDR-edited clones as well as homozygous editing. In addition, transfection of chromatin results in negligible cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that a chromatin donor template should be useful for a wide range of HDR applications such as the precise insertion or replacement of DNA fragments that contain the coding regions of genes.</content>

 Rett Syndrome is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from mutations in the gene &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;. Mutations of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2 &lt;/i&gt;restricted to GABAergic cell types largely replicate the behavioral phenotypes associated with mouse models of Rett Syndrome, suggesting a pathophysiological role for inhibitory interneurons. Recent work has suggested that vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons may play a critical role in the proper development and function of cortical circuits, making them a potentially key point of vulnerability in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, little is known about the role of VIP interneurons in Rett Syndrome. Here we find that loss of MeCP2 specifically from VIP interneurons replicates key neural and behavioral phenotypes observed following global &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; loss of function.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3) is a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable non-selective cation channel activated by heat and chemical agonists such as pregnenolone sulfate and CIM0216. TRPM3 mutations in humans were recently reported to be associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy; the functional effects of those mutations however were not reported. Here we show that both disease-associated mutations in the human TRPM3 render the channel overactive, but likely via different mechanisms. The Val to Met substitution in the S4-S5 loop induced a larger increase in basal activity and agonist sensitivity at room temperature than the Pro to Gln substitution in the extracellular segment of S6. In contrast, heat activation was increased more by the S6 mutant than by the S4-S5 segment mutant. Both mutants were inhibited by the TRPM3 antagonist primidone, suggesting a potential therapeutic intervention to treat this disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Synchronous neurotransmitter release is triggered by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding to the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 1, while asynchronous fusion and short-term facilitation is hypothesized to be mediated by plasma membrane-localized Synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7). We generated mutations in Drosophila &lt;i&gt;Syt7 &lt;/i&gt;to determine if it plays a conserved role as the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor for these processes. Electrophysiology and quantal imaging revealed evoked release was elevated 2-fold. &lt;i&gt;Syt7&lt;/i&gt; mutants also had a larger pool of readily-releasable vesicles, faster recovery following stimulation, and intact facilitation. &lt;i&gt;Syt1/Syt7&lt;/i&gt; double mutants displayed more release than &lt;i&gt;Syt1 &lt;/i&gt;mutants alone, indicating SYT7 does not mediate the residual asynchronous release remaining in the absence of SYT1. SYT7 localizes to an internal membrane tubular network within the peri-active zone, but does not enrich at active zones. These findings indicate the two Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor model of SYT1 and SYT7 mediating all phases of neurotransmitter release and facilitation is not applicable at Drosophila synapses.</content>

 Periodontal disease is an age-associated disorder clinically defined by periodontal bone loss, inflammation of the specialized tissues that surround and support the tooth, and microbiome dysbiosis. Currently, there is no therapy for reversing periodontal disease, and treatment is generally restricted to preventive measures or tooth extraction. The FDA-approved drug rapamycin slows aging and extends lifespan in multiple organisms, including mice. Here we demonstrate that short-term treatment with rapamycin rejuvenates the aged oral cavity of elderly mice, including regeneration of periodontal bone, attenuation of gingival and periodontal bone inflammation, and revertive shift of the oral microbiome toward a more youthful composition. This provides a geroscience strategy to potentially rejuvenate oral health and reverse periodontal disease in the elderly.</content>

 Although the cerebellum is traditionally associated with balance and motor function, it also plays wider roles in affective and cognitive behaviors. Evidence suggests that the cerebellar vermis may regulate aggressive behavior, though the cerebellar circuits and patterns of activity that influence aggression remain unclear. We used optogenetic methods to bidirectionally modulate the activity of spatially-delineated cerebellar Purkinje cells to evaluate the impact on aggression in mice. Increasing Purkinje cell activity in the vermis significantly reduced the frequency of attacks in a resident-intruder assay. Reduced aggression was not a consequence of impaired motor function, because optogenetic stimulation did not alter motor performance. In complementary experiments, optogenetic inhibition of Purkinje cells in the vermis increased the frequency of attacks. These results suggest Purkinje cell activity in the cerebellar vermis regulates aggression, and further support the importance of the cerebellum in driving affective behaviors that could contribute to neurological disorders.</content>

 From the northernmost tip of Scandinavia to the southernmost corner of Patagonia, and across six continents, house sparrows (&lt;i&gt;Passer domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) inhabit most human-modified habitats of the globe. With over 7,000 articles published, the species has become a workhorse for not only the study of self-urbanized wildlife, but also for understanding life history and body size evolution, sexual selection and many other biological phenomena. Traditionally, house sparrows were studied for their adaptations to local biotic and climatic conditions, but more recently, the species has come to serve as a focus for studies seeking to reveal the genomic, epigenetic and physiological underpinnings of success among invasive vertebrate species. Here, we review the natural history of house sparrows, highlight what the study of these birds has meant to bioscience generally, and describe the many resources available for future work on this species.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Malaria-071, a controlled human malaria infection trial, demonstrated that administration of three doses of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine given at one month intervals was inferior to a delayed fractional dose (DFD) schedule (62.5% vs 86.7% protection respectively). To investigate the underlying immunologic mechanism, we analyzed the B and T peripheral follicular helper cell (pTfh) responses. Here we show that protection in both study arms was associated with early induction of functional IL-21-secreting circumsporozoite (CSP)-specific pTfh cells together with induction of CSP-specific memory B cell responses after the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; dose that persisted after the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; dose. Data integration of key immunologic measures identified a subset of non-protected individuals in the standard (STD) vaccine arm who lost prior protective B cell responses after receiving the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; vaccine dose. We conclude that the DFD regimen favors persistence of functional B cells post 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; dose.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The CLC family comprises H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-coupled exchangers and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels, and mutations causing their dysfunction lead to genetic disorders. The CLC exchangers, unlike canonical 'ping-pong' antiporters, simultaneously bind and translocate substrates through partially congruent pathways. How ions of opposite charge bypass each other while moving through a shared pathway remains unknown. Here, we use MD simulations, biochemical and electrophysiological measurements to identify two conserved phenylalanine residues that form an aromatic pathway whose dynamic rearrangements enable H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; movement outside the Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; pore. These residues are important for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and voltage-dependent gating in the CLC exchangers. The aromatic pathway residues are evolutionarily conserved in CLC channels where their electrostatic properties and conformational flexibility determine gating. We propose that Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; move through physically distinct and evolutionarily conserved routes through the CLC channels and transporters and suggest a unifying mechanism that describes the gating mechanism of both CLC subtypes.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Can a single regulatory sequence be shared by two genes undergoing functional divergence? Here we describe a single promiscuous enhancer within the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Antennapedia Complex, EO053, that directs aspects of the expression of two adjacent genes, &lt;i&gt;pb&lt;/i&gt; (a &lt;i&gt;Hox2&lt;/i&gt; ortholog) and &lt;i&gt;zen2&lt;/i&gt; (a divergent &lt;i&gt;Hox3&lt;/i&gt; paralog), with disparate spatial and temporal expression patterns. We were unable to separate the &lt;i&gt;pb&lt;/i&gt;-like and &lt;i&gt;zen2&lt;/i&gt;-like specificities within EO053, and we identify sequences affecting both expression patterns. Importantly, genomic deletion experiments demonstrate that EO053 cooperates with additional &lt;i&gt;pb&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;zen2&lt;/i&gt;-specific enhancers to regulate the mRNA expression of both genes. We examine sequence conservation of EO053 within the Schizophora, and show that patterns of synteny between the &lt;i&gt;Hox2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hox3&lt;/i&gt; orthologs in Arthropods are consistent with a shared regulatory relationship extending prior to the &lt;i&gt;Hox3/zen&lt;/i&gt; divergence. Thus, EO053 represents an example of two genes having evolved disparate outputs while utilizing this shared regulatory region.</content>

 Codon pair deoptimization is a highly efficient virus attenuation strategy. It involves the recoding of viral genomes using underrepresented codon pairs. Groenke et al. show that suboptimal codon pairs are the primary cause of attenuation because they reduce mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and thus also protein production of recoded genes.</content>

 Sinha et al. examine the role of Pbrm1/polybromo-BAF in mammalian mesenchymal stromal cell osteolineage commitment and hematopoiesis. Osteogenic signals induce Pbrm1/PBAF expression, which in turn orchestrates chromatin remodeling at BmprIβ/TgfβrII loci. These findings reveal an epi-genomic connection to feedforward control of BMP/TGF-β signaling in the mesenchymal stromal microenvironment.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Estimating the extent to which newborn humans process input from their environment, especially regarding the depth of processing, is a challenging question. To approach this problem, we measured brain responses in 20 newborns with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a &quot;local-global&quot; auditory oddball paradigm in which two-levels of hierarchical regularities are presented. Results suggest that infants in the first weeks of life are able to learn hierarchical rules, yet a certain level of vigilance seems to be necessary. Newborns detected violations of the first-order regularity and displayed a mismatch response between 200-400ms. Violations of the second-order regularity only evoked a late response in newborns in an active state, which was expressed by a high heart rate variability. These findings are in line with those obtained in human adults and older infants suggesting a continuity in the functional architecture from term-birth on, despite the important immaturity of the human brain at this age.</content>

 Background: Older persons with poor sleep are more likely to develop neurodegenerative disease, but the causality underlying this association is unclear. To move towards explanation, we examine whether sleep quality and quantity are similarly associated with brain changes across the adult lifespan. Methods: Associations between self-reported sleep parameters (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index;PSQI) and longitudinal cortical change were tested using five samples from the Lifebrain consortium (n=2205, 4363 MRIs, 18-92 years). Analyses were augmented by considering episodic memory change, gene expression from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and amyloid-beta (A{beta}) accumulation (n=1980). Results: PSQI components sleep problems and low sleep quality were related to thinning of the right lateral temporal cortex. The association with sleep problems emerged after 60 years, especially in regions with high expression of genes related to oligodendrocytes and S1 pyramidal neurons. BMI and symptoms of depression had negligible effects. Sleep problems were neither related to longitudinal change in episodic memory function nor to A{beta} accumulation, suggesting that sleep-related cortical changes were independent of AD neuropathology and cognitive decline. Conclusion: Worse self-reported sleep in later adulthood was associated with more cortical thinning in regions of high expression of genes related to oligodendrocytes and S1 pyramidal neurons, but not to A{beta} accumulation or memory decline. The relationship to cortical brain change suggests that self-reported sleep parameters are relevant in lifespan studies, but small effect sizes, except for a few restricted regions, indicate that self-reported sleep is not a good biomarker of general cortical degeneration in healthy older adults.</content>

 To form a coherent representation of the environment, the brain must integrate information across different senses. Such multisensory convergence is widespread at the level of the cortex, where it is thought to arise primarily from corticocortical connections. Much less is known about the role of subcortical circuits in shaping the multisensory properties of cortical neurons. We show that sound-evoked activity in the mouse auditory cortex is widely suppressed by whisker stimulation. This suppression depends on the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), but surprisingly is implemented through a circuit linking S1 and the auditory thalamocortical system via the auditory midbrain. We also show that an additional, direct pathway exists from S1 to the medial sector of auditory thalamus, which facilitates auditory responses in neurons that do not project to the auditory cortex. The thalamus thus occupies a pivotal role in integrating multisensory signals by somatosensory top-down control of auditory subcortical processing.</content>

 Previous studies demonstrated that retinal damage correlates with a massive remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and reactive gliosis. However, the functional significance of the ECM in retinal neurodegeneration is still unknown. In the present study, we used an intraocular pressure (IOP) independent experimental autoimmune glaucoma (EAG) mouse model to examine the role of the ECM glycoprotein tenascin-C (Tnc). Wild type (WT ONA) and Tnc knockout (KO ONA) mice were immunized with an optic nerve antigen (ONA) homogenate and control groups (CO) obtained sodium chloride (WT CO, KO CO). IOP was measured weekly and electroretinographies were recorded at the end of the study. 10 weeks after immunization, we analyzed retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), glial cells and the expression of different cytokines in retina and optic nerve tissue in all four groups. IOP and retinal function was comparable in all groups. Although less severe in KO ONA, WT and KO mice displayed a significant loss of RGCs after immunization. Compared to KO ONA, a significant reduction of {beta}III-tubulin stained axons and oligodendrocyte markers was noted in the optic nerve of WT ONA. In retinal and optic nerve slices, we found an enhanced GFAP+ staining area of astrocytes in immunized WT. In retinal flat-mounts, a significantly higher number of Iba1+ microglia was found in WT ONA, while a lower number of Iba1+ cells was observed in KO ONA. Furthermore, an increased expression of the glial markers Gfap, Iba1, Nos2 and Cd68 was detected in retinal and optic nerve tissue of WT ONA, whereas comparable levels were observed in KO ONA post immunization. In addition, pro-inflammatory Tnfa expression was upregulated in WT ONA, but downregulated in KO ONA. Vice versa, a significantly increased anti-inflammatory Tgfb expression was measured in KO ONA animals. Collectively, this study revealed that Tnc plays an important role in glial and inflammatory response during retinal neurodegeneration. Our results provide evidence that Tnc is involved in glaucomatous damage by regulating retinal glial activation and cytokine release. Thus, this transgenic EAG mouse model offers for the first time the possibility to investigate IOP-independent glaucomatous damage in direct relation to ECM remodeling.</content>

 Here, we provide an analysis of the microsaccades that occurred during continuous visual search and targeting of small faces that we pasted either into cluttered background photos or into a simple gray background. Subjects continuously used their eyes to target singular 3-degree upright or inverted faces in changing scenes. As soon as the participant's gaze reached the target face, a new face was displayed in a different and random location. Regardless of the experimental context (e.g. background scene, no background scene), or target eccentricity (from 4 to 20 degrees of visual angle), we found that the microsaccade rate dropped to near zero levels within only 12 milliseconds after trial onset. There were almost never any microsaccades before the saccade to the face. One subject completed 118 consecutive trials without a single microsaccade. However, in about 20% of the trials, there was a single corrective microsaccade that occurred almost immediately after the preceding saccade's offset. These corrective microsaccades were task oriented because their facial landmark targeting distributions matched those of saccades within both the upright and inverted face conditions. Our findings show that a single feedforward pass through the visual hierarchy for each stimulus is likely all that is needed to effectuate prolonged continuous visual search. In addition, we provide evidence that microsaccades can serve perceptual functions like correcting saccades or effectuating task-oriented goals during continuous visual search.</content>

 Objective: To test the hypothesis that worse self-reported sleep relates to reduced hippocampal integrity as indexed by increased intra-hippocampal water diffusion, and that this relationship is stronger in the presence of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) accumulation, a marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Methods: Two-hundred and fifty-one participants, aged 19-81 years, completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 2 diffusion tensor imaging sessions, on average 3 years apart, allowing estimates of decline in hippocampal microstructural integrity as indexed by increased mean diffusivity (MD). We used the delayed recall from the California Verbal Learning Test to measure memory change. 18F-Flutemetamol PET, in 108 participants above 44 years of age, yielded 23 A{beta} positive cases. Genotyping enabled controlling for APOE {varepsilon}4 status, and polygenic scores for sleep efficiency and AD. Results: Worse global sleep quality and sleep efficiency related to more rapid reduction in hippocampal microstructural integrity over time. Focusing on sleep efficiency, this relationship was stronger in presence of cortical A{beta} accumulation. Sleep efficiency also related to memory decline indirectly via hippocampal integrity decline. The results were not explained by genetic risk for sleep efficiency and AD. Conclusions: Poor self-reported sleep efficiency related to decline in hippocampal integrity, especially in the presence of A{beta} accumulation. Poor sleep and hippocampal microstructural decline may partly explain memory decline in older adults with A{beta} pathology. The relationships were not explained by genetic risk, and poor self-reported sleep efficiency might constitute a risk factor for AD, although the causal mechanisms driving the of observed associations are unknown.</content>

 Regular physical activity/exercise is an effective non-pharmacological treatment for individuals with chronic pain. Central inhibitory mechanisms, involving serotonin and opioids, are critical to analgesia produced by regular physical activity. The RVM sends projections to the spinal cord to inhibit or facilitate nociceptive neurons and plays a key role in exercise-induced analgesia. The goal of these studies was to examine if regular physical activity modifies RVM-spinal cord circuitry. Male and female mice received Fluoro-Gold placed on the spinal cord to identify spinally projecting neurons from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and the nucleus raphe obscuris/nucleus raphe pallidus (NRO/NRP), dermorphin-488 into caudal medulla to identify mu-opioid receptors, and were immunohistochemically stained for either phosphorylated-N-methyl-D-aspartate subunit NR1 (p-NR1) to identify excitatory neurons or tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) to identify serotonin neurons. The percentage of dermorphin-488-positive cells that stained for p-NR1 (or TPH), and the percentage of dermorphin-488-positive cells that stained for p-NR1 (or TPH) and Fluoro-Gold was calculated. Physically active animals were provided running wheels in their cages for 8 weeks and compared to sedentary animals without running wheels. Animals with chronic muscle pain, induced by two intramuscular injections of pH 4.0, were compared to sham controls (pH 7.2). Physically active animals had less mu-opioid expressing neurons projecting to the spinal cord when compared to sedentary animals in the RVM, but not the NRO/NRP. No changes were observed for TPH. These data suggest that regular exercise alters central facilitation so that there is less descending facilitation to result in a net increase in inhibition.</content>

 The oculomotor system keeps the eyes steady in expectation of visual events. Here, recording microsaccades while people performed a tactile (frequency discrimination) task enabled us to test whether the oculomotor system shows an analogous preparatory response for unrelated tactile events. We manipulated the temporal predictability of tactile targets using tactile cues, which preceded the target by either constant (high predictability) or variable (low predictability) time intervals. Microsaccades were inhibited prior to target onset and more so for constant than variable intervals. This microsaccadic inhibition reveals a tight cross-modal link between tactile temporal expectation and oculomotor action. These findings -together with parallel findings in audition- portray oculomotor freezing as a marker of supramodal temporal expectation. Moreover, microsaccades occurring around the tactile target presentation were associated with reduced task performance, suggesting that oculomotor freezing mitigates potential detrimental, concomitant effects of microsaccades and revealing a cross-modal coupling between tactile perception and oculomotor action.</content>

 Astrocytes are the most common glial cell type in the brain, yet, it is still not clear how their activation affects the transcriptome of other brain cells such as microglia and neurons. Engineered G protein-coupled receptors called Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDS) make it possible to selectively activate specific cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes. By combining the selective activation of astrocytes with single cell RNA sequencing, we were able to study transcriptional changes that occur in response to the activation of astrocytes at the single cell level. Interestingly, our data shows that long-term activation of astrocytes in healthy mice results in dramatic alteration in the transcriptome of astrocytes and microglia. Genes that were differentially expressed in these Gq-DREADD-activated astrocytes were involved in neurogenesis and low density lipoprotein particle biology, while those in the microglia were involved in the response to lipoproteins, and the migration and chemotaxis of immune cells. Furthermore, network analysis showed that Gq-DREADD-mediated activation in astrocytes resulted in an upregulation of genes involved in the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and calcium ion homeostasis. This confirmed the activation of astrocytes through the expressed DREADDS. Our findings show the importance of considering the transcriptomic alteration in microglia and neurons after the activation of astrocytes in in vivo models. Therefore, our data will serve as a resource for the broader neuroscience community.</content>

 Correct spatiotemporal distribution of organelles and vesicles is crucial for healthy cell functioning and is regulated by intracellular transport mechanisms. Controlled transport of bulky mitochondria is especially important in polarized cells such as neurons that rely on these organelles to locally produce energy and buffer calcium. Mitochondrial transport requires and depends on microtubules which fill much of the available axonal space. How mitochondrial transport is affected by their position within the microtubule bundles is not known. Here, we found that anterograde transport, driven by kinesin motors, is susceptible to the molecular conformation of tubulin both in vitro and in vivo. Anterograde velocities negatively correlate with the density of elongated tubulin dimers, similar to GTP-tubulin, that are more straight and rigid. The impact of the tubulin conformation depends primarily on where a mitochondrion is positioned, either within or at the rim of microtubule bundle. Increasing elongated tubulin levels lowers the number of motile anterograde mitochondria within the microtubule bundle and increases anterograde transport speed at the microtubule bundle rim. We demonstrate that the increased kinesin step processivity on microtubules consisting of elongated dimers underlies increased mitochondrial dynamics. Our work indicates that the molecular conformation of tubulin controls mitochondrial motility and as such locally regulates the distribution of mitochondria along axons.</content>

 An increase in circulating glucocorticoids (CORT) is an essential part of the response to stress. Sustained elevations of CORT, however, have dramatic consequences on behavior, endocrine systems and peripheral organs. Critically, they dampen the endocrine response to acute challenges and decrease intrinsic excitability of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (CRHPVN), suggesting key circuits may be less responsive to stress. Here, we make the surprising discovery that CRHPVN neurons harness a form of adaptive synaptic scaling to escape the persistent negative feedback pressure from CORT and maintain stable output in vivo. Specifically, there is an increase in glutamatergic drive to these cells that is mediated by a postsynaptic, multiplicative increase in synaptic strength. These findings suggest that dysfunctions associated with chronic stress may not be due to the primary actions of CORT, but instead reflect the emergence of synaptic adaptations as networks seek to re-establish intrinsic activity setpoints.</content>

 Although amyloid beta (A{beta}) deposition is one of the major causes of white matter (WM) alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), little is known about the underlying basis of WM damage and its association with global structural connectivity and network topology. We aimed to dissect the contributions of WM microstructure to structural connectivity and network properties in the ArcA{beta} mice model of A{beta} amyloidosis. We acquired diffusion-weighted images (DWI) of wild type (WT) and ArcA{beta} transgenic (TG) mice using a 9.4 T MRI scanner. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) was performed to measure fiber tract-specific properties. We also performed three complementary experiments; to identify the global differences in structural connectivity, to compute network properties and to measure cellular basis of white matter alterations. Transgenic mice displayed disrupted structural connectivity centered to the entorhinal cortex (EC) and a lower fiber density and fiber bundle cross-section. In addition, there was a reduced network efficiency and degree centrality in weighted structural connectivity in the transgenic mice. To further examine the underlying neuronal basis of connectivity and network deficits, we performed histology experiments. We found no alteration in myelination and an increased level of neurofilament light (NFL) in the brain regions with disrupted connectivity in the TG mice. Furthermore, TG mice had a reduced number of perineuronal nets (PNN) in the EC. The observed FDC reductions may indicate a decrease in axonal diameter or axon count which would explain the basis of connectivity deficits and reduced network efficiency in TG mice. The increase in NFL suggests a breakdown of axonal integrity, which would reduce WM fiber health. Considering the pivotal role of the EC in AD, A{beta} deposition may primarily increase NFL release, damaging PNN in the entorhinal pathway, resulting in disrupted structural connectivity.</content>

 Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neural cultures from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients can reflect disease phenotypes targetable by treatments. However, widely used differentiation protocols produce mixtures of progenitors, neurons, glia, and other cells at various developmental stages and rostrocaudal neural tube segments. Here we present a methodology using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to distinguish cell type expression in C9orf72 ALS, sporadic ALS, control, and genome-edited cultures across multiple subjects, experiments, and commercial platforms. Combinations of HOX and developmental gene expression with global clustering classified rostrocaudal, progenitor, and mantle zone fates. This demonstrated that iPSC-differentiated cells recapitulate fetal hindbrain and spinal cord development and resolved early, reproducible, and motor neuron-specific signatures of familial and sporadic ALS. This includes downregulated ELAVL3 expression, which persists into disease endstages. Single-cell analysis thus yielded predictive ALS markers in other human and mouse models which were otherwise undiscovered through bulk omics assays.</content>

 Neuromodulators promote adaptive behaviors in response to either environmental or internal physiological changes. These responses are often complex and may involve concerted activity changes across circuits that are not physically connected. It is not well understood how neuromodulatory systems act across circuits to elicit complex behavioral responses. Here we show that the C. elegans NLP-12 neuropeptide system, related to the mammalian cholecystokinin system, shapes responses to food availability by selectively modulating the activity of head and body wall motor neurons. NLP-12 modulation of the head and body wall motor circuits is generated through conditional involvement of alternate GPCR targets. The CKR-1 GPCR is highly expressed in the head motor circuit, and functions to enhance head bending and increase trajectory reorientations during local food searching, primarily through stimulatory actions on SMD head motor neurons. In contrast, NLP-12 activation of CKR-1 and CKR-2 GPCRs regulates body bending under basal conditions, primarily through actions on body wall motor neurons. Thus, locomotor responses to changing environmental conditions emerge from conditional NLP-12 stimulation of head or body wall motor neuron targets.</content>

 Neuronal activity and gene expression in response to the loss of sleep can provide a window into the enigma of sleep function. Sleep loss is associated with brain differential gene expression, an increase in pyramidal cell mEPSC frequency and amplitude, and a characteristic rebound and resolution of slow wave sleep-slow wave activity (SWS-SWA). However, the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the sleep loss response are not well understood. We show that sleep-loss regulates MEF2C phosphorylation, a key mechanism regulating MEF2C transcriptional activity, and that MEF2C function in postnatal excitatory forebrain neurons is required for the biological events in response to sleep loss. These include altered gene expression, the increase and recovery of synaptic strength, and the rebound and resolution of SWS-SWA, which implicate MEF2C as an essential regulator of sleep function.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Parkinson's disease motor symptoms are associated with an increase in subthalamic nucleus beta band oscillatory power. But these oscillations are phasic, and there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that beta burst duration may be of critical importance to motor symptoms, making insights into the dynamics of beta bursting generation valuable. In this study, we ask the question ''Can average burst duration reveal how dynamics change between the ON and OFF medication states?''. Our analysis of local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus demonstrates using linear surrogates that the system generating beta oscillations acts in a more non-linear regime OFF medication and that the change in the degree of non-linearity is correlated with motor impairment. Further, we pinpoint specific dynamical changes responsible for changes in the temporal patterning of beta oscillations between medication states by fitting to data biologically inspired models, and simpler beta envelope models. Finally, we show that the non-linearity can be directly extracted from average burst duration profiles under the assumption of constant noise in envelope models. This reveals that average burst duration profiles provide a window into burst dynamics, which may underlie the success of burst duration as a biomarker. In summary, we demonstrate a relationship between average burst duration profiles, dynamics of the system generating beta oscillations, and motor impairment, which puts us in a better position to understand the pathology and improve therapies such as deep brain stimulation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Neurofilaments (NFs), a major cytoskeletal component of motor neurons, play a key role in their differentiation, establishment and maintenance of their morphology and mechanical strength. The de novo assembly of these neuronal intermediate filaments requires the presence of the neurofilament light subunit, NEFL, which expression is reduced in motor neurons in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This study used zebrafish as a model to characterize the NEFL homologue neflb, which encodes two different isoforms via splicing of the primary transcript (neflbE4 and neflbE3). In vivo imaging showed that neflb is crucial for proper neuronal development, and that disrupting the balance between its two isoforms specifically affects NF assembly and motor axon growth, with resulting motor deficits. This equilibrium is also disrupted upon partial depletion of TDP-43, a RNA binding protein that is mislocalized into cytoplasmic inclusions in ALS. The study supports interaction of NEFL expression and splicing with TDP-43 in a common pathway, both biologically and pathogenetically.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Our ability to recall past experiences, autobiographical memories (AMs), is crucial to cognition, endowing us with a sense of self and underwriting our capacity for autonomy. Traditional views assume that the hippocampus orchestrates event recall, whereas recent accounts propose that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) instigates and coordinates hippocampal-dependent processes. Here we sought to characterise the dynamic interplay between hippocampus and vmPFC during AM recall to adjudicate between these perspectives. Leveraging the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography, we found that the hippocampus and the vmPFC showed the greatest power changes during AM retrieval. Moreover, responses in the vmPFC preceded activity in the hippocampus during initiation of AM recall, except during retrieval of the most recent AMs. The vmPFC drove hippocampal activity during recall initiation and also as AMs unfolded over subsequent seconds, and this effect was evident regardless of AM age. These results re-cast the positions of the hippocampus and the vmPFC in the AM retrieval hierarchy, with implications for theoretical accounts of memory processing and systems-level consolidation.</content>

 Large-scale simulations of spiking neural network models are an important tool for improving our understanding of the dynamics and ultimately the function of brains. However, even small mammals such as mice have on the order of 1x10^12 synaptic connections which, in simulations, are each typically charaterized by at least one floating-point value. This amounts to several terabytes of data - an unrealistic memory requirement for a single desktop machine. Large models are therefore typically simulated on distributed supercomputers which is costly and limits large-scale modelling to a few privileged research groups. In this work, we describe extensions to GeNN - our Graphical Processing Unit~(GPU) accelerated spiking neural network simulator - that enable it to 'procedurally' generate connectivity and synaptic weights 'on the go' as spikes are triggered, instead of storing and retrieving them from memory. We find that GPUs are well-suited to this approach because of their raw computational power which, due to memory bandwidth limitations, is often under-utilised when simulating spiking neural networks. We demonstrate the value of our approach with a recent model of the Macaque visual cortex consisting of 4.13x10^6 neurons and 24.2x10^9 synapses. Using our new method, it can be simulated on a single GPU - a significant step forward in making large-scale brain modelling accessible to many more researchers. Our results match those obtained on a supercomputer and the simulation runs up to 35% faster on a single high-end GPU than previously on over 1000 supercomputer nodes.</content>

 Response inhibition describes the cognitive processes mediating the suppression of unwanted actions. A network involving the basal ganglia mediates two forms of response inhibition: reactive and proactive inhibition. Reactive inhibition serves to abruptly stop motor activity, whereas proactive inhibition is goal-orientated and results in slowing of motor activity in anticipation of stopping. Due to its impairment in several psychiatric disorders, the neurochemistry of response inhibition has become of recent interest. Dopamine has been posed as a candidate mediator of response inhibition due to its role in functioning of the basal ganglia and the observation that patients with Parkinson's disease on dopamine agonists develop impulse control disorders. Although the effects of dopamine on reactive inhibition have been studied, substantial literature on the role of dopamine on proactive inhibition is lacking. To fill this gap, we devised a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 1 mg ropinirole (a dopamine agonist) on response inhibition in healthy volunteers. We found that whilst reactive inhibition was unchanged, proactive inhibition was impaired when participants were on ropinirole relative to when on placebo. To investigate how ropinirole mediated this effect on proactive inhibition, we used hierarchical drift-diffusion modelling. We found that ropinirole impaired the ability to raise the decision threshold when proactive inhibition was called upon. Our results provide novel evidence that an acute dose of ropinirole selectively reduces proactive inhibition in healthy participants. These results may help explain how ropinirole induces impulse control disorders in susceptible patients with Parkinson's disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Critical period plasticity during early postnatal life is followed by a consolidated state through the maturation of interneuron networks and development of perineuronal nets (PNN) surrounding parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. However, critical period-like plasticity can be induced in the adult brain (iPlasticity). Over a shorter time scale, PV interneurons can alternate between high and low plasticity states (PV-plasticity) to regulate memory encoding and consolidation. We now show that iPlasticity and PV-plasticity in the adult visual cortex are induced by the activation of TrkB neurotrophin receptors in PV interneurons. Optical activation of TrkB specifically in PV interneurons switches adult cortical networks into a state of elevated plasticity within minutes. The activation changes PV properties characterized by ocular dominance plasticity and reduced PV and PNN expression. Our results show that TrkB activity within PV interneurons is essential for iPlasticity and orchestrates plasticity states within adult cortical networks.</content>

 An ability to optically visualize neurons and their subcellular components across brain regions is integral to our understanding of neuronal function. Multimode optical fibers (MMFs), combined with wavefront control methods, have achieved minimally-invasive in vivo imaging of neurons in deep-brain regions with diffraction-limited spatial resolution. To date MMF systems have been based on linear fluorescence and are therefore only able to perform two-dimensional imaging due to an absence of confocal filtering. Here we report a method to achieve optical sectioning in live brain tissue by taking advantage of the nonlinearity of two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF). In addition, we provide a new approach for the determination of transmission matrix for TPEF, a necessary step for the light shaping requirement of MMF imaging. Central to these advances is the use of a laser source able to generate both continuous wave (CW) light and femtosecond pulses. This configuration allows the system to be compact with minimal distal optics, enhancing suitability for neuroscience applications. With our system we demonstrate TPEF imaging of neurons and their dendrites in live brain slices through a single 60 m-core MMF with a numerical aperture of 0.37. Taken together these developments represent an important step towards three-dimensional (3D) deep-brain imaging in vivo.</content>

 Entraining alpha activity with rhythmic visual, auditory, and electrical stimulation can reduce experimentally induced pain. However, evidence for alpha entrainment and pain reduction in patients with chronic pain is limited. This feasibility study investigated whether visual alpha stimulation can increase alpha power in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and secondarily, if chronic pain was reduced following stimulation. In a within-subject design, 22 patients underwent 4-minute periods of stimulation at 10 Hz (alpha), 7 Hz (high-theta, control), and 1 Hz (control) in a pseudo-randomized order. Patients underwent stimulation both sitting and standing and verbally rated their pain before and after each stimulation block on a 0-10 numerical rating scale. Global alpha power was significantly higher during 10 Hz compared to 1 Hz stimulation when patients were standing (t = -6.08, p &amp;lt;.001). On a more regional level, a significant increase of alpha power was found in the right-middle and left-posterior region when patients were sitting. With respect to our secondary aim, no significant reduction of pain intensity and unpleasantness was found. However, only the alpha stimulation resulted in a minimal clinically important difference in at least 50% of participants for pain intensity (50%) and unpleasantness ratings (65%) in the sitting condition. This study provides initial evidence for the potential of visual stimulation as a means to enhance alpha activity in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The brief period of stimulation was insufficient to reduce chronic pain. This study is the first to provide evidence that a brief period of visual stimulation at alpha frequency can significantly increase alpha power in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Further study is warranted to investigate optimal dose and individual stimulation parameters to achieve pain relief in these patients.</content>

 Biological tissues contain thousands of different proteins yet conventional antibody staining can only assay a few at a time because of the limited number of spectrally distinct fluorescent labels. The capacity to map the location of hundreds or thousands of proteins within a single sample would allow for an unprecedented investigation of the spatial proteome, and give insight into the development and function of diseased and healthy tissues. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a new technology that leverages established methodologies for in situ imaging of nucleic acids to achieve near limitless multiplexing. The exponential scaling power of DNA technologies ties multiplexing to the number of DNA nucleotides sequenced rather than the number of spectrally distinct labels. Here we demonstrate that barcode sequencing can be applied to in situ proteomics by sequencing DNA conjugated antibodies bound to biological samples. In addition, we show a signal amplification method which is compatible with barcoded antibodies.</content>

 Recent genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have identified variants implicating immune pathways in disease development. A rare coding variant of PLCG2, which encodes PLC{gamma}2, shows a significant protective effect for AD (rs72824905, P522R, P=5.38x10-10, Odds Ratio = 0.68). Molecular dynamic modelling of the PLC{gamma}2-R522 variant, situated within the auto-inhibitory domain of PLC{gamma}2, suggests a structural change to the protein. Through CRISPR-engineering we have generated novel PLCG2-R522 harbouring human induced pluripotent cell lines (hiPSC) and a mouse knockin model, neither of which exhibits alterations in endogenous PLCG2 expression. Mouse microglia and macrophages and hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells with the R522 mutation, all demonstrate a consistent non-redundant hyperfunctionality in the context of normal expression of other PLC isoforms. This signalling alteration manifests as enhanced cellular Ca2+ store release (~20-40% increase) in response to physiologically-relevant stimuli (e.g. Fc receptor ligation and A{beta} oligomers). This hyperfunctionality resulted in increased PIP2 depletion in the cells with the PLC{gamma}2-R522 variant after exposure to stimuli and reduced basal detection of PIP2 levels in vivo. These PLC{gamma}2-R522 associated abnormalities resulted in impairments to phagocytosis (fungal and bacterial particles) and enhanced endocytosis (A{beta} oligomers and dextran). PLC{gamma}2 sits downstream of disease relevant pathways, such as TREM2 and CSF1R and alterations in its activity, direct impacts cell function, which in the context of the inherent drugability of enzymes such as PLC{gamma}2, raise the prospect of manipulation of PLC{gamma}2 as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's Disease.</content>

 The context-dependence of extinction learning has been well studied and requires the hippocampus. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. Using memory-driven reinforcement learning and deep neural networks, we developed a model that learns to navigate autonomously in biologically realistic VR environments based on raw camera inputs alone. Neither is context represented explicitly in our model, nor is context change signaled. We find that memory-intact agents learn distinct context representations, and develop ABA renewal, whereas memory-impaired agents do not. These findings reproduce the behavior of control and hippocampal animals, respectively. We therefore propose that the role of the hippocampus in the context-dependence of extinction learning might stem from its function in episodic-like memory and not in context-representation per se. We conclude that context-dependence can emerge from raw visual inputs.</content>

 The mapping of the wiring diagrams of neural circuits promises to allow us to link structure and function of neural networks. Current approaches to analyzing connectomes rely mainly on graph-theoretical tools, but these may downplay the complex nonlinear dynamics of single neurons and networks, and the way networks respond to their inputs. Here, we measure the functional similarity of simulated networks of neurons, by quantifying the similitude of their spiking patterns in response to the same stimuli. We find that common graph theory metrics convey little information about the similarity of networks' responses. Instead, we learn a functional metric between networks based on their synaptic differences, and show that it accurately predicts the similarity of novel networks, for a wide range of stimuli. We then show that a sparse set of architectural features - the sum of synaptic inputs that each neuron receives and the sum of each neuron's synaptic outputs - predicts the functional similarity of networks of up to 100 cells, with high accuracy. We thus suggest new architectural design principles that shape the function of neural networks, which conform with experimental evidence of homeostatic mechanisms.</content>

 Gain of function LRRK2-G2019S is the most common mutation associated with both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. It is expected therefore that understanding the cellular function of LRRK2 will provide much needed insight on the pathological mechanism of sporadic Parkinson's, which is the most common form. Here we show that constitutive LRRK2 activity represses nascent protein synthesis in rodent neurons. Specifically, enzymatic inhibition of LRRK2, gene silencing or gene knockout of Lrrk2 increase translation. In the rotenone model of Parkinson's, LRRK2 activity increases, leading to repression of translation and dopaminergic neuron atrophy both of which are prevented by LRRK2 inhibition. This is accompanied by altered phosphorylation of eIF2-S52({uparrow}), eIF2s2-S2({downarrow}) and eEF2-T57({uparrow}) in striatum/substantia nigra in a direction that signifies inhibition of protein synthesis. Significantly, LRRK2 is activated and translation is 40% reduced in Parkinson's patient fibroblasts (G2019S and sporadic) and LRRK2 inhibition restores normal translation. In contrast, translation is unchanged in cells from multiple system atrophy patients, implying disease specificity. These findings suggest that LRRK2-dependent repression of translation may be a proximal function of LRRK2 in Parkinson's pathology.</content>

Many proteins contain multiple folded domains separated by flexible linkers, and the ability to describe the structure and conformational heterogeneity of such flexible systems pushes the limits of structural biology. Using the three-domain protein TIA-1 as an example, we here combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with previously measured small-angle scattering data to study the conformation of TIA-1 in solution. We show that while the coarse-grained potential (Martini) in itself leads to too compact conformations, increasing the strength of protein-water interactions results in ensembles that are in very good agreement with experiments. We show how these ensembles can be refined further using a Bayesian/Maximum Entropy approach, and examine the robustness to errors in the energy function. In particular we find that as long as the initial simulation is relatively good, reweighting against experiments is very robust. We also study the relative information in X-ray and neutron scattering experiments and find that refining against the SAXS experiments leads to improvement in the SANS data. Our results suggest a general strategy for studying the conformation of multi-domain proteins in solution that combines coarse-grained simulations with small-angle X-ray scattering data that are generally most easy to obtain. These results may in turn be used to design further small-angle neutron scattering experiments that exploit contrast variation through &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H/&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H isotope substitutions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xDoZmCABfRI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The mammalian circadian clock is deeply rooted in rhythmic regulation of gene expression. Rhythmic transcriptional control mediated by the circadian transcription factors is thought to be the main driver of mammalian circadian gene expression. However, mounting evidence has demonstrated the importance of rhythmic post-transcriptional controls, and it remains unclear how the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms collectively control rhythmic gene expression. In mouse liver, hundreds of genes were found to exhibit rhythmicity in poly(A) tail length, and the poly(A) rhythms are strongly correlated with the protein expression rhythms. To understand the role of rhythmic poly(A) regulation in circadian gene expression, we constructed a parsimonious model that depicts rhythmic control imposed upon basic mRNA expression and poly(A) regulation processes, including transcription, deadenylation, polyadenylation, and degradation. The model results reveal the rhythmicity in deadenylation as the strongest contributor to the rhythmicity in poly(A) tail length and the rhythmicity in the abundance of the mRNA subpopulation with long poly(A) tails (a rough proxy for mRNA translatability). In line with this finding, the model further shows that the experimentally observed distinct peak phases in the expression of deadenylases, regardless of other rhythmic controls, can robustly cluster the rhythmic mRNAs by their peak phases in poly(A) tail length and abundance of the long-tailed subpopulation. This provides a potential mechanism to synchronize the phases of target gene expression regulated by the same deadenylases. Our findings highlight the critical role of rhythmic deadenylation in regulating poly(A) rhythms and circadian gene expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n0oLaE6eQOI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Immunoglobulin genes are formed through V(D)J recombination, which joins the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) germline genes. Since variations in germline genes have been linked to various diseases, personalized immunogenomics focuses on finding alleles of germline genes across various patients. Although reconstruction of V and J genes is a well-studied problem, the more challenging task of reconstructing D genes remained open until the IgScout algorithm was developed in 2019. In this work, we address limitations of IgScout by developing a probabilistic MINING-D algorithm for D gene reconstruction, apply it to hundreds of immunosequencing datasets from multiple species, and validate the newly inferred D genes by analyzing diverse whole genome sequencing datasets and haplotyping heterozygous V genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NHBGsoVGcSo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Controlling the six legs of an insect walking in an unpredictable environment is a challenging task, as many degrees of freedom have to be coordinated. Solutions proposed to deal with this task are usually based on the highly influential concept that (sensory-modulated) central pattern generators (CPG) are required to control the rhythmic movements of walking legs. Here, we investigate a different view. To this end, we introduce a sensor based controller operating on artificial neurons, being applied to a (simulated) insectoid robot required to exploit the “loop through the world” allowing for simplification of neural computation. We show that such a decentralized solution leads to adaptive behavior when facing uncertain environments which we demonstrate for a broad range of behaviors never dealt with in a single system by earlier approaches. This includes the ability to produce footfall patterns such as velocity dependent “tripod”, “tetrapod”, “pentapod” as well as various stable intermediate patterns as observed in stick insects and in Drosophila. These patterns are found to be stable against disturbances and when starting from various leg configurations. Our neuronal architecture easily allows for starting or interrupting a walk, all being difficult for CPG controlled solutions. Furthermore, negotiation of curves and walking on a treadmill with various treatments of individual legs is possible as well as backward walking and performing short steps. This approach can as well account for the neurophysiological results usually interpreted to support the idea that CPGs form the basis of walking, although our approach is not relying on explicit CPG-like structures. Application of CPGs may however be required for very fast walking. Our neuronal structure allows to pinpoint specific neurons known from various insect studies. Interestingly, specific common properties observed in both insects and crustaceans suggest a significance of our controller beyond the realm of insects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HZgZfDFb6Lg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments, the number of individual cells has increased exponentially, and the sequencing depth of each cell has decreased significantly. As a result, analyzing scRNA-seq data requires extensive considerations of program efficiency and method selection. In order to reduce the complexity of scRNA-seq data analysis, we present scedar, a scalable Python package for scRNA-seq exploratory data analysis. The package provides a convenient and reliable interface for performing visualization, imputation of gene dropouts, detection of rare transcriptomic profiles, and clustering on large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. The analytical methods are efficient, and they also do not assume that the data follow certain statistical distributions. The package is extensible and modular, which would facilitate the further development of functionalities for future requirements with the open-source development community. The scedar package is distributed under the terms of the MIT license at https://pypi.org/project/scedar.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O6vNdbU77Dc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Antibodies are capable of potently and specifically binding individual antigens and, in some cases, disrupting their functions. The key challenge in generating antibody-based inhibitors is the lack of fundamental information relating sequences of antibodies to their unique properties as inhibitors. We develop a pipeline, Antibody Sequence Analysis Pipeline using Statistical testing and Machine Learning (ASAP-SML), to identify features that distinguish one set of antibody sequences from antibody sequences in a reference set. The pipeline extracts feature fingerprints from sequences. The fingerprints represent germline, CDR canonical structure, isoelectric point and frequent positional motifs. Machine learning and statistical significance testing techniques are applied to antibody sequences and extracted feature fingerprints to identify distinguishing feature values and combinations thereof. To demonstrate how it works, we applied the pipeline on sets of antibody sequences known to bind or inhibit the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent enzymes that promote cancer progression and undesired inflammation under pathological conditions, against reference datasets that do not bind or inhibit MMPs. ASAP-SML identifies features and combinations of feature values found in the MMP-targeting sets that are distinct from those in the reference sets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m-Kl0J1aavU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Oogenesis is a complex developmental process that involves spatiotemporally regulated coordination between the germline and supporting, somatic cell populations. This process has been modeled extensively using the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ovary. Although different ovarian cell types have been identified through traditional means, the large-scale expression profiles underlying each cell type remain unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we have built a transcriptomic data set for the adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ovary and connected tissues. Using this data set, we identified the transcriptional trajectory of the entire follicle-cell population over the course of their development from stem cells to the oogenesis-to-ovulation transition. We further identify expression patterns during essential developmental events that take place in somatic and germline cell types such as differentiation, cell-cycle switching, migration, symmetry breaking, nurse-cell engulfment, egg-shell formation, and corpus luteum signaling. Extensive experimental validation of unique expression patterns in both ovarian and nearby, nonovarian cells also led to the identification of many new cell type–and stage-specific markers. The inclusion of several nearby tissue types in this data set also led to our identification of functional convergence in expression between distantly related cell types such as the immune-related genes that were similarly expressed in immune cells (hemocytes) and ovarian somatic cells (stretched cells) during their brief phagocytic role in nurse-cell engulfment. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the temporal regulation of genes in a cell-type specific manner during oogenesis and begin to reveal the relatedness in expression between cell and tissues types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_4UTqoDvHbw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Operant conditioning (OC) is a classical paradigm and a standard technique used in experimental psychology in which animals learn to perform an action to achieve a reward. By using this paradigm, it is possible to extract learning curves and measure accurately reaction times (RTs). Both these measurements are proxy of cognitive capabilities and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in mouse models of disease. Here, we describe a fully 3D printable device that is able to perform OC on freely moving mice, while performing real-time tracking of the animal position. We successfully trained six mice, showing stereotyped learning curves that are highly reproducible across mice and reaching &amp;gt;70% of accuracy after 2 d of conditioning. Different products for OC are commercially available, though most of them do not provide customizable features and are relatively expensive. This data demonstrate that this system is a valuable alternative to available state-of-the-art commercial devices, representing a good balance between performance, cost, and versatility in its use.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral studies have shown that the human motor system recycles motor parameters of previous actions, such as movement amplitude, when programming new actions. Shifting motor plans toward a new action forms a particularly severe problem for patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), a disorder that, in its early stage, is dominated by basal ganglia dysfunction. Here, we test whether this action selection deficit in Parkinson’s patients arises from an impaired ability to recycle motor parameters shared across subsequent actions. Parkinson’s patients off dopaminergic medication (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) and matched healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) performed a task that involved moving a handheld dowel over an obstacle in the context of a sequence of aiming movements. Consistent with previous research, healthy participants continued making unnecessarily large hand movements after clearing the obstacle (defined as &quot;hand path priming effect&quot;), even after switching movements between hands. In contrast, Parkinson’s patients showed a reduced hand path priming effect, i.e., they performed biomechanically more efficient movements than controls, but only when switching movements between hands. This effect correlated with disease severity, such that patients with more severe motor symptoms had a smaller hand path priming effect. We propose that the basal ganglia mediate recycling of movement parameters across subsequent actions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The pond snail &lt;i&gt;Lymnaea stagnalis&lt;/i&gt; learns conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and consolidates it into long-term memory (LTM). One-day food-deprived snails (day 1 snails) show the best CTA learning and memory, whereas more severely food-deprived snails (5 d) do not express good memory. However, previous studies showed that CTA-LTM was indeed formed in 5-d food-deprived snails (day 5 snails), but its recall was prevented by the effects of food deprivation. CTA-LTM recall in day 5 snails was expressed following 7 d of feeding and then 1 d of food deprivation (day 13 snails). In the present study, we thus hypothesized that memory recall occurs because day 13 snails are in an optimal internal state. One day of food deprivation before the memory test in day 13 snails increased the mRNA level of molluscan insulin-related peptide (MIP) in the CNS. Thus, we further hypothesized that an injection of insulin into day 5 snails following seven additional days with access to food (day 12 snails) activates CTA neurons and mimics the food deprivation state before the memory test in day 13 snails. Day 12 snails injected with insulin could recall the memory. In addition, the simultaneous injection of an anti-insulin receptor antibody and insulin into day 12 snails did not allow memory recall. Insulin injection also decreased the hemolymph glucose concentration. Together, the results suggest that an optimal internal state (i.e., a spike in insulin release and specific glucose levels) are necessary for LTM recall following CTA training in snails.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study is to investigate how the activation location of persistent inward current (PIC) over motoneuron dendrites is linked to motor output in the closed-loop motor unit. Here, a physiologically realistic model of a motor unit including afferent inputs from muscle spindles was comprehensively analyzed under intracellular stimulation at the soma and synaptic inputs over the dendrites during isometric contractions over a full physiological range of muscle lengths. The motor output of the motor unit model was operationally assessed by evaluating the rate of force development, the degree of force potentiation and the capability of self-sustaining force production. Simulations of the model motor unit demonstrated a tendency for a faster rate of force development, a greater degree of force potentiation, and greater capacity for self-sustaining force production under both somatic and dendritic stimulation of the motoneuron as the PIC channels were positioned farther from the soma along the path of motoneuron dendrites. Interestingly, these effects of PIC activation location on force generation significantly differed among different states of muscle length. The rate of force development and the degree of force potentiation were systematically modulated by the variation of PIC channel location for shorter-than-optimal muscles but not for optimal and longer-than-optimal muscles. Similarly, the warm-up behavior of the motor unit depended on the interplay between PIC channel location and muscle length variation. These results suggest that the location of PIC activation over motoneuron dendrites may be distinctively reflected in the motor performance during shortening muscle contractions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Newly born neurons express high levels of TUBA1A α-tubulin to assemble microtubules for neurite extension and to provide tracks for intracellular transport. In the adult brain, &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;/i&gt; expression decreases dramatically. A mouse that harbors a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding TUBA1A (&lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) allows us to ask whether TUBA1A is important for the function of mature neurons. α-Tubulin levels are about half of wild type in juvenile &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; brains, but are close to normal in older animals. In postnatal day (P)0 cultured neurons, reduced TUBA1A allows for assembly of less microtubules in axons resulting in more pausing during organelle trafficking. While &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse behavior is indistinguishable from wild-type siblings at weaning, &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice develop adult-onset ataxia. Neurons important for motor function in &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; remain indistinguishable from wild-type with respect to morphology and number and display no evidence of axon degeneration. &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses are the same size as wild-type before the onset of ataxia, but are reduced in size in older animals. Together, these data indicate that the TUBA1A-rich microtubule tracks that are assembled during development are essential for mature neuron function and maintenance of synapses over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The appropriate sensory information feedback is important for the success of an object grasping and manipulation task. In many scenarios, the need arises for multiple feedback information to be conveyed to a prosthetic hand user simultaneously. The multiple sets of information may either (1) directly contribute to the performance of the grasping or object manipulation task, such as the feedback of the grasping force, or (2) simply form additional independent set(s) of information. In this paper, the efficacy of simultaneously conveying two independent sets of sensor information (the grasp force and a secondary set of information) through a single channel of feedback stimulation (vibrotactile via bone conduction) to the human user in a prosthetic application is investigated. The performance of the grasping task is not dependent to the second set of information in this study. Subject performance in two tasks: regulating the grasp force and identifying the secondary information, were evaluated when provided with either one corresponding information or both sets of feedback information. Visual feedback is involved in the training stage. The proposed approach is validated on human-subject experiments using a vibrotactile transducer worn on the elbow bony landmark (to realize a non-invasive bone conduction interface) carried out in a virtual reality environment to perform a closed-loop object grasping task. The experimental results show that the performance of the human subjects on either task, whilst perceiving two sets of sensory information, is not inferior to that when receiving only one set of corresponding sensory information, demonstrating the potential of conveying a second set of information through a bone conduction interface in an upper limb prosthetic task.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: In the last few years, many investigations have focused on brain activity in general and in populations with different pathologies using non-invasive techniques such as electroencefalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the use of non-invasive techniques to detect brain signals to evaluate the cognitive activity of people with Down syndrome (DS) has not been sufficiently addressed. The objective of this study is to describe the state-of-the-art in fMRI techniques for recording brain signals in people with DS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A systematic review was performed based on PRISMA recommendations; only nine papers on this topic have been published. Three independent researchers selected all relevant information from each paper. Analyses of information concordance showed a high value of agreement between researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Although few relevant works have been published, the use of fMRI in people with DS is becoming an appropriate option to study brain function in this population. Of the nine identified papers, five used task designs, and four used resting-state paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Thus, we emphasize the need to incorporate rigorous cognitive activity procedures in evaluations of the DS population. We suggest several factors (such as head correction movements and paired sample techniques) that must be considered when designing an fMRI study with a task or a resting-state paradigm in a DS population.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transgenic Cre-recombinase expressing mouse lines are widely used to express fluorescent proteins and opto-/chemogenetic actuators, making them a cornerstone of modern neuroscience. The investigation of interneurons in particular has benefitted from the ability to genetically target specific cell types. However, the specificity of some Cre driver lines has been called into question. Here, we show that nonspecific expression in a subset of hippocampal neurons can have substantial nonspecific functional effects in a somatostatin-Cre (SST-Cre) mouse line. Nonspecific targeting of CA3 pyramidal cells caused large optogenetically evoked excitatory currents in remote brain regions. Similar, but less severe patterns of nonspecific expression were observed in a widely used SST-IRES-Cre line, when crossed with a reporter mouse line. Viral transduction on the other hand yielded more specific expression but still resulted in nonspecific expression in a minority of pyramidal layer cells. These results suggest that a careful analysis of specificity is mandatory before the use of Cre driver lines for opto- or chemogenetic manipulation approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 COVID-19 patients can present with pulmonary edema early in disease. We propose that the this is due to a local vascular problem because of activation of bradykinin 1 receptor (B1R) and B2R on endothelial cells in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via ACE2 that next to its role in RAS is needed to inactivate des-Arg9 bradykinin, the potent ligand of the bradykinin receptor type 1 (B1). Without ACE2 acting as a guardian to inactivate the ligands of B1, the lung environment is prone for local vascular leakage leading to angioedema. Here we hypothesize that a bradykinin-dependent local lung angioedema via B1 and B2 receptors is an important feature of COVID-19. We propose that blocking the B2 receptor and inhibiting kallikrein activity might have an ameliorating effect on early disease caused by COVID-19 and might prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In addition, this pathway might indirectly be responsive to anti-inflammatory agents.</content>

		<content type="html">
 piRNAs play a critical role in the regulation of transposons and other germline genes. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, regulation of piRNA target genes is mediated by the &lt;i&gt;mutator&lt;/i&gt; complex, which synthesizes high levels of siRNAs through the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the steps between mRNA recognition by the piRNA pathway and siRNA amplification by the &lt;i&gt;mutator &lt;/i&gt;complex are unknown. Here, we identify the Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, as acting downstream of piRNA production and upstream of &lt;i&gt;mutator&lt;/i&gt; complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. Interestingly, SIMR-1 also localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and &lt;i&gt;Mutator&lt;/i&gt; foci, two phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and&lt;i&gt; mutator&lt;/i&gt; complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. Thus, our data suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the &lt;i&gt;mutator&lt;/i&gt; complex.</content>

 Recent studies indicate that many developing tissues modify glycolysis to favor lactate synthesis, but how this promotes development is unclear. Using forward and reverse genetics in zebrafish, we show that disrupting the glycolytic gene &lt;i&gt;phosphoglycerate kinase-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;pgk1&lt;/i&gt;) impairs Fgf-dependent development of hair cells and neurons in the otic vesicle and other neurons in the CNS/PNS. Fgf-MAPK signaling underperforms in &lt;i&gt;pgk1-/-&lt;/i&gt; mutants even when Fgf is transiently overexpressed. Wild-type embryos treated with drugs that block synthesis or secretion of lactate mimic the &lt;i&gt;pgk1-/-&lt;/i&gt; phenotype, whereas &lt;i&gt;pgk1-/-&lt;/i&gt; mutants are rescued by treatment with exogenous lactate. Lactate treatment of wild-type embryos elevates expression of Etv5b/Erm even when Fgf signaling is blocked. However, lactate's ability to stimulate neurogenesis is reversed by blocking MAPK. Thus, lactate raises basal levels of MAPK and Etv5b (a critical effector of the Fgf pathway), rendering cells more responsive to dynamic changes in Fgf signaling required by many developing tissues.</content>

 Minor and major spliceosomes control splicing of distinct intron types and are thought to act largely independent of one another. SR proteins are essential splicing regulators mostly connected to the major spliceosome. Here, we show that &lt;i&gt;Srsf10&lt;/i&gt; expression is controlled through an autoregulated minor intron, tightly correlating Srsf10 with minor spliceosome abundance across different tissues and differentiation stages in mammals. Surprisingly, all other SR proteins also correlate with the minor spliceosome and &lt;i&gt;Srsf10&lt;/i&gt;, and abolishing &lt;i&gt;Srsf10&lt;/i&gt; autoregulation by Crispr/Cas9-mediated deletion of the autoregulatory exon induces expression of all SR proteins in a human cell line. Our data thus reveal extensive crosstalk and a global impact of the minor spliceosome on major intron splicing.</content>

 One of the fundamental gaps in our knowledge of how novel anatomical structures evolve is understanding the origins of the morphogenetic processes that form these features. Here, we traced the cellular development of a recently evolved morphological novelty, the posterior lobe of &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We found that this genital outgrowth forms through extreme increases in epithelial cell height. By examining the apical extracellular matrix (aECM), we also uncovered a vast matrix associated with the developing genitalia of lobed and non-lobed species. The aECM protein Dumpy is spatially expanded in lobe-forming species, connecting the posterior lobe to the ancestrally derived aECM network. Further analysis demonstrated that Dumpy attachments are necessary for cell height increases during posterior lobe development. We propose that the aECM presents a rich reservoir for generating morphological novelty and highlights a yet unseen role for aECM in regulating extreme cell height.</content>

 Cyclic nucleotide second messengers are increasingly implicated in prokaryotic anti-viral defence systems. Type III CRISPR systems synthesise cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) upon detecting foreign RNA, activating ancillary nucleases that can be toxic to cells, necessitating mechanisms to remove cOA in systems that operate via immunity rather than abortive infection. Previously, we demonstrated that the &lt;i&gt;Sulfolobus solfataricus &lt;/i&gt;type III-D CRISPR complex generates cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), activating the ribonuclease Csx1, and showed that subsequent RNA cleavage and dissociation acts as an 'off-switch' for the cyclase activity (Rouillon&lt;i&gt; et al.&lt;/i&gt;, 2018). Subsequently, we identified the cellular ring nuclease Crn1, which slowly degrades cA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to reset the system, and demonstrated that viruses can subvert type III CRISPR immunity by means of a potent anti-CRISPR ring nuclease variant AcrIII-1. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic interplay between these enzymes, governing cyclic nucleotide levels and infection outcomes in virus-host conflict.</content>

 The small molecules that mediate chemical communication between nematodes—so-called 'nematode-derived-modular-metabolites' (NDMMs)—are of major interest due to their ability to regulate development, behavior, and life-history. &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus pacificus&lt;/i&gt; nematodes produce an impressive diversity of structurally complex NDMMs, some of which act as primer pheromones capable of triggering irreversible developmental switches. Many of these NDMMs have only ever been found in &lt;i&gt;P. pacificus&lt;/i&gt; but no attempts had been made to study their evolution by profiling closely related species. This study was designed to bring a comparative perspective to the biochemical study of NDMMs via the systematic MS/MS and NMR-based analysis of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-metabolomes from over 30 &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus&lt;/i&gt; species. We identified 36 novel compounds and found evidence for the convergent evolution of complex NDMMs in separate branches of the &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus&lt;/i&gt; phylogeny. Our results demonstrate that biochemical innovation is a recurrent process in &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus&lt;/i&gt; nematodes, a pattern likely typical across the animal kingdom.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The H2A.Z histone variant, a genome-wide hallmark of permissive chromatin, is enriched near transcription start sites in all eukaryotes. H2A.Z is deposited by the SWR1 chromatin remodeler and evicted by unclear mechanisms. We tracked H2A.Z in living yeast at single-molecule resolution, and found that H2A.Z eviction is dependent on RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and the Kin28/Cdk7 kinase, which phosphorylates Serine 5 of heptapeptide repeats on the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest Pol II subunit Rpb1. These findings link H2A.Z eviction to transcription initiation, promoter escape and early elongation activities of Pol II. Because passage of Pol II through +1 nucleosomes genome-wide would obligate H2A.Z turnover, we propose that global transcription at yeast promoters is responsible for eviction of H2A.Z. Such usage of yeast Pol II suggests a general mechanism coupling eukaryotic transcription to erasure of the H2A.Z epigenetic signal.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In the nucleus, the spatiotemporal regulation of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA-C) is orchestrated by an intrinsically disordered protein kinase inhibitor, PKI, which recruits the CRM1/RanGTP nuclear exporting complex. How the PKA-C/PKI complex assembles and recognizes CRM1/RanGTP is not well understood. Using NMR, SAXS, fluorescence, metadynamics, and Markov model analysis, we determined the multi-state recognition pathway for PKI. After a fast binding step in which PKA-C selects PKI's most competent conformations, PKI folds upon binding through a slow conformational rearrangement within the enzyme's binding pocket. The high-affinity and pseudo-substrate regions of PKI become more structured and the transient interactions with the kinase augment the helical content of the nuclear export sequence, which is then poised to recruit the CRM1/RanGTP complex for nuclear translocation. The multistate binding mechanism featured by PKA-C/PKI complex represents a paradigm on how disordered, ancillary proteins (or protein domains) are able to operate multiple functions such as inhibiting the kinase while recruiting other regulatory proteins for nuclear export.</content>

 Many tasks used to study decision-making encourage subjects to integrate evidence over time. Such tasks are useful to understand how the brain operates on multiple samples of information over prolonged timescales, but only if subjects actually integrate evidence to form their decisions. We explored the behavioral observations that corroborate evidence-integration in a number of task-designs. Several commonly accepted signs of integration were also predicted by non-integration strategies. Furthermore, an integration model could fit data generated by non-integration models. We identified the features of non-integration models that allowed them to mimic integration and used these insights to design a motion discrimination task that disentangled the models. In human subjects performing the task, we falsified a non-integration strategy in each and confirmed prolonged integration in all but one subject. The findings illustrate the difficulty of identifying a decision-maker's strategy and support solutions to achieve this goal.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The mating-type switching endonuclease HO plays a central role in the natural life cycle of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, but its evolutionary origin is unknown. &lt;i&gt;HO&lt;/i&gt; is a recent addition to yeast genomes, present in only a few genera close to &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that &lt;i&gt;HO&lt;/i&gt; is structurally and phylogenetically related to a family of unorthodox homing genetic elements found in &lt;i&gt;Torulaspora&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lachancea &lt;/i&gt;yeasts. These &lt;i&gt;WHO &lt;/i&gt;elements home into the aldolase gene &lt;i&gt;FBA1&lt;/i&gt;, replacing its 3' end each time they integrate. They resemble inteins but they operate by a different mechanism that does not require protein splicing. We show that a WHO protein cleaves &lt;i&gt;Torulaspora delbrueckii&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;FBA1&lt;/i&gt; efficiently and in an allele-specific manner, leading to DNA repair by gene conversion or NHEJ. The DNA rearrangement steps during &lt;i&gt;WHO&lt;/i&gt; element homing are very similar to those during mating-type switching, and indicate that &lt;i&gt;HO&lt;/i&gt; is a domesticated &lt;i&gt;WHO&lt;/i&gt;-like element.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The NR5A-family nuclear receptors are highly conserved and function within the somatic follicle cells of the ovary to regulate folliculogenesis and ovulation in mammals; however, their roles in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ovaries are largely unknown. Here, we discover that Ftz-f1, one of the NR5A nuclear receptors in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, is transiently induced in follicle cells in late stages of oogenesis via ecdysteroid signaling. Genetic disruption of Ftz-f1 expression prevents follicle cell differentiation into the final maturation stage, which leads to anovulation. In addition, we demonstrate that the bHLH/PAS transcription factor Single-minded (Sim) acts as a direct target of Ftz-f1 to promote follicle cell differentiation/maturation and that Ftz-f1's role in regulating Sim expression and follicle cell differentiation can be replaced by its mouse homolog steroidogenic factor 1 (mSF-1). Our work provides new insight into the regulation of follicle maturation in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and the conserved role of NR5A nuclear receptors in regulating folliculogenesis and ovulation.</content>

 How did brains evolve to become so complex, and what is their future? Brains pose an explanatory challenge because entropy, which inexorably increases over time, is commonly associated with disorder and simplicity. Recently we showed how evolution is an entropic process, building structures – organisms – which themselves facilitate entropy growth. Here we suggest that key transitional points in evolution extended organisms’ reach into space and time, opening channels into new regions of a complex multi-dimensional state space that also allow entropy to increase.</content>

a multicenter study of 59 patients</title>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To foster trial‐readiness of COQ8A‐ataxia, we map the clinico‐genetic, molecular and neuroimaging spectrum of COQ8A‐ataxia in a large worldwide cohort, and provide first progression data, including treatment response to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross‐modal analysis of a multicenter cohort of 59 COQ8A patients, including genotype–phenotype correlations, 3D‐protein modelling, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mutation analyses, MRI markers, disease progression and CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; response data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;59 patients (39 novel) with 44 pathogenic &lt;i&gt;COQ8A&lt;/i&gt; variants (18 novel) were identified. Missense variants demonstrated a pleiotropic range of detrimental effects upon protein modelling and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; analysis of purified variants. COQ8A‐ataxia presented as variable multisystemic, early‐onset cerebellar ataxia, with complicating features ranging from epilepsy (32%) and cognitive impairment (49%) to exercise intolerance (25%) and hyperkinetic movement disorders (41%), including dystonia and myoclonus as presenting symptoms. Multisystemic involvement was more prevalent in missense than biallelic loss‐of‐function variants (82–93% vs. 53%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029). Cerebellar atrophy was universal on MRI (100%), with cerebral atrophy or dentate and pontine T2 hyperintensities observed in 28%. Cross‐sectional (n = 34) and longitudinal (n = 7) assessments consistently indicated mild‐to‐moderate progression of ataxia (SARA: 0.45/year). CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; treatment led to improvement by clinical report in 14/30 patients, and by quantitative longitudinal assessments in 8/11 patients (SARA: −0.81/year). Explorative sample size calculations indicate that ≥48 patients per arm may suffice to demonstrate efficacy for interventions that reduce progression by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides a deeper understanding of the disease, and paves the way towards large‐scale natural history studies and treatment trials in COQ8A‐ataxia.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Afferent and efferent connections of the nucleus prethalamicus in the yellowfin goby Acanthogobius flavimanus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5a7e3cd2-f032-4c42-859a-4a451f7fb3b2/cne24935-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus prethalamicus (PTh) of the yellowfin goby relays visual information from the optic tectum to as many as thirteen regions of the telencephalon that is amazingly well‐compartmentalized in the goby. The goby is a promising model fish for studying telencephalic circuitries involved in the processing of visual information.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus prethalamicus (PTh) receives fibers from the optic tectum and then projects to the dorsal telencephalon in the yellowfin goby &lt;i&gt;Acanthogobius flavimanus&lt;/i&gt;. However, it remained unclear whether the PTh is a visual relay nucleus, because the optic tectum receives not only visual but also other sensory modalities. Furthermore, precise telencephalic regions receiving prethalamic input remained unknown in the goby. We therefore investigated the full set of afferent and efferent connections of the PTh by direct tracer injections into the nucleus. Injections into the PTh labeled cells in the optic tectum, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, central and medial parts of the dorsal telencephalon, and caudal lobe of the cerebellum. We found that the somata of most tecto‐prethalamic neurons are present in the stratum periventriculare. Their dendrites ascend to reach the major retinorecipient layers of the tectum. The PTh is composed of two subnuclei (medial and lateral) and topographic organization was appreciated only for tectal projections to the lateral subnucleus (PTh‐l), which also receives sparse retinal projections. In contrast, the medial subnucleus receives fibers only from the medial tectum. We found that the PTh projects to nine subregions in the dorsal telencephalon and four in the ventral telencephalon. Furthermore, cerebellar injections revealed that cerebello‐prethalamic fibers cross the midline twice to innervate the PTh‐l on both sides. The present study is the first detailed report on the full set of the connections of PTh, which suggests that the PTh relays visual information from the optic tectum to the telencephalon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; ants are known for their outstanding navigational abilities. They return to their inconspicuous nest after far‐reaching foraging trips using path integration, and whenever available, learn and memorize visual features of panoramic sceneries. To achieve this, the ants combine directional visual information from celestial cues and panoramic scenes with distance information from an intrinsic odometer. The largely vision‐based navigation in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; requires sophisticated neuronal networks to process the broad repertoire of visual stimuli. Although &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; ants have been subject to many neuroethological studies, little is known about the general neuronal organization of their central brain and the visual pathways beyond major circuits. Here, we provide a comprehensive, three‐dimensional neuronal map of synapse‐rich neuropils in the brain of &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis nodus&lt;/i&gt; including major connecting fiber systems. In addition, we examined neuronal tracts underlying the processing of visual information in more detail. This study revealed a total of 33 brain neuropils and 30 neuronal fiber tracts including six distinct tracts between the optic lobes and the cerebrum. We also discuss the importance of comparative studies on insect brain architecture for a profound understanding of neuronal networks and their function.&lt;/p&gt;

 Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a neuroimaging technique that has allowed us an unprecedented look at the role that white matter microstructure may play in mental illnesses, such as psychosis. Psychosis-related illnesses, including schizophrenia, are increasingly viewed as existing along a spectrum; spectrums may be defined based on factors such as stage of illness, symptom severity, or genetic liability. This review first focuses on an overview of some of the recent findings from DWI studies.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathology of frontotemporal dementia, termed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is characterized by distinct molecular classes of aggregated proteins, the most common being TAR DNA‐binding protein‐43 (TDP‐43), tau, and fused in sarcoma (FUS). With a few exceptions, it is currently not possible to predict the underlying pathology based on the clinical syndrome. In this study, we set out to investigate the relationship between pathological and clinical presentation at single symptom level, including neuropsychiatric features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence or absence of symptoms from the current clinical guidelines, together with neuropsychiatric features, such as hallucinations and delusions, were scored and compared across pathological groups in a cohort of 150 brain donors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cohort consisted of 68.6% FTLD donors (35.3% TDP‐43, 28% tau, and 5.3% FUS) and 31.3% non‐FTLD donors with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and a different pathological substrate, such as Alzheimer's disease (23%). The presence of hyperorality points to FTLD rather than non‐FTLD pathology (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Within the FTLD group, hallucinations in the initial years of the disease were related to TDP‐43 pathology (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), including but not limited to chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt;) repeat expansion carriers. The presence of perseverative or compulsive behavior was more common in the TDP‐B and TDP‐C histotypes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that neuropsychiatric features are common in FTLD and form an important indicator of underlying pathology. In order to allow better inclusion of patients in targeted molecular trials, the routine evaluation of patients with frontotemporal dementia should include the presence and nature of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved and powerful drive, although its complete functions are still unknown. One possible function of sleep is that it promotes brain development. The amount of sleep is greatest during ages when the brain is rapidly developing, and sleep has been shown to influence critical period plasticity. This supports a role for sleep in brain development and suggests that abnormal sleep in early life may lead to abnormal development. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in the United States. It is estimated that insomnia affects 44%–86% of the ASD population, predicting the severity of ASD core symptoms and associated behavioral problems. Sleep problems impact the quality of life of both ASD individuals and their caregivers, thus it is important to understand why they are so prevalent. In this review, we explore the role of sleep in early life as a causal factor in ASD. First, we review fundamental steps in mammalian sleep ontogeny and regulation and how sleep influences brain development. Next, we summarize current knowledge gained from studying sleep in animal models of ASD. Ultimately, our goal is to highlight the importance of understanding the role of sleep in brain development and the use of animal models to provide mechanistic insight into the origin of sleep problems in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Tomosyn regulates the small RhoA GTPase to control the dendritic stability of neurons and the surface expression of AMPA receptors&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d717ef53-f5a1-4bd5-ad6a-837058a29a26/jnr24608-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomosyn inhibits RhoA activity via WD40 motif to regulate dendritic stability. Silence or autism spectrum disorder‐associated variants of tomosyn result in reduced dendritic complexity and surface expression of AMPA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomosyn, a protein encoded by syntaxin‐1‐binding protein 5 (&lt;i&gt;STXBP5&lt;/i&gt;) gene, has a well‐established presynaptic role in the inhibition of neurotransmitter release and the reduction of synaptic transmission by its canonical interaction with the soluble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐ethylmaleimide‐sensitive factor attachment protein receptor machinery. However, the postsynaptic role of tomosyn in dendritic arborization, spine stability, and trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors remains to be elucidated. We used short hairpin RNA to knock down tomosyn in mouse primary neurons to evaluate the postsynaptic cellular function and molecular signaling regulated by tomosyn. Knockdown of tomosyn led to an increase of RhoA GTPase activity accompanied by compromised dendritic arborization, loss of dendritic spines, decreased surface expression of AMPA receptors, and reduced miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency. Inhibiting RhoA signaling was sufficient to rescue the abnormal dendritic morphology and the surface expression of AMPA receptors. The function of tomosyn regulating RhoA is mediated through the N‐terminal WD40 motif, where two variants each carrying a single nucleotide mutation in this region were found in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We demonstrated that these variants displayed loss‐of‐function phenotypes. Unlike the wild‐type tomosyn, these two variants failed to restore the reduced dendritic complexity, spine density, as well as decreased surface expression of AMPA receptors in tomosyn knockdown neurons. This study uncovers a novel role of tomosyn in maintaining neuronal function by inhibiting RhoA activity. Further analysis of tomosyn variants also provides a potential mechanism for explaining cellular pathology in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Profilin 1 knockdown prevents ischemic brain damage by promoting M2 microglial polarization associated with the RhoA/ROCK pathway&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/12758661-66a6-4266-ad94-b2bf777999c6/jnr24607-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential molecular mechanism by which pfn1 regulates microglia polarization and hypoxia/ischemia injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglial polarization to the anti‐inflammatory M2 phenotype is essential in resolving neuroinflammation, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke intervention. The actin cytoskeleton is known to be important for the physiological functions of microglia, including migration and phagocytosis. Profilin 1 (PFN1), an actin‐binding protein, is involved in the dynamic transformation and reorganization of actin. However, the role of PFN1 in microglial polarization and ischemia/reperfusion injury is unclear. The role of PFN1 on microglial polarization was examined &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; in BV2 microglial cells subjected to oxygen‐glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGDR) and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in male mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Knockdown of PFN1 inhibited M1 microglial polarization and promoted M2 microglia polarization 48 hr after OGDR stimulation in BV2 cells and 7 days after MCAO‐induced injury in male mice. RhoA/ROCK pathway was involved in the regulation of PFN1 during microglial polarization. Knockdown of PFN1 also significantly attenuated brain infarcts and edema, improved cerebral blood flow and neurological deficits in MCAO‐injured mice. Inhibition of PFN1 effectively protected the brain against ischemia/reperfusion injuries by promoting M2 microglial polarization &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroendocrine function and associated mental health outcomes following mild traumatic brain injury in OEF‐deployed service members&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c7df79eb-75d8-4df9-be0d-d2655a91a39a/jnr24604-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chronic&lt;/i&gt; reduction in luteinizing hormone and testosterone (gonadotropin deficiency and hypogonadism). Neuroendocrine dysfunction and mild traumatic brain injury associated with mental health disorder (MHD) diagnosis. Long‐term neuroendocrine dysregulation in a deployed, chronically stressed military population associated with MHDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been linked to mental health disorders (MHDs) and pituitary function alterations. Due to the complex relationship of mTBI, the neuroendocrine system, and MHDs, we propose that neuroendocrine dysfunction (NED) may play a role in negative long‐term health outcomes. The goal of this study was to determine if blast‐concussed service members (SMs) have a stronger likelihood of developing NED. We hypothesized that NED either pre‐ or post‐injury is associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes. Serum samples from the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch were obtained from concussed (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 59) and non‐concussed (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 72) SMs treated at the Concussion Restoration Care Center (CRCC) in Afghanistan. Serum was collected within 2 years prior to deployment and one or two times within 3 years following their CRCC visit. Samples were analyzed for luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, human growth hormone, cortisol, and prolactin to assess post‐injury neuroendocrine function. Results indicate that SMs who incurred an mTBI exhibited long‐term LH and testosterone deficiencies 3 years following injury compared to controls. Specifically, 47.6% of head‐injured SMs displayed hypofunction in at least one of five hormones at 3 years post‐injury. Anxiety disorders were the most common MHD observed in concussed SMs with hypopituitarism, while there was also a trend for SMs with chronic pituitary dysfunction to have MHD diagnoses. Findings indicate blast‐related mTBI may be associated with long‐term health outcomes following a period of incubation. Neuroendocrine screenings may increase treatment opportunities, inform rehabilitation strategies, and improve overall quality of life for patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Short photoperiod restores ventral subicular lesion‐induced deficits in affective and socio‐cognitive behavior in male Wistar rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3ba9047e-c15c-4cda-bbb3-43693bb97e66/jnr24601-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of circadian manipulation on affective and socio‐cognitive functions were studied in ventral subicular lesioned (VSL) rat model of cognitive impairment. Bilateral VSL resulted in anxiety, depression, and impaired social behavior. Further, these VSL‐induced behavioral deficits were ameliorated by exposure to short photoperiod (06/18 hr light‐dark cycle) for 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoperiod (day‐length) has enduring effects on an organism's physiological functions like metabolism and behavioral phenotypes including cognition and affect. Circadian rhythm manipulations are potentially effective non‐pharmacological strategies in the management of central nervous system insults. In our previous study, we demonstrated the efficacy of short photoperiod regime (SPR; 06/18 hr light‐dark cycle) in establishing functional recovery in ventral subicular lesion (VSL) rats. The present study further demonstrates the efficacy of SPR in mitigating anxiety and depression as well as facilitating socio‐cognitive behavior in VSL rats. VSL elevated the basal plasma corticosterone levels, increased anxiety, anhedonia, and behavioral despair with decreased self‐care. The VSL rats also exhibited a considerable degree of impaired social cognition, in terms of altered social preference and social novelty. Exposure to SPR for 21 days mitigated the anxiety‐ and depressive‐like phenotypes as well as improved social cognition significantly. Thus, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of SPR strategy in reversing most of the behavioral deficits caused by VSL. SPR, perhaps, would have regulated the hypothalamo‐pituitary‐adrenal axis responsiveness as we observed a decrease in plasma corticosterone levels following SPR in VSL rats. The study implies the need for developing a task‐dependent SPR strategy to achieve complete behavioral recovery as the functional demands of each behavior is distinct. In summary, the study highlights the efficacy of photoperiod manipulation as a novel, non‐pharmacological approach in mitigating the affective and cognitive deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease wherein circadian rhythm alterations are implicated.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The neural correlates of mindfulness‐induced depression reduction in adults with autism spectrum disorder: A pilot study&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f99f8c07-5e54-4185-b095-8ccade818924/jnr24600-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness‐based therapy reduces depression in adults with autism and increases middle cingulate cortex activation during self‐reflection. Greater reductions in depression were associated with greater increases in middle cingulate activation, suggesting a potential therapeutic mechanism of mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high rates of depression and anxiety, and some evidence suggests mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) is effective in reducing these symptoms. However, the neural mechanisms of symptom alleviation, and benefit of MBSR beyond education/support groups are unknown. Maladaptive forms of self‐reflection are linked to ASD, depression, and anxiety. In this pilot study, we hypothesized (a) MBSR would reduce depression and anxiety in adults with ASD and (b) a mechanism of symptom alleviation would be increased blood oxygen level‐dependent signal in neural self‐reflection hubs. Twenty‐eight adults were randomly assigned to an 8‐week MBSR group (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) or a support group (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13) that met for the same amount of time with relaxation education materials. Based on previous self‐reflection literature in ASD, regions of interest (ROIs) were middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Only the MBSR group demonstrated significant reductions in depression, and neither group significantly changed in anxiety. Only the MBSR group increased activity of right MCC during self‐reflection, and the increase correlated with depression alleviation. There were no changes in vmPFC for the MBSR group or either ROI for the support/education group. Seed‐to‐voxel connectivity analysis revealed that only the MBSR group increased functional connectivity between right MCC and pre/postcentral gyrus, suggesting MBSR may increase primary sensorimotor input to higher order cognitive brain regions. Taken together, MBSR may be effective for reducing depression in adults with ASD, and the neural mechanism may be increasing frontal circuit involvement during self‐directed thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Purinergic modulation of neuronal gap junction circuits in the CNS of the leech&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6c05400d-cb6b-4fe1-aeed-bcae40a69038/jnr24599-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrical synapses in animals can display considerable variability in their permeability and conductances. This study documents how adenosine triphosphate exposure can significantly increase both of these measures in the nervous system of the medicinal leech. These findings highlight a robust mechanism for modifying neuronal circuits and which allows the rapid recruitment of neurons into active networks and promotes the entrainment of synchronized bursting activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gap junctions (GJs) are widely distributed in brains across the animal kingdom. To visualize the GJ‐ coupled networks of two major mechanosensory neurons in the ganglia of medicinal leeches, we injected these cells with the GJ‐permeable tracer Neurobiotin. When diffusion time was limited to only 30 min, tracer coupling was highly variable for both cells, suggesting a possible modulation of GJ permeability. In invertebrates the innexins (homologs of vertebrate pannexins) form the GJs. Because extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) modulates pannexin and leech innexin hemichannel permeability and is released by leech glial cells following injury, we tested the effects of bath application of ATP after the injection of Neurobiotin and observed a significant increase in the number of neurons tracer coupled to the sensory neurons. This effect required the elevation of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and could be produced by bath application of caffeine. Conversely, scavenging endogenous extracellular ATP with the ATPase apyrase decreased the number of coupled cells. ATP also increased electrical conductance and tracer permeability between the bilateral Retzius neurons. This modulatory effect of ATP on GJ coupling was blocked by siRNA knockdown of a P1‐like adenosine receptor. Finally, exposure of leech ganglia to extracellular ATP induced a characteristic low frequency (&amp;lt;0.3 Hz) rhythmic bursting activity that was roughly synchronous among multiple neurons, a behavior that was significantly attenuated by the GJ blocker octanol. These findings highlight the mediation by ATP of a robust physiological mechanism for modifying neuronal circuits by rapidly recruiting neurons into active networks and entraining synchronized bursting activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this invited review, we argue for the need to determine whether appetitive and aversive behaviors, be they goal‐directed or habitual, share overlapping neural circuitry. To motivate our argument, we first summarize what is currently known about the neural circuits governing aversive and appetitive behaviors by focusing first on the three hypothesized phases of avoidance learning, and then on goal‐directed and habitual reward seeking. We then provide several reasons to believe that the neural circuits of appetitive and aversive instrumental behaviors are not completely overlapping. We next discuss an experimental strategy to determine the extent of overlap based on a new computational framework that improves the identification of goal‐directed and habitual actions regardless of valence. Finally, we discuss recent work in obsessive‐compulsive disorder that uses this computational framework to determine whether patients perform appetitive and aversive versions of the same task using the same behavioral strategies and neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The striatal dopamine system has long been studied in the context of reward learning, motivation, and movement. Given the prominent role dopamine plays in a variety of adaptive behavioral states, as well as diseases like addiction, it is essential to understand the full complexity of dopamine neurons and the striatal systems they target. A growing number of studies are uncovering details of the heterogeneity in dopamine neuron subpopulations. Here, we review that work to synthesize current understanding of dopamine system heterogeneity across three levels, anatomical organization, functions in behavior, and modes of action, wherein we focus on signaling profiles and local mechanisms for modulation of dopamine release. Together, these studies reveal new and emerging dimensions of the striatal dopamine system, informing its contribution to dynamic motivational and decision‐making processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits are an important mechanism by which organisms can automate the control of behavior to alleviate cognitive demand. However, transitions to habitual control are risky because they lead to inflexible responding in the face of change. The question of how the brain controls transitions into habit is thus an intriguing one. How do we regulate when our repeated actions become automated? When is it advantageous or disadvantageous to release actions from cognitive control? Decades of research have identified a variety of methods for eliciting habitual responding in animal models. Progress has also been made to understand which brain areas and neural circuits control transitions into habit. Here, I discuss existing research on behavioral and neural circuit models for habit formation (with an emphasis on striatal circuits), and discuss strategies for combining information from different paradigms and levels of analysis to prompt further progress in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding of mirror neurons (MNs) has provided a biological substrate to a new concept of cognition, relating data on actions and perceptions not only to integrate perception in action planning and execution but also as a neural mechanism supporting a wide range of cognitive functions. Here we first summarize data on MN localization and role in primates, then we report findings in normal human subjects: functional magnetic resonance imaging and neurophysiological studies sustain that MNs have a role in motor learning and recognizing actions and intentions of others, and they also support an embodied view of language, empathy, and memory. Then, we detail the results of literature searching on MNs and embodied cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD the network of MN could be altered, but its hyperactivation might support motor and cognitive performances at least in early stages. In the ALS/FTD continuum, preliminary evidence points out to an involvement of the MN network, which could explain language and inter‐subjectivity deficits shown in patients affected by these clinical entities. In the MCI/AD spectrum, a few recent studies suggest a possible progressive involvement from posterior to anterior areas of the MN network, with the brain putting in place compensatory mechanisms in early stages. Reinterpreting neurodegenerative diseases at the light of the new views about brain organization stemming from the discovery of MN could help to better comprehend clinical manifestations and open new pathways to rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe mental retardation, absence of speech, abnormal motor coordination, abnormal EEG, and spontaneous seizure. AS is caused by a deficiency in the ubiquitin ligase E3A (Ube3a) gene product, known to play a dual role as both ubiquitin ligase and transcription coactivator. In AS animal models, multiple Ube3a substrates are accumulated in neurons. So far, studies in mouse models have either aimed at re‐expressing Ube3a or manipulating downstream signaling pathways. Reintroducing Ube3a in AS mice showed promising results but may have two caveats. First, it may cause an overdosage in the Ube3a expression, which in turn is known to contribute to autism spectrum disorders. Second, in mutation cases, the exogenous Ube3a may have to compete with the mutated endogenous form. Such two caveats left spaces for developing therapies or interventions directed to targets downstream Ube3a. Notably, Ube3a expression is dynamically regulated by neuronal activity and plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity. The abnormal synaptic plasticity uncovered in AS mice has been frequently rescued, but circuits symptoms like seizure are resistant to treatment. Future investigations are needed to further clarify the function (s) of Ube3a during development. Here I reviewed the recently identified major Ube3a substrates and signaling pathways involved in AS pathology, the Ube3a expression, imprinting and evolution, the AS mouse models that have been generated and inspired therapeutic potentials, and finally proposed some future explorations to better understand the AS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, many studies have focused on clarifying the roles of different N‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits in cerebral ischemia, hoping to develop subunit‐selective drugs. Recently, more attention was given to studying the role of GluN2C in ischemia damage, which may lead to the development of new NMDA receptor antagonists for cerebral ischemia. Results showed that GluN2C inhibition or knockout can effectively alleviate the ischemic injury caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion and, contrarily, can aggravate the damage to hippocampal CA1 circuit caused by transient global cerebral ischemia. These results indicate the complicated roles of GluN2C in cerebral ischemia. In this minireview, we focus on these findings, describe the roles of GluN2C from different cell origins in ischemic damage, and explain the above inconsistent experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks, endogenous oscillators generating daily biological rhythms, have important roles in the nervous system to control diverse cellular processes—not only in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where the master clocks reside to synchronize all circadian clocks in the body but also in other non‐SCN areas. Accumulating evidence has shown relationships between circadian abnormalities (e.g., sleep disturbances and abnormal rest–activity rhythms) and disease progressions in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) disease. Although circadian abnormalities were frequently considered as consequences of disease onsets, recent studies suggest altered circadian clocks as risk factors to develop neurodegenerative diseases via altered production or clearance rates of toxic metabolites like amyloid β. In this review, we will summarize circadian clock‐related pathologies in the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the central nervous system, AD and PD. Then, we will introduce the current clinical trials to rescue circadian abnormalities in AD and PD patients. Finally, a discussion about how to improve targeting circadian clocks to increase treatment efficiencies and specificities will be followed. This discussion will provide insight into circadian clocks as potential therapeutic targets to attenuate onsets and progressions of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal‐directed action refers to selecting behaviors based on the expectation that they will be reinforced with desirable outcomes. It is typically conceptualized as opposing habit‐based behaviors, which are instead supported by stimulus–response associations and insensitive to consequences. The prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) is positioned along the medial wall of the rodent prefrontal cortex. It is indispensable for action–outcome‐driven (goal‐directed) behavior, consolidating action–outcome relationships and linking contextual information with instrumental behavior. In this brief review, we will discuss the growing list of molecular factors involved in PL function. Ventral to the PL is the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). We will also summarize emerging evidence from rodents (complementing existing literature describing humans) that it too is involved in action–outcome conditioning. We describe experiments using procedures that quantify responding based on reward value, the likelihood of reinforcement, or effort requirements, touching also on experiments assessing food consumption more generally. We synthesize these findings with the argument that the mOFC is essential to goal‐directed action when outcome value information is not immediately observable and must be recalled and inferred.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active reward pursuit is supported by the balance between the cognitive and habitual control of behavior. The cognitive, goal‐directed strategy relies on the prospective evaluation of anticipated consequences, which allows behavior to readily adapt when circumstances change. Repetition of successful actions promotes less cognitively taxing habits, in which behavior is automatically executed without prospective consideration. Disruption in either of these behavioral regulatory systems contributes to the symptoms that underlie many psychiatric disorders. Here, I review recently identified neural substrates, at multiple neural levels, that contribute to habits and outline gaps in knowledge that must be addressed to fully understand the neural mechanisms of behavioral control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal‐directed and habitual decision‐making are fundamental processes that support the ongoing adaptive behavior. There is a growing interest in examining their disruption in psychiatric disease, often with a focus on a disease shifting control from one process to the other, usually a shift from goal‐directed to habitual control. However, several different experimental procedures can be used to probe whether decision‐making is under goal‐directed or habitual control, including outcome devaluation and contingency degradation. These different experimental procedures may recruit diverse behavioral and neural processes. Thus, there are potentially many opportunities for these disease phenotypes to manifest as alterations to both goal‐directed and habitual controls. In this review, we highlight the examples of behavioral and neural circuit divergence and similarity, and suggest that interpretation based on behavioral processes recruited during testing may leave more room for goal‐directed and habitual decision‐making to coexist. Furthermore, this may improve our understanding of precisely &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; the involved neural mechanisms underlying aspects of goal‐directed and habitual behavior are, as well as how disease affects behavior and these circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Learning leads to changes in population patterns of neural activity. In this study we wanted to examine how these changes in patterns of activity affect the dimensionality of neural responses and information about choices. We addressed these questions by carrying out high channel count recordings in dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 768 electrodes) while monkeys performed a two-armed bandit reinforcement learning task. The high channel count recordings allowed us to study population coding while monkeys learned choices between actions or objects. We found that the dimensionality of neural population activity was higher across blocks in which animals learned the values of novel pairs of objects, than across blocks in which they learned the values of actions. The increase in dimensionality with learning in object blocks was related to less shared information across blocks, and therefore patterns of neural activity that were less similar, when compared to learning in action blocks. Furthermore, these differences emerged with learning, and were not a simple function of the choice of a visual image or action. Therefore, learning the values of novel objects increases the dimensionality of neural representations in dlPFC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KUb9aJqcgf8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ljp7gPlfShU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels have been proposed to modulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and determine oscillatory Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Here, we report that TRIC-A–mediated amplitude and frequency modulation of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2)-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R)-induced cytosolic signals is based on attenuating store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE). Further, TRIC-A–dependent delay in ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store refilling contributes to shaping the pattern of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations. Upon ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; depletion, TRIC-A clusters with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-release–activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel 1 (Orai1) within ER–plasma membrane (PM) junctions and impairs assembly of the STIM1/Orai1 complex, causing a decrease in Orai1-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current and SOCE. Together, our findings demonstrate that TRIC-A is a negative regulator of STIM1/Orai1 function. Thus, aberrant SOCE could contribute to muscle disorders associated with loss of TRIC-A.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QB6hSmTAL_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation is described as normal or near to normal performance in Parkinson's disease (PD), despite the ongoing neural loss. Functional compensation typically proceeds in an inverse U‐shaped manner: compensation initiates in the prodromal phase, followed by an increasing episode until plateauing and diminishes in the advanced stages of the disease. The first evidence of the structural compensation was reported by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Recent studies, which have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as the basis for their investigation, have shown improved white matter diffusional properties both in motor‐ and non‐motor‐related structures in association with improved clinical scores in patients with PD. The majority of DTI studies have demonstrated microstructural compensation in the prodromal/early stages of PD at the regional scale. However, there have been reports of compensation in later stages of the disease and the whole‐brain/network scale that are probably due to the heterogeneous nature of PD. Although serving as a promising beginning to characterize compensation, lots remain to be clarified in understanding the underlying mechanisms of compensation and its structural pattern in PD. The existing knowledge gap necessitates studies that their main research questions are focused on structural compensation. This requirement becomes more apparent because structural compensation evidence has mostly emerged from the post hoc analysis of data and incidental findings of studies. Thus, future studies are required to investigate compensatory microstructural changes in PD to clarify the exact underlying mechanisms. These studies would also provide a basis to develop clinical improvements in the early diagnosis and management of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have increased in women by 84% relative to a 35% increase in men. Rates of alcohol use and high‐risk drinking have also increased in women by 16% and 58% relative to a 7% and 16% increase in men, respectively, over the last decade. This robust increase in drinking among women highlights the critical need to identify the underlying neural mechanisms that may contribute to problematic alcohol consumption across sex/gender (SG), especially given that many neuroimaging studies are underpowered to detect main or interactive effects of SG on imaging outcomes. This narrative review aims to explore the recent neuroimaging literature on SG differences in brain function and structure as it pertains to alcohol across positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging modalities in humans. Additional work using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and event‐related potentials to examine SG differences in AUD will be covered. Overall, current research on the neuroimaging of AUD, alcohol consumption, or risk of AUD is limited, and findings are mixed regarding the effect of SG on neurochemical, structural, and functional mechanisms associated with AUD. We address SG disparities in the neuroimaging of AUD and propose a call to action to include women in brain imaging research. Future studies are crucial to our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of AUD across neural systems and the vulnerability for AUD among women and men.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Visuomotor feedback responses vary in intensity throughout a reach, commonly explained by optimal control. Here, we show that the optimal control for a range of movements with the same goal can be simplified to a time-to-target dependent control scheme. We measure our human participants’ visuomotor responses in five reaching conditions, each with different hand or cursor kinematics. Participants only produced different feedback responses when these kinematic changes resulted in different times-to-target. We complement our experimental data with a range of finite and non-finite horizon optimal feedback control (OFC) models, finding that the model with time-to-target as one of the input parameters best replicates the experimental data. Overall, this suggests that time-to-target is a critical control parameter in online feedback control. Moreover, we propose that for a specific task and known dynamics, humans can instantly produce a control signal without any additional online computation allowing rapid response onset and close to optimal control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Feeding, a critical behavior for survival, consists of a complex series of behavioral steps. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, the initial steps of feeding are food choice, during which the quality of a potential food source is judged, and ingestion, during which the selected food source is ingested into the digestive tract. It remains unclear whether these steps employ different mechanisms of neural perception. Here, we provide insight into the two initial steps of feeding in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larva. We find that substrate choice and ingestion are determined by independent circuits at the cellular level. First, we took 22 candidate bitter compounds and examined their influence on choice preference and ingestion behavior. Interestingly, certain bitter tastants caused different responses in choice and ingestion, suggesting distinct mechanisms of perception. We further provide evidence that certain gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the external terminal organ (TO) are involved in determining choice preference, and a pair of larval pharyngeal GRNs is involved in mediating both avoidance and suppression of ingestion. Our results show that feeding behavior is coordinated by a multistep regulatory process employing relatively independent neural elements. These findings are consistent with a model in which distinct sensory pathways act as modulatory circuits controlling distinct subprograms during feeding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Visual search performance varies with stimulus and response history. Priming of pop-out refers to increased accuracy and reduced response time with repeated presentation of particular singleton and distractor features (e.g., a red target among green distractor stimuli), which are abruptly impaired when singleton and distractor features swap (e.g., green target among red distractors). Meanwhile, inhibition of return refers to the slowing of response time when target location repeats. Neurophysiological correlates of both these phenomena have been reported in the frontal eye field (FEF), an area in the frontal lobe contributing to attentional selection and eye movement planning. To understand the mechanistic origin of these adaptive behaviors, we investigated visual cortical area V4, an area providing input to and receiving feedback from FEF, during feature-based priming of pop-out and location-based inhibition of return. Performing a color pop-out task, monkeys exhibited pronounced priming of pop-out and inhibition of return. Neural spiking from V4 revealed earlier target selection associated with priming of pop-out and delayed selection associated with inhibition of return. These results demonstrate substantial involvement of extrastriate visual cortex in behavioral priming and inhibition of return.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neural oscillations at ~10 Hz, called alpha oscillations, are one of the most prominent components of neural oscillations in the human brain. In recent years, characteristics (power/frequency/phase) of occipital alpha oscillations have been correlated with various perceptual phenomena. However, the relationship between inter-individual differences in alpha oscillatory characteristics and the properties of the underlying brain structures, such as white matter pathways, is unclear. A possibility is that intrinsic occipital alpha oscillations are mediated by thalamocortical interaction; we hypothesized that the most promising candidate for characterizing the intrinsic alpha oscillation is optic radiation (OR), which is the geniculo-cortical pathway carrying signals between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). We used resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion-weighted/quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (dMRI/qMRI) to correlate the frequency and power of occipital alpha oscillations with the tissue properties of the OR by focusing on the different characteristics across individuals. We found that the peak alpha frequency (PAF) negatively correlated with intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), reflecting diffusion properties in intracellular (axonal) space, whereas the peak alpha power was not correlated with any tissue properties measurements. No significant correlation was found between OR and beta frequency/amplitude or between other white matter tract connecting parietal and inferotemporal cortex and alpha frequency/amplitude. These results support the hypothesis that an interaction between thalamic nuclei and early visual areas is essential for the occipital alpha oscillatory rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Human observers perceptually discriminate the dynamic deformation of materials in the real world. However, the psychophysical and neural mechanisms responsible for the perception of dynamic deformation have not been fully elucidated. By using a deforming bar as the stimulus, we showed that the spatial frequency of deformation was a critical determinant of deformation perception. Simulating the response of direction-selective units (i.e., MT pattern motion cells) to stimuli, we found that the perception of dynamic deformation was well explained by assuming a higher-order mechanism monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses. Our model with the higher-order mechanism also successfully explained the appearance of a visual illusion wherein a static bar apparently deforms against a tilted drifting grating. In particular, it was the lower spatial frequencies in this pattern that strongly contributed to the deformation perception. Finally, by manipulating the luminance of the static bar, we observed that the mechanism for the illusory deformation was more sensitive to luminance than contrast cues.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Nomen est omen, cognitive dissonance, and homology of memory centers in crustaceans and insects&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9b914101-1c41-4934-9189-f45f9d941600/cne24919-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1882, the Italian morphologist Giuseppe Bellonci correctly observed that crustaceans possess mushroom bodies, a finding only recently becoming substantiated: here the title page of his paper and a lithograph in it.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1882, the Italian embryologist Giuseppe Bellonci introduced a nomenclature for structures in the stomatopod crustacean &lt;i&gt;Squilla mantis&lt;/i&gt; that he claimed correspond to insect mushroom bodies, today recognized as cardinal centers that in insects mediate associative memory. The use of Bellonci's terminology has, through a series of misunderstandings and entrenched opinions, led to contesting views regarding whether centers in crustacean and insect brains that occupy corresponding locations and receive comparable multisensory inputs are homologous or homoplasic. The following describes the fate of terms used to denote sensory association neuropils in crustacean species and relates how those terms were deployed in the 1920s and 1930s by the Swedish neuroanatomist Bertil Hanström to claim homology in insects and crustaceans. Yet the same terminology has been repurposed by subsequent researchers to promote the very opposite view: that mushroom bodies are a derived trait of hexapods and that equivalent centers in crustaceans evolved independently.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is supposed to play a key role in long‐term memory consolidation transferring information from hippocampus to neocortex. However, sleep also activates epileptic activities in medial temporal regions. This study investigated whether interictal hippocampal spikes during sleep would impair long‐term memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively measured visual and verbal memory performance in 20 patients with epilepsy investigated with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) at immediate, 30‐minute, and 1‐week delays, and studied the correlations between interictal hippocampal spike frequency during waking and the first cycle of NREM sleep and memory performance, taking into account the number of seizures occurring during the consolidation period and other possible confounding factors, such as age and epilepsy duration.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retention of verbal memory over 1 week was negatively correlated with hippocampal spike frequency during sleep, whereas no significant correlation was found with hippocampal interictal spikes during waking. No significant result was found for visual memory. Regression tree analysis showed that the number of seizures was the first factor that impaired the verbal memory retention between 30 minutes and 1 week. When the number of seizures was below 5, spike frequency during sleep higher than 13 minutes was associated with impaired memory retention over 1 week.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that activation of interictal spikes in the hippocampus during sleep and seizures specifically impair long‐term memory consolidation. We hypothesize that hippocampal interictal spikes during sleep interrupt hippocampal‐neocortical transfer of information. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Action potentials arriving at a nerve terminal activate voltage-gated calcium channels and set the electrical driving force for calcium entry which affects the amount and duration of neurotransmitter release. During propagation, the duration, amplitude, and shape of action potentials often changes. This affects calcium entry, and can cause large changes in neurotransmitter release. Here, we have used a series of amplitude and area matched stimuli to examine how the shape and amplitude of a stimulus affect calcium influx at a presynaptic nerve terminal in the mammalian brain. We identify fundamental differences in calcium entry following calcium channel activation by a standard voltage jump vs. an action potential-like stimulation. We also tested a series of action potential-like stimuli with the same amplitude, duration, and stimulus area, but differing in their rise and decay times. We find that a stimulus that matches the rise and decay times of a physiological action potential produces a calcium channel response that is optimized over a range of peak amplitudes. Next, we determined the relative number of calcium channels that are active at different times during an action potential, which is important in the context of how local calcium domains trigger neurotransmitter release. We find the depolarizing phase of an AP-like stimulus only opens ~20% of the maximum number of calcium channels that can be activated. Channels continue to activate during the falling phase of the action potential, with peak calcium channel activation occurring near 0 mV. Although less than 25% of calcium channels are active at the end of the action potential, these calcium channels will generate a larger local calcium concentration that will increase the release probability for nearby vesicles. Determining the change in open probability of presynaptic calcium channels, and taking into account how local calcium concentration also changes throughout the action potential are both necessary to fully understand how the action potential triggers neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is regarded as a synaptopathy with a long presymptomatic phase. Soluble, oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to play a causative role in this disease, which eventually leads to cognitive decline. However, most animal studies have employed mice expressing high levels of the Aβ precursor protein (APP) transgene to drive pathology. Here, to understand how the principal neurons in different brain regions cope with moderate, chronically present levels of Aβ, we employed transgenic mice expressing equal levels of mouse and human APP carrying a combination of three familial AD (FAD)-linked mutations (Swedish, Dutch, and London), that develop plaques only in old age. We analyzed dendritic spine parameters in hippocampal and cortical brain regions after targeted expression of EGFP to allow high-resolution imaging, followed by algorithm-based evaluation of mice of both sexes from adolescence to old age. We report that Aβ species gradually accumulated throughout the life of APP&lt;sub&gt;SDL&lt;/sub&gt; mice, but not the oligomeric forms, and that the amount of membrane-associated oligomers decreased at the onset of plaque formation. We observed an age-dependent loss of thin spines under most conditions as an indicator of a loss of synaptic plasticity in older mice. We further found that hippocampal pyramidal neurons respond to increased Aβ levels by lowering spine density and shifting spine morphology, which reached significance in the CA1 subfield. In contrast, the spine density in cortical pyramidal neurons of APP&lt;sub&gt;SDL&lt;/sub&gt; mice was unchanged. We also observed an increase in the protein levels of PSD-95 and Arc in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. Our data demonstrated that increased concentrations of Aβ have diverse effects on dendritic spines in the brain and suggest that hippocampal and cortical neurons have different adaptive and compensatory capacity during their lifetime. Our data also indicated that spine morphology differs between sexes in a region-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common side effect of antipsychotic treatment. This movement disorder consists of orofacial and limb-truncal components. The present study is aimed at investigating the role of serotonin receptors (HTR) in modulating tardive dyskinesia by genotyping patients with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A set of 29 SNPs of genes of serotonin receptors HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR3A, HTR3B, and HTR6 was studied in a population of 449 Caucasians (226 females and 223 males) with verified clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (according to ICD-10: F20). Five SNPs were excluded because of low minor allele frequency or for not passing the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. Affinity of antipsychotics to 5-HT2 receptors was defined according to previous publications. Genotyping was carried out with SEQUENOM Mass Array Analyzer 4.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Statistically significant associations of rs1928040 of HTR2A gene in groups of patients with orofacial type of TD and total diagnosis of TD was found for alleles, and a statistical trend for genotypes. Moreover, statistically significant associations were discovered in the female group for rs1801412 of HTR2C for alleles and genotypes. Excluding patients who used HTR2A, respectively, HTR2C antagonists changed little to the associations of HTR2A polymorphisms, but caused a major change of the magnitude of the association of HTR2C variants. Due to the low patient numbers, these sub-analyses did not have significant results.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We found significant associations in rs1928040 of HTR2A and for rs1801412 of X-bound HTR2C in female patients. The associations were particularly related to the orofacial type of TD. Excluding patients using relevant antagonists particularly affected rs1801412, but not rs1928040-related associations. This suggest that rs1801412 is directly or indirectly linked to the functioning of HTR2C. Further study of variants of the HTR2C gene in a larger group of male patients who were not using HTR2C antagonists is necessary in order to verify a possible functional role of this receptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ion channels are expressed throughout nervous system development. The type and diversity of conductances and gating mechanisms vary at different developmental stages and with the progressive maturational status of neural cells. The variety of ion channels allows for distinct signaling mechanisms in developing neural cells that in turn regulate the needed cellular processes taking place during each developmental period. These include neural cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, which are crucial for developmental events ranging from the earliest steps of morphogenesis of the neural tube through the establishment of neuronal circuits. Here, we compile studies assessing the ontogeny of ionic currents in the developing nervous system. We then review work demonstrating a role for ion channels in neural tube formation, to underscore the necessity of the signaling downstream ion channels even at the earliest stages of neural development. We discuss the function of ion channels in neural cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation and conclude with how the regulation of all these morphogenetic and cellular processes by electrical activity enables the appropriate development of the nervous system and the establishment of functional circuits adapted to respond to a changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Immunologic function is an important determinant of cognition. Here we examined the contribution of early immune signatures to cognitive performance among HIV-infected, virally suppressed women (HIV+VS) and in HIV-uninfected (HIV-) women. Specifically, we measured serum inflammatory markers, developed combinatory immune signatures, and evaluated their associations with cognition. Forty-nine HIV+VS women in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) who achieved viral suppression shortly after effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and 56 matched HIV− women were selected. Forty-two serum inflammatory markers were measured within 2 years of effective ART initiation for HIV+VS women, and at an initial timepoint for HIV− women. The same inflammatory markers were also measured approximately 1, 7, and 12 years later for all women. Of the 105 women with complete immune data, 83 (34 HIV+VS, 49 HIV−) also had cognitive data available 12 years later at ≥1 time points (median = 3.1). We searched for combinatory immune signatures by adapting a dynamic matrix factorization analytic method that builds upon Tucker decomposition followed by Ingenuity&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Pathway Analysis to facilitate data interpretation. Seven combinatory immune signatures emerged based on the Frobenius residual. Three signatures were common between HIV+VS and HIV− women, while four signatures were unique. These inflammatory signatures predicted subsequent cognitive performance in both groups using mixed-effects modeling, but more domain-specific associations were significant in HIV+VS than HIV− women. Leukocyte influx into brain was a major contributor to cognitive function in HIV+VS women, while T cell exhaustion, inflammatory response indicative of depressive/psychiatric disorders, microglial activity, and cytokine signaling predicted both global and domain-specific performance for HIV− women. Our findings suggest that immune signatures may be useful diagnostic, prognostic, and immunotherapeutic targets predictive of subsequent cognitive performance. Importantly, they also provide insight into common and distinct inflammatory mechanisms underlying cognition in HIV− and HIV+VS women.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) causes impaired movement and cognition. PD can involve profound changes in cortical and subcortical brain activity as measured by electroencephalography or intracranial recordings of local field potentials (LFP). Such signals can adaptively guide deep-brain stimulation (DBS) as part of PD therapy. However, adaptive DBS requires the identification of triggers of neuronal activity dependent on real time monitoring and analysis. Current methods do not always identify PD-related signals and can entail delays. We test an alternative approach based on linear predictive coding (LPC), which fits autoregressive (AR) models to time-series data. Parameters of these AR models can be calculated by fast algorithms in real time. We compare LFPs from the striatum in an animal model of PD with dopamine depletion in the absence and presence of the dopamine precursor levodopa, which is used to treat motor symptoms of PD. We show that in dopamine-depleted mice a first order AR model characterized by a single LPC parameter obtained by LFP sampling at 1 kHz for just 1 min can distinguish between levodopa-treated and saline-treated mice and outperform current methods. This suggests that LPC may be useful in online analysis of neuronal signals to guide DBS in real time and could contribute to DBS-based treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Single cell neuronal activity (SUA) and local field potentials (LFP) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of unmedicated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery have been well-characterized during microelectrode recordings (MER). However, there is limited knowledge about the changes in the firing patterns and oscillations above and within the territories of STN after the intake of dopaminergic medication. Here, for the first time, we report the STN single cell and oscillatory neural dynamics in a medicated patient with idiopathic PD using intraoperative MER. We recorded LFP and SUA with microelectrodes at various depths during bilateral STN-DBS electrode implantation. We isolated 26 neurons in total and observed that tonic and irregular firing patterns of individual neurons predominated throughout the territories of STN. While burst-type firings have been well-characterized in the dorsal territories of STN in unmedicated patients, interestingly, this activity was not observed in our medicated subject. LFP recordings lacked the excessive beta (8–30 Hz) activity, characteristic of the unmedicated state and signal energy was mainly dominated by slow oscillations below 8 Hz. We observed sharp gamma oscillations between 70 and 90 Hz within and above the STN. Despite the presence of a broadband high frequency activity in 200–400 Hz range, no cross-frequency interaction in the form of phase-amplitude coupling was noted between low and high frequency oscillations of LFPs. While our results are in agreement with the previously reported LFP recordings from the DBS lead in medicated PD patients, the sharp gamma peak present throughout the depth recordings and the lack of bursting firings after levodopa intake have not been reported before. The lack of bursting in SUA, the lack of excessive beta activity and cross frequency coupling between HFOs and lower rhythms further validate the link between bursting firing regime of neurons and pathological oscillatory neural activity in PD-STN. Overall, these observations not only validate the existing literature on the PD electrophysiology in healthy/medicated animal models but also provide insights regarding the underlying electro-pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in PD patients through demonstration of multiscale relationships between single cell firings and field potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Speech-induced suppression is the normal, relative amplitude reduction of the auditory evoked potential for self-, compared to externally-generated, auditory stimulation. It remains controversial as to whether adults who stutter exhibit expected auditory modulation during speech; some studies have reported a significant difference between stuttering and fluent groups in speech-induced suppression during speech movement planning, while others have not. We compared auditory evoked potentials (N1 component) for auditory feedback arising from one’s own voice (Speaking condition) with passive listening to a recording of one’s own voice (Listening condition) in 24 normally-fluent speakers and 16 adults who stutter under various delayed auditory feedback (DAF) time conditions (100 ms, 200 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000 ms). We presented the participant’s own voice with a delay, immediately after presenting it without a delay. Our working hypothesis was that the shorter the delay time, the more likely the delayed sound is perceived as self-generated. Therefore, shorter delay time conditions are proposed to result in relatively enhanced suppression of the auditory system. Results showed that in fluent speakers, the shorter the delay time, the more the auditory evoked potential in the Speaking condition tended to be suppressed. In the Listening condition, there was a larger evoked potential with shorter delay times. As a result, speech-induced suppression was only significant at the short delay time conditions of 100 and 200 ms. Adults who stutter did not show the opposing changes in the Speaking and Listening conditions seen in the fluent group. Although the evoked potential in the Listening condition tended to decrease as the delay time increased, that in the Speaking condition did not show a distinct trend, and there was a significant suppression only at 200 ms delay. For the 200 ms delay condition, speakers with more severe stuttering showed significantly greater speech-induced suppression than those with less severe stuttering. This preliminary study suggests our methods for investigating evoked potentials by presenting own voice with a delay may provide a clue as to the nature of auditory modulation in stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Insights into brain anatomy are important for the early detection of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as dyslexia. FreeSurfer is one of the most frequently applied automatized software tools to study brain morphology. However, quality control of the outcomes provided by FreeSurfer is often ignored and could lead to wrong statistical inferences. Additional manual editing of the data may be a solution, although not without a cost in time and resources. Past research in adults on comparing the automatized method of FreeSurfer with and without additional manual editing indicated that although editing may lead to significant differences in morphological measures between the methods in some regions, it does not substantially change the sensitivity to detect clinical differences. Given that automated approaches are more likely to fail in pediatric—and inherently more noisy—data, we investigated in the current study whether FreeSurfer can be applied fully automatically or additional manual edits of T1-images are needed in a pediatric sample. Specifically, cortical thickness and surface area measures with and without additional manual edits were compared in six regions of interest (ROIs) of the reading network in 5-to-6-year-old children with and without dyslexia. Results revealed that additional editing leads to statistical differences in the morphological measures, but that these differences are consistent across subjects and that the sensitivity to reveal statistical differences in the morphological measures between children with and without dyslexia is not affected, even though conclusions of marginally significant findings can differ depending on the method used. Thereby, our results indicate that additional manual editing of reading-related regions in FreeSurfer has limited gain for pediatric samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The perceptron learning algorithm and its multiple-layer extension, the backpropagation algorithm, are the foundations of the present-day machine learning revolution. However, these algorithms utilize a highly simplified mathematical abstraction of a neuron; it is not clear to what extent real biophysical neurons with morphologically-extended non-linear dendritic trees and conductance-based synapses can realize perceptron-like learning. Here we implemented the perceptron learning algorithm in a realistic biophysical model of a layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell with a full complement of non-linear dendritic channels. We tested this biophysical perceptron (BP) on a classification task, where it needed to correctly binarily classify 100, 1,000, or 2,000 patterns, and a generalization task, where it was required to discriminate between two “noisy” patterns. We show that the BP performs these tasks with an accuracy comparable to that of the original perceptron, though the classification capacity of the apical tuft is somewhat limited. We concluded that cortical pyramidal neurons can act as powerful classification devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The exquisite intricacies of neural circuits are fundamental to an animal’s diverse and complex repertoire of sensory and motor functions. The ability to precisely map neural circuits and to selectively manipulate neural activity is critical to understanding brain function and has, therefore been a long-standing goal for neuroscientists. The recent development of optogenetic tools, combined with transgenic mouse lines, has endowed us with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision in circuit analysis. These advances greatly expand the scope of tractable experimental investigations. Here, in the first half of the review, we will present applications of optogenetics in identifying connectivity between different local neuronal cell types and of long-range projections with both in vitro and in vivo methods. We will then discuss how these tools can be used to reveal the functional roles of these cell-type specific connections in governing sensory information processing, and learning and memory in the visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, and motor cortex. Finally, we will discuss the prospect of new optogenetic tools and how their application can further advance modern neuroscience. In summary, this review serves as a primer to exemplify how optogenetics can be used in sophisticated modern circuit analyses at the levels of synapses, cells, network connectivity and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Applying serotonergic (5-HT) agonists or grafting of fetal serotonergic cells into the spinal cord improves locomotion after spinal cord injury. Little is known about the role of 5-HT receptors in the control of voluntary locomotion, so we administered inverse agonists of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Cyproheptadine; Cypr), 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; neutral antagonist (Volinanserin; Volin), 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; neutral antagonist (SB 242084), and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/2C&lt;/sub&gt; inverse agonist (SB 206553) receptors intrathecally in intact rats and monitored their effects on unrestrained locomotion. An intrathecal cannula was introduced at the low thoracic level and pushed caudally until the tip reached the L2/L3 or L5/L6 spinal segments. Locomotor performance was evaluated using EMG activity of hindlimb muscles during locomotion on a 2 m long runway. Motoneuron excitability was estimated using EMG recordings during dorsi- and plantar flexion at the ankle. Locomotion was dramatically impaired after the blockage of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. The effect of Cypr was more pronounced than that of Volin since in the L5/L6 rats Cypr (but not Volin) induced significant alteration of the strength of interlimb coordination followed by total paralysis. These agents significantly decreased locomotor EMG amplitude and abolished or substantially decreased stretch reflexes. Blocking 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors had no effect either on locomotion or reflexes. We suggest that in intact rats serotonin controls timing and amplitude of muscle activity by acting on 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on both CPG interneurons and motoneurons, while 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are not involved in control of the locomotor pattern in lumbar spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) has very limited regenerative capacity upon neural injuries or under degenerative conditions. In recent years, however, significant progress has been made on in vivo cell fate reprogramming for neural regeneration. Resident glial cells can be reprogrammed into neuronal progenitors and mature neurons in the CNS of adult mammals. In this review article, we briefly summarize the current knowledge on innate adult neurogenesis under pathological conditions and then focus on induced neurogenesis through cell fate reprogramming. We discuss how the reprogramming process can be regulated and raise critical issues requiring careful considerations to move the field forward. With emerging evidence, we envision that fate reprogramming-based regenerative medicine will have a great potential for treating neurological conditions such as brain injury, spinal cord injury (SCI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Trans-endothelial migration (TEM) of cancer cells is a critical step in metastasis. Micro-vascular barrier disruptions of distant organs play important roles in tumor cells TEM. The spine is a preferred site for multiple cancer cell metastases. Our previous study found that vertebral spongy bone was rich in CX3CL1 and that CX3CL1 can attract fractalkine receptor-expressing tumor cells to the spine. In the present study, we determined whether CX3CL1 was involved in vertebral micro-vascular barrier disruption and promoted tumor cell TEM after circulating tumor cells were arrested in the vertebral micro-vasculature. We examined the role of CX3CL1 in the barrier function of vertebral micro-vascular endothelial cells (VMECs) and explored the molecular mechanisms of CX3CL1-induced VMEC barrier disruption. Our results demonstrated that CX3CL1 led to F-actin formation and ZO-1 disruption in VMECs and induced the vertebral micro-vascular barrier disruption. Importantly, we found that the activation of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway plays an important role in CX3CL1-induced VMEC stress fiber formation, ZO-1 disruption and then vertebral micro-vascular barrier hyper-permeability. Inhibiting Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling in VMECs effectively blocked CX3CL1-induced vertebral vascular endothelial dysfunction and subsequent tumor cell TEM. The results of this study and our previous study indicate that in addition to its chemotaxis, CX3CL1 plays a critical role in regulating vertebral micro-vascular barrier function and tumor cell TEM. CX3CL1 induced VMECs stress fiber formation, ZO-1 disruption and then vascular endothelial hyperpermeability via activation of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway. The inhibition of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway in VMECs effectively blocked tumor cells TEMs in vertebral spongy bone and maybe a potential therapeutic strategy for spine metastases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Excitotoxicity is a phenomenon that describes the toxic actions of excitatory neurotransmitters, primarily glutamate, where the exacerbated or prolonged activation of glutamate receptors starts a cascade of neurotoxicity that ultimately leads to the loss of neuronal function and cell death. In this process, the shift between normal physiological function and excitotoxicity is largely controlled by astrocytes since they can control the levels of glutamate on the synaptic cleft. This control is achieved through glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft and its underlying recycling through the glutamate-glutamine cycle. The molecular mechanism that triggers excitotoxicity involves alterations in glutamate and calcium metabolism, dysfunction of glutamate transporters, and malfunction of glutamate receptors, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR). On the other hand, excitotoxicity can be regarded as a consequence of other cellular phenomena, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, physical neuronal damage, and oxidative stress. Regardless, it is known that the excessive activation of NMDAR results in the sustained influx of calcium into neurons and leads to several deleterious consequences, including mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, impairment of calcium buffering, the release of pro-apoptotic factors, among others, that inevitably contribute to neuronal loss. A large body of evidence implicates NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity as a central mechanism in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and epilepsy. In this review article, we explore different causes and consequences of excitotoxicity, discuss the involvement of NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity and its downstream effects on several neurodegenerative disorders, and identify possible strategies to study new aspects of these diseases that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. With the understanding that excitotoxicity is a common denominator in neurodegenerative diseases and other disorders, a new perspective on therapy can be considered, where the targets are not specific symptoms, but the underlying cellular phenomena of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Until now, existing methods for identifying lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules mainly rely on lncRNA related miRNA sponge interaction networks, which may not provide a full picture of miRNA sponging activities in biological conditions. Hence there is a strong need of new computational methods to identify lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules. In this work, we propose a framework, LMSM, to identify LncRNA related MiRNA Sponge Modules from heterogeneous data. To understand the miRNA sponging activities in biological conditions, LMSM uses gene expression data to evaluate the influence of the shared miRNAs on the clustered sponge lncRNAs and mRNAs. We have applied LMSM to the human breast cancer (BRCA) dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As a result, we have found that the majority of LMSM modules are significantly implicated in BRCA and most of them are BRCA subtype-specific. Most of the mediating miRNAs act as crosslinks across different LMSM modules, and all of LMSM modules are statistically significant. Multi-label classification analysis shows that the performance of LMSM modules is significantly higher than baseline’s performance, indicating the biological meanings of LMSM modules in classifying BRCA subtypes. The consistent results suggest that LMSM is robust in identifying lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules. Moreover, LMSM can be used to predict miRNA targets. Finally, LMSM outperforms a graph clustering-based strategy in identifying BRCA-related modules. Altogether, our study shows that LMSM is a promising method to investigate modular regulatory mechanism of sponge lncRNAs from heterogeneous data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l-ra7e3ldqI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Electrical stimulation of neural systems is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical treatments. Many applications of electrical stimulation affect large populations of neurons. However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We evaluate a reduced mean-field model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons which can be used to efficiently study the effects of electrical stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties of this basic cortical model are described in detail and validated using large network simulations. Bifurcation diagrams reflecting the network’s state reveal asynchronous up- and down-states, bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. The biophysical parameters of the AdEx neuron can be coupled to an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated up to the population description. We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct electrical inputs cause network state transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating that field effects are strongly amplified in the network. The effects of time-varying external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7zMWipN6ZMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Converging theories suggest that organisms learn and exploit probabilistic models of their environment. However, it remains unclear how such models can be learned in practice. The open-ended complexity of natural environments means that it is generally infeasible for organisms to model their environment comprehensively. Alternatively, &lt;i&gt;action-oriented&lt;/i&gt; models attempt to encode a parsimonious representation of adaptive agent-environment interactions. One approach to learning action-oriented models is to learn online in the presence of goal-directed behaviours. This constrains an agent to behaviourally relevant trajectories, reducing the diversity of the data a model need account for. Unfortunately, this approach can cause models to prematurely converge to sub-optimal solutions, through a process we refer to as a &lt;i&gt;bad-bootstrap&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we exploit the normative framework of &lt;i&gt;active inference&lt;/i&gt; to show that efficient action-oriented models can be learned by balancing goal-oriented and epistemic (&lt;i&gt;information-seeking&lt;/i&gt;) behaviours in a principled manner. We illustrate our approach using a simple agent-based model of bacterial chemotaxis. We first demonstrate that learning via goal-directed behaviour indeed constrains models to behaviorally relevant aspects of the environment, but that this approach is prone to sub-optimal convergence. We then demonstrate that epistemic behaviours facilitate the construction of accurate and comprehensive models, but that these models are not tailored to any specific behavioural niche and are therefore less efficient in their use of data. Finally, we show that active inference agents learn models that are parsimonious, tailored to action, and which avoid bad bootstraps and sub-optimal convergence. Critically, our results indicate that models learned through active inference can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed &lt;i&gt;because of&lt;/i&gt;, their departure from veridical representations of the environment. Our approach provides a principled method for learning adaptive models from limited interactions with an environment, highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kVx4Eq3TDIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The network architecture of an ecological community describes the structure of species interactions established in a given place and time. It has been suggested that this architecture presents unique features for each type of ecological interaction: e.g., nested and modular architectures would correspond to mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, respectively. Recently, Michalska-Smith and Allesina (2019) proposed a computational challenge to test whether it is indeed possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on network architecture. Contrary to the expectation, they found that this differentiation is practically impossible, moving the question to why it is not possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on their network architecture alone. Here, we show that this differentiation becomes possible by adding the local environmental information where the networks were sampled. We show that this can be explained by the fact that environmental conditions are a confounder of ecological interactions and network architecture. That is, the lack of association between network architecture and type of ecological interactions changes by conditioning on the local environmental conditions. Additionally, we find that environmental conditions are linked to the stability of ecological networks, but the direction of this effect depends on the type of interaction network. This suggests that the association between ecological interactions and network architectures exists, but cannot be fully understood without attention to the environmental conditions acting upon them.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xleeyv_OWW0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A massive number of biological entities, such as genes and mutations, are mentioned in the biomedical literature. The capturing of the semantic relatedness of biological entities is vital to many biological applications, such as protein-protein interaction prediction and literature-based discovery. Concept embeddings—which involve the learning of vector representations of concepts using machine learning models—have been employed to capture the semantics of concepts. To develop concept embeddings, named-entity recognition (NER) tools are first used to identify and normalize concepts from the literature, and then different machine learning models are used to train the embeddings. Despite multiple attempts, existing biomedical concept embeddings generally suffer from suboptimal NER tools, small-scale evaluation, and limited availability. In response, we employed high-performance machine learning-based NER tools for concept recognition and trained our concept embeddings, BioConceptVec, via four different machine learning models on ~30 million PubMed abstracts. BioConceptVec covers over 400,000 biomedical concepts mentioned in the literature and is of the largest among the publicly available biomedical concept embeddings to date. To evaluate the validity and utility of BioConceptVec, we respectively performed two intrinsic evaluations (identifying related concepts based on drug-gene and gene-gene interactions) and two extrinsic evaluations (protein-protein interaction prediction and drug-drug interaction extraction), collectively using over 25 million instances from nine independent datasets (17 million instances from six intrinsic evaluation tasks and 8 million instances from three extrinsic evaluation tasks), which is, by far, the most comprehensive to our best knowledge. The intrinsic evaluation results demonstrate that BioConceptVec consistently has, by a large margin, better performance than existing concept embeddings in identifying similar and related concepts. More importantly, the extrinsic evaluation results demonstrate that using BioConceptVec with advanced deep learning models can significantly improve performance in downstream bioinformatics studies and biomedical text-mining applications. Our BioConceptVec embeddings and benchmarking datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BioConceptVec.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xMJKDTCgxA4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system (ECS), encompassing cannabinoid receptors and enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of the endogenous cannabinoid signaling lipids, is highly expressed in the cerebellar cortex of adult humans and rodents. In addition to their well-established role in neuromodulation, eCBs have been shown to play key roles in aspects of neurodevelopment in the fore- and mid-brain, including neurogenesis, cell migration, and synapse specification. However, little is known about the role of ECS in cerebellar development. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical characterization of ECS components through key stages of cerebellar development in mice using antibodies for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) synthetizing and degrading enzymes and the major brain cannabinoid receptor, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), in combination with cerebellar cell markers. Our results reveal a temporally, spatially, and cytologically dynamic pattern of expression. Production, receptor binding, and degradation of eCBs are tightly controlled, thus localization of eCB receptors and the complementary cannabinoid signaling machinery determines the direction, duration, and ultimately the outcome of eCB signaling. To gain insights into the role of eCB signaling in cerebellar development, we characterized gross anatomy of cerebellar midvermis in CB1 knock-out (CB1 KO) mice, as well as their performance in cerebellar-influenced motor tasks. Our results show persistent and selective anatomic and behavioral alterations in CB1 KOs. Consequently, the insights gained from this study lay down the foundation for investigating specific cellular and molecular mechanisms regulated by eCB signaling during cerebellar development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic scaling is a form of synaptic plasticity where individual synapses scale their strengths to compensate for global suppression or elevation of neuronal activity. This process can be studied by measuring miniature EPSP (mEPSP) amplitudes and frequencies following the regulation of activity in neuronal cultures. Here, we demonstrate a quantitative approach to characterize multiplicative synaptic scaling using immunolabelling of hippocampal neuronal cultures treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX) or bicuculline to extract scaling factors for various synaptic proteins. This approach allowed us to directly examine the scaling of presynaptic and postsynaptic scaffolding molecules along with neurotransmitter receptors in primary cultures from mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. We show robust multiplicative scaling of synaptic scaffolding molecules namely, Shank2, PSD95, Bassoon, and AMPA receptor subunits and quantify their scaling factors. We use super-resolution microscopy to calculate scaling factors of surface expressed GluA2 within functional zones of the synapse and show that there is differential and correlated scaling of GluA2 levels within the spine, the postsynaptic density (PSD), and the perisynaptic regions. Our method opens a novel paradigm to quantify relative molecular changes of synaptic proteins within distinct subsynaptic compartments from a large number of synapses in response to alteration of neuronal activity, providing anatomic insights into the intricacies of variability in strength of individual synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the auditory system, the spectrotemporal structure of acoustic signals determines the temporal pattern of spikes. Here, we investigated this effect in neurons of the barn owl’s auditory midbrain (&lt;i&gt;Tyto furcata&lt;/i&gt;) that are selective for auditory space and whether it can influence the coding of sound direction. We found that in the nucleus where neurons first become selective to combinations of sound localization cues, reproducibility of spike trains across repeated trials of identical sounds, a metric of across-trial temporal fidelity of spiking patterns evoked by a stimulus, was maximal at the sound direction that elicited the highest firing rate. We then tested the hypothesis that this stimulus-dependent patterning resulted in rate co-modulation of cells with similar frequency and spatial selectivity, driving stimulus-dependent synchrony of population responses. Tetrodes were used to simultaneously record multiple nearby units in the optic tectum (OT), where auditory space is topographically represented. While spiking of neurons in OT showed lower reproducibility across trials compared with upstream nuclei, spike-time synchrony between nearby OT neurons was highest for sounds at their preferred direction. A model of the midbrain circuit explained the relationship between stimulus-dependent reproducibility and synchrony, and demonstrated that this effect can improve the decoding of sound location from the OT output. Thus, stimulus-dependent spiking patterns in the auditory midbrain can have an effect on spatial coding. This study reports a functional connection between spike patterning elicited by spectrotemporal features of a sound and the coding of its location.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental challenge in studying principles of organization used by the olfactory system to encode odor concentration information has been identifying comprehensive sets of activated odorant receptors (ORs) across a broad concentration range inside freely behaving animals. In mammals, this has recently become feasible with high-throughput sequencing-based methods that identify populations of activated ORs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, we characterized the mouse OR repertoires activated by the two odorants, acetophenone (ACT) and 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), from 0.01% to 100% (v/v) as starting concentrations using phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 capture followed by RNA-Seq. We found Olfr923 to be one of the most sensitive ORs that is enriched by ACT. Using a mouse line that genetically labels Olfr923-positive axons, we provided evidence that ACT activates the Olfr923 glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Through molecular dynamics stimulations, we identified amino acid residues in the Olfr923 binding cavity that facilitate ACT binding. This study sheds light on the active process by which unique OR repertoires may collectively facilitate the discrimination of odorant concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) is a key component of human memory and cognition. Computational models have been used to study the underlying neural mechanisms, but neglected the important role of short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) interactions for WM. Here, we investigate these using a novel multiarea spiking neural network model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and two parietotemporal cortical areas based on macaque data. We propose a WM indexing theory that explains how PFC could associate, maintain, and update multimodal LTM representations. Our simulations demonstrate how simultaneous, brief multimodal memory cues could build a temporary joint memory representation as an &quot;index&quot; in PFC by means of fast Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This index can then reactivate spontaneously and thereby also the associated LTM representations. Cueing one LTM item rapidly pattern completes the associated uncued item via PFC. The PFC–STM network updates flexibly as new stimuli arrive, thereby gradually overwriting older representations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) are intrinsically osmosensitive and can be activated by increases in blood osmolality, triggering the release of antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) to promote water retention. Hence, the activity of magnocellular VP neurons is one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of body fluid homeostasis in healthy organisms. Chronic exposure to high dietary salt leads to excessive activation of VP neurons, thereby elevating levels of circulating VP, which can cause increases in blood pressure contributing to salt-dependent hypertension. However, the molecular basis underlying high-salt diet-induced hyperactivation of magnocellular VP neurons remains not fully understood. Previous studies suggest that magnocellular neurosecretory neurons contain a subcortical layer of actin filaments and pharmacological stabilization of this actin network potentiates osmotically-induced activation of magnocellular neurons. Using super-resolution imaging &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, we investigated the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in rat MNCs under normal physiological conditions and after a chronic increase in blood osmolality following 7 d of salt-loading (SL). We found that, in addition to the subcortical layer of actin filaments, magnocellular VP neurons are endowed with a unique network of cytoplasmic actin filaments throughout their somata. Moreover, we revealed that the density of both subcortical and cytoplasmic actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons is dramatically increased following SL. These results suggest that increased osmo-responsiveness of VP neurons following chronic exposure to high dietary salt may be mediated by the modulation of unique actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons, possibly contributing to elevated blood pressure in this condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Social recognition is fundamental for social decision making and the establishment of long-lasting affiliative behaviors in behaviorally complex social groups. It is a critical step in establishing a selective preference for a social partner or group member. C57BL/6J lab mice do not form monogamous relationships, and typically do not show prolonged social preferences for familiar mice. The CA2 hippocampal subfield plays a crucial role in social memory and optogenetic stimulation of inputs to the dorsal CA2 field during a short memory acquisition period can enhance and extend social memories in mice. Here, we show that partner preference in mice can be induced by chemogenetic selective stimulation of the monosynaptic projections from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to the CA2 during the cohabitation period. Specifically, male mice spend more time in social contact, grooming and huddling with the partner compared to a novel female. Preference was not induced by prolonging the cohabitation period and allowing more time for social interactions and males to sire pups with the familiar female. These results suggest that PVN-to-CA2 projections are part of an evolutionarily conserved neural circuitry underlying the formation of social preference and may promote behavioral changes with appropriate stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Merosin deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDC1A), or LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-RD), is a recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the LAMA2 gene, encoding for the alpha-2 chain of laminin-211. The disease is predominantly characterized by progressive muscular dystrophy affecting patient motor function and reducing life expectancy. However, LAMA2-RD also comprises a developmentally-associated dysmyelinating neuropathy that contributes to the disease progression, in addition to brain abnormalities; the latter often underappreciated. In this brief review, we present data supporting the impact of peripheral neuropathy in the LAMA2-RD phenotype, including both mouse models and human studies. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying nerve abnormalities and involved in the laminin-211 pathway, which affects axon sorting, ensheathing and myelination. We conclude with some final considerations of consequences on nerve regeneration and potential therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Measures of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) activity have been shown to be sensitive to cognitive function and disease state. However, there is growing evidence that variations in vigilance can lead to pronounced and spatially widespread differences in resting-state brain activity. Unless properly accounted for, differences in vigilance can give rise to changes in resting-state activity that can be misinterpreted as primary cognitive or disease-related effects. In this paper, we examine in detail the link between vigilance and rsfMRI measures, such as signal variance and functional connectivity. We consider how state changes due to factors such as caffeine and sleep deprivation affect both vigilance and rsfMRI measures and review emerging approaches and methodological challenges for the estimation and interpretation of vigilance effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Bilingualism is of great interest to the neuroscience of language, and understanding the anatomical changes associated with second language learning help inform theories of bilingual advantage across the lifespan. While the literature on structural differences between bilinguals and monolinguals is robust, relatively few studies of gray matter (GM) have directly compared bilinguals with monolinguals in a whole-brain analysis. Overall, this and heterogeneity of study samples and methodology have led to a lack of clear anatomical support for major theories. Here, we engage in an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of GM for cases that directly compare bilingual and monolingual subjects in a whole-brain analysis. The analysis (sixteen foci, from ten contrasts across eight studies) resulted in one cluster located primarily within the anterior lobe of the right cerebellum. However, when the one pediatric study was removed, the analysis revealed no consistent results across the studies included in this meta-analysis. This suggests that for VBM studies of bilingual and monolingual adults there is considerable heterogeneity of results that complicate the understanding of the bilingual brain. Future studies will need to include larger, more well-defined samples and interrogate more fine-grained anatomical features such as cortical thickness and surface area in order to more fully examine the anatomical changes associated with bilingualism across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study investigated how modified control of a virtual hand executing reach-to-grasp affects functional performance and agency (perception of control). The objective of this work was to demonstrate positive relationships between reaching performance and grasping agency and motivate greater consideration of agency in movement rehabilitation. We hypothesized that agency and performance have positive correlation across varying control modes of the virtual hand. In this study, each participant controlled motion of a virtual hand through motion of his or her own hand. Control of the virtual hand was modified according to a specific control mode. Each mode involved the virtual hand moving at a modified speed, having noise, or including a level of automation. These specific modes represent potential control features to adapt for a rehabilitation device such as a prosthetic arm and hand. In this study, significant changes in agency and performance were observed across the control modes. Overall, a significant positive relationship (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was observed between the primary performance metric of reach (tracking a minimum path length trajectory) and an implicit measurement of agency (intentional binding). Intentional binding was assessed through participant perceptions of time-intervals between grasp contact and a sound event. Other notable findings include improved movement efficiency (increased smoothness, reduced acceleration) during expression of higher agency and shift toward greater implicit versus explicit agency with higher control speed. Positively relating performance and agency incentivizes control adaptation of powered movement devices, such as prostheses or exoskeletons, to maximize both user engagement and functional performance. Agency-based approaches may foster user-device integration at a cognitive level and facilitate greater clinical retention of the device. Future work should identify robust and automated methods to adapt device control for increased agency. Objectives include how virtual reality (VR) may identify optimal control of real-world devices and assessing real-time agency from neurophysiological signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that neurons can represent sensory input using probability distributions and neural circuits can perform probabilistic inference. Lateral connections between neurons have been shown to have non-random connectivity and modulate responses to stimuli within the classical receptive field. Large-scale efforts mapping local cortical connectivity describe cell type specific connections from inhibitory neurons and like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons. To relate the observed connectivity to computations, we propose a neuronal network model that approximates Bayesian inference of the probability of different features being present at different image locations. We show that the lateral connections between excitatory neurons in a circuit implementing contextual integration in this should depend on correlations between unit activities, minus a global inhibitory drive. The model naturally suggests the need for two types of inhibitory gates (normalization, surround inhibition). First, using natural scene statistics and classical receptive fields corresponding to simple cells parameterized with data from mouse primary visual cortex, we show that the predicted connectivity qualitatively matches with that measured in mouse cortex: neurons with similar orientation tuning have stronger connectivity, and both excitatory and inhibitory connectivity have a modest spatial extent, comparable to that observed in mouse visual cortex. We incorporate lateral connections learned using this model into convolutional neural networks. Features are defined by supervised learning on the task, and the lateral connections provide an unsupervised learning of feature context in multiple layers. Since the lateral connections provide contextual information when the feedforward input is locally corrupted, we show that incorporating such lateral connections into convolutional neural networks makes them more robust to noise and leads to better performance on noisy versions of the MNIST dataset. Decomposing the predicted lateral connectivity matrices into low-rank and sparse components introduces additional cell types into these networks. We explore effects of cell-type specific perturbations on network computation. Our framework can potentially be applied to networks trained on other tasks, with the learned lateral connections aiding computations implemented by feedforward connections when the input is unreliable and demonstrate the potential usefulness of combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in real-world vision tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A unique feature of the olfactory system is the continuous generation and integration of new neurons throughout adulthood. Adult-born neuron survival and integration is dependent on activity and sensory experience, which is largely mediated by early synaptic inputs that adult-born neurons receive upon entering the olfactory bulb (OB). As in early postnatal development, the first synaptic inputs onto adult-born neurons are GABAergic. However, the specific sources of early synaptic GABA and the influence of specific inputs on adult-born neuron development are poorly understood. Here, we use retrograde and anterograde viral tracing to reveal robust GABAergic projections from the basal forebrain horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) to the granule cell layer (GCL) and glomerular layer (GL) of the mouse OB. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings indicate that these projections target interneurons in the GCL and GL, including adult-born granule cells (abGCs). Recordings from birth-dated abGCs reveal a developmental time course in which HDB GABAergic input onto abGCs emerges as the neurons first enter the OB, and strengthens throughout the critical period of abGC development. Finally, we show that removing GABAergic signaling from HDB neurons results in decreased abGC survival. Together these data show that GABAergic projections from the HDB synapse onto immature abGCs in the OB to promote their survival through the critical period, thus representing a source of long-range input modulating plasticity in the adult OB.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays critical roles during early central nervous system development, such as neural cell proliferation, patterning of the neural tube and neuronal differentiation. While Shh signaling is still present in the postnatal brain, the roles it may play are, however, largely unknown. In particular, Shh signaling components are found at the synaptic junction in the maturing hippocampus during the first two postnatal weeks. This period is characterized by the presence of ongoing spontaneous synaptic activity at the cellular and network levels thought to play important roles in the onset of neuronal circuit formation and synaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that non-canonical Shh signaling increases the frequency of the synchronized electrical activity called Giant Depolarizing Potentials (GDP) and enhances spontaneous GABA post-synaptic currents in the rodent hippocampus during the early postnatal period. This effect is mediated specifically through the Shh co-receptor Smoothened via intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal and the activation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. Given the importance of these spontaneous events on neuronal network maturation and refinement, this study opens new perspectives for Shh signaling on the control of early stages of postnatal brain maturation and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Down-regulated Wnt signaling is involved in brain aging with declined cognitive capacity due to its modulation on neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, the naturally aged rat model was established by feeding rats from 6 months old to 21 months old. The cognitive capacity of aged rats was compared with young rats as the controls and the aged rats upon 12-week exercise interventions including treadmill running, resistance exercise, and alternating exercise with resistance exercise and treadmill running. Wnt signaling was examined in hippocampal tissues of the rats from different groups. Results indicated that the expression of Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) as an antagonist of Wnt signal pathway, the activation of GSK-3β, and the hyperphosphorylated Tau were markedly increased as the extension of age. Meanwhile, higher p-β-catenin&lt;sup&gt;Ser33, 37, Thr41&lt;/sup&gt; promoted neuronal degradation of aged rats. In contrast, three kinds of exercise interventions rescued the abnormal expression of DKK-1 and synaptophysin such as PSD-93 and PSD-95 in hippocampal tissues of the aged rats; especially 12-week treadmill running suppressed DKK-1 up-regulation, GSK-3β activation, β-catenin phosphorylation, and hyperphosphorylated Tau. In addition, the down-regulated PI3K/AKT and Wnt signal pathways were observed in aged rats, but could be reversed by resistance exercise and treadmill running. Moreover, the increased Bax and reduced Bcl-2 levels in hippocampal tissues of aged rats were also reversed upon treadmill running intervention. Taken together, down-regulated Wnt signaling suppressed PI3K/Akt signal pathway, aggravated synaptotoxicity, induced neuron apoptosis, and accelerated cognitive impairment of aged rats. However, exercise interventions, especially treadmill running, can attenuate their brain aging process via restoring Wnt signaling and corresponding targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Author summary &lt;p&gt;Recent work has indicated that anthropogenic pollution of floral-scent may have negative impacts on bumblebee foraging behavior. We need quantitative tools to both measure how much pollution of a learned floral-odor bumblebees can tolerate and identify which scent-pollutants are problematic. This study used encoding characteristics of insect olfactory systems to develop a new paradigm for quantifying complex odors. This ‘Compounds Without Borders’ method builds multidimensional vectors of scents based on physiologically relevant physical characteristics of component odorant-compounds. The angular distance between CWB-vectors then provides a single quantitative variable describing how similar (or dissimilar) two complex odors are. This angular representation of odor similarity is predictive of bumblebees’ behavior in an associative odor learning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ctFPWr22uUU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mosquitoes are important vectors for pathogens that infect humans and other vertebrate animals. Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to transmit pathogens. Here, we re-examine factors affecting the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquito’s state, that is not our main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations’ capacity to transmit pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4RoPuWiOonc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have previously shown that repetitive induction of long‐term potentiation (LTP) by glutamate (100 μM, 3 min, three times at 24‐hr intervals) provoked long‐lasting synaptic enhancement accompanied by synaptogenesis in rat hippocampal slice cultures, a phenomenon termed RISE (repetitive LTP‐induced synaptic enhancement). Here, we examined the role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐permeable (CP) AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the establishment of RISE. We first found a component sensitive to the Joro‐spider toxin (JSTX), a blocker of CP‐AMPARs, in a field EPSP recorded from CA3‐CA1 synapses at 2–3 days after stimulation, but this component was not found for 9–10 days. We also observed that rectification of AMPAR‐mediated current appeared only 2–3 days after stimulation, using a whole‐cell patch clamp recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons. These findings indicate that CP‐AMPAR is transiently expressed in the developing phase of RISE. The blockade of CP‐AMPARs by JSTX for 24 hr at this developing phase inhibited RISE establishment, accompanied by the loss of small synapses at the ultrastructural level. These results suggest that transiently induced CP‐AMPARs play a critical role in synaptogenesis in the developing phase of long‐lasting hippocampal synaptic plasticity, RISE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Down syndrome (DS) patients develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology by age 40. Although this increased susceptibility to AD in DS is thought to be primarily due to triplication of the amyloid precursor protein located on chromosome 21, the precise molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent evidence has implicated defective protein sorting and trafficking secondary to deficiencies in retromer complex proteins in AD pathogenesis. Thus, the objective of the present study is to assess the retromer complex system in DS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human post‐mortem brain tissue and fibroblasts from subjects with DS and healthy controls were examined for the various retromer protein components using western blot analysis and RT‐qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retromer recognition core proteins were significantly decreased in DS fibroblasts, and in both the hippocampi and cortices of young (age 15‐40 years old) and aged (40‐65 years old) DS subjects compared to controls. Correlation analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between recognition core proteins and levels of soluble forms of Aβ 1‐40 and 1‐42 in both hippocampus (n=33, Spearman=‐0.59 to ‐0.38, p≤0.03 for VPS35, VPS26, VPS29, and VPS26B) and cortex tissue (n=57, Spearman=‐0.46 to ‐0.27, p≤0.04 for VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29) of the same patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that dysregulation of the retromer complex system is an early event in the development of the AD‐like pathology and cognitive decline in DS, and for this reason the system could represent a novel potential therapeutic target for DS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precuneus (PreC; Brodmann area 7), a key hub within the default mode network (DMN) displays amyloid and tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PreC layer III projection neurons contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD), 14)a marker of neurons vulnerable to NFT pathology. Here we applied single population laser capture microdissection coupled with custom‐designed microarray profiling to determine the genetic signature of PreC CatD‐positive‐layer III neurons accrued from postmortem tissue obtained from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Expression profiling revealed significant differential expression of key transcripts in MCI and AD compared to NCI that underlie signaling defects, including dysregulation of genes within the endosomal‐lysosomal and autophagy pathways, cytoskeletal elements, AD‐related genes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cholinergic enzyme and receptors, markers of monoamine neurotransmission as well as steroid‐related transcripts. Pervasive defects in both MCI and AD were found in select transcripts within these key gene ontology categories, underscoring the vulnerability of these corticocortical neurons during the onset and progression of dementia. Select PreC dysregulated genes detected via custom‐designed microarray analysis were validated using qPCR. In summary, expression profiling of CatD positive PreC layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in MCI and AD that were not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Altered synaptic function is thought to play a role in many neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms for synaptic dysfunction. The squid giant synapse (SGS) is a classical model for studying synaptic electrophysiology and ultrastructure, as well as molecular mechanisms of neurotransmission. Here, we conduct a multidisciplinary study of synaptic actions of misfolded human G85R-SOD1 causing familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). G85R-SOD1, but not WT-SOD1, inhibited synaptic transmission, altered presynaptic ultrastructure, and reduced both the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles and mobility from the reserved pool (RP) to the RRP. Unexpectedly, intermittent high-frequency stimulation (iHFS) blocked inhibitory effects of G85R-SOD1 on synaptic transmission, suggesting aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling may underlie G85R-SOD1 toxicity. Ratiometric Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging showed significantly increased presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induced by G85R-SOD1 that preceded synaptic dysfunction. Chelating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; using EGTA prevented synaptic inhibition by G85R-SOD1, confirming the role of aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating G85R-SOD1 toxicity. These results extended earlier findings in mammalian motor neurons and advanced our understanding by providing possible molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in ALS as well as a unique model for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system, melastatin transient receptor potential (TRPM) channels function as receptors for the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PregS). The expression and function of TRPM3 has been explored in adult retina, although its role during development is unknown. We found, during the second postnatal week in mice, TRPM3 immunofluorescence labeled distinct subsets of inner retinal neurons, including a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), similar to what has been reported in the adult. Labeling for a TRPM3 promoter-driven reporter confirmed expression of the TRPM3 gene in RGCs and revealed additional expression in nearly all Müller glial cells. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that PregS and the synthetic TRPM3 agonist CIM0216 (CIM) induced prolonged calcium transients in RGCs, which were mostly absent in TRPM3 knock-out (KO) mice. These prolonged calcium transients were not associated with strong membrane depolarizations but induced c-Fos expression. To elucidate the impact of PregS-activation of TRPM3 on retinal circuits we took two sets of physiological measurements. First, PregS induced a robust increase in the frequency but not amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (PSCs). This increase was absent in the TRPM3 KO mice. Second, PregS induced a small increase in cell participation and duration of retinal waves, but this modulation persisted in TRPM3 KO mice, indicating PregS was acting on wave generating circuits independent of TRPM3 channels. Though baseline frequency of retinal waves was slightly reduced in the TRPM3 KO mice, other properties of waves were indistinguishable from wildtype. Together, these results indicate that the presence of neurosteroids impact spontaneous synaptic activity and retinal waves during development via both TRPM3-dependent and independent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R"/>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the neurobiology of migraine with aura (MWA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies reveal networks of microvessels linking brain–meninges–bone marrow. CSD activates the trigeminovascular system, evoking a meningeal inflammatory response. Accordingly, this study examines the upregulation of an inflammatory marker in extra‐axial tissues in migraine with visual aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used simultaneously acquired &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐PBR28 positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging data of 18kDa translocator protein (an inflammatory marker) in MWA patients (n = 11) who experienced headaches and visual aura in the preceding month. We measured mean tracer uptake (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR]) in 4 regions of interest comprising the meninges plus the adjacent overlying skull bone (parameningeal tissues [PMT]). These data were compared to healthy controls and patients with pain (chronic low back pain).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MWA had significantly higher mean SUVR in PMT overlying occipital cortex than both other groups, although not in the PMT overlying 3 other cortical areas. A positive correlation was also found between the number of visual auras and tracer uptake in occipital PMT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong persistent extra‐axial inflammatory signal was found in meninges and calvarial bone overlying the occipital lobe in migraine with visual auras. Our findings are reminiscent of CSD‐induced meningeal inflammation and provide the first imaging evidence implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of migraine meningeal symptoms. We suspect that this inflammatory focus results from a signal that migrates from underlying brain and if so, may implicate newly discovered bridging vessels that crosstalk between brain and skull marrow, a finding of potential relevance to migraine and other neuroinflammatory brain disorders.

 Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is involved in the formation and enlargement of cerebral aneurysms (CAs), with macrophages playing a key role in the process. The present study evaluated visualization of macrophages present in CAs using an activatable fluorescent probe (IONP-ICG) comprising an iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) conjugated with indocyanine green (ICG).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;IONP-ICG was intravenously administered to 15-week-old CA model rats (n = 8), and ex vivo near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and histological assessment of exposed CAs and cerebral arteries were performed 48 h later. Similar evaluations were performed in the control group, which included CA model rats given IONPs or ICG (n = 8 each).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ICG-derived NIRF signals were detected in three IONP-ICG group rats but not in IONP or ICG control groups. Among the three rats that exhibited signals, NIRF signal accumulation was observed in the CA of two rats and at the site of hemodynamic stress in the left posterior cerebral artery in one rat. Histologically, NIRF signals correlated strongly with macrophage localization. A total of 13 CAs formed in the IONP-ICG group. The number of macrophages in the CA wall was significantly greater in the two CAs that exhibited NIRF signals compared to the remaining 11 CAs that did not (P = 0.037). Moreover, all 11 CAs that did not exhibit NIRF signals were iron-negative, while the two CAs that exhibited NIRF signals were both iron-positive (P = 0.013).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;NIRF imaging using an activatable IONP-ICG probe is feasible for detecting the macrophage-rich regions in CAs and the cerebral artery wall, which is considered an early lesion in the process of CA formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;It is a commonplace that some people may adopt a controlling style, which brings about autonomy frustration to others. Existing studies on autonomy frustration mainly examined its effect in the primary thwarting context, ignoring its potential spillover to subsequent activities. In this study, we examined whether prior autonomy frustration would have a sustaining negative impact on one’s motivation in another autonomy-supportive activity that follows. In this electrophysiological study, participants worked on two irrelevant tasks organized by two different experimenters. We adopted a between-group design and manipulated participants’ autonomy frustration by providing varied audio instructions during Session 1. In Session 2, all participants were instructed to complete a moderately difficult task that is autonomy-supportive instead, and we observed a less pronounced reward positivity (RewP) difference wave and a smaller P300 in the autonomy-frustration group compared with the control group. These findings suggested that the negative influence of autonomy frustration is longstanding and that it can undermine one’s motivation and attention in a following activity that is autonomy-supportive itself. Thus, our findings provided original neutral evidence for the adverse intertemporal effect of autonomy frustration, and suggested important practical implications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spatio-temporal brain activities with variable delay detectable in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) give rise to highly reproducible structures, termed cortical lag threads, that propagate from one brain region to another. Using a computational topology of data approach, we found that persistent, recurring blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in triangulated rs-fMRI videoframes display previously undetected topological findings, i.e., vortex structures that cover brain activated regions. Measure of persistence of vortex shapes in BOLD signal propagation is carried out in terms of Betti numbers that rise and fall over time during spontaneous activity of the brain. Importantly, a topology of data given in terms of geometric shapes of BOLD signal propagation offers a practical approach in coping with and sidestepping massive noise in neurodata, such as unwanted dark (low intensity) regions in the neighborhood of non-zero BOLD signals. Our findings have been codified and visualized in plots able to track the non-trivial BOLD signals that appear intermittently in a sequence of rs-fMRI videoframes. The end result of this tracking of changing lag structures is a so-called persistent barcode, which is a pictograph that offers a convenient visual means of exhibiting, comparing, and classifying brain activation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00030"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This paper offers a prospectus of what might be achievable in the development of emotional recognition devices. It provides a conceptual overview of the free energy principle; including Markov blankets, active inference, and—in particular—a discussion of selfhood and theory of mind, followed by a brief explanation of how these concepts can explain both neural and cultural models of emotional inference. The underlying hypothesis is that emotion recognition and inference devices will evolve from state-of-the-art deep learning models into active inference schemes that go beyond marketing applications and become adjunct to psychiatric practice. Specifically, this paper proposes that a second wave of emotion recognition devices will be equipped with an emotional lexicon (or the ability to epistemically search for one), allowing the device to resolve uncertainty about emotional states by actively eliciting responses from the user and learning from these responses. Following this, a third wave of emotional devices will converge upon the user's generative model, resulting in the machine and human engaging in a reciprocal, prosocial emotional interaction, i.e., sharing a generative model of emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The Subthalamic Nucleus (STh) is an oval-shaped diencephalic structure located ventrally to the thalamus, playing a fundamental role in the circuitry of the basal ganglia. In addition to being involved in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, the STh is one of the target nuclei for deep brain stimulation. However, most of the anatomical evidence available derives from non-human primate studies. In this review, we will present the topographical and morphological organization of the nucleus and its connections to structurally and functionally related regions of the basal ganglia circuitry. We will also highlight the importance of additional research in humans focused on validating STh connectivity, cytoarchitectural organization, and its functional subdivision.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Emerging evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can cause neurological complications. We provide a brief overview of these recent observations and discuss some of their possible implications. In particular, given the global dimension of the current pandemic, we highlight the need to consider the possible long-term impact of COVID-19, potentially including neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.</content>

The growth of the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; in human blood causes all the symptoms of malaria. To proliferate, non-motile parasites must have access to susceptible red blood cells, which they invade using pairs of parasite ligands and host receptors that define invasion pathways. Parasites can switch invasion pathways, and while this flexibility is thought to facilitate immune evasion, it may also reflect the heterogeneity of red blood cell surfaces within and between hosts. Host genetic background affects red blood cell structure, for example, and red blood cells also undergo dramatic changes in morphology and receptor density as they age. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; consequences of both the accessibility of susceptible cells, and their heterogeneous susceptibility, remain unclear. Here, we measured invasion of laboratory strains of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; relying on distinct invasion pathways into red blood cells of different ages. We estimated invasion efficiency while accounting for red blood cell accessibility to parasites. This approach revealed different tradeoffs made by parasite strains between the fraction of cells they can invade and their invasion rate into them, and we distinguish “specialist” strains from “generalist” strains in this context. We developed a mathematical model to show that generalist strains would lead to higher peak parasitemias &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; compared to specialist strains with similar overall proliferation rates. Thus, the ecology of red blood cells may play a key role in determining the rate of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; parasite proliferation and malaria virulence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EkcZZAKB4Vg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Understanding the gating mechanism of ion channel proteins is key to understanding the regulation of cell signaling through these channels. Channel opening and closing are regulated by diverse environmental factors that include temperature, electrical voltage across the channel, and proton concentration. Low permeability in voltage-gated potassium ion channels (Kv) is intimately correlated with the prolonged action potential duration observed in many acidosis diseases. The Kv channels consist of voltage-sensing domains (S1–S4 helices) and central pore domains (S5–S6 helices) that include a selectivity filter and water-filled cavity. The voltage-sensing domain is responsible for the voltage-gating of Kv channels. While the low permeability of Kv channels to potassium ion is highly correlated with the cellular proton concentration, it is unclear how an intracellular acidic condition drives their closure, which may indicate an additional pH-dependent gating mechanism of the Kv family. Here, we show that two residues E327 and H418 in the proximity of the water cavity of Kv1.2 play crucial roles as a pH switch. In addition, we present a structural and molecular concept of the pH-dependent gating of Kv1.2 in atomic detail, showing that the protonation of E327 and H418 disrupts the electrostatic balance around the S6 helices, which leads to a straightening transition in the shape of their axes and causes dewetting of the water-filled cavity and closure of the channel. Our work offers a conceptual advancement to the regulation of the pH-dependent gating of various voltage-gated ion channels and their related biological functions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5aEdI3jnfI8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Many lines of evidence point to links between sleep regulation and energy homeostasis, but mechanisms underlying these connections are unknown. During &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; sleep, energetic stores are allocated to nonneural tasks with a resultant drop in the overall fat stores and energy charge. Mutants lacking KIN-29, the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; homolog of a mammalian Salt-Inducible Kinase (SIK) that signals sleep pressure, have low ATP levels despite high-fat stores, indicating a defective response to cellular energy deficits. Liberating energy stores corrects adiposity and sleep defects of &lt;i&gt;kin-29&lt;/i&gt; mutants. &lt;i&gt;kin-29&lt;/i&gt; sleep and energy homeostasis roles map to a set of sensory neurons that act upstream of fat regulation as well as of central sleep-controlling neurons, suggesting hierarchical somatic/neural interactions regulating sleep and energy homeostasis. Genetic interaction between &lt;i&gt;kin-29&lt;/i&gt; and the histone deacetylase &lt;i&gt;hda-4&lt;/i&gt; coupled with subcellular localization studies indicate that KIN-29 acts in the nucleus to regulate sleep. We propose that KIN-29/SIK acts in nuclei of sensory neuroendocrine cells to transduce low cellular energy charge into the mobilization of energy stores, which in turn promotes sleep.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/WJY3KcJFlug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological mechanisms of acoustic and weakly electric signaling in synodontid catfish&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9cc6877d-1c48-4db9-9de6-30d4d5c2431f/cne24920-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synodontid catfishes use an Elastic Spring Apparatus, including protractor muscles, to produce electric discharges or sounds. Anatomical characterization, together with motoneuron patch‐clamp recordings and protractor muscle EMGs suggest that adaptive changes in peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what extent do modifications in the nervous system and peripheral effectors contribute to novel behaviors? Using a combination of morphometric analysis, neuroanatomical tract‐tracing, and intracellular neuronal recording, we address this question in a sound‐producing and a weakly electric species of synodontid catfish, &lt;i&gt;Synodontis grandiops&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Synodontis nigriventris&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The same peripheral mechanism, a bilateral pair of protractor muscles associated with vertebral processes (elastic spring mechanism), is involved in both signaling systems. Although there were dramatic species differences in several morphometric measures, electromyograms provided strong evidence that simultaneous activation of paired protractor muscles accounts for an individual sound and electric discharge pulse. While the general architecture of the neural network and the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron population driving each target was largely similar, differences could contribute to species‐specific patterns in electromyograms and the associated pulse repetition rate of sounds and electric discharges. Together, the results suggest that adaptive changes in both peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system, and thus the evolution of a novel communication channel among synodontid catfish. Similarities with characters in other sonic and weakly electric teleost fish provide a striking example of convergent evolution in functional adaptations underlying the evolution of the two signaling systems among distantly related taxa.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate disease symptoms, clinical and MRI findings and to perform longitudinal volumetric MRI analyses in a European multi‐center cohort of pediatric anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (NMDARE) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied 38 children with NMDARE (median age 12.9years, range:1‐18) and a total of 82 MRI scans for volumetric MRI analyses compared to matched healthy controls. Mixed‐effect models and brain volume z‐scores were applied to estimate longitudinal brain volume development. Ordinal logistic regression and ordinal mixed models were used to predict disease outcome and severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial MRI scans showed abnormal findings in 15/38(39.5%) patients, mostly white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. Volumetric MRI analyses revealed reductions of whole brain, grey matter as well as hippocampal and basal ganglia volumes in NMDARE children. Longitudinal mixed‐effect models and z‐score transformation showed failure of age‐expected brain growth in patients. Importantly, patients with abnormal MRI findings at onset were more likely to have poor outcome (PCPC score&amp;gt;1, incidence rate ratio (IIR)[95%CI]: 3.50[1.31‐9.31], p=0.012) compared to patients with normal MRI. Ordinal logistic regression models corrected for time from onset confirmed abnormal MRI at onset OR[95%CI]: 9.90[2.51, 17.28]; p=0.009), a presentation with sensorimotor deficits (13.71[2.68, 24.73]; p=0.015), and a treatment delay &amp;gt;4 weeks (5.15[0.47, 9.82]; p=0.031) as independent predictors of poor clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with NMDARE exhibit significant brain volume loss and failure of age‐expected brain growth. Abnormal MRI findings, a clinical presentation with sensorimotor deficits, and a treatment delay &amp;gt;4 weeks are associated with worse clinical outcome. These characteristics represent promising prognostic biomarkers in pediatric NMDARE.&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM), a technique where volumes of tissue can be anatomically reconstructed by imaging consecutive tissue slices, has proven to be a powerful tool for the investigation of brain anatomy. Between the process of cutting the slices, or &quot;sections,&quot; and imaging them, however, handling 10°–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; delicate sections remains a bottleneck in ssEM, especially for batches in the &quot;mesoscale&quot; regime, i.e., 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; sections. We present a tissue section handling device that transports and positions sections, accurately and repeatability, for automated, robotic section pick-up and placement onto an imaging substrate. The device interfaces with a conventional ultramicrotomy diamond knife, accomplishing in-line, exact-constraint trapping of sections with 100-μm repeatability. An associated mathematical model includes capillary-based and Stokes-based forces, accurately describing observed behavior and fundamentally extends the modeling of water-air interface forces. Using the device, we demonstrate and describe the limits of reliable handling of hundreds of slices onto a variety of electron and light microscopy substrates without significant defects (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8 datasets composed of 126 serial sections in an automated fashion with an average loss rate and throughput of 0.50% and 63 s/section, respectively. In total, this work represents an automated mesoscale serial sectioning system for scalable 3D-EM connectomics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity forms the basis for neuronal circuit complexity and differences between otherwise similar circuits. We show that the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (&lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;) plays a central role in intrinsic plasticity of olfactory bulb (OB) projection neurons. Mitral and tufted (M/T) neurons from &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice are hyperexcitable, have a reduced A-type potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) and exhibit reduced expression of &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel subunit (Kv4.3) important for generating the I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, expression of the &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; genes is activity dependent in OB projection neurons and the MITF protein activates expression from &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; regulatory elements. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice have changes in olfactory habituation and have increased habituation for an odorant following long-term exposure, indicating that regulation of &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; is pivotal for long-term olfactory adaptation. Our findings show that &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; acts as a direct regulator of intrinsic homeostatic feedback and links neuronal activity, transcriptional changes and neuronal function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is the most common inherited optic neuropathy, with a prevalence of 1:12,000 to 1:25,000. &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are found in 70% of DOA patients, with a significant number remaining undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 286 index cases presenting optic atrophy, negative for &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations, by targeted next generation sequencing or whole exome sequencing. Pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms of the identified variants were studied in yeast and patient‐derived fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve cases (4%) were found to carry novel variants in &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2,&lt;/i&gt; a gene that has been associated with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28). Half of cases were familial with a dominant inheritance, whereas the others were sporadic, including &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Biallelic mutations were found in 3 probands with severe syndromic optic neuropathy, acting as recessive or phenotype‐modifier variants. All the DOA‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations were clustered in the ATPase domain, whereas SCA28‐associated mutations mostly affect the proteolytic domain. The pathogenic role of DOA‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations was confirmed in yeast, unraveling a mechanism distinct from that of SCA28‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Patients' fibroblasts showed abnormal OPA1 processing, with accumulation of the fission‐inducing short forms leading to mitochondrial network fragmentation, not observed in SCA28 patients' cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that mutations in &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; are a relevant cause of optic neuropathy, broadening the spectrum of clinical manifestations and genetic mechanisms associated with &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, and underscores the pivotal role of OPA1 and its processing in the pathogenesis of DOA.

 &lt;p&gt;Epileptogenesis is the gradual process responsible for converting a healthy brain into an epileptic brain. This process can be triggered by a wide range of factors, including brain injury or tumors, infections, and status epilepticus. Epileptogenesis results in aberrant synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation and seizure-induced cell death. As Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in cellular plasticity by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) were recently highlighted as key players in epileptogenesis. In this work, we engineered a biosensor to report in situ gelatinase activity in a model of epileptogenesis. This biosensor encompasses a gelatinase-sensitive activatable cell penetrating peptide (ACPP) coupled to a TAMRA fluorophore, allowing fluorescence uptake in cells displaying endogenous gelatinase activities. In a preclinical mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the intrahippocampal kainate injection, ACPPs revealed a localized distribution of gelatinase activities, refining temporal cellular changes during epileptogenesis. The activity was found particularly but not only in the ipsilateral hippocampus, starting from the CA1 area and spreading to dentate gyrus from the early stages throughout chronic epilepsy, notably in neurons and microglial cells. Thus, our work shows that ACPPs are suitable molecular imaging probes for detecting the spatiotemporal pattern of gelatinase activity during epileptogenesis, suggesting their possible use as vectors to target cellular reactive changes with treatment for epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The research on laminin α2 chain-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) advanced rapidly in the last few decades, largely due to availability of good mouse models for the disease and a strong interest in preclinical studies from scientists all over the world. These mouse models continue to provide a solid platform for understanding the LAMA2-CMD pathology. In addition, they enable researchers to test laborious, necessary routines, but also the most creative scientific approaches in order to design therapy for this devastating disorder. In this review we present animals belonging to the laminin α2 chain-deficient “dy/dy” mouse family (dy/dy, dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;, dy&lt;sup&gt;3K&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;3K&lt;/sup&gt;, dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;, et al.) and a summary of the scientific progress they facilitated. We also raise a few questions that need to be addressed in order to maximize the usefulness of laminin α2 murine mutants and to further advance the LAMA2-CMD studies. We believe that research opportunities offered by the mouse models for LAMA2-CMD will continuously support our efforts to find a treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although the ability to integrate information across the senses is compromised in some individuals for unknown reasons, similar defects have been observed when animals are reared without multisensory experience. The experience-dependent development of multisensory integration has been studied most extensively using the visual-auditory neuron of the cat superior colliculus (SC) as a neural model. In the normally-developed adult, SC neurons react to concordant visual-auditory stimuli by integrating their inputs in real-time to produce non-linearly amplified multisensory responses. However, when prevented from gathering visual-auditory experience, their multisensory responses are no more robust than their responses to the individual component stimuli. The mechanisms operating in this defective state are poorly understood. Here we examined the responses of SC neurons in “naïve” (i.e., dark-reared) and “neurotypic” (i.e., normally-reared) animals on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis to determine whether multisensory experience changes the operation by which unisensory signals are converted into multisensory outputs (the “multisensory transform”), or whether it changes the dynamics of the unisensory inputs to that transform (e.g., their synchronization and/or alignment). The results reveal that the major impact of experience was on the multisensory transform itself. Whereas neurotypic multisensory responses exhibited non-linear amplification near their onset followed by linear amplification thereafter, the naive responses showed no integration in the initial phase of the response and a computation consistent with competition in its later phases. The results suggest that multisensory experience creates an entirely new computation by which convergent unisensory inputs are used cooperatively to enhance the physiological salience of cross-modal events and thereby facilitate normal perception and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) seriously affects a patient’s quality of life, and it is urgent to find a method that can effectively alleviate the PHN of the upper extremity.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To observe the Efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) to cervical nerve root for PHN in upper extremity under CT guidance.&lt;/p&gt;Study Design&lt;p&gt;Retrospective comparative study.&lt;/p&gt;Setting&lt;p&gt;Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty patients with PHN in upper extremity were enrolled in Pain Management. Patients were randomized into two groups: cervical nerve root block (A group, n = 25) and cervical nerve root PRF (B group, n = 25). At each observation time, the general characteristics, visual analog scale (VAS), quality of life scores assessment (SF-36), the total efficacy rate, dosage of antiepileptic and narcotic analgesics, and the incidence of complications were followed up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with the preoperative, the postoperative VAS decreased, the physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS) increased in both groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The differences between group B and group A were statistically significant after 1 month, which could be maintained for 1 year (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The total efficacy rate of group A and group B was 52.0% and 80.0% at 1 Year, respectively. The total efficacy rate of group B was higher than that of group A (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The dosage of antiepileptic and narcotic analgesics in group B decreased significantly, and the decline was significant compared with group A (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The incidence of complications between the two groups were similar (P &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;CT-guided PRF to cervical nerve root for the treatment of PHN in the upper extremity is safe and effective. PRF can replicate the location of pain, precise positioning, reduce trauma, and increased pain relief rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Despite being a popular neuromodulation technique, clinical translation of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is hampered by variable responses observed within treatment cohorts. Addressing this challenge has been difficult due to the lack of an effective means of mapping the neuromodulatory electromagnetic fields together with the brain’s response. In this study, we present a novel imaging technique that provides the capability of concurrently mapping markers of tDCS currents, as well as the brain’s response to tDCS. A dual-echo echo-planar imaging (DE-EPI) sequence is used, wherein the phase of the acquired MRI-signal encodes the tDCS current induced magnetic field, while the magnitude encodes the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. The proposed technique was first validated in a custom designed phantom. Subsequent test–retest experiments in human participants showed that tDCS-induced magnetic fields can be detected reliably in vivo. The concurrently acquired BOLD data revealed large-scale networks characteristic of a brain in resting-state as well as a ‘cathodal’ and an ‘anodal’ resting-state component under each electrode. Moreover, ‘cathodal’s BOLD-signal was observed to significantly decrease with the applied current at the group level in all datasets. With its ability to image markers of electromagnetic cause as well as neurophysiological changes, the proposed technique may provide an effective means to visualize neural engagement in tDCS at the group level. Our technique also contributes to addressing confounding factors in applying BOLD fMRI concurrently with tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives&lt;p&gt;The frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway is important in the glutamic neural circuit. The hypofunction of GRIN1 and GRIA2 subunits from glutamic receptors has been hypothesized as the primary process in the etiology of schizophrenia. Identified gene polymorphism involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia may uncover relevant mechanism pathways.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We selected two loci of rs11146020 and rs3813296 distributed in GRIN1 and GRIA2 genes and tested their main and interaction effects on causality connections and structural characteristics in the frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway in 55 Han Chinese first-episode negative schizophrenia patients.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that: (1) rs11146020 has a significant main effect on the causality connections between the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and rs3813296 mainly influences those of the descending pathway from the prefrontal cortex to the striatum; (2) interaction effect of rs11146020 and rs3813296 on causality connections are located in the ascending pathway from the pallidum to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; and (3) the two loci have effects on the volumes of several regions of this pathway.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggested there is modulation on glutamic frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway by rs11146020 and rs3813296 gene polymorphism. Patients with different genotypes have different neuroimaging characteristics, which indirectly reminded clinicians those patients should receive different clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cochlea “translates” the in-air vibrational acoustic “language” into the spikes of neural “language” that are then transmitted to the brain for auditory understanding and/or perception. During this intracochlear “translation” process, high resolution in time–frequency–intensity domains guarantees the high quality of the input neural information for the brain, which is vital for our outstanding hearing abilities. However, cochlear implants (CIs) have coarse artificial coding and interfaces, and CI users experience more challenges in common acoustic environments than their normal-hearing (NH) peers. Noise from sound sources that a listener has no interest in may be neglected by NH listeners, but they may distract a CI user. We discuss the CI noise-suppression techniques and introduce noise management for a new implant system. The monaural signal-to-noise ratio estimation-based noise suppression algorithm “eVoice,” which is incorporated in the processors of Nurotron&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Enduro&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, was evaluated in two speech perception experiments. The results show that speech intelligibility in stationary speech-shaped noise can be significantly improved with eVoice. Similar results have been observed in other CI devices with single-channel noise reduction techniques. Specifically, the mean speech reception threshold decrease in the present study was 2.2 dB. The Nurotron society already has more than 10,000 users, and eVoice is a start for noise management in the new system. Future steps on non-stationary-noise suppression, spatial-source separation, bilateral hearing, microphone configuration, and environment specification are warranted. The existing evidence, including our research, suggests that noise-suppression techniques should be applied in CI systems. The artificial hearing of CI listeners requires more advanced signal processing techniques to reduce brain effort and increase intelligibility in noisy settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) has proven advantageous over conventional medium for culturing both rodent and human brain tissue. In addition, increased activity and synchrony, closer to the dynamic states exclusively recorded in vivo, were reported in rodent slices and cell cultures switching from artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) to hCSF. This indicates that hCSF possesses properties that are not matched by the aCSF, which is generally used for most electrophysiological recordings. To evaluate the possible significance of using hCSF as an electrophysiological recording medium, also for human brain tissue, we compared the network and single-cell firing properties of human brain slice cultures during perfusion with hCSF and aCSF. For measuring the overall activity from a majority of neurons within neocortical and hippocampal human slices, we used a microelectrode array (MEA) recording technique with 252 electrodes covering an area of 3.2 × 3.2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A second CMOS-based MEA with 4225 sensors on a 2 × 2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area was used for detailed mapping of action potential waveforms and cell identification. We found that hCSF increased the number of active electrodes and neurons and the firing rate of the neurons in the slices and induced an increase in the numbers of single channel and population bursts. Interestingly, not only an increase in the overall activity in the slices was observed, but a reconfiguration of the network could also be detected with specific activation and inactivation of subpopulations of neuronal ensembles. In conclusion, hCSF is an important component to consider for future human brain slice studies, especially for experiments designed to mimic parts of physiology and disease observed in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Gut integrity impairment leading to increased intestinal permeability (IP) is hypothesized to be a trigger of critically illness. Approximately 15–20% of human ischemic stroke (IS) victims require intensive care, including patients with impaired level of consciousness or a high risk for developing life-threatening cerebral edema. Local and systemic inflammatory reactions are a major component of the IS pathophysiology and can significantly aggravate brain tissue damage. Intracerebral inflammatory processes following IS have been well studied. Until now, less is known about systemic inflammatory responses and IS consequences apart from a frequently observed post-IS immunosuppression. Here, we provide a hypothesis of a crosstalk between systemic acute phase response (APR), IP and potential secondary brain damage during acute and subacute IS stages supported by preliminary experimental data. Alterations of the acute phase proteins (APPs) C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and serum level changes of antibodies directed against Escherichia coli-cell extract antigen (IgA-, IgM-, and IgG-anti-E. coli) were investigated at 1, 2, and 7 days following IS in ten male sheep. We found an increase of both APPs as well as a decrease of all anti-E. coli antibodies within 48 h following IS. This may indicate an early systemic APR and increased IP, and underlines the importance of the increasingly recognized gut-brain axis and of intestinal antigen release for systemic immune responses in acute and subacute stroke stages.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a kind of regulated cell death (RCD) caused by the redox state disorder of intracellular microenvironment controlled by glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is inhibited by iron chelators and lipophilic antioxidants. In addition to classical regulatory mechanisms, new regulatory factors for ferroptosis have been discovered in recent years, such as the P53 pathway, the activating transcription factor (ATF)3/4 pathway, Beclin 1 (BECN1) pathway, and some non-coding RNA. Ferroptosis is closely related to cancer treatment, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia–reperfusion of organ, neurotoxicity, and others, in particular, in the field of neurodegenerative diseases treatment has aroused people’s interest. The nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2/NFE2L2) has been proved to play a key role in neurodegenerative disease treatment and ferroptosis regulation. Ferroptosis promotes the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, while the expression of Nrf2 and its target genes (Ho-1, Nqo-1, and Trx) has been declined with aging; therefore, there is still insufficient evidence for ferroptosis and Nrf2 regulatory networks in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of ferroptosis regulatory mechanisms, as well as an emphasis on the mechanism of Nrf2 regulating ferroptosis. We also highlight the role of ferroptosis and Nrf2 during the process of neurodegenerative diseases and investigate a theoretical basis for further research on the relationship between Nrf2 and ferroptosis in the process of neurodegenerative diseases treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyloids are fibrillar protein aggregates associated with diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), type II diabetes and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. The process of amyloid polymerization involves three pathological protein transformations; from natively folded conformation to the cross-β conformation, from biophysically soluble to insoluble, and from biologically functional to non-functional. While amyloids share a similar cross-β conformation, the biophysical transformation can either take place spontaneously via a homogeneous nucleation mechanism (HON) or catalytically on an exogenous surface via a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism (HEN). Here, we postulate that the different nucleation pathways can serve as a mechanistic basis for an etiological classification of amyloidopathies, where hereditary forms generally follow the HON pathway, while sporadic forms follow seed-induced (prions) or surface-induced (including microbially induced) HEN pathways. Critically, the conformational and biophysical amyloid transformation results in loss-of-function (LOF) of the original natively folded and soluble protein. This LOF can, at least initially, be the mechanism of amyloid toxicity even before amyloid accumulation reaches toxic levels. By highlighting the important role of non-protein species in amyloid formation and LOF mechanisms of toxicity, we propose a generalized mechanistic framework that could help better understand the diverse etiology of amyloid diseases and offer new opportunities for therapeutic interventions, including replacement therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (α-syn) has been genetically and biochemically linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). There is accumulating evidence that misfolded α-syn species spread between cells in a prion-like manner and seed the aggregation of endogenous protein in the recipient cells. Exosomes have been proposed to mediate the transfer of misfolded α-syn and thus facilitate disease transmission, although the pathological mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated the seeding capacity of exosome-associated α-syn, in vivo. Disease-associated α-syn was present in exosome fractions isolated from transgenic A53T mouse brain. However, following intrastriatal injection of such exosomes in wild-type (wt) mice, we were not able to detect any accumulation of endogenous α-syn. In addition, recombinant fibrillar α-syn, when loaded to isolated brain exosomes, induced minor pathological α-syn brain accumulation at 7 months post injection. These data suggest that exosomes neutralize the effect of toxic α-syn species and raise additional questions on their paracrine modulatory role in disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Adolescence is an essential developmental period characterized by reward-related processes. The current study investigated the development of monetary and social reward processes in adolescents compared with that in children and adults; furthermore, it assessed whether adolescents had different levels of sensitivity to various types of rewards. Two adapted incentive delay tasks were employed for each participant, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The behavioral results showed that both monetary and social rewards could motivate response speed, and participants were more accurate under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The behavioral performances of individuals increased with age. For the ERP data, the cue-P3, target-P2, target-P3 and feedback-related negativity (FRN) components were investigated to identify reward motivation, emotional arousal, attention allocation and feedback processing. Children and adolescents showed higher motivation (larger cue-P3) to rewards than adults. Adolescents showed larger emotional responses to rewards; that is, they had larger target-P2 amplitudes than adults and shorter target-P2 latencies than children. Children showed stronger emotional reactivity for monetary rewards than for social rewards. All age groups had stronger attentional control (larger target-P3) under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The present study sheds light on the neurodevelopment of reward processes in children, adolescents and adults and shows that various reward process stages demonstrate different age-related and reward-type-related characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Path integration spatial navigation processes are emerging as promising cognitive markers for prodromal and clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, such path integration changes have been less explored in Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI), despite neurovascular change being a major contributing factor to dementia and potentially AD. In particular, the sensitivity and specificity of path integration impairments in VCI compared to AD is unclear. In the current pilot study, we explore path integration performance in early-stage AD and VCI patient groups and hypothesize that: (i) medial parietal mediated egocentric processes will be more affected in VCI; and (ii) medial temporal mediated allocentric processes will be more affected in AD. This cross-sectional study included early-stage VCI patients (n = 9), AD patients (n = 10) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20). All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological testing, as well as spatial navigation testing. The spatial navigation tests included the virtual reality “Supermarket” task assessing egocentric (body-based) and allocentric (map-based) navigation as well as the “Clock Orientation” test assessing egocentric and path integration processes. Results showed that egocentric integration processes are only impaired in VCI, potentially distinguishing it from AD. However, in contrast to our prediction, allocentric integration was not more impaired in AD compared to VCI. These preliminary findings suggest limited specificity of allocentric integration deficits between VCI and AD. By contrast, egocentric path integration deficits emerge as more specific to VCI, potentially allowing for more specific diagnostic and treatment outcome measures for vascular impairment in dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Large-scale neuroscience literature call for effective methods to mine the knowledge from species perspective to link the brain and neuroscience communities, neurorobotics, computing devices, and AI research communities. Structured knowledge can motivate researchers to better understand the functionality and structure of the brain and link the related resources and components. However, the abstracts of massive scientific works do not explicitly mention the species. Therefore, in addition to dictionary-based methods, we need to mine species using cognitive computing models that are more like the human reading process, and these methods can take advantage of the rich information in the literature. We also enable the model to automatically distinguish whether the mentioned species is the main research subject. Distinguishing the two situations can generate value at different levels of knowledge management. We propose SpecExplorer project which is used to explore the knowledge associations of different species for brain and neuroscience. This project frees humans from the tedious task of classifying neuroscience literature by species. Species classification task belongs to the multi-label classification which is more complex than the single-label classification due to the correlation between labels. To resolve this problem, we present the sequence-to-sequence classification framework to adaptively assign multiple species to the literature. To model the structure information of documents, we propose the hierarchical attentive decoding (HAD) to extract span of interest (SOI) for predicting each species. We create three datasets from PubMed and PMC corpora. We present two versions of annotation criteria (mention-based annotation and semantic-based annotation) for species research. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves improvements in the final results. Finally, we perform species-based analysis of brain diseases, brain cognitive functions, and proteins related to the hippocampus and provide potential research directions for certain species.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sensory conflict among visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information induces vertiginous sensation and postural instability. To elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of the integration between the visual and vestibular cues in humans, we analyzed the cortical hemodynamic responses during sensory conflict between visual and horizontal rotatory vestibular stimulation using a multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. The subjects sat on a rotatory chair that was accelerated at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 20 s to the right or left, kept rotating at 60°/s for 80 s, and then decelerated at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 20 s. The subjects were instructed to watch white stripes projected on a screen surrounding the chair during the acceleration and deceleration periods. The white stripes moved in two ways; in the “congruent” condition, the stripes moved in the opposite direction of chair rotation at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., natural visual stimulation), whereas in the “incongruent” condition, the stripes moved in the same direction of chair rotation at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., conflicted visual stimulation). The cortical hemodynamic activity was recorded from the bilateral temporoparietal regions. Statistical analyses using NIRS-SPM software indicated that hemodynamic activity increased in the bilateral temporoparietal junctions (TPJs) and human MT+ complex, including the medial temporal (MT) area and medial superior temporal (MST) area in the incongruent condition. Furthermore, the subjective strength of the vertiginous sensation was negatively correlated with hemodynamic activity in the dorsal part of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) in and around the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). These results suggest that sensory conflict between the visual and vestibular stimuli promotes cortical cognitive processes in the cortical network consisting of the TPJ, the medial temporal gyrus (MTG), and IPS, which might contribute to self-motion perception to maintain a sense of balance or equilibrioception during sensory conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Aim&lt;p&gt;Electrodes that provide brain to machine or computer interfacing must survive the lifetime of the person to be considered an acceptable prosthetic. The electrodes may be external such as with electroencephalographic (EEG), internal extracortical such as electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Most intracortical electrodes are placed close to the neuropil being recorded and do not survive years of recording. However, the Neurotrophic Electrode is placed within the cortex and the neuropil grows inside and through the hollow tip of the electrode and is thus trapped inside. Highly flexible coiled lead wires minimize the strain on the electrode tip. Histological analysis includes immunohistochemical detection of neurofilaments and the absence of gliosis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;This configuration led to a decade long recording in this locked-in person. At year nine, the neural activity underwent conditioning experiments indicating that the neural activity was functional and not noise. This paper presents data on the histological analysis of the tissue inside the electrode tip after 13 years of implantation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This paper is a singular example of histological analysis after a decade of recording. The histological analysis laid out herein is strong evidence that the brain can grow neurites into the electrode tip and record for a decade. This is profoundly important in the field of brain to machine or computer interfacing by implying that long term electrodes should incorporate some means of growing the neuropil into the electrode rather than placing the electrode into the neuropil.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cross-subject variability problems hinder practical usages of Brain-Computer Interfaces. Recently, deep learning has been introduced into the BCI community due to its better generalization and feature representation abilities. However, most studies currently only have validated deep learning models for single datasets, and the generalization ability for other datasets still needs to be further verified. In this paper, we validated deep learning models for eight MI datasets and demonstrated that the cross-dataset variability problem weakened the generalization ability of models. To alleviate the impact of cross-dataset variability, we proposed an online pre-alignment strategy for aligning the EEG distributions of different subjects before training and inference processes. The results of this study show that deep learning models with online pre-alignment strategies could significantly improve the generalization ability across datasets without any additional calibration data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The majority of neurons in the neuronal system of the brain have a complex morphological structure, which diversifies the dynamics of neurons. In the granular layer of the cerebellum, there exists a unique cell type, the unipolar brush cell (UBC), that serves as an important relay cell for transferring information from outside mossy fibers to downstream granule cells. The distinguishing feature of the UBC is that it has a simple morphology, with only one short dendritic brush connected to its soma. Based on experimental evidence showing that UBCs exhibit a variety of dynamic behaviors, here we develop two simple models, one with a few detailed ion channels for simulation and the other one as a two-variable dynamical system for theoretical analysis, to characterize the intrinsic dynamics of UBCs. The reasonable values of the key channel parameters of the models can be determined by analysis of the stability of the resting membrane potential and the rebound firing properties of UBCs. Considered together with a large variety of synaptic dynamics installed on UBCs, we show that the simple-structured UBCs, as relay cells, can extend the range of dynamics and information from input mossy fibers to granule cells with low-frequency resonance and transfer stereotyped inputs to diverse amplitudes and phases of the output for downstream granule cells. These results suggest that neuronal computation, embedded within intrinsic ion channels and the diverse synaptic properties of single neurons without sophisticated morphology, can shape a large variety of dynamic behaviors to enhance the computational ability of local neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contains specialized cell types whose firing is tuned to aspects of an animal’s position and orientation in the environment, reflecting a neuronal representation of space. The spatially tuned firing properties of these cells quickly emerge during the third postnatal week of development in rodents. Spontaneous synchronized network activity (SSNA) has been shown to play a crucial role in the development of neuronal circuits prior to week 3. SSNA in MEC is well described in rodents during the first postnatal week, but there are little data about its development immediately prior to eye opening and spatial exploration. Furthermore, existing data lack single-cell resolution and are not integrated across layers. In this study, we addressed the question of whether the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of SSNA during the second postnatal week resemble that of the first week or whether distinct features emerge during this period. Using a combined calcium imaging and electrophysiology approach in vitro, we confirm that in mouse MEC during the second postnatal week, SSNA persists and in fact peaks, and is dependent on ionotropic glutamatergic signaling. However, SSNA differs from that observed during the first postnatal week in two ways: First, EC does not drive network activity in the hippocampus but only in neighboring neocortex (NeoC). Second, GABA does not drive network activity but influences it in a manner that is dependent both on age and receptor type. Therefore, we conclude that while there is a partial mechanistic overlap in SSNA between the first and second postnatal weeks, unique mechanistic features do emerge during the second week, suggestive of different or additional functions of MEC within the hippocampal-entorhinal circuitry with increasing maturation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Genetically encoded nanosensors such as the FRET-based adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensor ATeam enable the measurement of changes in ATP levels inside cells, promoting our understanding of metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons. The sensors are usually well characterized in vitro but display altered properties when expressed inside cells, precluding a meaningful conversion of changes in FRET ratios into changes in intracellular ATP concentrations ([ATP]) on the basis of their in vitro properties. Here, we present an experimental strategy for the intracellular calibration of two different variants of ATeam in organotypic tissue slice culture of the mouse brain. After cell-type-specific expression of the sensors in astrocytes or neurons, slices were first perfused with a saline containing the saponin β-escin to permeabilize plasma membranes for ATP. Next, cells were depleted of ATP by perfusion with ATP-free saline containing metabolic inhibitors. Finally, ATP was re-added at defined concentrations and resulting changes in the FRET ratio recorded. When employing this protocol, ATeam1.03 expressed in astrocytes reliably responds to changes in [ATP], exhibiting an apparent K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of 9.4 mM. The high-affinity sensor ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt; displayed a significantly lower intracellular K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.7 mM. On the basis of these calibrations, we found that induction of a recurrent neuronal network activity resulted in an initial transient increase in astrocytic [ATP] by ~0.12 mM as detected by ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt;, a result confirmed using ATeam1.03. In neurons, in contrast, [ATP] immediately started to decline upon initiation of a network activity, amounting to a decrease by an average of 0.29 mM after 2 min. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt; and ATeam1.03 display a significant increase in their apparent K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; when expressed inside cells as compared with in vitro. Moreover, they show that both ATeam variants enable the quantitative detection of changes of astrocytic and neuronal [ATP] in the physiological range. ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt;, however, seems preferable because its K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is close to baseline ATP levels. Finally, our data support the idea that synchronized neuronal activity initially stimulates the generation of ATP in astrocytes, presumably through increased glycolysis, whereas ATP levels in neurons decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Plasticity is a fundamental property of the nervous system that enables its adaptations to the ever-changing environment. Heightened plasticity typical for developing circuits facilitates their robust experience-dependent functional maturation. This plasticity wanes during adolescence to permit the stabilization of mature brain function, but abundant evidence supports that adult circuits exhibit both transient and long-term experience-induced plasticity. Cortical plasticity has been extensively studied throughout the life span in sensory systems and the main distinction between development and adulthood arising from these studies is the concept that passive exposure to relevant information is sufficient to drive robust plasticity early in life, while higher-order attentional mechanisms are necessary to drive plastic changes in adults. Recent work in the primary visual and auditory cortices began to define the circuit mechanisms that govern these processes and enable continuous adaptation to the environment, with transient circuit disinhibition emerging as a common prerequisite for both developmental and adult plasticity. Drawing from studies in visual and auditory systems, this review article summarizes recent reports on the circuit and cellular mechanisms of experience-driven plasticity in the developing and adult brains and emphasizes the similarities and differences between them. The benefits of distinct plasticity mechanisms used at different ages are discussed in the context of sensory learning, as well as their relationship to maladaptive plasticity and neurodevelopmental brain disorders. Knowledge gaps and avenues for future work are highlighted, and these will hopefully motivate future research in these areas, particularly those about the learning of complex skills during development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The extended frontal aslant tract (exFAT) is a tractography-based extension of the frontal aslant tract (FAT) which has been shown to be related with language and working memory performance in healthy human adults, but whether those functional implications map to structurally separate regions along its trajectory is still an open question. We present a tractography-informed Voxel-Based Morphometry procedure capable of detecting local tract-specific structural differences in white matter regions and apply it in two maximum variation sampling studies by comparing local differences in diffusion-derived microstructural parameters and fiber density along the exFAT territory between top performers and bottom performers in language and working memory tasks. In the right hemisphere we were able to detect, without prior constraints, a vertical frontal aslant component approximating the original FAT trajectory whose fiber density was significantly correlated with language (but not working memory) performance and an anterior cluster component corresponding to a distinct anterior frontal aslant component whose fiber density was significantly correlated with working memory (but not language) performance. The reported sub-division of the exFAT territory describes a set of frontal connections that are compatible with previously reported results on the Broca’s territory and frontal cortex hierarchical organization along an anterior-posterior gradient, suggesting that the exFAT could be part of a common neuroanatomical scaffold where language and working memory functions are integrated in the healthy human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Calcium stores in neurons are heterogeneous in compartmentalization and molecular composition. Danio rerio (zebrafish) is an animal model with a simply folded cerebellum similar in cellular organization to that of mammals. The aim of the study was to identify new endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium store markers in zebrafish adult brain with emphasis on cerebellum and optic tectum. By quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found three RNA transcripts coding for the intra-ER calcium binding protein calsequestrin: casq1a, casq1b, and casq2. In brain homogenates, two isoforms were detected by mass spectrometry and western blotting. Fractionation experiments of whole brain revealed that Casq1a and Casq2 were enriched in a heavy fraction containing ER microsomes and synaptic membranes. By in situ hybridization, we found the heterogeneous expression of casq1a and casq2 mRNA to be compatible with the cellular localization of calsequestrins investigated by immunofluorescence. Casq1 was expressed in neurogenic differentiation 1 expressing the granule cells of the cerebellum and the periventricular zone of the optic tectum. Casq2 was concentrated in parvalbumin expressing Purkinje cells. At a subcellular level, Casq1 was restricted to granular cell bodies, and Casq2 was localized in cell bodies, dendrites, and axons. Data are discussed in relation to the differential cellular and subcellular distribution of other cerebellum calcium store markers and are evaluated with respect to the putative relevance of calsequestrins in the neuron-specific functional activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;People with Down syndrome, which is a trisomy of chromosome 21, exhibit intellectual disability from infancy and neuropathology similar to Alzheimer’s disease, such as amyloid plaques, from an early age. Recently, we showed that cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3, promotes the clearance of amyloid β and rescues cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. The objective of the present study was to examine whether cilostazol improves behaviors in the most widely used animal model of Down syndrome, i.e., Ts65Dn mice. Mice were supplemented with cilostazol from the fetal period until young adulthood. Supplementation significantly ameliorated novel-object recognition in Ts65Dn females and partially ameliorated sensorimotor function as determined by the rotarod test in Ts65Dn females and hyperactive locomotion in Ts65Dn males. Cilostazol supplementation significantly shortened swimming distance in Ts65Dn males in the Morris water maze test, suggesting that the drug improved cognitive function, although it did not shorten swimming duration, which was due to decreased swimming speed. Thus, this study suggests that early supplementation with cilostazol partially rescues behavioral abnormalities seen in Down syndrome and indicates that the effects are sex-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra leads to a progressive, long-term decline of movement and other non-motor deficits. The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) often appear later in the course of the disease, when most of the functional dopaminergic neurons have been lost. The late onset of the disease, the severity of the illness, and its impact on the global health system demand earlier diagnosis and better targeted therapy. PD etiology and pathogenesis are largely unknown. There are mutations in genes that have been linked to PD and, from these complex phenotypes, mitochondrial dysfunction emerged as central in the pathogenesis and evolution of PD. In fact, several PD-associated genes negatively impact on mitochondria physiology, supporting the notion that dysregulation of mitochondrial signaling and homeostasis is pathogenically relevant. Derangement of mitochondrial homeostatic controls can lead to oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. Restoring deranged signaling cascades to and from mitochondria in PD neurons may then represent a viable opportunity to reset energy metabolism and delay the death of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we will highlight the relevance of dysfunctional mitochondrial homeostasis and signaling in PD, the molecular mechanisms involved, and potential therapeutic approaches to restore mitochondrial activities in damaged neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a sequence of pathological changes, which are commonly assessed in vivo using various brain imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Currently, the most approaches to analyze statistical associations between regions and imaging modalities rely on Pearson correlation or linear regression models. However, these models are prone to spurious correlations arising from uninformative shared variance and multicollinearity. Notably, there are no appropriate multivariate statistical models available that can easily integrate dozens of multicollinear variables derived from such data, being able to utilize the additional information provided from the combination of data sources. Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) can estimate the conditional dependency from given data, which is conceptually expected to closely reflect the underlying causal relationships between various variables. Hence, we applied GGMs to assess multimodal regional brain alterations in AD. We obtained data from N = 972 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The mean amyloid load (AV45-PET), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), and gray matter volume (MRI) were calculated for each of the 108 cortical and subcortical brain regions. GGMs were estimated using a Bayesian framework for the combined multimodal data and the resulted conditional dependency networks were compared to classical covariance networks based on Pearson correlation. Additionally, graph-theoretical network statistics were calculated to determine network alterations associated with disease status. The resulting conditional dependency matrices were much sparser (≈10% density) than Pearson correlation matrices (≈50% density). Within imaging modalities, conditional dependency networks yielded clusters connecting anatomically adjacent regions. For the associations between different modalities, only few region-specific connections were detected. Network measures such as small-world coefficient were significantly altered across diagnostic groups, with a biphasic u-shape trajectory, i.e., increased small-world coefficient in early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), similar values in late MCI, and decreased values in AD dementia patients compared to cognitively normal controls. In conclusion, GGMs removed commonly shared variance among multimodal measures of regional brain alterations in MCI and AD, and yielded sparser matrices compared to correlation networks based on the Pearson coefficient. Therefore, GGMs may be used as alternative to thresholding-approaches typically applied to correlation networks to obtain the most informative relations between variables.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Heterozygous mutations of the GBA1 gene, encoding for lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), occur in a considerable percentage of all patients with sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD), varying between 8% and 12% across the world. Genome wide association studies have confirmed the strong correlation between PD and GBA1 mutations, pointing to this element as a major risk factor for PD, possibly the most important one after age. The pathobiological mechanisms underlying the link between a defective function of GCase and the development of PD are still unknown and are currently the focus of intense investigation in the community of pre-clinical and clinical researchers in the PD field. A major controversy regards the fact that, despite the unequivocal correlation between the presence of GBA1 mutations and the risk of developing PD, only a minority of asymptomatic carriers with GBA1 mutations convert to PD in their lifetime. GBA1 mutations reduce the enzymatic function of GCase, impairing lysosomal efficiency and the cellular ability to dispose of pathological alpha-synuclein. Changes in the cellular lipidic content resulting from the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, triggered by lysosomal dysfunction, may contribute to the pathological modification of alpha-synuclein, due to its ability to interact with cell membrane lipids. Mutant GCase can impair mitochondrial function and cause endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby impacting on cellular energy production and proteostasis. Importantly, reduced GCase activity is associated with clear activation of microglia, a major mediator of neuroinflammatory response within the brain parenchyma, which points to neuroinflammation as a major consequence of GCase dysfunction. In this present review article, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of GBA1 mutations in PD development and their phenotypic correlations. We also discuss the potential role of the GCase pathway in the search for PD biomarkers that may enable the development of disease modifying therapies. Answering these questions will aid clinicians in offering more appropriate counseling to the patients and their caregivers and provide future directions for PD preclinical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There is currently a need for engaging, user-friendly, and repeatable tasks for assessment of cognitive and motor function in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. This study evaluated the feasibility of a maze-like Numberlink puzzle game in assessing differences in game-based measures of cognition and motor function due to age and neurodegenerative diseases. Fifty-five participants, including young (18–31 years, n = 18), older (64–79 years, n = 14), and oldest adults (86–98 years, n = 14), and patients with Parkinson’s (59–76 years, n = 4) and Huntington’s disease (HD; 35–66 years, n = 5) played different difficulty levels of the Numberlink puzzle game and completed usability questionnaires and tests for psychomotor, attentional, visuospatial, and constructional and executive function. Analyses of Numberlink game-based cognitive (solving time and errors) and motor [mean velocity and movement direction changes (MDC)] performance metrics revealed statistically significant differences between age groups and between patients with HD and older adults. However, patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) did not differ from older adults. Correlational analyses showed significant associations between game-based performance and movement metrics and performance on neuropsychological tests for psychomotor, attentional, visuospatial, and constructional and executive function. Furthermore, varying characteristics of the Numberlink puzzle game succeeded in creating graded difficulty levels. Findings from this study support recent suggestions that data from a maze-like puzzle game provide potential “digital biomarkers” to assess changes in psychomotor, visuoconstructional, and executive function related to aging and neurodegeneration. In particular, game-based movement measures from the maze-like puzzle Numberlink games are promising as a tool to monitor the progression of motor impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are needed to more comprehensively establish the cognitive validity and test–retest reliability of using Numberlink puzzles as a valid cognitive assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Thiele et al. show that importin-α3 is one of the major nuclear transporters of NF-κB in the mammalian lung. High-level TNF-α-inducing HPAIVs inhibit importin-α3 mRNA transcription by interfering with its promoter activity.

Biological networks across scales exhibit hierarchical organization that may constrain network function. Yet, understanding how these hierarchies arise due to the operational constraint of the networks and whether they impose limits to molecular phenotypes remains elusive. Here we show that metabolic networks include a hierarchy of reactions based on a natural flux ordering that holds for every steady state. We find that the hierarchy of reactions is reflected in experimental measurements of transcript, protein and flux levels of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; under various growth conditions as well as in the catalytic rate constants of the corresponding enzymes. Our findings point at resource partitioning and a fine-tuning of enzyme levels in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to respect the constraints imposed by the network structure at steady state. Since reactions in upper layers of the hierarchy impose an upper bound on the flux of the reactions downstream, the hierarchical organization of metabolism due to the flux ordering has direct applications in metabolic engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qQph3EDddVU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Lisa-Katrin Schätzle, Ali Hadizadeh Esfahani, Andreas Schuppert&lt;/p&gt;

Translational models directly relating drug response specific processes that can be observed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; role in cancer patients constitute a crucial part of the development of personalized medication. Unfortunately, current studies often focus on the optimization of isolated model characteristics instead of examining the overall modeling workflow and the interplay of the individual model components. Moreover, they are often limited to specific data sets only. Therefore, they are often confined by the irreproducibility of the results and the non-transferability of the approaches into other contexts. In this study, we present a thorough investigation of translational models and their ability to predict the drug responses of cancer patients originating from diverse data sets using the R-package FORESEE. By systematically scanning the modeling space for optimal combinations of different model settings, we can determine models of extremely high predictivity and work out a few modeling guidelines that promote simplicity. Yet, we identify noise within the data, sample size effects, and drug unspecificity as factors that deteriorate the models’ robustness. Moreover, we show that cell line models of high accuracy do not necessarily excel in predicting drug response processes in patients. We therefore hope to motivate future research to consider &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; aspects more carefully to ultimately generate deeper insights into applicable precision medicine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IvU2KaKPQNI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of liver disease. The capsid is an essential component of the virion and it is therefore of interest how it assembles and disassembles. The capsid protein is unusual both for its rare fold and that it polymerizes according to two different icosahedral symmetries, causing the polypeptide chain to exist in seven quasi-equivalent environments: A, B, and C in AB and CC dimers in T = 3 capsids, and A, B, C, and D in AB and CD dimers in T = 4 capsids. We have compared the two capsids by cryo-EM at 3.5 Å resolution. To ensure a valid comparison, the two capsids were prepared and imaged under identical conditions. We find that the chains have different conformations and potential energies, with the T = 3 C chain having the lowest. Three of the four quasi-equivalent dimers are asymmetric with respect to conformation and potential energy; however, the T = 3 CC dimer is symmetrical and has the lowest potential energy although its intra-dimer interface has the least free energy of formation. Of all the inter-dimer interfaces, the CB interface has the least area and free energy, in both capsids. From the calculated energies of higher-order groupings of dimers discernible in the lattices we predict early assembly intermediates, and indeed we observe such structures by negative stain EM of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assembly reactions. By sequence analysis and computational alanine scanning we identify key residues and motifs involved in capsid assembly. Our results explain several previously reported observations on capsid assembly, disassembly, and dimorphism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1gKDlqd1oAs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Recent years have seen rising incidence of dengue and large outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya, which are all caused by viruses transmitted by &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. In most settings, the primary intervention against &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt;-transmitted viruses is vector control, such as indoor, ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying. Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) has the potential to more effectively impact &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt;-borne diseases, but its implementation requires careful planning and evaluation. The optimal time to deploy these interventions and their relative epidemiological effects are, however, not well understood. We used an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission calibrated to data from Iquitos, Peru to assess the epidemiological effects of these interventions under differing strategies for deploying them. Specifically, we compared strategies where spray application was initiated when incidence rose above a threshold based on incidence in recent years to strategies where spraying occurred at the same time(s) each year. In the absence of spraying, the model predicted 361,000 infections [inter-quartile range (IQR): 347,000–383,000] in the period 2000–2010. The ULV strategy with the fewest median infections was spraying twice yearly, in March and October, which led to a median of 172,000 infections [IQR: 158,000–183,000], a 52% reduction from baseline. Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days). For TIRS, the best strategy was threshold-based, which led to the fewest infections of all strategies tested (9,900; [IQR: 8,720–11,400], a 94% reduction), and required fewer days spraying than the equivalent ULV strategy (280). Although spraying twice each year is likely to avert the most infections, our results indicate that a threshold-based strategy can become an alternative to better balance the translation of spraying effort into impact, particularly if used with a residual insecticide.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QKd-nkAFWE0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Sequential sampling models such as the drift diffusion model (DDM) have a long tradition in research on perceptual decision-making, but mounting evidence suggests that these models can account for response time (RT) distributions that arise during reinforcement learning and value-based decision-making. Building on this previous work, we implemented the DDM as the choice rule in inter-temporal choice (temporal discounting) and risky choice (probability discounting) using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation. We validated our approach in data from nine patients with focal lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex / medial orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/mOFC) and nineteen age- and education-matched controls. Model comparison revealed that, for both tasks, the data were best accounted for by a variant of the drift diffusion model including a non-linear mapping from value-differences to trial-wise drift rates. Posterior predictive checks confirmed that this model provided a superior account of the relationship between value and RT. We then applied this modeling framework and 1) reproduced our previous results regarding temporal discounting in vmPFC/mOFC patients and 2) showed in a previously unpublished data set on risky choice that vmPFC/mOFC patients exhibit increased risk-taking relative to controls. Analyses of DDM parameters revealed that patients showed substantially increased non-decision times and reduced response caution during risky choice. In contrast, vmPFC/mOFC damage abolished neither scaling nor asymptote of the drift rate. Relatively intact value processing was also confirmed using DDM mixture models, which revealed that in both groups &amp;gt;98% of trials were better accounted for by a DDM with value modulation than by a null model without value modulation. Our results highlight that novel insights can be gained from applying sequential sampling models in studies of inter-temporal and risky decision-making in cognitive neuroscience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4-f6shlX5Ys&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Analytical forms for neuronal firing rates are important theoretical tools for the analysis of network states. Since the 1960s, the majority of approaches have treated neurons as being electrically compact and therefore isopotential. These approaches have yielded considerable insight into how single-cell properties affect network activity; however, many neuronal classes, such as cortical pyramidal cells, are electrically extended objects. Calculation of the complex flow of electrical activity driven by stochastic spatio-temporal synaptic input streams in these structures has presented a significant analytical challenge. Here we demonstrate that an extension of the level-crossing method of Rice, previously used for compact cells, provides a general framework for approximating the firing rate of neurons with spatial structure. Even for simple models, the analytical approximations derived demonstrate a surprising richness including: independence of the firing rate to the electrotonic length for certain models, but with a form distinct to the point-like leaky integrate-and-fire model; a non-monotonic dependence of the firing rate on the number of dendrites receiving synaptic drive; a significant effect of the axonal and somatic load on the firing rate; and the role that the trigger position on the axon for spike initiation has on firing properties. The approach necessitates only calculating the mean and variances of the non-thresholded voltage and its rate of change in neuronal structures subject to spatio-temporal synaptic fluctuations. The combination of simplicity and generality promises a framework that can be built upon to incorporate increasing levels of biophysical detail and extend beyond the low-rate firing limit treated in this paper.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y8Nf5bPog3Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Transcription activation by cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CAP) is the classic paradigm of transcription regulation in bacteria. CAP was suggested to activate transcription on class-II promoters via a recruitment and isomerization mechanism. However, whether and how it modifies RNA polymerase (RNAP) to initiate transcription remains unclear. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of an intact &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; class-II CAP-dependent transcription activation complex (CAP-TAC) with and without de novo RNA transcript. The structures reveal two distinct architectures of TAC and raise the possibility that CAP binding may induce substantial conformational changes in all the subunits of RNAP and transiently widen the main cleft of RNAP to facilitate DNA promoter entering and formation of the initiation open complex. These structural changes vanish during further RNA transcript synthesis. The observations in this study may reveal a possible on-pathway intermediate and suggest a possibility that CAP activates transcription by inducing intermediate state, in addition to the previously proposed stabilization mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IL2sq4EEp9s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Interhemispheric connections enable interaction and integration of sensory information in bilaterian nervous systems and are thought to optimize sensory computations. However, the cellular and spatial organization of interhemispheric networks and the computational properties they mediate in vertebrates are still poorly understood. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent the connectivity between left and right brain hemispheres participates in sensory processing. Here, we show that the zebrafish olfactory bulbs (OBs) receive direct interhemispheric projections from their contralateral counterparts in addition to top-down inputs from the contralateral zebrafish homolog of olfactory cortex. The direct interhemispheric projections between the OBs reach peripheral layers of the contralateral OB and retain a precise topographic organization, which directly connects similarly tuned olfactory glomeruli across hemispheres. In contrast, interhemispheric top-down inputs consist of diffuse projections that broadly innervate the inhibitory granule cell layer. Jointly, these interhemispheric connections elicit a balance of topographically organized excitation and nontopographic inhibition on the contralateral OB and modulate odor responses. We show that the interhemispheric connections in the olfactory system enable the modulation of odor response and contribute to a small but significant improvement in the detection of a reproductive pheromone when presented together with complex olfactory cues by potentiating the response of the pheromone selective neurons. Taken together, our data show a previously unknown function for an interhemispheric connection between chemosensory maps of the olfactory system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Jo-Gyw42cMs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Countering the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens requires improved understanding of how resistance emerges and spreads in individual species, which are often embedded in complex microbial communities such as the human gut microbiome. Interactions with other microorganisms in such communities might suppress growth and resistance evolution of individual species (e.g., via resource competition) but could also potentially accelerate resistance evolution via horizontal transfer of resistance genes. It remains unclear how these different effects balance out, partly because it is difficult to observe them directly. Here, we used a gut microcosm approach to quantify the effect of three human gut microbiome communities on growth and resistance evolution of a focal strain of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We found the resident microbial communities not only suppressed growth and colonisation by focal &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; but also prevented it from evolving antibiotic resistance upon exposure to a beta-lactam antibiotic. With samples from all three human donors, our focal &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strain only evolved antibiotic resistance in the absence of the resident microbial community, even though we found resistance genes, including a highly effective resistance plasmid, in resident microbial communities. We identified physical constraints on plasmid transfer that can explain why our focal strain failed to acquire some of these beneficial resistance genes, and we found some chromosomal resistance mutations were only beneficial in the absence of the resident microbiota. This suggests, depending on in situ gene transfer dynamics, interactions with resident microbiota can inhibit antibiotic-resistance evolution of individual species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7BukWKQPzEA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the prevalence of the perfusion‐weighted imaging (PWI)–diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch and response to intravenous thrombolysis in the WAKE‐UP trial.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prespecified post hoc analysis of ischemic stroke patients screened for DWI–fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch in WAKE‐UP who underwent PWI. We defined PWI‐DWI mismatch as ischemic core volume &amp;lt; 70ml, mismatch volume &amp;gt; 10ml, and mismatch ratio &amp;gt; 1.2. Primary efficacy end point was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days, adjusted for age and symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1,362 magnetic resonance imaging–screened patients, 431 underwent PWI. Of these, 57 (13%) had a double mismatch, 151 (35%) only a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch, and 54 (13%) only a PWI‐DWI mismatch. DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was more prevalent than PWI‐DWI mismatch (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 43–53% vs 26%, 95% CI = 22–30%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Screening for either one of the mismatch profiles resulted in a yield of 61% (95% CI = 56–65%). Prevalence of PWI‐DWI mismatch was similar in patients with (27%) or without (24%) DWI‐FLAIR mismatch (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.52). In an exploratory analysis in the small subgroup of 208 randomized patients with PWI, PWI‐DWI mismatch status did not modify the treatment response (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for interaction = 0.73).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating both the DWI‐FLAIR and PWI‐DWI mismatch patterns in patients with unknown time of stroke onset will result in the highest yield of thrombolysis treatment. The treatment benefit of alteplase in patients with a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch seems to be driven not merely by the presence of a PWI‐DWI mismatch, although this analysis was underpowered.

&lt;p&gt;There is much controversy about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep‐disordered breathing on the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between markers of sleep‐related hypoxemia and brain anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors, only mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with bilateral volume of hippocampus (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), thalamus (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), putamen (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), and angular gyrus (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). We observed the same relationship in left hemispheric amygdala (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010), caudate (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008), inferior frontal gyrus (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004), and supramarginal gyrus (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). The other respiratory variables—lowest oxygen saturation, percentage of sleep time with oxygen saturation &amp;lt; 90%, apnea–hypopnea index, and oxygen desaturation index—did not show any significant association with brain volumes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with atrophy of cortical and subcortical brain areas known for high sensitivity to oxygen supply. Their vulnerability to hypoxemia may contribute to behavioral phenotype and cognitive decline in patients with sleep‐disordered breathing. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulates life‐sustaining functions ranging from appetite and digestion to heart rate and breathing. It is also the brain’s primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top‐down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain‐wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone‐sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS‐projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt;/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc32a1&lt;/i&gt;/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington’s nucleus, Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral “mind–body” symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospectively characterize changes in serum proteins following sport‐related concussion and determine whether candidate biomarkers discriminate concussed athletes from controls and are associated with duration of symptoms following concussion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school and collegiate athletes were enrolled between 2015 and 2018. Blood was collected at preinjury baseline and within 6 hours (early acute) and at 24 to 48 hours (late acute) following concussion in football players (n = 106), matched uninjured football players (n = 84), and non–contact‐sport athletes (n = 50). Glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin c‐terminal hydrolase‐L1, S100 calcium binding protein B, alpha‐II‐spectrin breakdown product 150, interleukin 6, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, and c‐reactive protein were measured in serum. Linear models assessed changes in protein concentrations over time. Receiver operating curves quantified the discrimination of concussed athletes from controls. A Cox proportional hazard model determined whether proteins were associated with symptom recovery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All proteins except glial fibrillary acidic protein and c‐reactive protein were significantly elevated at the early acute phase postinjury relative to baseline and both control groups and discriminated concussed athletes from controls with areas under the curve of 0.68 to 0.84. The candidate biomarkers also significantly improved the discrimination of concussed athletes from noncontact controls compared to symptom severity alone. Glial fibrillary acidic protein was elevated postinjury relative to baseline in concussed athletes with a loss of consciousness or amnesia. Finally, early acute levels of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist were associated with the number of days to symptom recovery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain injury and inflammatory proteins show promise as objective diagnostic biomarkers for sport‐related concussion, and inflammatory markers may provide prognostic value. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The ability to mentally travel to specific events from one’s past, dubbed episodic autobiographical memory (E-AM), contributes to adaptive functioning. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying its typical interindividual variation remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we capitalize on existing evidence that successful performance on E-AM tasks draws on the ability to visualize past episodes and reinstate their unique spatiotemporal context. Hence, here, we test whether features of the brain’s functional architecture relevant to perceptual versus conceptual processes shape individual differences in both self-rated E-AM and laboratory-based episodic memory (EM) for random visual scene sequences (visual EM). We propose that superior subjective E-AM and visual EM are associated with greater similarity in static neural organization patterns, potentially indicating greater efficiency in switching, between rest and mental states relevant to encoding perceptual information. Complementarily, we postulate that impoverished subjective E-AM and visual EM are linked to dynamic brain organization patterns implying a predisposition towards semanticizing novel perceptual information. Analyses were conducted on resting state and task-based fMRI data from 329 participants (160 women) in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) who completed visual and verbal EM assessments, and an independent gender diverse sample (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 59) who self-rated their E-AM. Interindividual differences in subjective E-AM were linked to the same neural mechanisms underlying visual, but not verbal, EM, in general agreement with the hypothesized static and dynamic brain organization patterns. Our results suggest that higher E-AM entails more efficient processing of temporally extended information sequences, whereas lower E-AM entails more efficient semantic or gist-based processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

By using the coupling to microwave photons in a cavity as an alternative relaxation path, it is demonstrated that spins can be cooled below the lattice temperature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nphys/rss/current/~4/rq6s9KAdOjA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>
