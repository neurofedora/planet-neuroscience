                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Inflammation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) alleviates mitochondrial apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells, and to further explore the mechanism involved. Prepared PC-12 cells were treated with IGF-1, Mdivi-1 (DRP1 blocker), LY294002 (PI3K blocker), betulinic acid (NF-κB activator) or their combinations. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation were then measured to assess mitochondrial function. The rate of apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The expression of several apoptosis proteins (i.e. Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and signaling proteins (i.e. p-GSK3β, NF-κB and NLRP3) was measured using western blotting. Compared with the control cells, the LPS-treated cells showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased apoptosis and upregulation of apoptosis proteins, which were significantly alleviated by Mdivi-1. These findings indicate that neuronal apoptosis was activated partly through the mitochondrial pathway. IGF-1 treatment inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-treated cells. The reagent also increased the expression of p-GSK3β and decreased the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. Both LY294002 and betulinic acid reversed the protective effect of IGF-1. In addition, LY294002 affected the expression of the three signaling proteins, while betulinic acid only affected the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. These findings indicated a GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway was existed and was involved in the protective mechanism of IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 alleviated mitochondrial apoptosis through GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The existence of Gram-negative bacteria in the brain, regardless of underlying immune status has been demonstrated by recent studies. The colocalization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1-40/42&lt;/sub&gt; in amyloid plaques supports the hypothesis that brain microbes may be the cause, triggering chronic neuroinflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate the behavioral changes induced by infectious neuroinflammation, we chose the third ventricle as the site of a single LPS injection (20 μg or 80 μg) in male Wistar rats to avoid mechanical injury to forebrain structures while inducing widespread inflammation throughout the brain. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by LPS resulted in depressive-like behaviors and the impairment of spatial learning; however, there was no evidence of the development of pathological hallmarks (e.g., the phosphorylation of tau) for 10 months following LPS injection. The acceleration of cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 and the retardation of cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR were observed in the hippocampus of rats treated with either low-dose or high-dose LPS. The rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol metabolism (CYP46A1) in SH-SY5Y cells and synthesis (HMGCR) in U251 cells were altered by inflammation stimulators, including LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The data suggest that chronic neuroinflammation provoked by the administration of LPS into the third ventricle may induce depressive-like symptoms and that the loss of cholesterol might be a biomarker of chronic neuroinflammation. The lack of pathological hallmarks of AD in our model indicates that Gram-negative bacteria infection might not be a single cause of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twins studies indicate that many individual factors are associated with genetic polymorphisms in tobacco use, dependence vulnerability, and the ability to quit smoking. Opioid receptor delta-type 1 (OPRD1) is one of the most important genes in the opioid pathway. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association of variants located in the intron 1 of the OPRD1 gene, including rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589, with susceptibility to nicotine dependence among northern Iranians. DNA of 426 individuals, including 224 smokers and 202 healthy people, were extracted with the salting-out standard technique, qualified with Agarose gel, then quantified with Nanodrop, and finally genotyped by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR. All statistical analyses were performed by SNPAlyze version 8.1 and SPSS version 20. Results revealed no significant association of all three studied variants with the susceptibility to nicotine dependence in any models of inheritance. However, there were five haplotypes with an overall frequency higher than 0.05; no significant impact of any of them on nicotine dependence was observed. Altogether, rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589 were not associated with nicotine dependence among northern Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To study the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on axon regeneration and secretion change of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) under oxidative stress after spinal cord injury (SCI), and further explore the effect of changes in DRG secretion caused by PBM on the polarization of macrophages. The PBM-DRG model was constructed to perform PBM on neurons under oxidative stress simulated in vitro. And the irradiation conditions were as follows: wavelength, 810 nm; power density, 2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; irradiation area, 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; and irradiation time, 440 s. Then resulted in an energy of 4 J (2 mW/cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 4.5 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 440 s). About 100 μM H&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was added to the culture medium to simulate oxidative stress after SCI. An ROS (reactive oxygen species) assay kit was used to measure ROS contend in the DRG. The survival level of the neurons was measured using the CCK-8 method, and the axon regeneration of neurons was observed by using immunofluorescence. The secretion level of CCL2 from DRG was determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Further culturing macrophages of DRG-conditioned medium culture, the expression level of iNOS and Arg-1 in macrophages was assessed using Western blot analysis. The expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was determined by ELISA. After adding the neutralizing antibody of CCL2 to the DRG neuron-conditioned medium following PBM irradiation to culture macrophages to observe the effects on macrophage polarization and secretion. PBM could reduce ROS levels in neurons, increase neuronal survival under oxidative stress, and promote neuronal axon regeneration. In addition, PBM could also promote CCL2 secretion by DRG under oxidative stress. By constructing a DRG supernatant-M1 macrophage adoptive culture model, we found that the supernatant of DRG after PBM intervention could reduce the expression level of iNOS and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in M1 macrophages; at the same time, it could also up-regulate the expression of Arg-1, one of the markers of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, these effects could be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies of CCL2. PBM could promote survival and axonal regeneration of DRG under SCI oxidative stress, increase the secretion level of CCL2 by DRG, and this change can reduce the polarization of macrophages to M1, further indicating that PBM could promote spinal cord injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Behçet syndrome (BS) is a vasculitis characterized by several clinical manifestations including the rare neurological involvement (neuro-BS, NBS). The aim of our pivotal study was to investigate the mutational status of several inflammation-related genes in a cohort of Italian patients with and without the neurological involvement (20 NBS vs 40 no-NBS patients). The preliminary &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection and primer design were performed by NCBI Primer-Blast tool. Genomic DNA was isolated and amplified using PCR. PCR amplicons were sequenced and bioinformatically analysed. Twelve tagSNPs were selected and genotyped: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187, rs17482078, and rs27044; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL10 rs1800872&lt;/em&gt; and rs1518111, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12A&lt;/em&gt; rs17810546, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL12RB2&lt;/em&gt; rs924080, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STAT4&lt;/em&gt; rs7572482, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CCR1&lt;/em&gt; rs7616215, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KLRC4&lt;/em&gt; rs2617170, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;UBAC2&lt;/em&gt; rs3825427.&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt; ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs showed statistically significant higher frequencies in NBS group than no-NBS. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; rs30187 AA was more common in no-NBS patients (20.0% NBS vs 47.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while rs17482078 GA frequency was higher in NBS patients (55.0% NBS vs 22.5% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, OR: 4.21). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; rs17375018 GG was more frequent in NBS group (65.0% NBS vs 40.0% no-NBS; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), according to a previous finding. No other statistically significant differences were found. In conclusion, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ERAP1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL23R&lt;/em&gt; SNPs were found associated with neurological involvement of BS. Additional and larger analyses were required to verify our preliminary findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cypermethrin activates microglia, which is found to be decisive in neurodegeneration in the experimental rats. While the involvement of microglial activation in toxicant-induced neurodegeneration is reported, the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression of inflammatory proteins from the rat primary microglia is not yet properly understood. The study intended to delineate the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression and release of proteins from the microglia. Rat primary microglial cells were treated with cypermethrin to check the expression of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin-treated microglia conditioned media and cells were collected to measure the expression and release of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin augmented the protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and p42/44, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and MMP-9 levels in the cell lysate and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in the microglia conditioned media. Pre-treatment with minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor or rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, notably reduced the release of TNF-α in the conditioned media and expression of iNOS protein in the microglia. Minocycline reduced the expression of PKC-δ, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins in the microglia. While cypermethrin-treated conditioned media induced the toxicity in the rat primary neurons, minocycline or rottlerin reduced the cypermethrin treated microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity. The outcomes of the present study suggest that cypermethrin activates microglia and releases TNF-α and IL-1β as well as up-regulates the expression of PKC-δ, iNOS, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins, which could contribute to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposit in the parenchyma is a major characteristic in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the impaired glymphatic clearance contributes to the Aβ accumulation. It was reported that L-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) showed the potential neuroprotective effect in the rodent models of AD. The effects of NBP on the glymphatic system were explored in this study. In the wild-type mice, both CSF tracer influx and perivascular drainage increased after NBP treatment compared with vehicle treatment. Moreover, NBP promoted the perivascular drainage of Aβ via increased cerebral pulsation, which could be inhibited by propranolol. Then, we studied the potential of 3-month NBP treatment on Aβ deposits in 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice. NBP daily treatments remarkably improved cognitive behavior in &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus internal-ref refid-sec7&quot;&gt;Morris water maze&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, NBP could reduce Aβ deposition and decrease parenchymal Aβ levels. In addition, NBP markedly improved the perivascular AQP4 localization. Our results indicated that NBP could enhance the glymphatic clearance and reduce parenchymal Aβ deposit in the APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that it may have potential in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic event worldwide. Work from the past decade has highlighted the key involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in SCI. Nevertheless, the molecular action of lncRNA H19 in SCI is still not fully understood. The levels of H19, microRNA (miR)-325-3p, and neuronal differentiation 4 (NEUROD4) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell apoptosis. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Targeted relationships among H19, miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), or RNA pull-down assays. Our data showed that H19 level was overexpressed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV2 cells. H19 silencing alleviated LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, H19 in BV2 cells directly targeted miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 was a direct target of miR-325-3p. Moreover, miR-325-3p was a functional target of H19 in regulating cell apoptosis and inflammation induced by LPS. Enforced expression of miR-325-3p relieved LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation through reducing NEUROD4. Furthermore, H19 in BV2 cells regulated NEUROD4 expression through targeting miR-325-3p. Our results identified that the silencing of H19 attenuated LPS-evoked microglia cell apoptosis and inflammation after SCI at least partially through targeting the miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 axis, highlighting a novel approach for SCI management.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Repeated exposure to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reduces responses of monocytes/macrophages to LPS (LPS/endotoxin tolerance). Microglial exposure to Aβ deposits, a TLR4 ligand, may cause “Aβ/LPS tolerance,” leading to decreased Aβ clearance. We demonstrated that microglial activation by LPS is diminished in Aβ deposit-bearing 12-month-old model mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compared with non-AD mice and Aβ deposit-free 2-month-old AD mice. Because miR-146a plays a predominant role in inducing TLR tolerance in macrophages and because miR-146a in extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by inflammatory macrophages increases in circulation, we investigated potential roles of miR-146a and inflammatory EVs in inducing TLR tolerance in microglia and in altering expression of inflammatory AD risk genes. We found that miR-146a upregulation induces TLR tolerance and alters expression of inflammatory AD risk genes in response to LPS treatment in BV2 microglia. LPS brain injection altered expression of the AD risk genes in 12-month-old AD mice but not in non-AD littermates. EVs from inflammatory macrophages polarize BV2 microglia to M1 phenotype and induce TLR tolerance. Microglia exposed to Aβ in the brain show reduced cytokine responses to systemic inflammation due to peripheral LPS injection, indicating TLR/Aβ tolerance in microglia. Our results suggest that increased miR-146a induces microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance and that circulating EVs shed by inflammatory macrophages contribute to microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance, leading to reduced Aβ clearance. Our study also suggests that altered expression of inflammatory AD risk genes may contribute to AD development via the same molecular mechanism underlying LPS tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioma is a prevalent primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used to treat glioma. However, the resistance of TMZ to glioma poses heavy burden to glioma treatment. In this study, the effects of glioma resistance to TMZ and underlying mechanism were revealed. The expression levels of circ-VPS18, microRNA-370 (miR-370) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of RUNX1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and multi-drug resistance gene-1 (MDR1) was determined by western blot. The functional effects of circ-VPS18 knockdown on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression were revealed by cell counting kit-8 proliferation (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell assays. The impacts of circ-VPS18 deletion on TMZ sensitivity in vivo were illustrated by in vivo tumor formation assay. The binding relationship between miR-370 and circ-VPS18 or RUNX1 was predicted by starBase v2.0 online database and identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Circ-VPS18 expression and the mRNA and protein levels of RUNX1 were dramatically upregulated, and miR-370 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma cells, TMZ-resistant glioma tissues, or tissue compared with control groups. Functionally, circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity, induced cell apoptosis, whereas repressed cell viability, migration and invasion in U251/TR and LN229/TR cells, which was reversed by miR-370 inhibitor. Additionally, RUNX1 overexpression hindered the effects of miR-370 on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression. Circ-VPS18 knockdown enhanced TMZ sensitivity in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-VPS18 functioned as a sponge of miR-370 and miR-370 targeted RUNX1. Circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity and repressed glioma progression by sponging miR-370 to downregulate RUNX1 expression, which provided a new insight in further studying glioma resistance to TMZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a significant threat to human life and health. The intraneuronal accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brains of AD patients results in neuronal cell death, which is a key factor that triggers multiple changes in the pathogenesis of AD. The inhibition of Aβ-induced neuronal cell death may potentially help in the intervention and treatment of AD. Our previous study reported that tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) is induced by and promotes Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;25–35&lt;/sub&gt;-induced neurotoxicity in mouse neuronal cells, but the roles and regulatory mechanisms of TNFAIP1 are still largely unknown. In this study, our experimental results show that TNFAIP1 and p-TNFAIP1 (phosphorylation of TNFAIP1 at Ser280) are overexpressed in the neurons of the cortex and hippocampus in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and the transcription factor NF-κB is involved in the Aβ-induced upregulation of TNFAIP1. Moreover, our results suggest that TNFAIP1 contributes to the Aβ-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), and neuronal cell death in human SH-SY5Y cells. We further revealed that Aβ increases the binding of TNFAIP1 to RhoB, and knockdown of RhoB attenuates the TNFAIP1-induced apoptosis of human SH-SY5Y cells. These data suggest that TNFAIP1 is closely associated with AD pathogenesis, and overexpression of TNFAIP1 in the neurons of the brains of AD patients plays a role in apoptosis, at least in part, via RhoB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Migraine is a prevalent disorder in humans and represents one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability. Several genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathobiology of migraine. A number of studies have underscored the role of dysregulated immune reactions. We compared the expression levels &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-17&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IFN-γ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; cytokines in blood specimens of patients with migraine and those of healthy persons to identify any possible dysregulation in their expression and to propose mechanisms for this disorder. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;INF-γ&lt;/em&gt; was suggestively higher in migraine cases than in healthy individuals (posterior beta = 0.35, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.017). In addition, expression of this cytokine was lower in female subjects than in male subjects (posterior beta = −0.712, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.012). Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TGF-β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNF-α&lt;/em&gt; was also higher in cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 1.34, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.04; posterior beta = 0.849, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.036; posterior beta = 0.451, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.042, respectively). On the other hand, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL8&lt;/em&gt; expression was lower in migraine cases than in controls (posterior beta = −0.78, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.039). Expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-1B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-17&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-2&lt;/em&gt; were not meaningfully different between cases and controls. The current study highlights the dysregulation of cytokine-coding genes in the blood of patients with migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Women with epilepsy are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effect of antiepileptic drugs on sexual function and satisfaction in women with epilepsy. In this cross-sectional study, 80 married women with epilepsy who were under treatment with antiepileptic drugs for at least 1 year were evaluated. Sexual function in patients was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of women was 28.8 (± 5.9) years. The mean (± SD) duration of epilepsy was 8.6 (± 4.1) years. Thirteen women (16.2%) had focal epilepsy and 67 (83.7%) had generalized epilepsy. The mean (± SD) overall sexual performance of patients was 20.5 (± 4.7). Fifteen patients (21.3%) had decreased sexual function and 78.2% had unfavorable sexual performance. Generalized epilepsy, multi-drug regimen, disease duration of more than 10 years, and age &amp;gt; 30 years were associated with sexual dysfunction. Due to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women with epilepsy, special attention should be given to appropriate management of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study presented two Chinese adult female patients who were diagnosed with adult-onset Krabbe disease (KD) and reviewed this disease in Chinese patients. Two young female adults in their 20s were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, including symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and laboratory studies were collected. Sequence alignment and structural modeling were carried out to analyze the pathogenesis of the disease. Both patients were adult-onset and both had a mild clinical course, presented with spastic weakness. The MRI study showed demyelination confined to the corticospinal tracts and parieto-occipital white matter. The β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity was obviously decreased in both patients. Gene test of GALC showed that both patients were compound heterozygotes; proband I was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and p.I250T (c.749 T &amp;gt; C), while proband II was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &amp;gt; C) and a new variant of c.283_284del. Molecular analysis revealed the variants may influence the function of GALC. We provided two Chinese adult-onset KD, and the clinical and genetic characteristics of proband II was especially rare due to asymmetric symptoms, spinal cord involvement, and the identification of a new point mutation c.283_284del in the GALC gene. Variant c.749 T &amp;gt; C can present mild syndromes except for severe cases. c.283_284del is a new variant that may occur in adult-onset type.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies have shown that lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-29b are closely associated with repair of the injured spinal cord. However, the mechanism by which lncRNA NEAT1 promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury by regulating miR-29b has not been reported. To explore this mechanism, we established a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). The experimental rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: the sham, model, si-NEAT1, miR-29b, si-NEAT1 + negative control and si-NEAT1 + si-miR-29b groups. The hind limb motor function of the rats was evaluated on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after modelling using the BBB rating scale. Seven days after the operation, attenuation of pathological changes in injured spinal cord tissues was evaluated by HE staining. Anterior horn neurons and cavities in the injured area were counted by Nissl staining. In addition, the TUNEL assay was employed to study neuronal apoptosis in the anterior horn, and the expression of the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was analysed by western blotting. Finally, the protein expression of GFAP, NCAM, GAP43, and SCG10 was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. BBB scores revealed that decreasing the level of NEAT1 improved the hind limb motor function of the rats by increasing miR-29b expression. H&amp;amp;E and Nissl staining showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated lesions in the spinal cord and decreased the number of cavities in the injured spinal cord by upregulating miR-29b. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting suggested that silencing NEAT1 significantly downregulated GFAP expression and upregulated GAP43, SCG10 and NCAM expression by inducing overexpression of miR-29b. The TUNEL assay and western blotting also showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated neuronal apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It has been suggested that dysregulation of hormones is associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). This study aimed to measure the serum levels of progesterone and testosterone in 125 SCZ patients at different stages of treatment and 96 healthy control (HC) subjects. Our results showed that first-episode drug-free SCZ patients had significantly increased testosterone levels when compared with HC subjects, and chronic medication, but not short-term medication, further increased the serum testosterone levels in the patients. Further analysis suggested that the sex of the patients did not affect testosterone levels. In contrast, serum progesterone levels did not show significant differences between first-episode, drug-free SCZ patients and controls, and the antipsychotics increased progesterone levels in the male SCZ patients, but not female patients. Interestingly, our analyses demonstrated that the serum progesterone levels were negatively correlated with PANSS total score and PNASS positive score, suggesting a correlation between blood hormone levels and disease severity in SCZ patients. Taken together, our data showed differential changes in serum testosterone and progesterone levels in SCZ patients with or without antipsychotics, and our results suggest that increased sex hormone levels may be a defensive response to protect the human body under stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most lethal malignancies of the central nervous system characterized by high mortality rate. The complexity of GBM pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis is not fully understood yet. GBM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry several oncogenic elements that facilitate GBM progression. The purpose of this study was to identify systems level molecular signatures from GBM-derived EVs using integrative analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data generated from plasma and serum samples. The dataset contained 19 samples in total, of which 15 samples were from plasma (11 GBM patients and 4 healthy samples) and 4 samples were from serum (2 GBM and 2 healthy samples). We carried out statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs, protein–protein interaction networks, module analysis, transcription factors and target gene regulatory networks analysis, and identification of hub genes. The differential expression of the identified hub genes were validated with the independent TCGA-GBM dataset. We have identified a few crucial genes and pathways associated with GBM prognosis and therapy resistance. The DEGs identified from plasma were associated with inflammatory processes and viral infection. On the other hand, the hub genes identified from the serum samples were significantly associated with protein ubiquitinylation processes and cytokine signaling regulation. The findings indicate that GBM-derived plasma and serum DEGs may be associated with distinct cellular processes and pathways which facilitate GBM progression. The findings will provide better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of GBM pathogenesis and progression. These results can further be utilized for developing and validating minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic molecular biomarkers for GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are commonly used to prevent weight gain and development of metabolic diseases associated with consumption of high-energy diets. Recent studies have demonstrated that these compounds may have unwanted detrimental effects under specific circumstances in vivo. In particular, an association between NNS consumption and changes in signaling pathways involved in the hunger-satiety system in the brain has been reported. Nonetheless, the extent of alterations in brain signaling pathways associated with consumption of these compounds has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of frequent consumption of NNSs on the expression of proteins involved in signaling pathways related to appetite control in the brain in vivo. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were supplemented with sucrose, sucralose, or steviol glycosides in their daily drinking water for 6 weeks. Subsequently, total brain protein extracts were used to analyze the expression of total and phosphorylated JAK2, STAT5, ERK 1/2, JNK, as well as SHP-2 and POMC, by western blot. Serum concentrations of leptin and α-MSH were quantified by ELISA. Results show that consumption of NNSs promotes significant changes in these signaling pathways, reducing the expression of pSTAT5/STAT5, pERK 1/2, SHP-2, and pJNK/JNK in male mice supplemented with steviol glycosides. Furthermore, consumption of steviol glycosides induced a decrease of α-MSH in male mice. In contrast, steviol glycosides induced overexpression of pSTAT5, pERK, and SHP-2 in females. These data suggest that chronic consumption of NNSs promotes sex-specific changes in signaling pathways related to the central hunger-satiety system in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As an important endogenous growth factor, PDGF-BB can effectively promote neurogenesis, thus is considered as a potential agent for Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapy. However, the protective function of PDGF-BB on neuronal cells, especially the molecular mechanism, remains less clear, which is needed to explore before its clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of PDGF-BB against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a widely used cellular tool for PD-related molecular study. Our results indicated that PDGF-BB exerts a prominent protective effect against neurotoxin MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered ROS generation and cellular loss. We further dissected the molecular mechanism involved in this process by using specific pharmacological inhibitors and validated that the distinct signaling pathways PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MEK/ERK are involved in the process against MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity upon PDGF-BB treatment. We also detected that activation of upstream PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MER/ERK signaling pathways contribute to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the downstream effector cyclic response element-binding protein (CREB), a known transcription factor to exhibit neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects. Using genetic approach, we further confirmed that the activation of CREB is involved in PDGF-BB-mediated protection in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these data demonstrated the protective effect of PDGF-BB in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and verified the involved molecular mechanism in PDGF-BB-mediated neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We contribute to the theoretical understanding of randomized search
heuristics for dynamic problems. We consider the classical vertex coloring
problem on graphs and investigate the dynamic setting where edges are added to
the current graph. We then analyze the expected time for randomized search
heuristics to recompute high quality solutions. The (1+1)~Evolutionary
Algorithm and RLS operate in a setting where the number of colors is bounded
and we are minimizing the number of conflicts. Iterated local search algorithms
use an unbounded color palette and aim to use the smallest colors and,
consequently, the smallest number of colors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identify classes of bipartite graphs where reoptimization is as hard as or
even harder than optimization from scratch, i.e., starting with a random
initialization. Even adding a single edge can lead to hard symmetry problems.
However, graph classes that are hard for one algorithm turn out to be easy for
others. In most cases our bounds show that reoptimization is faster than
optimizing from scratch. We further show that tailoring mutation operators to
parts of the graph where changes have occurred can significantly reduce the
expected reoptimization time. In most settings the expected reoptimization time
for such tailored algorithms is linear in the number of added edges. However,
tailored algorithms cannot prevent exponential times in settings where the
original algorithm is inefficient.

 &lt;p&gt;In this paper, we study the performance of variants of well-known
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures on different audio tasks. We
show that tuning the Receptive Field (RF) of CNNs is crucial to their
generalization. An insufficient RF limits the CNN's ability to fit the training
data. In contrast, CNNs with an excessive RF tend to over-fit the training data
and fail to generalize to unseen testing data. As state-of-the-art CNN
architectures-in computer vision and other domains-tend to go deeper in terms
of number of layers, their RF size increases and therefore they degrade in
performance in several audio classification and tagging tasks. We study
well-known CNN architectures and how their building blocks affect their
receptive field. We propose several systematic approaches to control the RF of
CNNs and systematically test the resulting architectures on different audio
classification and tagging tasks and datasets. The experiments show that
regularizing the RF of CNNs using our proposed approaches can drastically
improve the generalization of models, out-performing complex architectures and
pre-trained models on larger datasets. The proposed CNNs achieve
state-of-the-art results in multiple tasks, from acoustic scene classification
to emotion and theme detection in music to instrument recognition, as
demonstrated by top ranks in several pertinent challenges (DCASE, MediaEval).

 &lt;p&gt;Residual networks (ResNets) have displayed impressive results in pattern
recognition and, recently, have garnered considerable theoretical interest due
to a perceived link with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
This link relies on the convergence of network weights to a smooth function as
the number of layers increases. We investigate the properties of weights
trained by stochastic gradient descent and their scaling with network depth
through detailed numerical experiments. We observe the existence of scaling
regimes markedly different from those assumed in neural ODE literature.
Depending on certain features of the network architecture, such as the
smoothness of the activation function, one may obtain an alternative ODE limit,
a stochastic differential equation or neither of these. These findings cast
doubts on the validity of the neural ODE model as an adequate asymptotic
description of deep ResNets and point to an alternative class of differential
equations as a better description of the deep network limit.

		<title type="html" xml:lang="en-us">The Nonlinearity Coefficient -- A Practical Guide to Neural Architecture Design. (arXiv:2105.12210v1 [cs.LG])</title>
		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12210"/>

 &lt;p&gt;In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized
function. Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as
searching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural
architecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture
search' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded
significant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for
a local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around
architectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we present a different and complementary approach to
architecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We
develop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture
will achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training.
We then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition
itself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this
explanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep
learning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first
line of code is written, even for tasks for which no prior art exists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of
a neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a
primary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the
'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity.
Via extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the
architecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful
predictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is
essential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually
simple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute,
has extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows
instructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled
via our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the
most powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural
network analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which
we use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out a range of metrics and properties
that have a significant explanatory influence on test and training error. We go
on to explain the majority of the error variation across a wide range of
randomly generated architectures with these metrics and properties. We compile
our insights into a practical guide for architecture designers, which we argue
can significantly shorten the trial-and-error phase of deep learning
deployment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are grounded in an experimental protocol that exceeds that of the
vast majority of other deep learning studies in terms of carefulness and rigor.
We study the impact of e.g. dataset, learning rate, floating-point precision,
loss function, statistical estimation error and batch inter-dependency on
performance and other key properties. We promote research practices that we
believe can significantly accelerate progress in architecture design research.

 &lt;p&gt;Intelligent behaviour in the physical world exhibits structure at multiple
spatial and temporal scales. Although movements are ultimately executed at the
level of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected
to serve goals defined on much longer timescales, and in terms of relations
that extend far beyond the body itself, ultimately involving coordination with
other agents. Recent research in artificial intelligence has shown the promise
of learning-based approaches to the respective problems of complex movement,
longer-term planning and multi-agent coordination. However, there is limited
research aimed at their integration. We study this problem by training teams of
physically simulated humanoid avatars to play football in a realistic virtual
environment. We develop a method that combines imitation learning, single- and
multi-agent reinforcement learning and population-based training, and makes use
of transferable representations of behaviour for decision making at different
levels of abstraction. In a sequence of stages, players first learn to control
a fully articulated body to perform realistic, human-like movements such as
running and turning; they then acquire mid-level football skills such as
dribbling and shooting; finally, they develop awareness of others and play as a
team, bridging the gap between low-level motor control at a timescale of
milliseconds, and coordinated goal-directed behaviour as a team at the
timescale of tens of seconds. We investigate the emergence of behaviours at
different levels of abstraction, as well as the representations that underlie
these behaviours using several analysis techniques, including statistics from
real-world sports analytics. Our work constitutes a complete demonstration of
integrated decision-making at multiple scales in a physically embodied
multi-agent setting. See project video at https://youtu.be/KHMwq9pv7mg.

Changes in protein and gene expression levels are often used as features in predictive modeling such as survival prediction. A common strategy to aggregate information contained in individual proteins is to integrate the expression levels with the biological networks. In this work, we propose a novel patient representation where we integrate proteins’ expression levels with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks: Patient representation with PRER (Pairwise Relative Expressions with Random walks) (PRER). PRER captures the dysregulation patterns of proteins based on the neighborhood of a protein in the PPI network. Specifically, PRER computes a feature vector for a patient by comparing the source protein’s expression level with other proteins’ levels that are within its neighborhood. The neighborhood of the source protein is derived by biased random-walk strategy on the network. We test PRER’s performance in survival prediction task in 10 different cancers using random forest survival models. PRER yields a statistically significant predictive performance in 9 out of 10 cancers when compared to the same model trained with features based on individual protein expressions. Furthermore, we identified the pairs of proteins that their interactions are predictive of patient survival but their individual expression levels are not. The set of identified relations provides a valuable collection of protein biomarkers with high prognostic value. PRER can be used for other complex diseases and prediction tasks that use molecular expression profiles as input. PRER is freely available at: https://github.com/hikuru/PRER.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gU2ANEpjrG0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway can cause malformation of cortical development (MCD) with associated epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID) through a yet unknown mechanism. Here, we made use of the recently identified dominant-active mutation in &lt;i&gt;Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RHEB&lt;/i&gt;), RHEBp.P37L, to gain insight in the mechanism underlying the epilepsy caused by hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway. Focal expression of RHEBp.P37L in mouse somatosensory cortex (SScx) results in an MCD-like phenotype, with increased mTOR signaling, ectopic localization of neurons, and reliable generalized seizures. We show that in this model, the mTOR-dependent seizures are caused by enhanced axonal connectivity, causing hyperexcitability of distally connected neurons. Indeed, blocking axonal vesicle release from the RHEBp.P37L neurons alone completely stopped the seizures and normalized the hyperexcitability of the distally connected neurons. These results provide new evidence of the extent of anatomical and physiological abnormalities caused by mTOR hyperactivity, beyond local malformations, which can lead to generalized epilepsy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/V9fN7mJ3TKQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Sergio M. Pontejo, Philip M. Murphy&lt;/p&gt;

Removal of apoptotic cells is essential for maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Chemotactic cues termed “find-me” signals attract phagocytes toward apoptotic cells, which selectively expose the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and other “eat-me” signals to distinguish healthy from apoptotic cells for phagocytosis. Blebs released by apoptotic cells can deliver find-me signals; however, the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that apoptotic blebs generated in vivo from mouse thymus attract phagocytes using endogenous chemokines bound to the bleb surface. We show that chemokine binding to apoptotic cells is mediated by PS and that high affinity binding of PS and other anionic phospholipids is a general property of many but not all chemokines. Chemokines are positively charged proteins that also bind to anionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on cell surfaces for presentation to leukocyte G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). We found that apoptotic cells down-regulate GAGs as they up-regulate PS on the cell surface and that PS-bound chemokines, unlike GAG-bound chemokines, are able to directly activate chemokine receptors. Thus, we conclude that PS-bound chemokines may serve as find-me signals on apoptotic vesicles acting at cognate chemokine receptors on leukocytes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YjUGdCwxqGM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Normal cellular processes give rise to toxic metabolites that cells must mitigate. Formaldehyde is a universal stressor and potent metabolic toxin that is generated in organisms from bacteria to humans. Methylotrophic bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Methylorubrum extorquens&lt;/i&gt; face an acute challenge due to their production of formaldehyde as an obligate central intermediate of single-carbon metabolism. Mechanisms to sense and respond to formaldehyde were speculated to exist in methylotrophs for decades but had never been discovered. Here, we identify a member of the DUF336 domain family, named &lt;i&gt;efgA&lt;/i&gt; for enhanced formaldehyde growth, that plays an important role in endogenous formaldehyde stress response in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;extorquens&lt;/i&gt; PA1 and is found almost exclusively in methylotrophic taxa. Our experimental analyses reveal that EfgA is a formaldehyde sensor that rapidly arrests growth in response to elevated levels of formaldehyde. Heterologous expression of EfgA in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increases formaldehyde resistance, indicating that its interaction partners are widespread and conserved. EfgA represents the first example of a formaldehyde stress response system that does not involve enzymatic detoxification. Thus, EfgA comprises a unique stress response mechanism in bacteria, whereby a single protein directly senses elevated levels of a toxic intracellular metabolite and safeguards cells from potential damage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RiUQLYU__lI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reversible Cellular Automata (RCA) are a particular kind of shift-invariant
transformations characterized by a dynamics composed only of disjoint cycles.
They have many applications in the simulation of physical systems, cryptography
and reversible computing. In this work, we formulate the search of a specific
class of RCA -- namely, those whose local update rules are defined by conserved
landscapes -- as an optimization problem to be tackled with Genetic Algorithms
(GA) and Genetic Programming (GP). In particular, our experimental
investigation revolves around three different research questions, which we
address through a single-objective, a multi-objective, and a lexicographic
approach. The results obtained from our experiments corroborate the previous
findings and shed new light on 1) the difficulty of the associated optimization
problem for GA and GP, 2) the relevance of conserved landscape CA in the domain
of cryptography and reversible computing, and 3) the relationship between the
reversibility property and the Hamming weight.

 &lt;p&gt;When we look at the world around us, we see complex physical systems and
emergent phenomena. Emergence occurs when a system is observed to have
properties that its parts do not have on their own. These properties or
behaviors emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole. Examples of
emergence can vary from the synchronization of pendulum clocks hanging on the
same wall to the phenomenon of life as an emergent property of chemistry. One
of the most complex systems that exist in nature is the human brain. It
contains on average 100 to 200 billion neurons and about 100 trillion synapses
connecting them. From this vast neuronal dynamics, the ability to learn and
store memory emerges as well as the ability to have complex cognitive skills,
conscious experience and a sense of self. In this work, we investigated how
complex systems like the human brain and chaotic systems create emergent
properties. In order to do so, we used network theory (paper 1), chaos and
synchronization theory (paper 2 and 3).

 &lt;p&gt;Background The learning of genotype-phenotype associations and history of
human disease by doing detailed and precise analysis of phenotypic
abnormalities can be defined as deep phenotyping. To understand and detect this
interaction between phenotype and genotype is a fundamental step when
translating precision medicine to clinical practice. The recent advances in the
field of machine learning is efficient to predict these interactions between
abnormal human phenotypes and genes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods In this study, we developed a framework to predict links between
human phenotype ontology (HPO) and genes. The annotation data from the
heterogeneous knowledge resources i.e., orphanet, is used to parse human
phenotype-gene associations. To generate the embeddings for the nodes (HPO &amp;amp;
genes), an algorithm called node2vec was used. It performs node sampling on
this graph based on random walks, then learns features over these sampled nodes
to generate embeddings. These embeddings were used to perform the downstream
task to predict the presence of the link between these nodes using 5 different
supervised machine learning algorithms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The downstream link prediction task shows that the Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree based model (LightGBM) achieved an optimal AUROC 0.904 and AUCPR
0.784. In addition, LightGBM achieved an optimal weighted F1 score of 0.87.
Compared to the other 4 methods LightGBM is able to find more accurate
interaction/link between human phenotype &amp;amp; gene pairs.

 &lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision (CV). However, training and inference of DNN models are both memory and
computation intensive, incurring significant overhead in terms of energy
consumption and silicon area. In particular, inference is much more
cost-sensitive than training because training can be done offline with powerful
platforms, while inference may have to be done on battery powered devices with
constrained form factors, especially for mobile or edge vision applications. In
order to accelerate DNN inference, model quantization was proposed. However
previous works only focus on the quantization rate without considering the
efficiency of operations. In this paper, we propose Dendrite-Tree based Neural
Network (DTNN) for energy-efficient inference with table lookup operations
enabled by activation quantization. In DTNN both costly weight access and
arithmetic computations are eliminated for inference. We conducted experiments
on various kinds of DNN models such as LeNet-5, MobileNet, VGG, and ResNet with
different datasets, including MNIST, Cifar10/Cifar100, SVHN, and ImageNet. DTNN
achieved significant energy saving (19.4X and 64.9X improvement on ResNet-18
and VGG-11 with ImageNet, respectively) with negligible loss of accuracy. To
further validate the effectiveness of DTNN and compare with state-of-the-art
low energy implementation for edge vision, we design and implement DTNN based
MLP image classifiers using off-the-shelf FPGAs. The results show that DTNN on
the FPGA, with higher accuracy, could achieve orders of magnitude better energy
consumption and latency compared with the state-of-the-art low energy
approaches reported that use ASIC chips.

 &lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as bio-inspired energy-efficient neural
networks, have attracted great attentions from researchers and industry. The
most efficient way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-SNN conversion. However,
the conversion usually suffers from accuracy loss and long inference time,
which impede the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal
conversion. To better correlate ANN-SNN and get greater accuracy, we propose
Rate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training,
enabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN. Moreover, we propose
an optimal fit curve to quantify the fit between the activation value of source
ANN and the actual firing rate of target SNN. We show that the inference time
can be reduced by optimizing the upper bound of the fit curve in the revised
ANN to achieve fast inference. Our theory can explain the existing work on fast
reasoning and get better results. The experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves near loss less conversion with VGG-16,
PreActResNet-18, and deeper structures. Moreover, it can reach 8.6x faster
reasoning performance under 0.265x energy consumption of the typical method.

 &lt;p&gt;Social reviews are indispensable resources for modern consumers' decision
making. For financial gain, companies pay fraudsters preferably in groups to
demote or promote products and services since consumers are more likely to be
misled by a large number of similar reviews from groups. Recent approaches on
fraudster group detection employed handcrafted features of group behaviors
without considering the semantic relation between reviews from the reviewers in
a group. In this paper, we propose the first neural approach, HIN-RNN, a
Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) Compatible RNN for fraudster group
detection that requires no handcrafted features. HIN-RNN provides a unifying
architecture for representation learning of each reviewer, with the initial
vector as the sum of word embeddings of all review text written by the same
reviewer, concatenated by the ratio of negative reviews. Given a co-review
network representing reviewers who have reviewed the same items with the same
ratings and the reviewers' vector representation, a collaboration matrix is
acquired through HIN-RNN training. The proposed approach is confirmed to be
effective with marked improvement over state-of-the-art approaches on both the
Yelp (22% and 12% in terms of recall and F1-value, respectively) and Amazon (4%
and 2% in terms of recall and F1-value, respectively) datasets.

 &lt;p&gt;We propose an approach to saddle point optimization relying only on an oracle
that solves a minimization problem approximately. We analyze its convergence
property on a strongly convex--concave problem and show its linear convergence
toward the global min--max saddle point. Based on the convergence analysis, we
propose a heuristic approach to adapt the learning rate for the proposed saddle
point optimization approach. The implementation of the proposed approach using
the (1+1)-CMA-ES as the minimization oracle, namely Adversarial-CMA-ES, is
evaluated on test problems. Numerical evaluation reveals the tightness of the
theoretical convergence rate bound as well as the efficiency of the learning
rate adaptation mechanism. As an example of real-world applications, it is
applied to automatic berthing control problems under model uncertainties,
showing its usefulness in obtaining solutions robust under model uncertainties.

 &lt;p&gt;Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) is an emerging modeling paradigm which
aims to combine physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) to
create generalizable, trustworthy, accurate, computationally efficient and
self-evolving models. Here, we introduce, justify and demonstrate a novel
approach to HAM -- the Corrective Source Term Approach (CoSTA) -- which
augments the governing equation of a PBM model with a corrective source term
generated by a deep neural network (DNN). In a series of numerical experiments
on one-dimensional heat diffusion, CoSTA is generally found to outperform
comparable DDM and PBM models in terms of accuracy -- often reducing predictive
errors by several orders of magnitude -- while also generalizing better than
pure DDM. Due to its flexible but solid theoretical foundation, CoSTA provides
a modular framework for leveraging novel developments within both PBM and DDM,
and due to the interpretability of the DNN-generated source term within the PBM
paradigm, CoSTA can be a potential door-opener for data-driven techniques to
enter high-stakes applications previously reserved for pure PBM.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This paper investigates the influence of genotype size on evolutionary
algorithms' performance. We consider genotype compression (where genotype is
smaller than phenotype) and expansion (genotype is larger than phenotype) and
define different strategies to reconstruct the original variables of the
phenotype from both the compressed and expanded genotypes. We test our approach
with several evolutionary algorithms over three sets of optimization problems:
COCO benchmark functions, modeling of Physical Unclonable Functions, and neural
network weight optimization. Our results show that genotype expansion works
significantly better than compression, and in many scenarios, outperforms the
original genotype encoding. This could be attributed to the change in the
genotype-phenotype mapping introduced with the expansion methods: this
modification beneficially transforms the domain landscape and alleviates the
search space traversal.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adult-onset ataxias are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of movement disorders. In addition to nuclear gene mutations, sequence changes have also been described in the mitochondrial genome. Here, we present findings of mutation analysis of the mitochondrial gene &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MT-ATP6&lt;/em&gt;. We analyzed 94 patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), including 34 sporadic cases. In all patients, common sequence changes found in SCAs such as repeat expansions and point mutations had been excluded previously. We found pathogenic &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MT-ATP&lt;/em&gt; variants in five of these patients (5.32%), two of whom were sporadic. Four of the five mutations have not previously been described in ataxias. All but one of these mutations affect transmembrane helices of subunit-α of ATP synthase. Two mutations (p.G16S, and p.P18S) disrupt transmembrane helix 1 (TMH1), one mutation (p.G167D) affects TMH5, and another one (p.L217P) TMH6. The fifth mutation (p.T96A) describes an amino acid change in close proximity to transmembrane helix 3 (TMH3). The level of heteroplasmy was either complete or very high ranging from 87 to 99%. The high prevalence of pathogenic &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MT-ATP6&lt;/em&gt; variants suggests that analysis of this gene should be included in the routine workup of both hereditary and sporadic ataxias.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Disproportionate, maladapted, and generalized fear are essential hallmarks of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which develops upon severe trauma in a subset of exposed individuals. Among the brain areas that are processing fear memories, the hippocampal formation exerts a central role linking emotional-affective with cognitive aspects. In the hippocampus, neuronal excitability is constrained by multiple GABAergic interneurons with highly specialized functions and an extensive repertoire of co-released neuromodulators. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of these co-transmitters that significantly affects hippocampal signaling, with ample evidence supporting its fundamental role in emotional, cognitive, and metabolic circuitries. Here we investigated the role of NPY in relation to GABA, both released from the same interneurons of the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG), in different aspects of fear conditioning. We demonstrated that activation of dentate GABA neurons specifically during fear recall reduced cue-related as well as trace-related freezing behavior, whereas inhibition of the same neurons had no significant effects. Interestingly, concomitant overexpression of NPY in these neurons did not further modify fear recall, neither under baseline conditions nor upon chemogenetic stimulation. However, potentially increased co-release of NPY substantially reduced contextual fear, promoted extinction learning, and long-term suppression of fear in a foreground context–conditioning paradigm. Importantly, NPY in the dorsal DG was not only expressed in somatostatin neurons, but also in parvalbumin-positive basket cells and axoaxonic cells, indicating intense feedback and feedforward modulation of hippocampal signaling and precise curtailing of neuronal engrams. Thus, these findings suggest that co-release of NPY from specific interneuron populations of the dorsal DG modifies dedicated aspects of hippocampal processing by sharpening the activation of neural engrams and the consecutive fear response. Since inappropriate and generalized fear is the major impediment in the treatment of PTSD patients, the dentate NPY system may be a suitable access point to ameliorate PTSD symptoms and improve the inherent disease course.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience cognitive impairment and physical disabilities in daily life. Currently, there are no treatments available to slow down the course of the disease, and limited treatments exist only to treat symptoms. However, deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM-DBS) has been reported to improve cognitive function in individuals with AD. Here, we report the effects of NBM-DBS on cognitive function in a subject with severe AD. An 80-year-old male with severe AD (Clinical Dementia Rating scale: 3.0 points) underwent surgery for bilateral NBM-DBS electrode placement. After 10 weeks of stimulation, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) assessment improved from a score of 5 to 9 points, and assessment using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) showed a marked reduction in total score from 43 to 33 points, suggesting cognitive benefits from NBM-DBS. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by a subdural effusion that occurred several days after surgery, with complete recovery. Interestingly, the subject also displayed abnormal thermoregulation with stimulation initiation and stimulation parameter modifications. NBM-DBS may serve as a potential therapy for severe AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: ChiCTR1900022324.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;P2X7 receptors are ion-gated channels activated by ATP. Under pathological conditions, the extensive release of ATP induces sustained P2X7 receptor activation, culminating in induction of proinflammatory pathways with inflammasome assembly and cytokine release. These inflammatory conditions, whether occurring peripherally or in the central nervous system (CNS), increase blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability. Besides its well-known involvement in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, the P2X7 receptor may induce BBB disruption and chemotaxis of peripheral immune cells to the CNS, resulting in brain parenchyma infiltration. For instance, despite common effects on cytokine release, P2X7 receptor signaling is also associated with metalloproteinase secretion and activation, as well as migration and differentiation of T lymphocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells. Here we highlight that peripheral immune cells mediate the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, mainly through T lymphocyte, neutrophil and monocyte infiltration. We propose that P2X7 receptor activation contributes to neurodegenerative disease progression beyond its known effects on the CNS. This review discusses how P2X7 receptor activation mediates responses of peripheral immune cells within the inflamed CNS, as occurring in the aforementioned diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.657594"/>

 &lt;p&gt;The first synapse of the visual pathway is formed by photoreceptors, horizontal cells and bipolar cells. While ON bipolar cells invaginate into the photoreceptor terminal and form synaptic triads together with invaginating horizontal cell processes, OFF bipolar cells make flat contacts at the base of the terminal. When horizontal cells are ablated during retina development, no invaginating synapses are formed in rod photoreceptors. However, how cone photoreceptors and their synaptic connections with bipolar cells react to this insult, is unclear so far. To answer this question, we specifically ablated horizontal cells from the developing mouse retina. Following ablation around postnatal day 4 (P4)/P5, cones initially exhibited a normal morphology and formed flat contacts with OFF bipolar cells, but only few invaginating contacts with ON bipolar cells. From P15 on, synaptic remodeling became obvious with clustering of cone terminals and mislocalized cone somata in the OPL. Adult cones (P56) finally displayed highly branched axons with numerous terminals which contained ribbons and vesicular glutamate transporters. Furthermore, type 3a, 3b, and 4 OFF bipolar cell dendrites sprouted into the outer nuclear layer and even expressed glutamate receptors at the base of newly formed cone terminals. These results indicate that cones may be able to form new synapses with OFF bipolar cells in adult mice. In contrast, cone terminals lost their invaginating contacts with ON bipolar cells, highlighting the importance of horizontal cells for synapse maintenance. Taken together, our data demonstrate that early postnatal horizontal cell ablation leads to differential remodeling in the cone pathway: whereas synapses between cones and ON bipolar cells were lost, new putative synapses were established between cones and OFF bipolar cells. These results suggest that synapse formation and maintenance are regulated very differently between flat and invaginating contacts at cone terminals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Recent studies have reported that homocysteine (Hcy) may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study explored the relationship between the plasma Hcy and folate levels and the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science for published literature, including case-control studies and prospective cohort studies, and performed a systematic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The results of our meta-analysis, consisting of case-control studies, showed higher levels of Hcy and lower levels of folate in dementia, AD, and VaD patients than those in non-demented controls (for dementia: SMD = 0.812, 95% CI [0.689, 0.936], p = 0.000 for Hcy; SMD = −0.677, 95% CI [−0.828, −0.525], p = 0.000 for folate). AD patients showed significantly lower plasma Hcy levels compared to VaD patients (SMD = −0.278, 95% CI [−0.466, −0.09], p = 0.000). Subgroup analysis revealed that ethnicity, average age, and dementia type had no significant effect on this association. Furthermore, from the analysis of prospective cohort studies, we identified that elevated plasma Hcy levels were associated with an increased risk of dementia, AD, and VaD (RR&lt;sub&gt;dementia&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.22, 95% CI [1.08, 1.36]; RR&lt;sub&gt;AD&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.07, 95% CI [1.04, 1.11]; RR&lt;sub&gt;VaD&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.13, 95% CI [1.04, 1.23]). In addition, every 5 μmol/L increase in the plasma Hcy level was associated with a 9% increased risk of dementia and a 12% increased risk of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Hcy and folic acid are potential predictors of the occurrence and development of AD. A better understanding of their function in dementia could provide evidence for clinicians to rationalize clinical intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study aims to develop and validate an artificial intelligence model based on deep learning to predict early hematoma enlargement (HE) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. A total of 1,899 noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) images of cerebral hemorrhage patients were retrospectively analyzed to establish a predicting model and 1,117 to validate the model. And a total of 118 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria so as to validate the value of the model for clinical prediction. The baseline noncontrast computed tomography images within 6 h of intracerebral hemorrhage onset and the second noncontrast computed tomography performed at 24 ± 3 h from the onset were used to evaluate the prediction of intracerebral hemorrhage growth. In validation dataset 1, the AUC was 0.778 (95% CI, 0.768–0.786), the sensitivity was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.790–0.843), and the specificity was 0.601 (95% CI, 0.565–0.632). In validation dataset 2, the AUC was 0.780 (95% CI, 0.761–0.798), the sensitivity was 0.732 (95% CI, 0.682–0.788), and the specificity was 0.709 (95% CI, 0.658–0.759). The sensitivity of intracerebral hemorrhage hematoma expansion as predicted by an artificial intelligence imaging system was 89.3%, with a specificity of 77.8%, a positive predictive value of 55.6%, a negative predictive value of 95.9%, and a Yoden index of 0.671, which were much higher than those based on the manually labeled noncontrast computed tomography signs. Compared with the existing prediction methods through computed tomographic angiography (CTA) image features and noncontrast computed tomography image features analysis, the artificial intelligence model has higher specificity and sensitivity in the prediction of early hematoma enlargement in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Dysfunction of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) is a major cause of human mitochondrial diseases. To identify determinants of mETC function, we screened a genome-wide human CRISPRi library under oxidative metabolic conditions with selective inhibition of mitochondrial Complex III and identified ovarian carcinoma immunoreactive antigen (OCIA) domain-containing protein 1 (OCIAD1) as a Complex III assembly factor. We find that OCIAD1 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that forms a complex with supramolecular prohibitin assemblies. Our data indicate that OCIAD1 is required for maintenance of normal steady-state levels of Complex III and the proteolytic processing of the catalytic subunit cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (CYC1). In OCIAD1 depleted mitochondria, unprocessed CYC1 is hemylated and incorporated into Complex III. We propose that OCIAD1 acts as an adaptor within prohibitin assemblies to stabilize and/or chaperone CYC1 and to facilitate its proteolytic processing by the IMMP2L protease.</content>

 Use of adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) has become widespread, providing new insights into the immune system with potential broad clinical and diagnostic applications. However, like many high-throughput technologies, it comes with several problems, and the AIRR Community was established to understand and help solve them. We, the AIRR Community’s Biological Resources Working Group, have surveyed scientists about the need for standards and controls in generating and annotating AIRR-seq data. Here, we review the current status of AIRR-seq, provide the results of our survey, and based on them, offer recommendations for developing AIRR-seq standards and controls, including future work.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In many bacteria and in eukaryotes, replication fork establishment requires the controlled loading of hexameric, ring-shaped helicases around DNA by AAA+ ATPases. How loading factors use ATP to control helicase deposition is poorly understood. Here, we dissect how specific ATPase elements of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; DnaC, an archetypal loader for the bacterial DnaB helicase, play distinct roles in helicase loading and the activation of DNA unwinding. We identify a new element, the arginine-coupler, which regulates the switch-like behavior of DnaC to prevent futile ATPase cycling and maintains loader responsiveness to replication restart systems. Our data help explain how the ATPase cycle of a AAA+-family helicase loader is channeled into productive action on its target; comparative studies indicate elements analogous to the Arg-coupler are present in related, switch-like AAA+ proteins that control replicative helicase loading in eukaryotes, as well as polymerase clamp loading and certain classes of DNA transposases.</content>

 Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is characterized by short stature, skeletal deformities, low bone mass, and motor deficits. A subset of OI patients also present with joint hypermobility; however, the role of tendon dysfunction in OI pathogenesis is largely unknown. Using the&lt;i&gt; Crtap&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model of severe, recessive OI, we found that mutant Achilles and patellar tendons were thinner and weaker with increased collagen cross-links and reduced collagen fibril size at 1- and 4-months compared to wildtype. Patellar tendons from &lt;i&gt;Crtap&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice also had altered numbers of CD146&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD200&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD146&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;CD200&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; progenitor-like cells at skeletal maturity. RNA-seq analysis of Achilles and patellar tendons from 1-month &lt;i&gt;Crtap&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice revealed dysregulation in matrix and tendon marker gene expression concomitant with predicted alterations in TGF-b, inflammatory, and metabolic signaling. At 4-months, &lt;i&gt;Crtap&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice showed increased aSMA, MMP2, and phospho-NFkB in the patellar tendon consistent with excess matrix remodeling and tissue inflammation. Finally, a series of behavioral tests showed severe motor impairments and reduced grip strength in 4-month &lt;i&gt;Crtap&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice – a phenotype that correlates with the tendon pathology.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Phenotypic plasticity represents the most relevant hallmark of the carcinoma cell as it bestows it with the capacity of transiently altering its morphologic and functional features while &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; to the metastatic site. However, the study of phenotypic plasticity is hindered by the rarity of these events within primary lesions and by the lack of experimental models. Here, we identified a subpopulation of phenotypic plastic colon cancer cells: EpCAM&lt;sup&gt;lo&lt;/sup&gt; cells are motile, invasive, chemo-resistant, and highly metastatic. EpCAM&lt;sup&gt;lo&lt;/sup&gt; bulk and single-cell RNAseq analysis indicated 1. enhanced Wnt/b-catenin signaling, 2. a broad spectrum of degrees of EMT activation including hybrid E/M states (partial EMT) with highly plastic features, and 3. high correlation with the CMS4 subtype, accounting for colon cancer cases with poor prognosis and a pronounced stromal component. Of note, a signature of genes specifically expressed in EpCAM&lt;sup&gt;lo&lt;/sup&gt; cancer cells is highly predictive of overall survival in tumors other than CMS4, thus highlighting the relevance of quasi-mesenchymal tumor cells across the spectrum of colon cancers. Enhanced Wnt and the downstream EMT activation represent key events in eliciting phenotypic plasticity along the invasive front of primary colon carcinomas. Distinct sets of epithelial and mesenchymal genes define transcriptional trajectories through which state transitions arise. pEMT cells, often earmarked by the extracellular matrix glycoprotein SPARC together with nuclear ZEB1 and b-catenin along the invasive front of primary colon carcinomas, are predicted to represent the origin of these (de)differentiation routes through biologically-distinct cellular states, and to underlie the phenotypic plasticity of colon cancer cells.</content>

 For decades, the frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) – a disproportion in EEG alpha oscillations power between right and left frontal channels – has been one of the most popular measures of depressive disorders (DD) in electrophysiology studies. Patients with DD often manifest a left-sided FAA: relatively higher alpha power in the left versus right frontal lobe. Recently, however, multiple studies failed to confirm this effect, questioning its reproducibility. Our purpose is to thoroughly test the validity of FAA in depression by conducting a multiverse analysis – running many related analyses and testing the sensitivity of the effect to changes in the analytical approach – on data from five independent studies. Only 13 of the 270 analyses revealed significant results. We conclude the paper by discussing theoretical assumptions underlying the FAA and suggest a list of guidelines for improving and expanding the EEG data analysis in future FAA studies.</content>

 Embryos must communicate instructions to their constituent cells over long distances. These instructions are often encoded in the concentration of signals called morphogens. In the textbook view, morphogen molecules diffuse from a localized source to form a concentration gradient, and target cells adopt fates by measuring the local morphogen concentration. However, natural patterning systems often incorporate numerous co-factors and extensive signaling feedback, suggesting that embryos require additional mechanisms to generate signaling patterns. Here, we examine the mechanisms of signaling pattern formation for the mesendoderm inducer Nodal during zebrafish embryogenesis. We find that Nodal signaling activity spans a normal range in the absence of signaling feedback and relay, suggesting that diffusion is sufficient for Nodal gradient formation. We further show that the range of endogenous Nodal ligands is set by the EGF-CFC co-receptor Oep: in the absence of Oep, Nodal activity spreads to form a nearly uniform distribution throughout the embryo. In turn, increasing Oep levels sensitizes cells to Nodal ligands. We recapitulate these experimental results with a computational model in which Oep regulates the diffusive spread of Nodal ligands by setting the rate of capture by target cells. This model predicts, and we confirm &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, the surprising observation that a failure to replenish Oep transforms the Nodal signaling gradient into a travelling wave. These results reveal that patterns of Nodal morphogen signaling are shaped by co-receptor-mediated restriction of ligand spread and sensitization of responding cells.</content>

 Increasing life expectancy is prompting the need to understand how the brain changes during healthy aging. Research utilizing Electroencephalography (EEG) has found that the power of alpha oscillations decrease from adulthood on. However, non-oscillatory (aperiodic) components in the data may confound results and thus require re-investigation of these findings. The present report aims at analyzing a pilot and two additional independent samples (total N = 533) of resting-state EEG from healthy young and elderly individuals. A newly developed algorithm will be utilized that allows the decomposition of the measured signal into aperiodic and aperiodic-adjusted signal components. By using multivariate sequential Bayesian updating of the age effect in each signal component, evidence across the datasets will be accumulated. It is hypothesized that previously reported age-related alpha power differences will disappear when absolute power is adjusted for the aperiodic signal component. Consequently, age-related differences in the intercept and slope of the aperiodic signal component are expected. Importantly, using a battery of neuropsychological tests, we will assess how the previously reported relationship between cognitive functions and alpha oscillations changes when taking the aperiodic signal into account; this will be done on data of the young and aged individuals separately. The aperiodic signal components and adjusted alpha parameters could potentially offer a promising biomarker for cognitive decline, thus finally the test-retest reliability of the aperiodic and aperiodic-adjusted signal components will be assessed.</content>

 Humans often act in the best interests of others. However, how we learn which actions result in good outcomes for other people and the neurochemical systems that support this &quot;prosocial learning&quot; remain poorly understood. Using computational models of reinforcement learning, functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modelling, we examined how different doses of intranasal oxytocin, a neuropeptide linked to social cognition, impact how people learn to benefit others (prosocial learning) and whether this influence could be dissociated from how we learn to benefit ourselves (self-oriented learning). We show that a low dose of oxytocin prevented decreases in prosocial performance over time, despite no impact on self-oriented learning. Critically, oxytocin produced dose-dependent changes in the encoding of prediction errors (PE) in the midbrain-subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) pathway specifically during prosocial learning. Our findings reveal a new role of oxytocin in prosocial learning by modulating computations of PEs in the midbrain-sgACC pathway.</content>

 Vascular dysfunction is an early feature of late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), preceding classic AD pathology such as beta amyloid accumulation and formation of hyperphosphorylated tau. Such vascular dysfunction may promote classic AD pathology by decreasing blood flow, impairing brain oxygenation and clearance of molecules such as beta amyloid. The main genetic risk factor for AD is the {epsilon}4 allele of APOE, which has been found to increase blood brain barrier permeability and decrease vascular density, as well as decrease blood flow and functional hyperaemia in anaesthetised mice undergoing acute surgery. These results suggest that APOE4 may confer AD risk via its effects on the vasculature. However, the responses of neurons and individual vessels have not been studied, so neurovascular relationships are unknown, and no previous studies have looked at awake mice. We therefore measured neurovascular responses at rest and in response to visual stimulation using 2 photon imaging of awake APOE3 and APOE4 targeted-replacement (APOE TR) mice that expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f in excitatory neurons, while labelling the vascular lumen with Texas Red dextran. In parallel, we measured cerebral blood flow, blood oxygenation and cerebral blood volume using combined laser Doppler flowmetry and haemoglobin spectrometry. Measurements were performed in mice aged between 3-4 months to 12-13 months. We found a milder vascular deficit in awake mice than previous studies that used an acute surgical preparation: capillary responses to visual stimulation were the same in APOE3 and APOE4 TR mice, leading to unimpaired functional hyperaemia. However, neuronal calcium signals during visual stimulation were significantly enhanced in APOE4 mice, while there was a marked decrease in pial arteriole responsiveness and vasomotion. This pattern of results was unaffected by age, suggesting that APOE4 expression creates a stable, but mildly altered neurovascular state that does not itself cause degeneration. However, these changes likely make the system more sensitive to subsequent insults; for example, weaker vasomotion could impair clearance of beta amyloid as it starts to accumulate, and therefore may help explain how APOE4 expression increases risk of developing AD.</content>

 As routine and lower demand cognitive tasks are taken over by automated assistive systems, human operators are increasingly required to sustain cognitive demand over long periods of time. This has been reported to have long term adverse effects on cardiovascular and mental health. However, it remains unclear whether prolonged cognitive activity results in a monotonic decrease in the efficiency of the recruited brain processes, or whether the brain is able to sustain functions over time spans of one hour and more. Here, we show that during working sessions of one hour or more, contrary to the prediction of a monotonic decline, behavioral performance in both humans and non-human primates consistently fluctuates between periods of optimal and suboptimal performance at a very slow rhythm of circa 5 cycles per hour. These fluctuations are observed in both high attentional (in non-human primates) and low attentional (in humans) demand conditions. They coincide with fluctuations in pupil diameter, indicating underlying changes in arousal and information-processing load. Accordingly, we show that these rhythmic behavioral fluctuations correlate, at the neurophysiological level, with fluctuations in the informational attention orientation and perception processing capacity of prefrontal neuronal populations. We further identify specific markers of these fluctuations in LFP power, LFP coherence and spike-field coherence, pointing towards long-range rhythmic modulatory inputs to the prefrontal cortex rather than a local prefrontal origin. These results shed light on the resilience of brain mechanisms to sustained effort and have direct implications on how to optimize high cognitive demand working and learning environments.</content>

 Sensory neurons encode information using multiple nonlinear and dynamical transformations. For instance, auditory receptor neurons in Drosophila adapt to the mean and the intensity of the stimulus, change their frequency tuning with sound intensity, and employ a quadratic nonlinearity. While these computations are considered advantageous in isolation, their combination can lead to a highly ambiguous and complex code that is hard to decode. Combining electrophysiological recordings and computational modelling, we investigate how the different computations found in auditory receptor neurons in Drosophila combine to encode behaviorally-relevant acoustic signals like the courtship song. The computational model consists of a quadratic filter followed by a divisive normalization stage and reproduces population neural responses to artificial and natural sounds. For general classes of sounds, like band-limited noise, the representation resulting from these highly nonlinear computations is highly ambiguous and does not allow for a recovery of information about the frequency content and amplitude pattern. However, for courtship song, the code is simple and efficient: The quadratic filter improves the representation of the song envelope while preserving information about the song's fine structure across intensities. Divisive normalization renders the presentation of the song envelope robust to the relatively slow fluctuations in intensity that arise during social interactions, while preserving information about the species-specific fast fluctuations of the envelope. Overall, we demonstrate how a sensory system can benefit from adaptive and nonlinear computations while minimizing concomitant costs arising from ambiguity and complexity of readouts by adapting the code for behaviorally-relevant signals.</content>

 Every day, we respond to the dynamic world around us by flexibly choosing actions to meet our goals. This constant problem solving, in familiar settings and in novel tasks, is a defining feature of human behaviour. Flexible neural populations are thought to support this process by adapting to prioritise task-relevant information, driving coding in specialised brain regions toward stimuli and actions that are important for our goal. Accordingly, human fMRI shows that activity patterns in frontoparietal cortex contain more information about visual features when they are task-relevant. However, if this preferential coding drives momentary focus, for example to solve each part of a task, it must reconfigure more quickly than we can observe with fMRI. Here we used MVPA with MEG to test for rapid reconfiguration of stimulus information when a new feature becomes relevant within a trial. Participants saw two displays on each trial. They attended to the shape of a first target then the colour of a second, or vice versa, and reported the attended features at a choice display. We found evidence of preferential coding for the relevant features in both trial phases, even as participants shifted attention mid-trial, commensurate with fast sub-trial reconfiguration. However, we only found this pattern of results when the task was difficult, and the stimulus displays contained multiple objects, and not in a simpler task with the same structure. The data suggest that adaptive coding in humans can operate on a fast, sub-trial timescale, suitable for supporting periods of momentary focus when complex tasks are broken down into simpler ones, but may not always do so.</content>

 The human brain is extremely flexible and capable of rapidly selecting relevant information in accordance with task goals. Regions of frontoparietal cortex flexibly represent relevant task information such as task rules and stimulus features when participants perform tasks successfully, but less is known about how information processing breaks down when participants make mistakes. This is important for understanding whether and when information coding recorded with neuroimaging is directly meaningful for behaviour. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to assess the temporal dynamics of information processing, and linked neural responses with goal-directed behaviour by analysing how they changed on behavioural error. Participants performed a difficult stimulus-response task using two stimulus-response mapping rules. We used time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis to characterise the progression of information coding from perceptual information about the stimulus, cue and rule coding, and finally, motor response. Response-aligned analyses revealed a ramping up of perceptual information prior to a correct response, suggestive of internal evidence accumulation. Strikingly, when participants made a stimulus-related error, and not when they made other types of errors, patterns of activity initially reflected the stimulus presented, but later reversed, and accumulated towards a representation of the incorrect stimulus. This suggests that the patterns recorded at later timepoints reflect an internally generated stimulus representation that was used to make the (incorrect) decision. These results illustrate the orderly and overlapping temporal dynamics of information coding in perceptual decision-making and show a clear link between neural patterns in the late stages of processing and behaviour.</content>

 Prior work has shown that there is substantial interindividual variation in the spatial distribution of functional networks across the cerebral cortex, or functional topography. However, it remains unknown whether there are sex differences in the topography of individualized networks in youth. Here we leveraged an advanced machine learning method (sparsity-regularized non-negative matrix factorization) to define individualized functional networks in 693 youth (ages 8-23 years) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Multivariate pattern analysis using support vector machines classified participant sex based on functional topography with 83% accuracy (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Brain regions most effective in classifying participant sex belonged to association networks, including the ventral attention and default mode networks. Mass-univariate analyses using generalized additive models with penalized splines provided convergent results. Comparative analysis using transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas revealed that sex differences in multivariate patterns of functional topography correlated with the expression of genes on the X-chromosome. These results identify normative developmental sex differences in the functional topography of association networks and highlight the role of sex as a biological variable in shaping brain development in youth.</content>

 Recently, studies have shown that the alpha band (8-13 Hz) EEG signals enable the decoding of auditory spatial attention. However, deep learning methods typically requires a large amount of training data. Inspired by sparse coding in cortical neurons, we propose a spiking neural network model for auditory spatial attention detection. The model is composed of three neural layers, two of them are spiking neurons. We formulate a new learning rule that is based on firing rate of pre synaptic and post-synaptic neurons in the first layer and the second layer of spiking neurons. The third layer consists of 10 spiking neurons that the pattern of their firing rate after training is used in test phase of the method. The proposed method extracts the patterns of recorded EEG of leftward and rightward attention, independently, and uses them to train network to detect the auditory spatial attention. In addition, a computational approach is presented to find the best single-trial EEG data as training samples of leftward and rightward attention EEG. In this model, the role of using low connectivity rate of the layers and specific range of learning parameters in sparse coding is studied. Importantly, unlike most prior model, our method requires 10% of EEG data as training data and has shown 90% accuracy in average. This study suggests new insights into the role of sparse coding in both biological networks and brain-inspired machine learning.</content>

 Current theories of human neural development and brain maturation emphasize the posterior-to-anterior or back-to-front pattern as an unequivocal ontogenetic feature that is largely due to the late maturing frontal lobes. The back-to-front pattern has received substantial support from both anatomical and electrophysiological studies, the latter looking at the age-related changes in the topography of sleep slow waves. However, the above scenario of a unidirectional developmental and anatomical route disregards the major hub of the so-called default-mode network, which is a human-specific and late maturing neural structure of the brain, undergoing significant differentiation during adolescence: the precuneus. In order to understand how the late maturation of the precuneus might modify the presently accepted large-scale maturational pattern of the human brain, here we focus on sleep spindles that are known to be involved in neural plasticity with major sources in the precuneus in adults. We provide evidence for the posteriorization in the prevailing anatomical localization of fast sleep spindles. The predominantly central maxima in density and amplitude of fast spindles at the age of 12 years becomes gradually shifted to the parietal regions until the age of 20. Similar changes, albeit at a smaller anatomical distance take place in terms of fast sleep spindle frequency. These findings indicate a front-to-back pattern of brain maturation and correspond with reports on an increased differentiation of the precuneus during adolescence.</content>

 Visual categorization is the brain ability to rapidly and automatically respond to widely variable visual inputs in a category-selective manner (i.e., distinct responses between categories and similar responses within categories). Whether category-selective neural responses are purely visual or can be influenced by other sensory modalities remains unclear. Here, we test whether odors modulate visual categorization, expecting that odors facilitate the neural categorization of congruent visual objects, especially when the visual category is ambiguous. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while natural images depicting various objects were displayed in rapid 12-Hz streams (i.e., 12 images / second) and variable exemplars of a target category (either human faces, cars, or facelike objects in dedicated sequences) were interleaved every 9th stimulus to tag category-selective responses at 12/9 = 1.33 Hz in the EEG frequency spectrum. During visual stimulation, participants (N = 26) were implicitly exposed to odor contexts (either body, gasoline or baseline odors) and performed an orthogonal cross-detection task. We identify clear category-selective responses to every category over the occipito-temporal cortex, with the largest response for human faces and the lowest for facelike objects. Critically, body odor boosts the response to the ambiguous facelike objects (i.e., either perceived as nonface objects or faces) over the right hemisphere, especially for participants reporting their presence post-stimulation. By contrast, odors do not significantly modulate other category-selective responses, nor the general visual response recorded at 12 Hz, revealing a specific influence on the categorization of congruent ambiguous stimuli. Overall, these findings support the view that the brain actively uses cues from the different senses to readily categorize visual inputs, and that olfaction, which is generally considered as poorly functional in humans, is well placed to disambiguate visual information.</content>

 Immunotherapy for hematologic malignancies with CD19-directed CAR T cells is associated with neurotoxicity in about 40% of patients. Systemic cytokine release syndrome, endothelial activation, and disruption of endothelial integrity have all been associated with neurotoxicity, but it remains unclear how these mechanisms interact and how they lead to neurologic dysfunction. We developed a syngeneic mouse model which manifests systemic cytokine release and behavioral abnormalities within 3-5 days after infusion of high-dose murine CD19-CAR T cells. Histologic examination revealed widespread brain hemorrhages, diffuse extravascular IgG deposition, loss of capillary pericyte coverage and increased prevalence of string capillaries. In vivo two-photon imaging of blood flow revealed plugging of &amp;gt;10% of capillaries by leukocytes, associated with regions of localized hypoxia. These data reveal capillary obstruction and associated brain hypoxia and microvascular decline as a potential basis for neurotoxicity during CD19-CAR T cell treatment in humans, which may be amenable to therapeutic interventions.</content>

 It is widely assumed that episodic memories are not stored in isolation but rather in dynamic event networks. However, the mechanisms of the underlying dynamic of these representations, in particular how such networks are updated, remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the reconfiguration of events into event networks in the hippocampus by presenting new events that could update either one of two competing narratives. During the first session, participants viewed four animated movies, each representing a distinct narrative; two distinct narratives from the Jones family and two distinct narratives from the Smith family. During the second session, we re-exposed participants to snapshots of these narratives along with snapshots of new events from one of the two families, allowing updating of the acquired event networks of that family. Our findings show that the hippocampus integrated new events that relate to the old family, and then integrated these new events with the corresponding old events. Furthermore, hippocampal representations of the events within a narrative became better integrated after updating. Our results shed new light on the neural mechanisms underlying flexible mnemonic updating with realistic events and further advance our understanding of the structured reconfiguration of event networks in memory.</content>

 Replay can consolidate memories by offline neural reactivation related to past experiences. Category knowledge is learned across multiple experiences and subsequently generalised to new situations. This ability to generalise is promoted by offline consolidation and replay during rest and sleep. However, aspects of replay are difficult to determine from neuroimaging studies alone. Here, we provide a comprehensive account of how category replay may work in the brain by simulating these processes in a neural network which assumed the functional roles of the human ventral visual stream and hippocampus. We showed that generative replay, akin to imagining entirely new instances of a category, facilitated generalisation to new experiences. This invites a reconsideration of the nature of replay more generally, and suggests that replay helps to prepare us for the future as much as remember the past. We simulated generative replay at different network locations finding it was most effective in later layers equivalent to the lateral occipital cortex, and less effective in layers corresponding to early visual cortex, thus drawing a distinction between the observation of replay in the brain and its relevance to consolidation. We modelled long-term memory consolidation in humans and found that category replay is most beneficial for newly acquired knowledge, at a time when generalisation is still poor, a finding which suggests replay helps us adapt to changes in our environment. Finally, we present a novel mechanism for the frequent observation that the brain selectively consolidates weaker information, and showed that a reinforcement learning process in which categories were replayed according to their contribution to network performance explains this well-documented phenomenon, thus reconceptualising replay as an active rather than passive process.</content>

 The protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK), a key ER stress sensor of the unfolded protein response (UPR), can confer beneficial effects by facilitating the removal of cytosolic aggregates through the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). In neurodegenerative diseases, the ALP ameliorates the accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates in the brain. Transcription factor-EB (TFEB), a master regulator of the ALP, positively regulates key genes involved in the cellular degradative pathway. However, in neurons, the role of PERK activation in mitigating amyloidogenesis by ALP remains unclear. In this study, we found that SB202190 selectively activates PERK independently of its inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, but not inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease-1 (IRE1 or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), in human neuroblastoma cells. PERK activation by SB202190 was dependent on mitochondrial ROS production and promoted Ca2+-calcineurin activation. The activation of the PERK-Ca2+-calcineurin axis by SB202190 positively affects TFEB activity to increase ALP in neuroblastoma cells. Collectively, our study reveals a novel physiological mechanism underlying ALP activation, dependent on PERK activation, for ameliorating amyloidogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases.</content>

 Behavior consists of the interaction between an organism and its environment, and is controlled by the brain. However, while brain activity varies at fast, sub-seconds time scales, behavioral measures tend to be temporally coarse, often limited just to the success or failure in a trial. The large gap between the temporal resolutions at which brain and behavior are observed likely impedes our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying behavior. To overcome this problem, we developed the RIFF: an interactive arena for rats that has multiple feeding areas, multiple sound sources, and high-resolution tracking of behavior, with concomitant wireless electrophysiological recordings. The RIFF can be flexibly programmed to create arbitrarily complex tasks that the rats have to solve. It records unrestrained rat behavior together with neuronal data from chronically implanted electrodes. We present here a detailed description of the RIFF. We illustrate its power with results from two exemplary tasks. Rats learned within two days a complex task that required timed movement, and developed anticipatory behavior. Rats found solution strategies that differed between animals but were stable within each animal. We report auditory responses in and around primary auditory cortex as well as in the posterior insular cortex, but show that often the same neurons were also sensitive to non-auditory parameters such as rat location and body orientation. These parameters are crucial for state assessment and the selection of future actions. Our findings show that the complex, unrestrained behavior of rats can be studied in a controlled environment, enabling novel insights into the cognitive capabilities and learning mechanisms of rats. This combination of electrophysiology and detailed behavioral observation opens the way to a better understanding of how the brain controls behavior.</content>

 Synchronous interpersonal motor interactions require moment-to-moment predictions and proactive monitoring of the partner's actions. Neurophysiologically, this is highlighted by an enhancement of midfrontal theta activity. In the present study we explored the causal role of midfrontal theta for interpersonal motor interactions employing transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). We implemented a realistic human-avatar interaction task in immersive virtual reality (IVR) where participants controlled a virtual arm and hand to press a button synchronously with a virtual partner. Participants completed the task while receiving theta (Experiment 1) or beta (control frequency, Experiment 2) EEG-informed tACS over the frontal midline, as well as sham stimulation as a control. Results showed that frontal theta tACS significantly improved behavioural performance (by reducing interpersonal asynchrony) and participants' motor strategies (by increasing movement times and reducing reaction times), while beta tACS had no effect on these measures. These results suggest that theta tACS over frontal areas facilitates action monitoring and motor abilities supporting interpersonal interactions.</content>

 Spontaneous alpha oscillations (~10Hz) have been associated with various cognitive functions, including perception. Their phase and amplitude independently predict cortical excitability and subsequent perceptual performance. Yet, the causal role of alpha phase-amplitude tradeoffs on visual perception remains ill-defined. We aimed to fill this gap and tested two clear predictions from the Pulsed Inhibition theory according to which alpha oscillations are associated with periodic functional inhibition. (1) High alpha amplitude induces cortical inhibition at specific phases, associated with low perceptual performance, while at opposite phases, excitation increases and so does perceptual performance. (2) Low alpha amplitude induces higher cortical excitability, less susceptible to phasic (periodic) pulsed inhibition and overall higher perceptual performance. Here, cortical excitability was assessed in humans using phosphene (illusory) perception induced by single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over visual cortex at perceptual threshold, and its post-pulse evoked activity recorded with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). We observed that pre-pulse alpha phase modulates the probability to perceive a phosphene, predominantly for high alpha amplitude, with a non-optimal phase for phosphene perception between -{pi}/2 and -{pi}/4. The pre-pulse non-optimal phase further leads to an increase in post-pulse evoked activity (ERP), in phosphene-perceived trials specifically. Together, these results show that alpha oscillations create periodic inhibitory moments when alpha amplitude is high, leading to periodic decrease of perceptual performance. This study provides strong causal evidence in favor of the Pulsed Inhibition theory.</content>

 Oligodendrocytes produce myelin which provides insulation to axons and speeds up neuronal transmission. In ischaemic conditions myelin is damaged, resulting to mental and physical disabilities. Therefore, it is important to understand how the functionality of oligodendrocytes and myelin is affected by ischaemia. Recent evidence suggests that oligodendrocyte damage during ischaemia is mediated by TRPA1, whose activation raises intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and damages compact myelin. Here, we show that TRPA1 is tonically active in oligodendrocytes and the optic nerve, as the specific TRPA1 antagonist, A-967079, decreases basal oligodendrocyte Ca2+ concentrations and increases the size of the compound action potential. Conversely, TRPA1 agonists reduce the size of the optic nerve compound action potential, and this effect is significantly reduced by the TRPA1 antagonist. These results indicate that glial TRPA1 regulates neuronal excitability in the white matter under physiological as well as pathological conditions. Importantly, we find that inhibition of TRPA1 prevents loss of compound action potentials during oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and improves the recovery. TRPA1 block was effective when applied before, during or after OGD, indicating that the damage is occurring during ischaemia, but that therapeutic intervention is possible after the ischaemic insult. These results indicate that TRPA1 has an important role in the brain, and that its block may be effective in treating oligodendrocyte loss and damage in many white matter diseases.</content>

 Pediatric neuroimaging is a quickly developing field that still faces important methodological challenges. One key challenge is the use of many different atlases, automated segmentation tools, manual edits in semiautomated protocols, and quality control protocols, which complicates comparisons between studies. In this article, we present our semiautomated segmentation protocol using FreeSurfer v6.0, ENIGMA consortium software, and the quality control protocol that was used in FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. We used a dichotomous quality rating scale for inclusion and exclusion of images, and then explored the quality on a region of interest level to exclude all regions with major segmentation errors. The effects of manual edits on cortical thickness values were minor: less than 2% in all regions. Supplementary materials cover registration and additional edit options in FreeSurfer and comparison to the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12). Overall, we conclude that despite minor imperfections FreeSurfer can be reliably used to segment cortical metrics from T1-weighted images of 5-year-old children with appropriate quality assessment in place. However, custom templates may be needed to optimize the results for the subcortical areas. Our semiautomated segmentation protocol provides high quality pediatric neuroimaging data and could help investigators working with similar data sets.</content>

 Understanding the organizational principles of human brain activity at the systems level remains a major challenge in network neuroscience. Here, we introduce a fully data-driven approach based on graph learning to extract meaningful repeating network patterns from regionally-averaged time-courses. We use the Graph Laplacian Mixture Model (GLMM), a generative model that treats functional data as a collection of signals expressed on multiple underlying graphs. By exploiting covariance between activity of brain regions, these graphs can be learned without resorting to structural information. To validate the proposed technique, we first apply it to task fMRI with a known experimental paradigm. The probability of each graph to occur at each time-point is found to be consistent with the task timing, while the spatial patterns associated to each epoch of the task are in line with previously established activation patterns using classical regression analysis. We further on apply the technique to resting state data, which leads to extracted graphs that correspond to well-known brain functional activation patterns. The GLMM allows to learn graphs entirely from the functional activity that, in practice, turn out to reveal high degrees of similarity to the structural connectome. We compared similarity of the default mode network estimated from different task data and comparing them to each other and to structure. Using different metrics, a similar distinction between high- and low-level cognitive tasks arises. Overall, this method allows us to infer relevant functional brain networks without the need of structural connectome information. Moreover, we find that these networks correspond better to structure compared to traditional methods.</content>

 Background: Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have made moving, wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG) possible. The OPMs typically used for MEG require a low background magnetic field to operate, which is achieved using both passive and active magnetic shielding. However, the background magnetic field is never truly zero Tesla, and so the field at each of the OPMs changes as the participant moves. This leads to position and orientation dependent changes in the measurements, which manifest as low frequency artefacts in MEG data. Objective: We modelled the spatial variation in the magnetic field and used the model to predict the movement artefact found in a dataset. Methods: We demonstrate a method for modelling this field with a triaxial magnetometer, then showed that we can use the same technique to predict the movement artefact in a real OPM-based MEG (OP-MEG) dataset. Results: Using an 86-channel OP-MEG system, we found that this modelling method maximally reduced the power spectral density of the data by 26.2 {+/-} 0.6 dB at 0 Hz, when applied over 5 s non-overlapping windows. Conclusion: The magnetic field inside our state-of-the art magnetically shielded room can be well described by low-order spherical harmonic functions. We achieved a large reduction in movement noise when we applied this model to OP-MEG data. Significance: Real-time implementation of this method could reduce passive shielding requirements for OP-MEG recording and allow the measurement of low-frequency brain activity during natural participant movement.</content>

 Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a promising model for understanding human vision, most CNNs lack robustness to challenging viewing conditions such as image blur, whereas human vision is much more reliable. Might robustness to blur be attributable to vision during infancy, given that acuity is initially poor but improves considerably over the first several months of life? Here, we evaluated the potential consequences of such early experiences by training CNN models on face and object recognition tasks while gradually reducing the amount of blur applied to the training images. For CNNs trained on blurry to clear faces, we observed sustained robustness to blur, consistent with a recent report by Vogelsang and colleagues (2018). By contrast, CNNs trained with blurry to clear objects failed to retain robustness to blur. Further analyses revealed that the spatial frequency tuning of the two CNNs was profoundly different. The blurry to clear face-trained network successfully retained a preference for low spatial frequencies, whereas the blurry to clear object-trained CNN exhibited a progressive shift toward higher spatial frequencies. Our findings provide novel computational evidence showing how face recognition, unlike object recognition, allows for more holistic processing. Moreover, our results suggest that blurry vision during infancy is insufficient to account for the robustness of adult vision to blurry objects.</content>

 A salient difference between artificial and biological neural networks is the complexity and diversity of individual units in the latter (Tasic et al., 2018). This remarkable diversity is present in the cellular and synaptic dynamics. In this study we focus on the role in learning of one such dynamical mechanism missing from most artificial neural network models, short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP). Biological synapses have dynamics over at least two time scales: a long time scale, which maps well to synaptic changes in artificial neural networks during learning, and the short time scale of STSP, which is typically ignored. Recent studies have shown the utility of such short-term dynamics in a variety of tasks (Masse et al., 2019; Perez-Nieves et al., 2021), and networks trained with such synapses have been shown to better match recorded neuronal activity and animal behavior (Hu et al., 2020). Here, we allow the timescale of STSP in individual neurons to be learned, simultaneously with standard learning of overall synaptic weights. We study learning performance on two predictive tasks, a simple dynamical system and a more complex MNIST pixel sequence. When the number of computational units is similar to the task dimensionality, RNNs with STSP outperform standard RNN and LSTM models. A potential explanation for this improvement is the encoding of activity history in the short-term synaptic dynamics, a biological form of long short-term memory. Beyond a role for synaptic dynamics themselves, we find a reason and a role for their diversity: learned synaptic time constants become heterogeneous across training and contribute to improved prediction performance in feedforward architectures. These results demonstrate how biologically motivated neural dynamics improve performance on the fundamental task of predicting future inputs with limited computational resources, and how learning such predictions drives neural dynamics towards the diversity found in biological brains.</content>

 Microlasers in near-degenerate supermodes lay the cornerstone for studies of non-Hermitian physics, novel light sources, and advanced sensors. Recent experiments of the stimulated scattering in supermode microcavities reported beating phenomena, interpreted as dual-mode lasing, which, however, contradicts their single-mode nature due to the clamped pump field. Here, we investigate the...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/NYkegNnRJqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Heterochromatin assembly requires methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) and serves as a paradigm for understanding the importance of histone modifications in epigenetic genome control.

Poor context integration, the process of incorporating both previous and current information in decision making, is a cognitive symptom of schizophrenia. The maintenance of the contextual information has been shown to be sensitive to changes in excitation-inhibition (EI) balance. Many regions of the brain are sensitive to EI imbalances, however, so it is unknown how systemic manipulations affect the specific regions that are important to context integration. We constructed a multi-structure, biophysically-realistic agent that could perform context-integration as is assessed by the dot pattern expectancy task. The agent included a perceptual network, a memory network, and a decision making system and was capable of successfully performing the dot pattern expectancy task. Systemic manipulation of the agent’s EI balance produced localized dysfunction of the memory structure, which resulted in schizophrenia-like deficits at context integration. When the agent’s pyramidal cells were less excitatory, the agent fixated upon the cue and initiated responding later than the default agent, which were like the deficits one would predict that individuals on the autistic spectrum would make. This modelling suggests that it may be possible to parse between different types of context integration deficits by adding distractors to context integration tasks and by closely examining a participant’s reaction times.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f5D4eROQn-I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We here conducted an image-based chemical screen to evaluate how medically approved drugs, as well as drugs that are currently under development, influence overall translation levels. None of the compounds up-regulated translation, which could be due to the screen being performed in cancer cells grown in full media where translation is already present at very high levels. Regarding translation down-regulators, and consistent with current knowledge, inhibitors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway were the most represented class. In addition, we identified that inhibitors of sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) also reduce mRNA translation levels independently of mTOR. Mechanistically, this is explained by an effect of the compounds on the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which activates the integrated stress response (ISR) and contributes to the toxicity of SPHK inhibitors. Surprisingly, the toxicity and activation of the ISR triggered by 2 independent SPHK inhibitors, SKI-II and ABC294640, the latter in clinical trials, are also observed in cells lacking SPHK1 and SPHK2. In summary, our study provides a useful resource on the effects of medically used drugs on translation, identified compounds capable of reducing translation independently of mTOR and has revealed that the cytotoxic properties of SPHK inhibitors being developed as anticancer agents are independent of SPHKs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8oWNzB01x50&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) complex are heterogeneous and vary in dendritic morphology, cell shape, spine and axon presence, soma size, and orientation to surrounding fibers. An example of 7, Golgi‐stained neurons with 5 primary dendrites and their location (inset) in this composite sagittal section illustrates a spectrum of dendritic arbors and these other features. Arrows point to the direction of fibers in the TRN. Greatest soma length (L) is indicated. Neurons in the inset, enlarged views of neurons, and enclosed boxes are coded with similar colors.







Abstract
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical structure influencing information transfer to the forebrain. In crocodilians, the TRN shares many features with its mammalian counterpart. One area that has not been explored is how individual neurons in the crocodilian TRN compare with those found in mammals. In mammals, TRN neurons are aligned parallel to the external border of the dorsal thalamus, have their dendrites oriented perpendicular to the fibers in the internal capsule, have fine, filamentous dendritic appendages, are either bipolar or multipolar, and are commonly considered to be a homogeneous morphological population of cells. To investigate the cellular morphology of the TRN complex, a Golgi analysis was undertaken in Alligator mississippiensis. This study examined features that have been used in mammals. In Alligator, the 4 TRN divisions are the dorsal peduncular nucleus, the perireticular nucleus, the interstitial nucleus, and the neurons in the medial forebrain bundle associated with the interstitial nucleus. In crocodilians, the dorsal peduncular nucleus is homologous to the TRN of mammals. From the 1787 drawn neuron profiles in the traditional 3 planes of section, the following were concluded. First, neurons in each part of the TRN complex in Alligator were similar in morphology. Second, each part of the TRN complex of Alligator contained a heterogenous population of cells. These variations between the cellular morphology of the dorsal peduncular nucleus of crocodilians and the TRN of mammals are speculated to partly result from differences in forebrain organization.

 Abstract
Extensive alterations in gene regulatory networks are a typical characteristic of Huntington's disease (HD); these include alterations in protein‐coding genes and poorly understood non‐coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are associated with pathology caused by mutant huntingtin. Long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of ncRNAs involved in a variety of biological functions, including transcriptional regulation and post‐transcriptional modification of many targets, and likely contributed to the pathogenesis of HD. While a number of changes in lncRNAs expression have been observed in HD, little is currently known about their functions. Here, we discuss their possible mechanisms and molecular functions, with a particular focus on their roles in transcriptional regulation. These findings give us a better insight into HD pathogenesis and may provide new targets for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disease.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep learning, a multi-layered neural network approach inspired by the brain,
has revolutionized machine learning. One of its key enablers has been
backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function
with respect to the weights in the neural network model, in combination with
its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in
digital computers is intrinsically wasteful, with energy consumption becoming
prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development
of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and
integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing
systems. The learning process in these material systems, taking place, e.g., by
artificial evolution or surrogate neural network modelling, is still a
complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate an efficient and
accurate homodyne gradient extraction method for performing gradient descent on
the loss function directly in the material system. We demonstrate the method in
our recently developed dopant network processing units, where we readily
realize all Boolean gates. This shows that gradient descent can in principle be
fully implemented in materio using simple electronics, opening up the way to
autonomously learning material systems.

 &lt;p&gt;The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that any dynamical system can be
interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment.
Although the FEP applies in theory to a wide variety of systems, there has been
almost no direct exploration of the principle in concrete systems. In this
paper, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in the
simplest possible set of systems - weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear
stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general are the
requirements imposed on the statistical structure of a system and (ii) how
informative the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We find that this
structure, known as a Markov blanket (i.e. a boundary precluding direct
coupling between internal and external states) and stringent restrictions on
its solenoidal flows, both required by the FEP, make it challenging to find
systems that fulfil the required assumptions. Suitable systems require an
absence of asymmetries in sensorimotor interactions that are highly unusual for
living systems. Moreover, we find that a core step in the argument relating the
behaviour of a system to variational inference relies on an implicit
equivalence between the dynamics of the average states with the average of the
dynamics. This equivalence does not hold in general even for linear systems as
it requires an effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions.
These observations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability
of the FEP and point to potential issues in its current form. These issues make
the FEP, as it stands, not straightforwardly applicable to the simple linear
systems studied here and suggests more development is needed before it could be
applied to the kind of complex systems which describe living and cognitive
processes.

 &lt;p&gt;Federated Learning (FL) has recently received a lot of attention for
large-scale privacy-preserving machine learning. However, high communication
overheads due to frequent gradient transmissions decelerate FL. To mitigate the
communication overheads, two main techniques have been studied: (i) local
update of weights characterizing the trade-off between communication and
computation and (ii) gradient compression characterizing the trade-off between
communication and precision. To the best of our knowledge, studying and
balancing those two trade-offs jointly and dynamically while considering their
impacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises
significantly faster FL. In this paper, we first formulate our problem to
minimize learning error with respect to two variables: local update
coefficients and sparsity budgets of gradient compression who characterize
trade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. We
then derive an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time
considering the interdependency between the two variables. Based on this
theoretical analysis, we propose an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL),
that jointly and dynamically adjusts the two variables to minimize the learning
error. We demonstrate that FFL consistently achieves higher accuracies faster
than similar schemes existing in the literature.

 &lt;p&gt;Multiagent systems provide an ideal environment for the evaluation and
analysis of real-world problems using reinforcement learning algorithms. Most
traditional approaches to multiagent learning are affected by long training
periods as well as high computational complexity. NEAT (NeuroEvolution of
Augmenting Topologies) is a popular evolutionary strategy used to obtain the
best performing neural network architecture often used to tackle optimization
problems in the field of artificial intelligence. This paper utilizes the NEAT
algorithm to achieve competitive multiagent learning on a modified pong game
environment in an efficient manner. The competing agents abide by different
rules while having similar observation space parameters. The proposed algorithm
utilizes this property of the environment to define a singular
neuroevolutionary procedure that obtains the optimal policy for all the agents.
The compiled results indicate that the proposed implementation achieves ideal
behaviour in a very short training period when compared to existing multiagent
reinforcement learning models.

capable of using multi-relational domain knowledge. The technique is based on
mode-directed inverse entailment (MDIE) developed in Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP). Given a data instance $e$ and background knowledge $B$, MDIE
identifies a most-specific logical formula $\bot_B(e)$ that contains all the
relational information in $B$ that is related to $e$. We transform $\bot_B(e)$
into a corresponding &quot;bottom-graph&quot; that can be processed for use by standard
GNN implementations. This transformation allows a principled way of
incorporating generic background knowledge into GNNs: we use the term `BotGNN'
for this form of graph neural networks. For several GNN variants, using
real-world datasets with substantial background knowledge, we show that BotGNNs
perform significantly better than both GNNs without background knowledge and a
recently proposed simplified technique for including domain knowledge into
GNNs. We also provide experimental evidence comparing BotGNNs favourably to
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that use features representing a
&quot;propositionalised&quot; form of the background knowledge; and BotGNNs to a standard
ILP based on the use of most-specific clauses. Taken together, these results
point to BotGNNs as capable of combining the computational efficacy of GNNs
with the representational versatility of ILP.

 &lt;p&gt;We present a quantitative study of phase entrainment by periodic visual
stimuli in a biologically inspired neural network. The objective is to
understand the neuronal population dynamics that underlie phase entrainment.
Phase and frequency entrainment of brain oscillations by external stimuli are
used as therapeutic treatment in neurological disorders, for example in
Parkinsonian tremor. And yet, the neuronal dynamics underpinning such
entrainment is not fully understood. Rhythmic sensory stimulation is one way of
studying phase synchronisation in the brain. A recent experimental study has
shown phase entrainment of brain oscillations during steady state visually
evoked potentials (SSVEP), which are scalp electroencephalogram corresponding
to periodic rhythmic stimuli. We have simulated SSVEP-like signals
corresponding to periodic pulse input to our in silico model. We have used
phase locking values, normalised Shannon entropy and conditional probability as
synchronisation indices showing relative phase synchrony between the neuronal
populations as well with the input. The phase synchronisation disappears with
jitter in the input inter-pulse intervals. This would not have been the case if
the output signal were to be the superposition of the responses to the
different input signals. Thus, it may be inferred that the phase
synchronisation implies entrainment of the network response by the periodic
input. Overall, our study shows the plausibility of using biologically inspired
in silico models, validated with experimental works, to understand and make
testable predictions on brain entrainment as a therapeutic treatment in
specific neurological disorders.

 &lt;p&gt;Photonic neural networks have significant potential for high-speed neural
processing with low latency and ultralow energy consumption. However, the
on-chip implementation of a large-scale neural network is still challenging
owing to its low scalability. Herein, we propose the concept of a photonic
neural field and implement it experimentally on a silicon chip to realize
highly scalable neuro-inspired computing. In contrast to existing photonic
neural networks, the photonic neural field is a spatially continuous field that
nonlinearly responds to optical inputs, and its high spatial degrees of freedom
allow for large-scale and high-density neural processing on a millimeter-scale
chip. In this study, we use the on-chip photonic neural field as a reservoir of
information and demonstrate a high-speed chaotic time-series prediction with
low errors using a training approach similar to reservoir computing. We discuss
that the photonic neural field is potentially capable of executing more than
one peta multiply-accumulate operations per second for a single input
wavelength on a footprint as small as a few square millimeters. In addition to
processing, the photonic neural field can be used for rapidly sensing the
temporal variation of an optical phase, facilitated by its high sensitivity to
optical inputs. The merging of optical processing with optical sensing paves
the way for an end-to-end data-driven optical sensing scheme.

 &lt;p&gt;In the past three decades, a large number of metaheuristics have been
proposed and shown high performance in solving complex optimization problems.
While most variation operators in existing metaheuristics are empirically
designed, this paper aims to design new operators automatically, which are
expected to be search space independent and thus exhibit robust performance on
different problems. For this purpose, this work first investigates the
influence of translation invariance, scale invariance, and rotation invariance
on the search behavior and performance of some representative operators. Then,
we deduce the generic form of translation, scale, and rotation invariant
operators. Afterwards, a principled approach is proposed for the automated
design of operators, which searches for high-performance operators based on the
deduced generic form. The experimental results demonstrate that the operators
generated by the proposed approach outperform state-of-the-art ones on a
variety of problems with complex landscapes and up to 1000 decision variables.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In the present work, we introduce a general class of mean-field interacting
nonlinear Hawkes processes modelling the reciprocal interactions between two
neuronal populations, one excitatory and one inhibitory. The model incorporates
two features: inhibition, which acts as a multiplicative factor onto the
intensity of the excitatory population and additive retroaction from the
excitatory neurons onto the inhibitory ones. We give first a detailed analysis
of the well-posedness of this interacting system as well as its dynamics in
large population. The second aim of the paper is to give a rigorous analysis of
the longtime behavior of the mean-field limit process. We provide also
numerical evidence that inhibition and retroaction may be responsible for the
emergence of limit cycles in such system.

 &lt;p&gt;The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is the wide-network limit of a kernel defined
using neural networks at initialization, whose embedding is the gradient of the
output of the network with respect to its parameters. We study the &quot;after
kernel&quot;, which is defined using the same embedding, except after training, for
neural networks with standard architectures, on binary classification problems
extracted from MNIST and CIFAR-10, trained using SGD in a standard way. Lyu and
Li described a sense in which neural networks, under certain conditions, are
equivalent to SVM with the after kernel. Our experiments are consistent with
this proposition under natural conditions. For networks with an architecure
similar to VGG, the after kernel is more &quot;global&quot;, in the sense that it is less
invariant to transformations of input images that disrupt the global structure
of the image while leaving the local statistics largely intact. For fully
connected networks, the after kernel is less global in this sense. The after
kernel tends to be more invariant to small shifts, rotations and zooms; data
augmentation does not improve these invariances. The (finite approximation to
the) conjugate kernel, obtained using the last layer of hidden nodes,
sometimes, but not always, provides a good approximation to the NTK and the
after kernel.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Learning to count is an important example of the broader human capacity for
systematic generalization, and the development of counting is often
characterized by an inflection point when children rapidly acquire proficiency
with the procedures that support this ability. We aimed to model this process
by training a reinforcement learning agent to select N items from a binary
vector when instructed (known as the give-$N$ task). We found that a
memory-augmented modular network architecture based on the recently proposed
Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN) exhibited an inflection during learning
that resembled human development. This model was also capable of systematic
extrapolation outside the range of its training set - for example, trained only
to select between 1 and 10 items, it could succeed at selecting 11 to 15 items
as long as it could make use of an arbitrary count sequence of at least that
length. The close parallels to child development and the capacity for
extrapolation suggest that our model could shed light on the emergence of
systematicity in humans.

 &lt;p&gt;Brain signals could be used to control devices to assist individuals with
disabilities. Signals such as electroencephalograms are complicated and hard to
interpret. A set of signals are collected and should be classified to identify
the intention of the subject. Different approaches have tried to reduce the
number of channels before sending them to a classifier. We are proposing a deep
learning-based method for selecting an informative subset of channels that
produce high classification accuracy. The proposed network could be trained for
an individual subject for the selection of an appropriate set of channels.
Reduction of the number of channels could reduce the complexity of
brain-computer-interface devices. Our method could find a subset of channels.
The accuracy of our approach is comparable with a model trained on all
channels. Hence, our model's temporal and power costs are low, while its
accuracy is kept high.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Intrinsic oscillators in the central nervous system play a preeminent role in the neural control of rhythmic behaviors, yet little is known about how the ionic milieu regulates their output patterns. A powerful system to address this question is the pacemaker nucleus of the weakly electric fish &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/em&gt;. A neural network comprised of an average of 87 pacemaker cells and 20 relay cells produces tonic oscillations, with higher frequencies in males compared to females. Previous empirical studies have suggested that this sexual dimorphism develops and is maintained through modulation of buffering of extracellular K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by a massive meshwork of astrocytes enveloping the pacemaker and relay cells. Here, we constructed a model of this neural network that can generate sustained spontaneous oscillations. Sensitivity analysis revealed the potassium equilibrium potential, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; (as a proxy of extracellular K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration), and corresponding somatic channel conductances as critical determinants of oscillation frequency and amplitude. In models of both the pacemaker nucleus network and isolated pacemaker and relay cells, the frequency increased almost linearly with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the amplitude decreased nonlinearly with increasing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;. Our simulations predict that this frequency increase is largely caused by a shift in the minimum K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance over one oscillation period. This minimum is close to zero at more negative &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;, converging to the corresponding maximum at less negative &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;. This brings the resting membrane potential closer to the threshold potential at which voltage-gated Na&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels become active, increasing the excitability, and thus the frequency, of pacemaker and relay cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Persistent acidosis occurs in ischemia and multiple neurological diseases. In previous studies, acidic stimulation leads to rapid increase in intracellular calcium in neurons. However, it remains largely unclear how a prolonged acidosis alters neuronal signaling. In our previous study, we found that GPR68-mediated PKC activities are protective against acidosis-induced injury in cortical slices. Here, we first asked whether the same principle holds true in organotypic hippocampal slices. Our data showed that 1-h pH 6 induced PKC phosphorylation in a GPR68-dependent manner. Go6983, a PKC inhibitor worsened acidosis-induced neuronal injury in wild type (WT) but had no effect in GPR68&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; slices. Next, to gain greater insights into acid signaling in brain tissue, we treated organotypic hippocampal slices with pH 6 for 1-h and performed a kinome profiling analysis by Western blot. Acidosis had little effect on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) or casein kinase 2 activity, two members of the CMGC family, or Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM and RAD3-related (ATR) activity, but reduced the phosphorylation of MAPK/CDK substrates. In contrast, acidosis induced the activation of CaMKIIα, PKA, and Akt. Besides these serine/threonine kinases, acidosis also induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Since GPR68 is widely expressed in brain neurons, we asked whether GPR68 contributes to acidosis-induced signaling. Deleting GPR68 had no effect on acidosis-induced CaMKII phosphorylation, attenuated that of phospho-Akt and phospho-PKA substrates, while abolishing acidosis-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that prolonged acidosis activates a network of signaling cascades, mediated by AGC kinases, CaMKII, and tyrosine kinases. GPR68 is the primary mediator for acidosis-induced activation of PKC and tyrosine phosphorylation, while both GPR68-dependent and -independent mechanisms contribute to the activation of PKA and Akt.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep learning based medical image segmentation has shown great potential in becoming a key part of the clinical analysis pipeline. However, many of these models rely on the assumption that the train and test data come from the same distribution. This means that such methods cannot guarantee high quality predictions when the source and target domains are dissimilar due to different acquisition protocols, or biases in patient cohorts. Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation techniques have shown great potential in alleviating this problem by minimizing the shift between the source and target distributions, without requiring the use of labeled data in the target domain. In this work, we aim to predict tissue segmentation maps on T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data of an unseen preterm-born neonatal population, which has both different acquisition parameters and population bias when compared to our training data. We achieve this by investigating two unsupervised domain adaptation techniques with the objective of finding the best solution for our problem. We compare the two methods with a baseline fully-supervised segmentation network and report our results in terms of Dice scores obtained on our source test dataset. Moreover, we analyse tissue volumes and cortical thickness measures of the harmonized data on a subset of the population matched for gestational age at birth and postmenstrual age at scan. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the harmonized cortical gray matter maps with an analysis comparing term and preterm-born neonates and a proof-of-principle investigation of the association between cortical thickness and a language outcome measure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. In recent years, it has been proven that the kynurenine system plays a significant role in the development of several nervous system disorders, including multiple sclerosis. Kynurenine pathway metabolites have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects. Moreover, the enzymes of the kynurenine pathway play an important role in immunomodulation processes, among others, as well as interacting with neuronal energy balance and various redox reactions. Dysregulation of many of the enzymatic steps in kynurenine pathway and upregulated levels of these metabolites locally in the central nervous system, contribute to the progression of multiple sclerosis pathology. This process can initiate a pathogenic cascade, including microglia activation, glutamate excitotoxicity, chronic oxidative stress or accumulated mitochondrial damage in the axons, that finally disrupt the homeostasis of neurons, leads to destabilization of neuronal cell cytoskeleton, contributes to neuro-axonal damage and neurodegeneration. Neurofilaments are good biomarkers of the neuro-axonal damage and their level reliably indicates the severity of multiple sclerosis and the treatment response. There is increasing evidence that connections exist between the molecules generated in the kynurenine metabolic pathway and the change in neurofilament concentrations. Thus the alterations in the kynurenine pathway may be an important biomarker of the course of multiple sclerosis. In our present review, we report the possible relationship and connection between neurofilaments and the kynurenine system in multiple sclerosis based on the available evidences.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Its genetic cause is a 2.5- to 3.8-kb-long complex pentanucleotide repeat insertion containing (TGGAA)n, (TAGAA)n, (TAAAA)n, and (TAAAATAGAA)n located in an intron shared by two different genes: brain expressed associated with NEDD4-1 (BEAN1) and thymidine kinase 2 (TK2). Among these repeat sequences, (TGGAA)n repeat was the only sequence segregating with SCA31, which strongly suggests its pathogenicity. In SCA31 patient brains, the mutant BEAN1 transcript containing expanded UGGAA repeats (UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;) was found to form abnormal RNA structures called RNA foci in cerebellar Purkinje cell nuclei. In addition, the deposition of pentapeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, poly(Trp-Asn-Gly-Met-Glu), translated from UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; RNA, was detected in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells. To uncover the pathogenesis of UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in SCA31, we generated Drosophila models of SCA31 expressing UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; RNA. The toxicity of UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; depended on its length and expression level, which was accompanied by the accumulation of RNA foci and translation of repeat-associated PPR proteins in Drosophila, consistent with the observation in SCA31 patient brains. We also revealed that TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2B1, motor neuron disease–linked RNA-binding proteins bound to UGGAA&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; RNA, act as RNA chaperones to regulate the formation of RNA foci and repeat-associated translation. Further research on the role of RNA-binding proteins as RNA chaperones may also provide a novel therapeutic strategy for other microsatellite repeat expansion diseases besides SCA31.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the adult human brain, six isoforms of the microtubule-associated protein TAU are expressed, which result from alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 of the MAPT gene. These isoforms differ in the number of N-terminal inserts (0N, 1N, 2N) and C-terminal repeat domains (3R or 4R) and are differentially expressed depending on the brain region and developmental stage. Although all TAU isoforms can aggregate and form neurofibrillary tangles, some tauopathies, such as Pick’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, are characterized by the accumulation of specific TAU isoforms. The influence of the individual TAU isoforms in a cellular context, however, is understudied. In this report, we investigated the subcellular localization of the human-specific TAU isoforms in primary mouse neurons and analyzed TAU isoform-specific effects on cell area and microtubule dynamics in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our results show that 2N-TAU isoforms are particularly retained from axonal sorting and that axonal enrichment is independent of the number of repeat domains, but that the additional repeat domain of 4R-TAU isoforms results in a general reduction of cell size and an increase of microtubule counts in cells expressing these specific isoforms. Our study points out that individual TAU isoforms may influence microtubule dynamics differentially both by different sorting patterns and by direct effects on microtubule dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Immunostaining is a powerful technique and widely used to identify molecules in tissues and cells, although critical steps are necessary to block cross-reaction. Here we focused on an overlooked cross immunoreactivity issue where a secondary antibody (secondary) cross-reacts with a primary antibody (primary) from a different species. We first confirmed the previously reported cross-species binding of goat anti-mouse secondary to rat primary. This was accomplished by staining with a rat primary against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and visualizing with goat (or donkey) anti-mouse secondary. We then further revealed the converse cross-species binding by staining with a mouse primary against neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) and visualizing with anti-rat secondaries. We speculate that mouse and rat primaries share antigenicity, enabling either secondary to recognize either primary. To block this cross-species binding in double staining experiments, we compared three protocols using mouse anti-NeuN and rat anti-GFAP, two primaries whose antigens have non-overlapping distributions in brain tissues. Simultaneous staining resulted in cross-species astrocytic staining (anti-mouse secondary to rat anti-GFAP primary) but no cross-species neuronal staining (anti-rat secondary to mouse anti-NeuN primary). Cross-species astrocytic staining was missing after sequential same-species staining with mouse anti-NeuN primary, followed by rat anti-GFAP. However, cross-species astrocytic staining could not be diminished after sequential same-species staining with rat anti-GFAP primary, followed by mouse anti-NeuN. We thus hypothesize that a competition exists between anti-mouse and anti-rat secondaries in their binding to both primaries. Single staining for NeuN or GFAP visualized with dual secondaries at different dilution ratio supported this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Recent advances in neuroscience indicate that analysis of bio-signals such as rest state electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking data can provide more reliable evaluation of children autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than traditional methods of behavior measurement relying on scales do. However, the effectiveness of the new approaches still lags behind the increasing requirement in clinical or educational practices as the “bio-marker” information carried by the bio-signal of a single-modality is likely insufficient or distorted. This study proposes an approach to joint analysis of EEG and eye-tracking for children ASD evaluation. The approach focuses on deep fusion of the features in two modalities as no explicit correlations between the original bio-signals are available, which also limits the performance of existing methods along this direction. First, the synchronization measures, information entropy, and time-frequency features of the multi-channel EEG are derived. Then a random forest applies to the eye-tracking recordings of the same subjects to single out the most significant features. A graph convolutional network (GCN) model then naturally fuses the two group of features to differentiate the children with ASD from the typically developed (TD) subjects. Experiments have been carried out on the two types of the bio-signals collected from 42 children (21 ASD and 21 TD subjects, 3–6 years old). The results indicate that (1) the proposed approach can achieve an accuracy of 95% in ASD detection, and (2) strong correlations exist between the two bio-signals collected even asynchronously, in particular the EEG synchronization against the face related/joint attentions in terms of covariance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback (NF) is a complex learning scenario, as the task consists of trying out mental strategies while processing a feedback signal that signifies activation in the brain area to be self-regulated and acts as a potential reward signal. In an attempt to dissect these subcomponents, we obtained whole-brain networks associated with efficient self-regulation in two paradigms: parallel, where the task was performed concurrently, combining feedback with strategy execution; and serial, where the task was performed consecutively, separating feedback processing from strategy execution. Twenty participants attempted to control their anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) NF in 18 sessions over 2 weeks, using cognitive and emotional mental strategies. We analyzed whole-brain fMRI activations in the NF training runs with the largest aMCC activation for the serial and parallel paradigms. The equal length of the strategy execution and the feedback processing periods in the serial paradigm allows a description of the two task subcomponents with equal power. The resulting activation maps were spatially correlated with functionally annotated intrinsic connectivity brain maps (BMs). Brain activation in the parallel condition correlates with the basal ganglia (BG) network, the cingulo-opercular network (CON), and the frontoparietal control network (FPCN); brain activation in the serial strategy execution condition with the default mode network (DMN), the FPCN, and the visual processing network; while brain activation in the serial feedback processing condition predominantly with the CON, the DMN, and the FPCN. Additional comparisons indicate that BG activation is characteristic to the parallel paradigm, while supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) activations are characteristic to the serial paradigm. The multifaceted view of the subcomponents allows describing the cognitive processes associated with strategy execution and feedback processing independently in the serial feedback task and as combined processes in the multitasking scenario of the conventional parallel feedback task.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical areas are highly interconnected both via cortical and subcortical pathways, and primary sensory cortices are not isolated from this general structure. In primary sensory cortical areas, these pre-existing functional connections serve to provide contextual information for sensory processing and can mediate adaptation when a sensory modality is lost. Cross-modal plasticity in broad terms refers to widespread plasticity across the brain in response to losing a sensory modality, and largely involves two distinct changes: cross-modal recruitment and compensatory plasticity. The former involves recruitment of the deprived sensory area, which includes the deprived primary sensory cortex, for processing the remaining senses. Compensatory plasticity refers to plasticity in the remaining sensory areas, including the spared primary sensory cortices, to enhance the processing of its own sensory inputs. Here, we will summarize potential cellular plasticity mechanisms involved in cross-modal recruitment and compensatory plasticity, and review cortical and subcortical circuits to the primary sensory cortices which can mediate cross-modal plasticity upon loss of vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background Our aim was to investigate the effects of the protein expression and the function of sodium, potassium, and chloride co-transporter (NKCC1) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1) in capsaicin-induced acute inflammatory pain and the possible mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods Male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, capsaicin, and inhibitor groups. The expression and distribution of TRPV1 and NKCC1 in rat DRG were observed by immunofluorescence. Thermal radiation and acetone test were used to detect the pain threshold of heat and cold noxious stimulation in each group. The expressions of NKCC1 mRNA, NKCC1 protein, and p-NKCC1 in the DRG were detected by PCR and western blotting (WB). Patch clamp and chloride fluorescent probe were used to observe the changes of GABA activation current and intracellular chloride concentration. After intrathecal injection of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (GF109203X) or MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (U0126), the behavioral changes and the expression of NKCC1 and p-ERK protein in L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; DRG were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: TRPV1 and NKCC1 were co-expressed in the DRG. Compared with the control group, the immunofluorescence intensity of NKCC1 and p-NKCC1 in the capsaicin group was significantly higher, and the expression of NKCC1 in the nuclear membrane was significantly higher than that in the control group. The expression of NKCC1 mRNA and protein of NKCC1 and p-NKCC1 in the capsaicin group were higher than those in the control group. After capsaicin injection, GF109203X inhibited the protein expression of NKCC1 and p-ERK, while U0126 inhibited the protein expression of NKCC1. In the capsaicin group, paw withdrawal thermal latency (WTL) was decreased, while cold withdrawal latency (CWL) was prolonged. Bumetanide, GF109203X, or U0126 could reverse the effect. GABA activation current significantly increased in the DRG cells of the capsaicin group, which could be reversed by bumetanide. The concentration of chloride in the DRG cells of the capsaicin group increased, but decreased after bumetanide, GF109203X, and U0126 were administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion Activation of TRPV1 by exogenous agonists can increase the expression and function of NKCC1 protein in DRG, which is mediated by activation of PKC/p-ERK signaling pathway. These results suggest that DRG NKCC1 may participate in the inflammatory pain induced by TRPV1.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Serum miR-30c-5p correlates with Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet its role has not been illustrated. This research analyzed the function of miR-30c-5p in PD. The behavioral evaluation was performed on MPTP-treated PD mice transfected with miR-30c-5p agomiR, antagomiR, siATG5, or 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor). Oxidative stress-related factors, miR-30c-5p, and apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins in brain tissues or cells were determined by molecular experiments. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine metabolic markers were detected using immunofluorescence and Diode Array Detector (DAD), respectively. Effects of miR-30c-5p and its target gene Autophagy-related gene (ATG) 5 protein (ATG5) on MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells were determined through a series of molecular experiments. MiR-30c-5p was upregulated but ATG5 was downregulated in PD mice. MiR-30c-5p antagomiR attenuated the decrease of ATG5 in PD mice. MiR-30c-5p antagomiR partly alleviated the behavioral symptoms and inhibited the increases of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and SOD in PD mice. The levels of Bcl-2, dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), TH, and LC3 II were downregulated in PD mice, while Bax, cleaved caspase-3, P62, and LC3 I were upregulated. However, miR-30c-5p antagomiR partly reversed the levels of these factors in PD mice. 3-MA could block the effects of miR-30c-5p antagomiR on PD mice. MiR-30c-5p antagomiR attenuated apoptosis and induced autophagy in brain tissues of MPTP-treated mice by targeting ATG5. In vitro assay results also showed that silence of ATG5 reduced the protective effect of miR-30c-5p downregulation on the cells. MiR-30c-5p regulates the progression of Parkinson’s disease through attenuating ATG5-inhibited apoptosis and -induced autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Trigeminal sensory neurons of transgenic knock-in (KI) mice expressing the R192Q missense mutation in the α1A subunit of neuronal voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, which leads to familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) in patients, exhibit a hyperexcitability phenotype. Here, we show that the expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels, linked to pain states, is upregulated in KI primary cultures of trigeminal ganglia (TG), as shown by increased expression of its α1 subunit. In the majority of TG neurons, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels are co-expressed with ATP-gated P2X3 receptors (P2X3R), which are important nociceptive sensors. Reversing the trigeminal phenotype with selective Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channel inhibitor ω-agatoxin IVA inhibited Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 overexpression. Functionally, KI neurons revealed a TTX-sensitive inward current of larger amplitude that was partially inhibited by selective Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 blocker Tp1a. Under current-clamp condition, Tp1a raised the spike threshold of both wild-type (WT) and KI neurons with decreased firing rate in KI cells. Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 activator OD1 accelerated firing in WT and KI neurons, a phenomenon blocked by Tp1a. Enhanced expression and function of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels in KI TG neurons resulted in higher excitability and facilitated nociceptive signaling. Co-expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channels and P2X3Rs in TGs may explain how hypersensitivity to local stimuli can be relevant to migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Together with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), large vessel atherosclerosis is considered to be an equally important risk factor in the progression of vascular cognitive impairment. This article aims to investigate whether carotid atherosclerotic calcification is associated with the increased risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 128 patients (mean age: 62.1 ± 12.2 years, 37 women) suffering from ischemic stroke underwent brain/neck computer tomography angiography examination. The presence and characteristic of carotid calcification (size, number and location) were analyzed on computer tomography angiography. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) was assessed using Fazekas scales. PSCI was diagnosed based on a battery of neuropsychological assessments implemented 6−12 months after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Among 128 patients, 26 developed post-stroke dementia and 96 had carotid calcification. Logistic regression found carotid calcification (odds ratio [OR] = 7.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–47.69) and carotid artery stenosis (OR = 6.42, 95% CI: 1.03–40.15) both significantly increased the risk for post-stroke dementia. Moreover, multiple, thick/mixed, and surface calcifications exhibited an increasing trend in PSCI (P&lt;sub&gt;trend&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.004, 0.016, 0.045, respectively). The prediction model for post-stroke dementia including carotid calcification (area under curve = 0.67), WMH (area under curve = 0.67) and other covariates yielded an area under curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82–0.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the quantity and location of carotid calcifications were independent indicators for PSCI. The significant role of large vessel atherosclerosis in PSCI should be concerned in future study.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;P301S transgenic mice are an animal model of tauopathy and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), exhibiting tau pathology and synaptic dysfunction. Cornel iridoid glycoside (CIG) is an active ingredient extracted from Cornus officinalis, a traditional Chinese herb. In the present study, the purpose was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of CIG on tau pathology and synaptic dysfunction using P301S transgenic mice. The results showed that intragastric administration of CIG for 3.5 months improved cognitive impairments and the survival rate of P301S mice. Electrophysiological recordings and transmission electron microscopy study showed that CIG improved synaptic plasticity and increased the ultrastructure and number of synapse. Moreover, CIG increased the expression levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B, and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1. We inferred that the major mechanism of CIG involving in the regulation of synaptic dysfunctions was inhibiting the activation of Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway and alleviating STAT1-induced suppression of NMDAR expressions. Based on our findings, we thought CIG might be a promising candidate for the therapy of tauopathy such as AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Olfactory impairment is a central non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have demonstrated that olfactory dysfunction is associated with mental illness and impaired cognition. The frequently investigated olfactory functions are odor detection, discrimination, and identification. However, few studies have focused on odor recognition memory (ORM). ORM tasks involves episodic memory which therefore can facilitate the detection of dementia among patients with PD and consequently adjust their treatment. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to summarize the existing research on ORM in PD. Databases and reference lists were used for data collection. Studies were included in the review if they met the eligibility criteria derived from the PICOS-framework. Quality evaluation of the studies was based on the STROBE-statement. Six studies with small samples were included in the analysis which demonstrated the scarce research on the subject. The studies targeting ORM were heterogenous and involved two main tasks: odor recognition and odor matching. The synthesis of the data demonstrated that PD patients performed significantly lower than controls on both tasks, especially on odor matching task. Only the odor recognition task exhibited a difference between patients with PD vs. Alzheimer's disease (AD). PD patients performed significantly better than AD patients. The findings based on the available limited data support the notion that odor recognition task can be of importance in identifying Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). To investigate this hypothesis, future research needs to include larger samples of PD, PDD and AD patients executing the same odor recognition task.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Addressing gender and racial-ethnic disparities at all career stages is a priority for the research community. In this article, we focus on efforts to encourage mid-career women, particularly women of color, to move into leadership positions in science and science policy. We highlight the need to strengthen leadership skills for the critical period immediately following promotion to associate/tenured professor – when formal career development efforts taper off while institutional demands escalate – and describe a program called MAVEN that has been designed to teach leadership skills to mid-career women scientists, particularly those from underrepresented groups.</content>

 Itch is an unpleasant sensation that elicits robust scratching and aversive experience. However, the identity of the cells and neural circuits that organize this information remains elusive. Here we show the necessity and sufficiency of chloroquine-activated neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) for both itch sensation and associated aversion. Further, we show that chloroquine-activated CeA neurons play important roles in itch-related comorbidities, including anxiety-like behaviors, but not in some aversive and appetitive behaviors previously ascribed to CeA neurons. RNA-sequencing of chloroquine-activated CeA neurons identified several differentially expressed genes as well as potential key signaling pathways in regulating pruritis. Finally, viral tracing experiments demonstrate that these neurons send projections to the ventral periaqueductal gray that are critical in modulation of itch. These findings reveal a cellular and circuit signature of CeA neurons orchestrating behavioral and affective responses to pruritus in mice.</content>

 At the transition from intrauterine to postnatal life, drastic alterations are mirrored by changes in cellular immunity. These changes are in part immune cell intrinsic, originate in the replacement of fetal cells, or result from global regulatory mechanisms and adaptation to changes in the tissue microenvironment. Overall, longer developmental trajectories are intersected by events related to mother-infant separation, birth cues, acquisition of microbiota and metabolic factors. Perinatal alterations particularly affect immune niches, where structures with discrete functions meet, the intestinal mucosa, epidermis and lung. Accordingly, the following questions will be addressed in this review:</content>

 T cells use their T-cell receptors (TCRs) to discriminate between lower-affinity self and higher-affinity non-self pMHC antigens. Although the discriminatory power of the TCR is widely believed to be near-perfect, technical difficulties have hampered efforts to precisely quantify it. Here, we describe a method for measuring very low TCR/pMHC affinities, and use it to measure the discriminatory power of the TCR, and the factors affecting it. We find that TCR discrimination, although enhanced compared with conventional cell-surface receptors, is imperfect: primary human T cells can respond to pMHC with affinities as low as K&lt;sub&gt;D &lt;/sub&gt;~1 mM. The kinetic proofreading mechanism fit our data, providing the first estimates of both the time delay (2.8 s) and number of biochemical steps (2.67) that are consistent with the extraordinary sensitivity of antigen recognition. Our findings explain why self pMHC frequently induce autoimmune diseases and anti-tumour responses, and suggest ways to modify TCR discrimination.</content>

 Disparate redox activities that take place beyond the bounds of the prokaryotic cell cytosol must connect to membrane or cytosolic electron pools. Proteins post-translationally flavinylated by the enzyme ApbE mediate electron transfer in several characterized extracytosolic redox systems but the breadth of functions of this modification remains unknown. Here we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of 31,910 prokaryotic genomes that provides evidence of extracytosolic ApbEs within ~50% of bacteria and the involvement of flavinylation in numerous uncharacterized biochemical processes. By mining flavinylation-associated gene clusters, we identify five protein classes responsible for transmembrane electron transfer and two domains of unknown function (DUF2271 and DUF3570) that are flavinylated by ApbE. We observe flavinylation/iron transporter gene colocalization patterns that implicate functions in iron reduction and assimilation. We find associations with characterized and uncharacterized respiratory oxidoreductases that highlight roles of flavinylation in respiratory electron transport chains. Finally, we identify interspecies gene cluster variability consistent with flavinylation/cytochrome functional redundancies and discover a class of 'multi-flavinylated proteins' that may resemble multiheme cytochromes in facilitating longer distance electron transfer. These findings provide key mechanistic insight into an important facet of bacterial physiology and establish flavinylation as a functionally diverse mediator of extracytosolic electron transfer.</content>

 The &lt;i&gt;hemibrain&lt;/i&gt; connectome provides large scale connectivity and morphology information for the majority of the central brain of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Using this data set, we provide a complete description of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; olfactory system, covering all first, second and lateral horn-associated third-order neurons. We develop a generally applicable strategy to extract information flow and layered organisation from connectome graphs, mapping olfactory input to descending interneurons. This identifies a range of motifs including highly lateralised circuits in the antennal lobe and patterns of convergence downstream of the mushroom body and lateral horn. Leveraging a second data set we provide a first quantitative assessment of inter- versus intra-individual stereotypy. Comparing neurons across two brains (three hemispheres) reveals striking similarity in neuronal morphology across brains. Connectivity correlates with morphology and neurons of the same morphological type show similar connection variability within the same brain as across two brains.</content>

 Upon exposure to harmful microorganisms, hosts engage in protective molecular and behavioral immune responses, both of which are ultimately regulated by the nervous system. Using the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, we show that ingestion of &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis &lt;/i&gt;leads to a fast pathogen avoidance behavior that results in aversive learning. We have identified multiple sensory mechanisms involved in the regulation of avoidance of &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis. &lt;/i&gt;The G-protein coupled receptor NPR-1-dependent oxygen-sensing pathway opposes this avoidance behavior, while an ASE neuron-dependent pathway and an AWB and AWC neuron-dependent pathway are directly required for avoidance. Colonization of the anterior part of the intestine by &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis &lt;/i&gt;leads to AWB and AWC mediated olfactory aversive learning. Finally, two transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) channels, GON-2 and GTL-2, mediate this newly described rapid pathogen avoidance. These results suggest a mechanism by which TRPM channels may sense the intestinal distension caused by bacterial colonization to elicit pathogen avoidance and aversive learning by detecting changes in host physiology.</content>

 Morphogenesis is governed by the interplay of molecular signals and mechanical forces across multiple length scales. The last decade has seen tremendous advances in our understanding of the dynamics of protein localization and turnover at sub-cellular length scales, and at the other end of the spectrum, of mechanics at tissue-level length scales. Integrating the two remains a challenge, however, because we lack a detailed understanding of the subcellular patterns of mechanical properties of cells within tissues. Here, in the context of the elongating body axis of &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryos, we combine tools from cell biology and physics to demonstrate that individual cell-cell junctions display finely-patterned local mechanical heterogeneity along their length. We show that such local mechanical patterning is essential for the cell movements of convergent extension and is imparted by locally patterned clustering of a classical cadherin. Finally, the patterning of cadherins and thus local mechanics along cell-cell junctions are controlled by Planar Cell Polarity signaling, a key genetic module for CE that is mutated in diverse human birth defects.</content>

 Studies in a variety of species have shown evidence for positively selected variants introduced into a population via introgression from another, distantly related population - a process known as adaptive introgression. However, there are few explicit frameworks for jointly modelling introgression and positive selection, in order to detect these variants using genomic sequence data. Here, we develop an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs do not require the specification of an analytical model of allele frequency dynamics, and have outperformed alternative methods for classification and parameter estimation tasks in various areas of population genetics. Thus, they are potentially well suited to the identification of adaptive introgression. Using simulations, we trained CNNs on genotype matrices derived from genomes sampled from the donor population, the recipient population and a related non-introgressed population, in order to distinguish regions of the genome evolving under adaptive introgression from those evolving neutrally or experiencing selective sweeps. Our CNN architecture exhibits 95% accuracy on simulated data, even when the genomes are unphased, and accuracy decreases only moderately in the presence of heterosis. As a proof of concept, we applied our trained CNNs to human genomic datasets - both phased and unphased - to detect candidates for adaptive introgression that shaped our evolutionary history.</content>

 All-optical methods for imaging and manipulating brain networks with high spatial resolution are fundamental to study how neuronal ensembles drive behavior. Stimulation of neuronal ensembles using holographic techniques requires high-sensitivity actuators to avoid photodamage and heating. Moreover, two-photon-excitable opsins should be insensitive to light at wavelengths used for imaging. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel soma-targeted variant of the large-conductance blue light-sensitive opsin CoChR (stCoChR). In the mouse cortex &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we combined holographic two-photon stimulation of stCoChR with an amplified laser tuned at the opsin absorption peak and imaging of the red-shifted indicator jRCaMP1a. Compared to previously characterized blue light-sensitive soma-targeted opsins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, stCoChR allowed neuronal stimulation with more than 10-fold lower average power and no spectral crosstalk. The combination of stCoChR, tuned amplified laser stimulation, and red-shifted functional indicators promises to be a powerful tool for large-scale interrogation of neural networks in the intact brain.</content>

 During hunger or malnutrition, animals prioritize alimentation of the brain over other organs to ensure its function and, thus, their survival. This protection, also-called brain sparing, is described from &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; to humans. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms adapting carbohydrate transport. Here, we used &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; genetics to unravel the mechanisms operating at the blood–brain barrier (BBB) under nutrient restriction. During starvation, expression of the carbohydrate transporter Tret1-1 is increased to provide more efficient carbohydrate uptake. Two mechanisms are responsible for this increase. Similar to the regulation of mammalian GLUT4, Rab-dependent intracellular shuttling is needed for Tret1-1 integration into the plasma membrane; even though Tret1-1 regulation is independent of insulin signaling. In addition, starvation induces transcriptional upregulation that is controlled by TGF-β signaling.

 Endothelial cells (ECs) are key players in the development and maintenance of the vascular tree, the establishment of the blood brain barrier and control of blood flow. Disruption in ECs is an early and active component of vascular pathogenesis. However, our ability to selectively target ECs in the CNS for identification and manipulation is limited. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we utilized a recently developed AAV-BR1 system to identify distinct classes of ECs along the vascular tree using a GFP reporter. We then developed an inducible EC-specific ectopic Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression system using AAV-BR1-CAG-DIO-Cx43-P2A-DsRed2 in combination with a mouse line carrying inducible CreERT2 in ECs. We targeted Cx43 because its loss has been implicated in microvascular impariment in numerous diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular edema. GFP-labeled ECs were numerous, evenly distributed along the vascular tree and their morphology was polarized with respect to the direction of blood flow. After tamoxifen induction, ectopic Cx43 was specifically expressed in ECs. Similarly to endogenous Cx43, ectopic Cx43 was localized at the membrane contacts of ECs and it did not affect tight junction proteins. The ability to enhance gap junctions in ECs provides a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, an early pathology in numerous diseases.</content>

 Endogenous adenosine plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis and adenosine levels are tightly regulated across neural circuits. In the dorsal medial striatum (DMS) adenosine inhibits neurotransmitter release, but the source and mechanism underlying its accumulation are largely unknown. Opioids also inhibit neurotransmitter release in the DMS and influences adenosine accumulation after prolonged exposure. However, how these two neurotransmitter systems interact acutely is also largely unknown. This study demonstrates that activation of mu opioid receptors (MORs), but not delta opioid receptors (DORs) or kappa opioid receptors (KORs), inhibits tonic activation of adenosine A1Rs via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent mechanism in both male and female mice. Further, selectively knocking-out MORs from presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) revealed that activation of MORs on D1R positive MSNs, but not D2R positive MSNs, is necessary to inhibit tonic adenosine signaling on presynaptic terminals. Given the role of D1R positive MSNs in movement and motivated behaviors, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which these neurons regulate their own synaptic inputs.</content>

 Satellite glia are the major glial type found in ganglia of the peripheral nervous system and wrap around cell bodies of sympathetic and sensory neurons that are very diverse. Other than their close physical association with peripheral neurons, little is known about this glial population. Here, we performed single cell RNA sequencing analysis and identified five different populations of satellite glia from sympathetic and sensory ganglia. We identified three shared populations of satellite glia enriched in immune-response genes, immediate-early genes and ion channels/ECM-interactors, respectively. Sensory- and sympathetic-specific satellite glia are differentially enriched for modulators of lipid synthesis and metabolism. Sensory glia are also specifically enriched for genes involved in glutamate turnover. Further, satellite glia and Schwann cells can be distinguished by unique transcriptional signatures. This study reveals remarkable heterogeneity of satellite glia in the peripheral nervous system.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in SETD1A, which encodes a subunit of histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, have been shown to cause a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome and increase the risk for schizophrenia. To study the effect of decreased SETD1A function in human cells, we generated excitatory/inhibitory neuronal networks from human induced pluripotent stem cells with a SETD1A heterozygous LoF mutation (SETD1A+/-). Our data show that SETD1A haploinsufficiency resulted in altered neuronal network activity, which was mainly characterized by an overly synchronized network. In individual neurons, this network phenotype was reflected by increased somatodendritic complexity and elevated synaptic connectivity. We found that this network phenotype was driven by SETD1A haploinsufficiency in glutamatergic neurons. In accordance with the functional changes, transcriptomic profiling revealed perturbations in gene sets associated with schizophrenia, synaptic transmission and glutamatergic synaptic function. At the molecular level, we identified specific changes in the cAMP/PKA pathway pointing toward a hyperactive cAMP pathway in SETD1A+/- neurons. Finally, using pharmacological experiments targeting the cAMP pathway we were able to rescue the network deficits in SETD1A+/- cultures. In conclusion, our results illuminate key molecular, cellular and network abnormalities caused by SETD1A haploinsufficiency and demonstrate a direct link between SETD1A and the cAMP-dependent pathway in human neurons.</content>

		<content type="html">
 An isotropic dynamical system is one that looks the same in every direction, i.e., if we imagine standing somewhere within an isotropic system, we would not be able to differentiate between different lines of sight. Conversely, anisotropy is a measure of the extent to which a system deviates from perfect isotropy, with larger values indicating greater discrepancies between the structure of the system along its axes. Here, we derive the form of a generalised scalable (mechanically similar) discretized field theoretic Lagrangian that allows for levels of anisotropy to be directly estimated via timeseries of arbitrary dimensionality. We generate synthetic data for both isotropic and anisotropic systems and, by using Bayesian model inversion and reduction, show that we can discriminate between the two datasets - thereby demonstrating proof of principle. We then apply this methodology to murine calcium imaging data collected in rest and task states, showing that anisotropy can be estimated directly from different brain states and cortical regions in an empirical in vivo biological setting. We hope that this theoretical foundation, together with the methodology and publicly available MATLAB code, will provide an accessible way for researchers to obtain new insight into the structural organization of neural systems in terms of how scalable neural regions grow - both ontogenetically during the development of an individual organism, as well as phylogenetically across species.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Chronic adversity in early childhood is associated with increased anxiety and a propensity for substance abuse later in adulthood, yet the effects of early life stress (ELS) on brain development remains poorly understood. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a powerful model for studying neurodevelopment and stress. Here, we describe a zebrafish model of ELS and identify a role for glucocorticoid signaling during a critical window in development that leads to long-term changes in brain function. Larval fish subjected to chronic stress in early development exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and elevated glucocorticoid levels later in life. Increased stress-like behavior was only observed when fish were subjected to ELS within a precise time window in early development, revealing a temporal critical window of sensitivity. Moreover, enhanced anxiety-like behavior only emerges after two months post-ELS, revealing a developmentally specified delay in the effects of ELS. ELS leads to increased levels of baseline cortisol, and resulted in a dysregulation of cortisol receptors, suggesting long-term effects on cortisol signaling. Together, these findings reveal a critical window for ELS to affect developmental reprogramming of the glucocorticoid receptor pathway, resulting in chronic elevated stress.</content>

 Objective
To examine the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke with cancer.


Methods
We conducted a prospective cross‐sectional study from 2016‐2020 at two hospitals. We enrolled three groups of 50 adult participants each. The main group included patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. The control groups included patients with acute ischemic stroke only or active cancer only. The stroke‐only and cancer‐only patients were matched to the cancer‐plus‐stroke patients by age, sex, and cancer type, if applicable. The outcomes were prespecified hematological biomarkers and transcranial Doppler microemboli detection. Hematological biomarkers included markers of coagulation (D‐dimer, thrombin‐antithrombin), platelet function (P‐selectin), and endothelial integrity (thrombomodulin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 [sICAM‐1], soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 [sVCAM‐1]). Hematological biomarkers were compared between groups using the Kruskal‐Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum tests. In multivariable linear regression models, we adjusted for race, number of stroke risk factors, smoking, stroke severity, and antithrombotic use. Transcranial Doppler microemboli presence was compared between groups using Chi‐square tests.


Results
Levels of all study biomarkers were different between groups. In univariate between‐group comparisons, cancer‐plus‐stroke participants had higher levels of D‐dimer, sICAM‐1, sVCAM‐1, and thrombomodulin than both control groups; higher levels of thrombin‐antithrombin than cancer‐only participants; and higher levels of P‐selectin than stroke‐only participants. Findings were similar in multivariable analyses. Transcranial Doppler microemboli were detected in 32% of cancer‐plus‐stroke participants, 16% of stroke‐only participants, and 6% of cancer‐only participants (p=0.005).


Interpretation
Patients with cancer‐related stroke have higher markers of coagulation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction, and more circulating microemboli, than matched controls.

Sequence-based residue contact prediction plays a crucial role in protein structure reconstruction. In recent years, the combination of evolutionary coupling analysis (ECA) and deep learning (DL) techniques has made tremendous progress for residue contact prediction, thus a comprehensive assessment of current methods based on a large-scale benchmark data set is very needed. In this study, we evaluate 18 contact predictors on 610 non-redundant proteins and 32 CASP13 targets according to a wide range of perspectives. The results show that different methods have different application scenarios: (1) DL methods based on multi-categories of inputs and large training sets are the best choices for low-contact-density proteins such as the intrinsically disordered ones and proteins with shallow multi-sequence alignments (MSAs). (2) With at least 5L (L is sequence length) effective sequences in the MSA, all the methods show the best performance, and methods that rely only on MSA as input can reach comparable achievements as methods that adopt multi-source inputs. (3) For top L/5 and L/2 predictions, DL methods can predict more hydrophobic interactions while ECA methods predict more salt bridges and disulfide bonds. (4) ECA methods can detect more secondary structure interactions, while DL methods can accurately excavate more contact patterns and prune isolated false positives. In general, multi-input DL methods with large training sets dominate current approaches with the best overall performance. Despite the great success of current DL methods must be stated the fact that there is still much room left for further improvement: (1) With shallow MSAs, the performance will be greatly affected. (2) Current methods show lower precisions for inter-domain compared with intra-domain contact predictions, as well as very high imbalances in precisions for intra-domains. (3) Strong prediction similarities between DL methods indicating more feature types and diversified models need to be developed. (4) The runtime of most methods can be further optimized.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/siLP2VRCLOM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Synaptic clustering on neuronal dendrites has been hypothesized to play an important role in implementing pattern recognition. Neighboring synapses on a dendritic branch can interact in a synergistic, cooperative manner via nonlinear voltage-dependent mechanisms, such as NMDA receptors. Inspired by the NMDA receptor, the single-branch clusteron learning algorithm takes advantage of location-dependent multiplicative nonlinearities to solve classification tasks by randomly shuffling the locations of “under-performing” synapses on a model dendrite during learning (“structural plasticity”), eventually resulting in synapses with correlated activity being placed next to each other on the dendrite. We propose an alternative model, the gradient clusteron, or G-clusteron, which uses an analytically-derived gradient descent rule where synapses are &quot;attracted to&quot; or &quot;repelled from&quot; each other in an input- and location-dependent manner. We demonstrate the classification ability of this algorithm by testing it on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and show that, when using a softmax activation function, the accuracy of the G-clusteron on the all-versus-all MNIST task (~85%) approaches that of logistic regression (~93%). In addition to the location update rule, we also derive a learning rule for the synaptic weights of the G-clusteron (“functional plasticity”) and show that a G-clusteron that utilizes the weight update rule can achieve ~89% accuracy on the MNIST task. We also show that a G-clusteron with both the weight and location update rules can learn to solve the XOR problem from arbitrary initial conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KRXrTXsT_Mo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

An interesting problem for the human saccadic eye-movement system is how to deal with the degrees-of-freedom problem: the six extra-ocular muscles provide three rotational degrees of freedom, while only two are needed to point gaze at any direction. Measurements show that 3D eye orientations during head-fixed saccades in far-viewing conditions lie in Listing’s plane (LP), in which the eye’s cyclotorsion is zero (Listing’s law, LL). Moreover, while saccades are executed as single-axis rotations around a stable eye-angular velocity axis, they follow straight trajectories in LP. Another distinctive saccade property is their nonlinear main-sequence dynamics: the affine relationship between saccade size and movement duration, and the saturation of peak velocity with amplitude. To explain all these properties, we developed a computational model, based on a simplified and upscaled robotic prototype of an eye with 3 degrees of freedom, driven by three independent motor commands, coupled to three antagonistic elastic muscle pairs. As the robotic prototype was not intended to faithfully mimic the detailed biomechanics of the human eye, we did not impose specific prior mechanical constraints on the ocular plant that could, by themselves, generate Listing’s law and the main-sequence. Instead, our goal was to study how these properties can emerge from the application of optimal control principles to simplified eye models. We performed a numerical linearization of the nonlinear system dynamics around the origin using system identification techniques, and developed open-loop controllers for 3D saccade generation. Applying optimal control to the simulated model, could reproduce both Listing’s law and and the main-sequence. We verified the contribution of different terms in the cost optimization functional to realistic 3D saccade behavior, and identified four essential terms: total energy expenditure by the motors, movement duration, gaze accuracy, and the total static force exerted by the muscles during fixation. Our findings suggest that Listing’s law, as well as the saccade dynamics and their trajectories, may all emerge from the same common mechanism that aims to optimize speed-accuracy trade-off for saccades, while minimizing the total muscle force during eccentric fixation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7nEB9fufRJw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We contrast two computational models of sequence learning. The associative learner posits that learning proceeds by strengthening existing association weights. Alternatively, recoding posits that learning creates new and more efficient representations of the learned sequences. Importantly, both models propose that humans act as optimal learners but capture different statistics of the stimuli in their internal model. Furthermore, these models make dissociable predictions as to how learning changes the neural representation of sequences. We tested these predictions by using fMRI to extract neural activity patters from the dorsal visual processing stream during a sequence recall task. We observed that only the recoding account can explain the similarity of neural activity patterns, suggesting that participants recode the learned sequences using chunks. We show that associative learning can theoretically store only very limited number of overlapping sequences, such as common in ecological working memory tasks, and hence an efficient learner should recode initial sequence representations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s2L3TsNT71U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Coevolution-based contact prediction, either directly by coevolutionary couplings resulting from global statistical sequence models or using structural supervision and deep learning, has found widespread application in protein-structure prediction from sequence. However, one of the basic assumptions in global statistical modeling is that sequences form an at least approximately independent sample of an unknown probability distribution, which is to be learned from data. In the case of protein families, this assumption is obviously violated by phylogenetic relations between protein sequences. It has turned out to be notoriously difficult to take phylogenetic correlations into account in coevolutionary model learning. Here, we propose a complementary approach: we develop strategies to randomize or resample sequence data, such that conservation patterns and phylogenetic relations are preserved, while intrinsic (i.e. structure- or function-based) coevolutionary couplings are removed. A comparison between the results of Direct Coupling Analysis applied to real and to resampled data shows that the largest coevolutionary couplings, i.e. those used for contact prediction, are only weakly influenced by phylogeny. However, the phylogeny-induced spurious couplings in the resampled data are compatible in size with the first false-positive contact predictions from real data. Dissecting functional from phylogeny-induced couplings might therefore extend accurate contact predictions to the range of intermediate-size couplings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rZ6uKv1LSrQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

During cell migration in confinement, the nucleus has to deform for a cell to pass through small constrictions. Such nuclear deformations require significant forces. A direct experimental measure of the deformation force field is extremely challenging. However, experimental images of nuclear shape are relatively easy to obtain. Therefore, here we present a method to calculate predictions of the deformation force field based purely on analysis of experimental images of nuclei before and after deformation. Such an inverse calculation is technically non-trivial and relies on a mechanical model for the nucleus. Here we compare two simple continuum elastic models of a cell nucleus undergoing deformation. In the first, we treat the nucleus as a homogeneous elastic solid and, in the second, as an elastic shell. For each of these models we calculate the force field required to produce the deformation given by experimental images of nuclei in dendritic cells migrating in microchannels with constrictions of controlled dimensions. These microfabricated channels provide a simplified confined environment mimicking that experienced by cells in tissues. Our calculations predict the forces felt by a deforming nucleus as a migrating cell encounters a constriction. Since a direct experimental measure of the deformation force field is very challenging and has not yet been achieved, our numerical approaches can make important predictions motivating further experiments, even though all the parameters are not yet available. We demonstrate the power of our method by showing how it predicts lateral forces corresponding to actin polymerisation around the nucleus, providing evidence for actin generated forces squeezing the sides of the nucleus as it enters a constriction. In addition, the algorithm we have developed could be adapted to analyse experimental images of deformation in other situations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VFNS8Ql34z4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genome-scale metabolic modeling is an important tool in the study of metabolism by enhancing the collation of knowledge, interpretation of data, and prediction of metabolic capabilities. A frequent assumption in the use of genome-scale models is that the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; organism is evolved for optimal growth, where growth is represented by flux through a biomass objective function (BOF). While the specific composition of the BOF is crucial, its formulation is often inherited from similar organisms due to the experimental challenges associated with its proper determination.
A cell’s macro-molecular composition is not fixed and it responds to changes in environmental conditions. As a consequence, initiatives for the high-fidelity determination of cellular biomass composition have been launched. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical and computational framework capable of using multiple measurements of cellular biomass composition in different environments. Here, we propose two different computational approaches for directly addressing this challenge: Biomass Trade-off Weighting (BTW) and Higher-dimensional-plane InterPolation (HIP).
In lieu of experimental data on biomass composition-variation in response to changing nutrient environment, we assess the properties of BTW and HIP using three hypothetical, yet biologically plausible, BOFs for the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genome-scale metabolic model &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;ML1515. We find that the BTW and HIP formulations have a significant impact on model performance and phenotypes. Furthermore, the BTW method generates larger growth rates in all environments when compared to HIP. Using acetate secretion and the respiratory quotient as proxies for phenotypic changes, we find marked differences between the methods as HIP generates BOFs more similar to a reference BOF than BTW. We conclude that the presented methods constitute a conceptual step in developing genome-scale metabolic modelling approaches capable of addressing the inherent dependence of cellular biomass composition on nutrient environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a4MWgD3TmqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Objective
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Men are on average ~ 1.5 times more likely to develop PD compared to women with European ancestry. Over the years, genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors for PD, however, it is unclear whether genetics contribute to disease etiology in a sex‐specific manner.


Methods
In an effort to study sex‐specific genetic factors associated with PD, we explored 2 large genetic datasets from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank consisting of 13,020 male PD cases, 7,936 paternal proxy cases, 89,660 male controls, 7,947 female PD cases, 5,473 maternal proxy cases, and 90,662 female controls. We performed GWAS meta‐analyses to identify distinct patterns of genetic risk contributing to disease in male versus female PD cases.


Results
In total, 19 genomewide significant regions were identified and no sex‐specific effects were observed. A high genetic correlation between the male and female PD GWAS were identified (rg = 0.877) and heritability estimates were identical between male and female PD cases (~ 20%).


Interpretation
We did not detect any significant genetic differences between male or female PD cases. Our study does not support the notion that common genetic variation on the autosomes could explain the difference in prevalence of PD between males and females cases at least when considering the current sample size under study. Further studies are warranted to investigate the genetic architecture of PD explained by X and Y chromosomes and further evaluate environmental effects that could potentially contribute to PD etiology in male versus female patients.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In 2006, during a meeting of a working group of scientists in La Jolla,
California at The Neurosciences Institute (NSI), Gerald Edelman described a
roadmap towards the creation of a Conscious Artifact. As far as I know, this
roadmap was not published. However, it did shape my thinking and that of many
others in the years since that meeting. This short paper, which is based on my
notes taken during the meeting, describes the key steps in this roadmap. I
believe it is as groundbreaking today as it was more than 15 years ago.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We design multi-horizon forecasting models for limit order book (LOB) data by
using deep learning techniques. Unlike standard structures where a single
prediction is made, we adopt encoder-decoder models with sequence-to-sequence
and Attention mechanisms, to generate a forecasting path. Our methods achieve
comparable performance to state-of-art algorithms at short prediction horizons.
Importantly, they outperform when generating predictions over long horizons by
leveraging the multi-horizon setup. Given that encoder-decoder models rely on
recurrent neural layers, they generally suffer from a slow training process. To
remedy this, we experiment with utilising novel hardware, so-called Intelligent
Processing Units (IPUs) produced by Graphcore. IPUs are specifically designed
for machine intelligence workload with the aim to speed up the computation
process. We show that in our setup this leads to significantly faster training
times when compared to training models with GPUs.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10415"/>
		<id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10415</id>
		<updated>2021-05-24T01:30:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We analyse the dynamics of the improved discretised version of the well known
Izhikevich neuronmodel under the action of external electromagnetic field. It
is found that the three-dimensional IZHmap shows rich dynamics. With the
variation of the electromagnetic field, period-doubling routeto chaos in a
repeating fashion is observed from the bifurcation diagram. Even the forward
andbackward continuation bifurcation diagram which do not completely overlap
suggests that there is multistability in the system. The phenomenon of
bistability (coexistence of periodic and chaotic attractors) is observed. The
presence of periodic and chaotic attractor is aided by the maximal Lyapunov
exponent diagram. The Lyapunov phase diagram of electromagnetic field and
synapses current shows a large parameter region of chaotic and periodic
behaviors with the presence of unbounded regions as well. The IZH map shows a
plethora of spiking and bursting patterns such as mixed-mode patterns, tonic
spiking, phasic spiking, steady spikes, regular spikes, spike bursting,
periodic bursting, phasic bursting, chaotic firing, etc with the variation of
electromagnetic coupling strength and the synapses current. We also investigate
the presence of chimera states in a ring-star, ring, star network of IZH map
neurons. Chimera states are found in the case of ring-star and ring network
while synchronised clusters were found in the case of star network and are
aided by the spatiotemporal plots, space-time plot, recurrence plots. The rich
dynamics shown by the discretised IZH map makes it a promising research model
to study about neurodynamics.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Modern electronic design automation (EDA) tools can handle the complexity of
state-of-the-art electronic systems by decomposing them into smaller blocks or
cells, introducing different levels of abstraction and staged design flows.
However, throughout each independent-optimised design step, overhead and
inefficiency can accumulate in the resulting overall design. Performing
design-specific optimisation from a more global viewpoint requires more time
due to the larger search space, but has the potential to provide solutions with
improved performance. In this work, a fully-automated, multi-objective (MO) EDA
flow is introduced to address this issue. It specifically tunes drive strength
mapping, preceding physical implementation, through multi-objective
population-based search algorithms. Designs are evaluated with respect to their
power, performance and area (PPA). The proposed approach is capable of
expanding the design space, offering a set of Pareto-optimised trade-off
solutions for different case-specific utilisation. We have applied the proposed
MOEDA framework to ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits using a commercial 65nm standard
cell library. The experimental results demonstrate how the MOEDA flow enhances
the solutions initially generated by the standard digital flow, and how
simultaneously a significant improvement in PPA metrics is achieved.

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To characterize patients with acute ischemic stroke related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess the classification performance of clinical and laboratory parameters in predicting in-hospital outcome of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the setting of the STROKOVID study including patients with acute ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to the ten hub hospitals in Lombardy, Italy, between March 8 and April 30, 2020, we compared clinical features of patients with confirmed infection and non-infected patients by logistic regression models and survival analysis. Then, we trained and tested a random forest (RF) binary classifier for the prediction of in-hospital death among patients with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Among 1013 patients, 160 (15.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06–2.27) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.05–2.43) were independently associated with COVID-19 status. Patients with COVID-19 had increased stroke severity at admission [median NIHSS score, 9 (25th to75th percentile, 13) vs 6 (25th to75th percentile, 9)] and increased risk of in-hospital death (38.1% deaths vs 7.2%; HR 3.30; 95% CI 2.17–5.02). The RF model based on six clinical and laboratory parameters exhibited high cross-validated classification accuracy (0.86) and precision (0.87), good recall (0.72) and F1-score (0.79) in predicting in-hospital death.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ischemic strokes in COVID-19 patients have distinctive risk factor profile and etiology, increased clinical severity and higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to non-COVID-19 patients. A simple model based on clinical and routine laboratory parameters may be useful in identifying ischemic stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are unlikely to survive the acute phase.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Hierarchical counterstream via feedforward and feedback interactions is a major organizing principle of the cerebral cortex. The counterstream, as a topological feature of the network of cortical areas, is captured by the convergence and divergence of paths through directed links. So defined, the convergence degree (CD) reveals the reciprocal nature of forward and backward connections, and also hierarchically relevant integrative properties of areas through their inward and outward connections. We asked if topology shapes large-scale cortical functioning by studying the role of CD in network resilience and Granger causal coupling in a model of hierarchical network dynamics. Our results indicate that topological synchronizability is highly vulnerable to attacking edges based on CD, while global network efficiency depends mostly on edge betweenness, a measure of the connectedness of a link. Furthermore, similar to anatomical hierarchy determined by the laminar distribution of connections, CD highly correlated with causal coupling in feedforward gamma, and feedback alpha-beta band synchronizations in a well-studied subnetwork, including low-level visual cortical areas. In contrast, causal coupling did not correlate with edge betweenness. Considering the entire network, the CD-based hierarchy correlated well with both the anatomical and functional hierarchy for low-level areas that are far apart in the hierarchy. Conversely, in a large part of the anatomical network where hierarchical distances are small between the areas, the correlations were not significant. These findings suggest that CD-based and functional hierarchies are interrelated in low-level processing in the visual cortex. Our results are consistent with the idea that the interplay of multiple hierarchical features forms the basis of flexible functional cortical interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Invaginating structures are common in the synapses of most animals. However, the details of these invaginating structures remain understudied in part because they are not well resolved in light microscopy and were often misidentified in early electron microscope (EM) studies. Utilizing experimental techniques along with the latest advances in microscopy, such as focused ion beam-scanning EM (FIB-SEM), evidence is gradually building to suggest that the synaptic invaginating structures contribute to synapse development, maintenance, and plasticity. These invaginating structures are most elaborate in synapses mediating rapid integration of signals, such as muscle contraction, mechanoreception, and vision. Here we argue that the synaptic invaginations should be considered in future studies seeking to understand their role in sensory integration and coordination, learning, and memory. We review the various types of invaginating structures in the synapses and discuss their potential functions. We also present several new examples of invaginating structures from a variety of animals including Drosophila and mice, mainly using FIB-SEM, with which we trace the form and arrangement of these structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is critically involved in the formation of associative fear memory and in subsequent extinction learning. Fear conditioning is associated with a long-term potentiation at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses onto Purkinje cells. We therefore tested whether fear conditioning unmasks novel forms of synaptic plasticity, which enable subsequent extinction learning to reset cerebellar circuitry. We found that fear learning enhanced GABA release from molecular layer interneurons and this was reversed after fear extinction learning. Importantly an extinction-like stimulation of parallel fibers after fear learning is sufficient to induce a lasting decrease in inhibitory transmission (I-LTD&lt;sub&gt;stim&lt;/sub&gt;) in the cerebellar cortex, a form of plasticity that is absent in naïve animals. While NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are required for the formation and extinction of associative memory, the role of GluN2D, one of the four major NMDA receptor subunits, in learning and memory has not been determined. We found that fear conditioning elevates spontaneous GABA release in GluN2D KO as shown in WT mice. Deletion of GluN2D, however, abolished the I-LTD&lt;sub&gt;stim&lt;/sub&gt; induced by parallel fiber stimulation after learning. At the behavioral level, genetic deletion of GluN2D subunits did not affect associative learning and memory retention, but impaired subsequent fear extinction learning. D-cycloserine, a partial NMDA receptor (NMDAR) agonist, failed to rescue extinction learning in mutant mice. Our results identify GluN2D as a critical NMDAR subunit for extinction learning and reveal a form of GluN2D-dependent metaplasticity that is associated with extinction in the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cochlin is the most abundant protein in the inner ear. To study its function in response to noise trauma, we exposed adolescent wild-type (Coch&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) and cochlin knock-out (Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice to noise (8–16 kHz, 103 dB SPL, 2 h) that causes a permanent threshold shift and hair cell loss. Two weeks after noise exposure, Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice had substantially less elevation in noise-induced auditory thresholds and hair cell loss than Coch&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, consistent with cochlin deficiency providing protection from noise trauma. Comparison of pre-noise exposure thresholds of auditory brain stem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice and Coch&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; littermates revealed a small and significant elevation in thresholds of Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, overall consistent with a small conductive hearing loss in Coch&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We show quantitatively that the pro-inflammatory component of cochlin, LCCL, is upregulated after noise exposure in perilymph of wild-type mice compared to unexposed mice, as is the enzyme catalyzing LCCL release, aggrecanase1, encoded by Adamts4. We further show that upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in perilymph and cochlear soft-tissue after noise exposure is lower in cochlin knock-out than wild-type mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that cochlin deficiency results in conductive hearing loss that protects against physiologic and molecular effects of noise trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly and is the most common type of dementia. AD is mostly gradual onset, and involves slow, progressive mental decline, accompanied by personality changes; the incidence of AD gradually increases with age. The etiology of AD is unknown, although it is currently believed to be related to abnormal deposition of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the brain, hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau, and the release of various cytokines, complements, activators and chemokines by cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of highly conserved non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and manipulate the functions of intracellular proteins and physiological processes. Emerging studies have shown that miRNA plays an important role in regulating AD-related genes. MiR-132 is known as “NeurimmiR” due to its involvement in numerous neurophysiological and pathological processes. Accumulating pre-clinical results suggest that miR-132 may be involved in the progression of Aβ and tau pathology. Moreover, clinical studies have indicated that decreased circulating miR-132 levels could be used a potential diagnostic biomarker in AD. Here, we review the pathogenic role of miR-132 activity in AD, and the potential of targeting miR-132 for developing future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Rbfox1 is a multifunctional RNA binding protein that regulates alternative splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and translation. Its roles in neurogenesis and neuronal functions are well established. Recent studies also implicate Rbfox1 in the regulation of gene networks that support cell survival during stress. We have earlier characterized the expression of Rbfox1 in amacrine and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and showed that deletion of Rbfox1 in adult animals results in depth perception deficiency. The current study investigates the effect of Rbfox1 downregulation on survival of RGCs injured by optic nerve crush (ONC). Seven days after ONC, animals sustained severe degeneration of RGC axons in the optic nerve and significant loss of RGC somas. Semi-quantitative grading of optic nerve damage in control + ONC, control + tamoxifen + ONC, and Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; + ONC groups ranged from 4.6 to 4.8 on a scale of 1 (normal; no degenerated axons were noted) to 5 (total degeneration; all axons showed degenerated organelles, axonal content, and myelin sheath), indicating a severe degeneration. Among these three ONC groups, no statistical significance was observed when any two groups were compared. The number of RGC somas were quantitatively analyzed in superior, inferior, nasal and temporal retinal quadrants at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mm from the center of the optic disc. The average RGC densities (cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were: control 6,438 ± 1,203; control + ONC 2,779 ± 573; control + tamoxifen 6,163 ± 861; control + tamoxifen + ONC 2,573 ± 555; Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; 6,437 ± 893; and Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; + ONC 2,537 ± 526. The RGC loss in control + ONC, control + tamoxifen + ONC and Rbfox1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; + ONC was 57% (P = 1.44954E-42), 58% (P = 1.37543E-57) and 61% (P = 5.552E-59) compared to RGC numbers in the relevant uninjured groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between any two groups of uninjured animals or between any two ONC groups. Our data indicate that Rbfox1-mediated pathways have no effect on survival of RGCs injured by ONC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The identification of neurological diseases in their presymptomatic phase will be a fundamental aim in the coming years. This step is necessary both to optimize early diagnostics and to verify the effectiveness of experimental disease modifying drugs in the early stages of diseases. Among the biomarkers that can detect neurological diseases already in their preclinical phase, neurofilament light chain (NfL) has given the most promising results. Recently, its measurement in serum has enabled the identification of neurodegeneration in diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) up to 6–10 years before the onset of symptoms. Similar results have been obtained in conditions such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), up to 2 years before clinical onset. Study of the longitudinal dynamics of serum NfL has also revealed interesting aspects of the pathophysiology of these diseases in the preclinical phase. This review sought to discuss these very recent findings on serum NfL in the presymptomatic phase of neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As a type of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-dependent deacetylases, sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is predominantly found in the cytoplasm of cells in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting its potential role in neurological disorders. Though SIRT2 is generally acknowledged to accelerate the development of neurological pathologies, it protects the brain from deterioration in certain circumstances. This review summarized the complex roles SIRT2 plays in the pathophysiology of diverse neurological disorders, compared and analyzed the discrete roles of SIRT2 in different conditions, and provided possible explanations for its paradoxical functions. In the future, the rapid growth in SIRT2 research may clarify its impacts on neurological disorders and develop therapeutic strategies targeting this protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objects: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of in-bed wearable elbow robot training for motor recovery in patients with early and late subacute stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eleven in-patient stroke survivors (male/female: 7/4, age: 50.7 ± 10.6 years, post-stroke duration: 2.6 ± 1.9 months) received 15 sessions of training over about 4 weeks of hospital stay. During each hourly training, participants received passive stretching and active movement training with motivating games using a wearable elbow rehabilitation robot. Isometric maximum muscle strength (MVC) of elbow flexors and extensors was evaluated using the robot at the beginning and end of each training session. Clinical measures including Fugl-Meyer Assessment of upper extremity (FMA-UE), Motricity Index (MI) for upper extremities, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) were measured at baseline, after the 4-week training program, and at a 1-month follow-up. The muscle strength recovery curve over the training period was characterized as a logarithmic learning curve with three parameters (i.e., initial muscle strength, rate of improvement, and number of the training session).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: At the baseline, participants had moderate to severe upper limb motor impairment {FMA-UE [median (interquartile range)]: 28 (18–45)} and mild spasticity in elbow flexors {MAS [median (interquartile range)]: 0 (0–1)}. After about 4 weeks of training, significant improvements were observed in FMA-UE (p = 0.003) and MI (p = 0.005), and the improvements were sustained at the follow-up. The elbow flexors MVC significantly increased by 1.93 Nm (95% CI: 0.93 to 2.93 Nm, p = 0.017) and the elbow extensor MVC increased by 0.68 Nm (95% CI: 0.05 to 1.98 Nm, p = 0.036). Muscle strength recovery curve showed that patients with severe upper limb motor impairment had a greater improvement rate in elbow flexor strength than those with moderate motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In-bed wearable elbow robotic rehabilitation is feasible and effective in improving biomechanical and clinical outcomes for early and late subacute stroke in-patients. Results from the pilot study suggested that patients with severe upper limb motor impairment may benefit more from the robot training compared to those with moderate impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In recent years, event-based sensors have been combined with spiking neural networks (SNNs) to create a new generation of bio-inspired artificial vision systems. These systems can process spatio-temporal data in real time, and are highly energy efficient. In this study, we used a new hybrid event-based camera in conjunction with a multi-layer spiking neural network trained with a spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule. We showed that neurons learn from repeated and correlated spatio-temporal patterns in an unsupervised way and become selective to motion features, such as direction and speed. This motion selectivity can then be used to predict ball trajectory by adding a simple read-out layer composed of polynomial regressions, and trained in a supervised manner. Hence, we show that a SNN receiving inputs from an event-based sensor can extract relevant spatio-temporal patterns to process and predict ball trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks with associative memory properties are typically based on fixed-point dynamics, which is fundamentally distinct from the oscillatory dynamics of the brain. There have been proposals for oscillatory associative memories, but here too, in the majority of cases, only binary patterns are stored as oscillatory states in the network. Oscillatory neural network models typically operate at a single/common frequency. At multiple frequencies, even a pair of oscillators with real coupling exhibits rich dynamics of Arnold tongues, not easily harnessed to achieve reliable memory storage and retrieval. Since real brain dynamics comprises of a wide range of spectral components, there is a need for oscillatory neural network models that operate at multiple frequencies. We propose an oscillatory neural network that can model multiple time series simultaneously by performing a Fourier-like decomposition of the signals. We show that these enhanced properties of a network of Hopf oscillators become possible by operating in the complex-variable domain. In this model, the single neural oscillator is modeled as a Hopf oscillator, with adaptive frequency and dynamics described over the complex domain. We propose a novel form of coupling, dubbed “power coupling,” between complex Hopf oscillators. With power coupling, expressed naturally only in the complex-variable domain, it is possible to achieve stable (normalized) phase relationships in a network of multifrequency oscillators. Network connections are trained either by Hebb-like learning or by delta rule, adapted to the complex domain. The network is capable of modeling N-channel electroencephalogram time series with high accuracy and shows the potential as an effective model of large-scale brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor, psychiatric, and cognitive abnormalities. Neurodegeneration is prominently observed in the striatum where GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN) are the most affected neuronal population. Interestingly, recent reports of pathological changes in HD patient striatal tissue have identified a significant reduction in the number of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons which becomes more robust in tissues of higher disease grade. Analysis of other interneuron populations, including somatostatin, calretinin, and cholinergic, did not reveal significant neurodegeneration. Electrophysiological experiments in BACHD mice have identified significant changes in the properties of parvalbumin and somatostatin expressing interneurons in the striatum. Furthermore, their interactions with MSNs are altered as the mHTT expressing mouse models age with increased input onto MSNs from striatal somatostatin and parvalbumin-expressing neurons. In order to determine whether BACHD mice recapitulate the alterations in striatal interneuron number as observed in HD patients, we analyzed the number of striatal parvalbumin, somatostatin, calretinin, and choline acetyltransferase positive cells in symptomatic 12–14 month-old mice by immunofluorescent labeling. We observed a significant decrease in the number of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons as well as a decrease in the area and perimeter of these cells. No significant changes were observed for somatostatin, calretinin, or cholinergic interneuron numbers while a significant decrease was observed for the area of cholinergic interneurons. Thus, the BACHD mice recapitulate the degenerative phenotype observed in the parvalbumin interneurons in HD patient striata without affecting the number of other interneuron populations in the striatum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The presubiculum, a subarea of the parahippocampal region, plays a critical role in spatial navigation and spatial representation. An outstanding aspect of presubicular spatial codes is head-direction selectivity of the firing of excitatory neurons, called head-direction cells. Head-direction selectivity emerges before eye-opening in rodents and is maintained in adulthood through neurophysiological interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Although the presubiculum has been physiologically profiled in terms of spatial representation during development, the histological characteristics of the developing presubiculum are poorly understood. We found that the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) could be used to delimit the superficial layers of the presubiculum, which was identified using an anterograde tracer injected into the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN). Thus, we immunostained slices from mice ranging in age from neonates to adults using an antibody against VGluT2 to evaluate the VGluT2-positive area, which was identified as the superficial layers of the presubiculum, during development. We also immunostained the slices using antibodies against parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) and found that in the presubicular superficial layers, PV-positive neurons progressively increased in number during development, whereas SOM-positive neurons exhibited no increasing trend. In addition, we observed repeating patch structures in presubicular layer III from postnatal days 12. The abundant expression of VGluT2 suggests that the presubicular superficial layers are regulated primarily by VGluT2-mediated excitatory neurotransmission. Moreover, developmental changes in the densities of PV- and SOM-positive interneurons and the emergence of the VGluT2-positive patch structures during adolescence may be associated with the functional development of spatial codes in the superficial layers of the presubiculum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of progressive disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS) such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and multiple sclerosis. Inflammation plays a critical role in the onset and progression of these injuries. Periodontitis is considered an inflammatory disease caused by oral biofilms around the tooth-supporting tissues, leading to a systemic and chronic inflammatory condition. Thus, this systematic review aimed to search for evidence in the association between neurodegenerative disorders and periodontitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This systematic review was registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the code CRD 42016038327. The search strategy was performed in three electronic databases and one gray literature source—PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and OpenGrey, based on the PECO acronym: observational studies in humans (P) in which a neurodegenerative disease was present (E) or absent (C) to observe an association with periodontitis (O). The Fowkes and Fulton checklist was used to critically appraise the methodological quality and the risk of bias of individual studies. The quality of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: From 534 articles found, 12 were included, of which eight were case–control, three were cross-sectional, and one was a cohort, giving a total of 3,460 participants. All the included studies reported an association between some neurodegenerative diseases and periodontitis and presented a low risk of bias. According to the GRADE approach, the level of evidence of probing pocket depth was considered very low due to the significant heterogeneity across the studies' upgrading imprecision and inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although all the included studies in this review reported an association between neurodegenerative diseases and periodontitis, the level of evidence was classified to be very low, which suggests a cautious interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives&lt;p&gt;Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is a syndrome describing late-onset persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in non-demented older adults. Few studies to date have investigated the associations of MBI with structural brain changes. Our aim was to explore structural correlates of NPS in a non-demented memory clinic sample using the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C) that has been developed to measure MBI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;One hundred sixteen non-demented older adults from the Czech Brain Aging Study with subjective cognitive concerns were classified as subjective cognitive decline (n = 37) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 79). Participants underwent neurological and neuropsychological examinations and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (1.5 T). The Czech version of the MBI-C was administered to participants’ informants. Five a priori selected brain regions were measured, namely, thicknesses of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and entorhinal cortex (ERC) and volume of the hippocampus (HV), and correlated with MBI-C total and domain scores.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Entorhinal cortex was associated with MBI-C total score (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.368, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and with impulse dyscontrol score (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.284, p = 0.002). HV was associated with decreased motivation (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.248, p = 0.008) and impulse dyscontrol score (r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.240, p = 0.011).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly in the MBI impulse dyscontrol and motivation domains, are associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy in a clinical cohort of non-demented older adults. This study supports earlier involvement of temporal rather than frontal regions in NPS manifestation. Since these regions are typically affected early in the course of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the MBI-C may potentially help further identify individuals at-risk of developing AD dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ESCRT-III polymerization is required for all endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent events in the cell. However, the relative contributions of the eight ESCRT-III subunits differ between each process. The minimal features of ESCRT-III proteins necessary for function and the role for the multiple ESCRT-III subunits remain unclear. To identify essential features of ESCRT-III subunits, we previously studied the polymerization mechanisms of two ESCRT-III subunits Snf7 and Vps24, identifying the association of the helix-4 region of Snf7 with the helix-1 region of Vps24 (Banjade et al., 2019a). Here, we find that mutations in the helix-1 region of another ESCRT-III subunit Vps2 can functionally replace Vps24 in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. Engineering and genetic selections revealed the required features of both subunits. Our data allow us to propose three minimal features required for ESCRT-III function – spiral formation, lateral association of the spirals through heteropolymerization, and binding to the AAA + ATPase Vps4 for dynamic remodeling.</content>

 Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) normally signals to necroptosis by phosphorylating MLKL. We report here that when the cellular RIPK3 chaperone Hsp90/CDC37 level is low, RIPK3 also signals to apoptosis. The apoptotic function of RIPK3 requires phosphorylation of the serine 165/threonine 166 sites on its kinase activation loop, resulting in inactivation of RIPK3 kinase activity while gaining the ability to recruit RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 to form a cytosolic caspase-activating complex, thereby triggering apoptosis. We found that PGF&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt; induces RIPK3 expression in luteal granulosa cells in the ovary to cause luteal regression through this RIPK3-mediated apoptosis pathway. Mice carrying homozygous phosphorylation-resistant RIPK3 S165A/T166A knockin mutations failed to respond to PGF&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt; but retained pro-necroptotic function, whereas mice with phospho-mimicking S165D/T166E homozygous knock-in mutation underwent spontaneous apoptosis in multiple RIPK3-expressing tissues and died shortly after birth. Thus, RIPK3 signals to either necroptosis or apoptosis depending on its serine 165/threonine 166 phosphorylation status.</content>

 Dopaminergic signaling plays an important role in associative learning, including fear and extinction learning. Dopaminergic midbrain neurons encode prediction error-like signals when threats differ from expectations. Within the amygdala, GABAergic intercalated cell (ITC) clusters receive one of the densest dopaminergic projections, but their physiological consequences are incompletely understood. ITCs are important for fear extinction, a function thought to be supported by activation of ventromedial ITCs that inhibit central amygdala fear output. In mice, we reveal two distinct novel mechanisms by which mesencephalic dopaminergic afferents control ITCs. Firstly, they co-release GABA to mediate rapid, direct inhibition. Secondly, dopamine suppresses inhibitory interactions between distinct ITC clusters via presynaptic D1 receptors. Early extinction training augments both GABA co-release onto dorsomedial ITCs and dopamine-mediated suppression of dorso- to ventromedial inhibition between ITC clusters. These findings provide novel insights into dopaminergic mechanisms shaping the activity balance between distinct ITC clusters that could support their opposing roles in fear behavior.</content>

 While high risk of failure is an inherent part of developing innovative therapies, it can be reduced by adherence to evidence-based rigorous research practices. Numerous analyses conducted to date have clearly identified measures that need to be taken to improve research rigor. Supported through the European Union's Innovative Medicines Initiative, the EQIPD consortium has developed a novel preclinical research quality system that can be applied in both public and private sectors and is free for anyone to use. The EQIPD Quality System was designed to be suited to boost innovation by ensuring the generation of robust and reliable preclinical data while being lean, effective and not becoming a burden that could negatively impact the freedom to explore scientific questions. EQIPD defines research quality as the extent to which research data are fit for their intended use. Fitness, in this context, is defined by the stakeholders, who are the scientists directly involved in the research, but also their funders, sponsors, publishers, research tool manufacturers and collaboration partners such as peers in a multi-site research project. The essence of the EQIPD Quality System is the set of 18 core requirements that can be addressed flexibly, according to user-specific needs and following a user-defined trajectory. The EQIPD Quality System proposes guidance on expectations for quality-related measures, defines criteria for adequate processes (i.e., performance standards) and provides examples of how such measures can be developed and implemented. However, it does not prescribe any pre-determined solutions. EQIPD has also developed tools (for optional use) to support users in implementing the system and assessment services for those research units that successfully implement the quality system and seek formal accreditation. Building upon the feedback from users and continuous improvement, a sustainable EQIPD Quality System will ultimately serve the entire community of scientists conducting non-regulated preclinical research, by helping them generate reliable data that are fit for their intended use.</content>

 What factors constrain the arrangement of the multiple fields of a place cell? By modeling place cells as perceptrons that act on multiscale periodic grid-cell inputs, we analytically enumerate a place cell's &lt;i&gt;repertoire&lt;/i&gt; - how many field arrangements it can realize without external cues while its grid inputs are unique; and derive its &lt;i&gt;capacity&lt;/i&gt; - the spatial range over which it can achieve any field arrangement. We show that the repertoire is very large and relatively noise-robust. However, the repertoire is a vanishing fraction of all arrangements, while capacity scales only as the sum of the grid periods so field arrangements are constrained over larger distances. Thus, grid-driven place field arrangements define a large response scaffold that is strongly constrained by its structured inputs. Finally, we show that altering grid-place weights to generate an arbitrary new place field strongly affects existing arrangements, which could explain the volatility of the place code.</content>

 Invasion of human erythrocytes by the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; is a multi-step process. Previously, a forward genetic screen for &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; host factors identified erythrocyte CD55 as essential for invasion, but its specific role and how it interfaces with the other factors that mediate this complex process are unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, antibody-based inhibition, and live cell imaging, here we show that CD55 is specifically required for parasite internalization. Pre-invasion kinetics, erythrocyte deformability, and echinocytosis were not influenced by CD55, but entry was inhibited when CD55 was blocked or absent. Visualization of parasites attached to CD55-null erythrocytes point to a role for CD55 in stability and/or progression of the moving junction. Our findings demonstrate that CD55 acts after discharge of the parasite's rhoptry organelles, and plays a unique role relative to all other invasion receptors. As the requirement for CD55 is strain-transcendent, these results suggest that CD55 or its interacting partners may hold potential as therapeutic targets for malaria.</content>

 The Wnt-pathway is part of a signalling network that regulates many aspects of cell biology. Recently we discovered crosstalk between AMPA/Kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and the Wnt-pathway during the initial Wnt3a-interaction at the cytonemes of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, we demonstrate that this crosstalk persists throughout the Wnt3a-response in ESCs. Both AMPA- and Kainate-receptors regulate early Wnt3a-recruitment, dynamics on the cell membrane, and orientation of the spindle towards a Wnt3a-source at mitosis. AMPA-receptors specifically are required for segregating cell fate components during Wnt3a-mediated asymmetric cell division (ACD). Using Wnt-pathway component knockout lines, we determine that Wnt co-receptor Lrp6 has particular functionality over Lrp5 in cytoneme formation, and in facilitating ACD. Both Lrp5 and 6, alongside pathway effector β-catenin act in concert to mediate the positioning of the dynamic interaction with, and spindle orientation to, a localized Wnt3a-source. Wnt-iGluR crosstalk may prove pervasive throughout embryonic and adult stem cell signalling.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The mechanisms that govern thalamocortical transmission are poorly understood. Recent data have shown that sensory stimuli elicit activity in ensembles of cortical neurons that recapitulate stereotyped spontaneous activity patterns. Here, we elucidate a possible mechanism by which gating of patterned population cortical activity occurs. In this study, sensory-evoked all-or-none cortical population responses were observed in the mouse auditory cortex &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and similar stochastic cortical responses were observed in a colliculo-thalamocortical brain slice preparation. Cortical responses were associated with decreases in auditory thalamic synaptic inhibition and increases in thalamic synchrony. Silencing of corticothalamic neurons in layer 6 (but not layer 5) or the thalamic reticular nucleus linearized the cortical responses, suggesting that layer 6 corticothalamic feedback via the thalamic reticular nucleus was responsible for gating stochastic cortical population responses. These data implicate a corticothalamic-thalamic reticular nucleus circuit that modifies thalamic neuronal synchronization to recruit populations of cortical neurons for sensory representations.</content>

 Abstract
The role of the hippocampus in recognition memory has long been a source of debate. Tasks used to study recognition that typically require an explicit probe, where the participant must make a response to prove they remember, yield mixed results on hippocampal involvement. Here, we tasked monkeys to freely view naturalistic videos, and only tested their memory via looking times for two separate novel versus repeat video conditions on each trial. Notably, a large proportion (&amp;gt;30%) of hippocampal neurons differentiated these videos via changes in firing rates time‐locked to the duration of their presentation on screen, and not during the delay period between them as would be expected for working memory. Many of these single neurons (&amp;gt;15%) contributed to both retrieval conditions, and differentiated novel from repeat videos across trials with trial‐unique content, suggesting they detect familiarity. The majority of neurons contributing to the classifier showed an enhancement in firing rate on repeat compared with novel videos, a pattern which has not previously been shown in hippocampus. These results suggest the hippocampus contributes to recognition memory via familiarity during free‐viewing.</content>

 Objectives
Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.


Methods
Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α−/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND study participants.


Results
Among risk and prodromal markers, physical inactivity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical inactivity, sex, constipation, possible REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical inactivity showed an interaction effect. Amongst other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Constipation was highest in individuals with the Firmicutes‐enriched enterotype, and physical inactivity was most frequent in the Bacteroides‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the Prevotella‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical inactivity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.


Interpretation
Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.

 Cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills were both related to neurocognitive functioning and white matter microstructure. No evidence was found for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in the relationship between both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning.

Abstract
Recent evidence indicates that both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance are related to enhanced neurocognitive functioning in children by influencing brain structure and functioning. This study investigates the role of white matter microstructure in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning in healthy children. In total 92 children (mean age 9.1 years, range 8.0–10.7) were included in this study. Cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance were assessed using performance‐based tests. Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using computerized tests (working memory, inhibition, interference control, information processing, and attention). Diffusion tensor imaging was used in combination with tract‐based spatial statistics to assess white matter microstructure as defined by fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivity (AD, RD). The results revealed positive associations of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. Information processing and motor response inhibition were associated with FA in a cluster located in the corpus callosum. Within this cluster, higher cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills were both associated with greater FA, greater AD, and lower RD. No mediating role was found for FA in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. The results indicate that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are related to neurocognitive functioning as well as white matter microstructure in children. However, this study provides no evidence for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in these relationships.</content>

Interest in gene drive technology has continued to grow as promising new drive systems have been developed in the lab and discussions are moving towards implementing field trials. The prospect of field trials requires models that incorporate a significant degree of ecological detail, including parameters that change over time in response to environmental data such as temperature and rainfall, leading to seasonal patterns in mosquito population density. Epidemiological outcomes are also of growing importance, as: i) the suitability of a gene drive construct for release will depend on its expected impact on disease transmission, and ii) initial field trials are expected to have a measured entomological outcome and a modeled epidemiological outcome. We present MGDrivE 2 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 2): a significant development from the MGDrivE 1 simulation framework that investigates the population dynamics of a variety of gene drive architectures and their spread through spatially-explicit mosquito populations. Key strengths and fundamental improvements of the MGDrivE 2 framework are: i) the ability of parameters to vary with time and induce seasonal population dynamics, ii) an epidemiological module accommodating reciprocal pathogen transmission between humans and mosquitoes, and iii) an implementation framework based on stochastic Petri nets that enables efficient model formulation and flexible implementation. Example MGDrivE 2 simulations are presented to demonstrate the application of the framework to a CRISPR-based split gene drive system intended to drive a disease-refractory gene into a population in a confinable and reversible manner, incorporating time-varying temperature and rainfall data. The simulations also evaluate impact on human disease incidence and prevalence. Further documentation and use examples are provided in vignettes at the project’s CRAN repository. MGDrivE 2 is freely available as an open-source R package on CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MGDrivE2). We intend the package to provide a flexible tool capable of modeling gene drive constructs as they move closer to field application and to infer their expected impact on disease transmission.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ilj39Jhio9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genetic predisposition for complex traits often acts through multiple tissues at different time points during development. As a simple example, the genetic predisposition for obesity could be manifested either through inherited variants that control metabolism through regulation of genes expressed in the brain, or that control fat storage through dysregulation of genes expressed in adipose tissue, or both. Here we describe a statistical approach that leverages tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) corresponding to tissue-specific genes to prioritize a relevant tissue underlying the genetic predisposition of a given individual for a complex trait. Unlike existing approaches that prioritize relevant tissues for the trait in the population, our approach probabilistically quantifies the tissue-wise genetic contribution to the trait for a given individual. We hypothesize that for a subgroup of individuals the genetic contribution to the trait can be mediated primarily through a specific tissue. Through simulations using the UK Biobank, we show that our approach can predict the relevant tissue accurately and can cluster individuals according to their tissue-specific genetic architecture. We analyze body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) in the UK Biobank to identify subgroups of individuals whose genetic predisposition act primarily through brain versus adipose tissue, and adipose versus muscle tissue, respectively. Notably, we find that these individuals have specific phenotypic features beyond BMI and WHRadjBMI that distinguish them from random individuals in the data, suggesting biological effects of tissue-specific genetic contribution for these traits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/702WWWjDJ6w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
Object naming involves accessing meaning and retrieving the associated word form from remote semantic memory. Historically, previously acquired semantic knowledge (i.e., remote semantic memory) was thought to be independent of the hippocampus via neocortical consolidation. This view is based on evidence demonstrating a dissociation in behavior in patients with hippocampal amnesia: amnesic patients are impaired in acquiring new vocabulary yet can name and define previously acquired words. More recently, the view that remote semantic memory is hippocampus‐independent has been challenged by the documentation of disruptions in aspects of remote semantic memory in patients with hippocampal amnesia, particularly in language use and depth of semantic knowledge. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the hippocampus plays a long‐term role in remote semantic memory. We tested amnesic patients and demographically matched healthy comparison participants in an extensive naming task using photographic images of objects normalized for familiarity, object agreement, and visual complexity. Amnesic patients were less likely to correctly name objects than healthy comparison participants. Further, amnesic patients' performance worsened for words that were less familiar, more visually complex, and had less object agreement. These findings suggest that the hippocampus may play a long‐term role in semantic memory processes, rather than a time‐limited role in the initial acquisition of semantic information, and that hippocampal damage can disrupt object naming.</content>

 Abstract
A new theory is proposed of mechanisms of navigation in primates including humans in which spatial view cells found in the primate hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus are used to guide the individual from landmark to landmark. The navigation involves approach to each landmark in turn (taxis), using spatial view cells to identify the next landmark in the sequence, and does not require a topological map. Two other cell types found in primates, whole body motion cells, and head direction cells, can be utilized in the spatial view cell navigational mechanism, but are not essential. If the landmarks become obscured, then the spatial view representations can be updated by self‐motion (idiothetic) path integration using spatial coordinate transform mechanisms in the primate dorsal visual system to transform from egocentric to allocentric spatial view coordinates. A continuous attractor network or time cells or working memory is used in this approach to navigation to encode and recall the spatial view sequences involved. I also propose how navigation can be performed using a further type of neuron found in primates, allocentric‐bearing‐to‐a‐landmark neurons, in which changes of direction are made when a landmark reaches a particular allocentric bearing. This is useful if a landmark cannot be approached. The theories are made explicit in models of navigation, which are then illustrated by computer simulations. These types of navigation are contrasted with triangulation, which requires a topological map. It is proposed that the first strategy utilizing spatial view cells is used frequently in humans, and is relatively simple because primates have spatial view neurons that respond allocentrically to locations in spatial scenes. An advantage of this approach to navigation is that hippocampal spatial view neurons are also useful for episodic memory, and for imagery.</content>

 Abstract
Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) shows neuronal death in cornu ammonis (CA)1, CA3, and CA4. It is known that granule cells and CA2 neurons survive and their axons, the mossy fibers (MF), lose their target cells in CA3 and CA4 and sprout to the granule cell layer and molecular layer. We examined in TLE patients and in a mouse epilepsy model, whether MF sprouting is directed to the dentate gyrus or extends to distant CA regions and whether sprouting is associated with death of target neurons in CA3 and CA4. In 319 TLE patients, HS was evaluated by Wyler grade and International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) types using immunohistochemistry against neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Synaptoporin was used to colocalize MF. In addition, transgenic Thy1‐eGFP mice were intrahippocampally injected with kainate and sprouting of eGFP‐positive MFs was analyzed together with immunocytochemistry for regulator of G‐protein signaling 14 (RGS14). In human HS Wyler III and IV as well as in ILAE 1, 2, and 3 specimens, we found synaptoporin‐positive axon terminals in CA2 and even in CA1, associated with the extent of granule cell dispersion. Sprouting was seen in cases with cell death of target neurons in CA3 and CA4 (classical severe HS ILAE type 1) but also without this cell death (atypical HS ILAE type 2). Similarly, in epileptic mice eGFP‐positive MFs sprouted to CA2 and beyond. The presence of MF terminals in the CA2 pyramidal cell layer and in CA1 was also correlated with the extent of granule cell dispersion. The similarity of our findings in human specimens and in the mouse model highlights the importance and opens up new chances of using translational approaches to determine mechanisms underlying TLE.</content>

 Abstract
Theoretical accounts of moral decision making imply distinct ways in which episodic memory processes may contribute to judgments about moral dilemmas that entail high conflict between a harmful action and a greater good resulting from such action. Yet, studies examining the status of moral judgment in amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions have yielded inconsistent results. To examine whether and how episodic processes contribute to high conflict moral decisions, amnesic patients with MTL damage and control participants were asked to judge the moral acceptability of a harmful action across two conditions that differed in the framing of the moral question. We predicted that personal (but not abstract) framing would engage episodic processes involved in mental simulation, yielding a selective impairment in MTL patients in the personal framing condition. This prediction was not confirmed as neither patients nor controls were influenced by the framing of the moral question. With the exception of a patient whose lesion extended into the amygdala bilaterally, patients were less willing than controls to endorse the utilitarian option, rejecting the harmful action despite its beneficial outcome. They also rated actions as emotionally more intense than did controls. These findings suggest that episodic processes involved in mental simulation are necessary to prospectively evaluate action‐outcome contingencies.</content>

 Abstract
A fundamental skill of an intelligent mind is that of being able to rapidly discover the structural organization underlying the relations across the objects or the events in the world. Humans, thanks to language, master this skill. For example, a child learning that dolphins and cats can also be referred to as mammals, not only will infer the presence of a hierarchical organization for which dolphins and cats are subordinate exemplars of the category mammals, but will also derive that dolphins are, at least at one conceptual level, more similar to cats than to sharks, despite their indisputable higher perceptual similarity to the latter. The hippocampal‐entorhinal system, classically known for its involvement in relational and inferential memory, is a likely candidate to construct and hold these complex relational structures between concepts. To test this hypothesis, we trained healthy human adults to organize a novel audio‐visual object space into categories labeled with novel words. Crucially, a hierarchical taxonomy existed between the object categories, and participants discovered it via inference during a simple associative object‐to‐word training. Using functional MRI after learning, and a combination of ROI‐based multivariate analyses, we found that both the mid‐anterior hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex represented the inferred hierarchical structure between words: subordinate‐level words were represented more similarly to their related superordinate than to unrelated ones. This was paired, in the entorhinal cortex, by an additional signature of internalized structural representation of nested hierarchy: words referring to subordinate concepts belonging to the same superordinate category were represented more similarly compared with those not belonging to the same superordinate level: interestingly, this similarity was never directly taught to subjects nor it was made explicit during the task, but only indirectly derived through a logical inferential process and, crucially, contrasted the evidence coming from the definitional perceptual properties of the concepts. None of these results were observed before learning, when the same words were not yet semantically organized. A whole‐brain searchlight revealed that the effect in the entorhinal cortex extends to a wider network of areas, encompassing the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, partially overlapping with the semantic network.</content>

 Abstract
The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is evolutionarily conserved as one of the few sites of adult neurogenesis in mammals. Although there is clear evidence that neurogenesis is necessary for healthy hippocampal function, whether adult‐born neurons are simply integrated into existing hippocampal networks to serve a similar purpose to that of developmentally born neurons or whether they represent a discrete cell population with unique functions remains less clear. In this review, we consider evidence for discrete cellular, synaptic, and structural features of adult‐born DG neurons, suggesting that neurogenesis contributes to the formation of a heterogeneous DG. We therefore propose that hippocampal neurogenesis creates a specialized neuronal subpopulation that may play a key role in hippocampal functions like episodic memory. We note critical gaps in this extensive body of work, including a general failure to include female animals in relevant research and a need for more precise consideration of intrahippocampal neuroanatomy.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nature Methods, Published online: 21 May 2021; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01166-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41592-021-01166-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bioimaging data have significant potential for reuse, but unlocking this potential requires systematic archiving of data and metadata in public databases. We propose draft metadata guidelines to begin addressing the needs of diverse communities within light and electron microscopy. We hope this publication and the proposed Recommended Metadata for Biological Images (REMBI) will stimulate discussions about their implementation and future extension.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nmeth/rss/current/~4/aI_ZoIVMDtA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Movement related beta band cortical oscillations, including beta rebound after execution and/or suppression of movement, have drawn attention in upper extremity motor control literature. However, fewer studies focused on beta band oscillations during postural control in upright stance. In this preliminary study, we examined beta rebound and other components of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during perturbed upright stance to investigate supraspinal contributions to postural stabilization. Particularly, we aimed to clarify the timing and duration of beta rebound within a non-sustained, but long-lasting postural recovery process that occurs more slowly compared to upper extremities. To this end, EEG signals were acquired from nine healthy young adults in response to a brief support-surface perturbation, together with the center of pressure, the center of mass and electromyogram (EMG) activities of ankle muscles. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations were computed from EEG data using the perturbation-onset as a triggering event. After short-latency (&amp;lt;0.3 s) ERPs, our results showed a decrease in high-beta band oscillations (event-related desynchronization), which was followed by a significant increase (event-related synchronization) in the same band, as well as a decrease in theta band oscillations. Unlike during upper extremity motor tasks, the beta rebound in this case was initiated before the postural recovery was completed, and sustained for as long as 3 s with small EMG responses for the first half period, followed by no excessive EMG activities for the second half period. We speculate that those novel characteristics of beta rebound might be caused by slow postural dynamics along a stable manifold of the unstable saddle-type upright equilibrium of the postural control system without active feedback control, but with active monitoring of the postural state, in the framework of the intermittent control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation of sulfatides in both glial cells and neurons. MLD results from an inherited deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and myelin degeneration in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Currently, no effective treatment is available for the most frequent late infantile (LI) form of MLD after symptom onset. The LI form results in rapid neurological degradation and early death. ARSA enzyme must be rapidly and efficiently delivered to brain and spinal cord oligodendrocytes of patients with LI MLD in order to potentially stop the progression of the disease. We previously showed that brain gene therapy with adeno-associated virus serotype rh10 (AAVrh10) driving the expression of human ARSA cDNA alleviated most long-term disease manifestations in MLD mice but was not sufficient in MLD patient to improve disease progression. Herein, we evaluated the short-term effects of intravenous AAVPHP.eB delivery driving the expression of human ARSA cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus/b-actin hybrid (CAG) promoter in 6-month-old MLD mice that already show marked sulfatide accumulation and brain pathology. Within 3 months, a single intravenous injection of AAVPHP.eB-hARSA-HA resulted in correction of brain and spinal cord sulfatide storage, and improvement of astrogliosis and microgliosis in brain and spinal cord of treated animals. These results strongly support to consider the use of AAVPHP.eB-hARSA vector for intravenous gene therapy in symptomatic rapidly progressing forms of MLD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease. The characteristic pathologies include extracellular senile plaques formed by β-amyloid protein deposition, neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and neuronal loss with glial cell hyperplasia. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are rich in miRNA-binding sites (miRNA response elements, MREs), which serve as miRNA sponges or competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Although several research groups have identified dysregulated circRNAs in the cerebral cortex of SAMP8 mice or APP/PS1 mice using deep RNA-seq analysis, we need to further explore circRNA expression patterns, targets, functions and the signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD and in particular the hippocampal circRNA expression profiles in AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We used deep RNA sequencing to investigate circRNA-ceRNA network patterns in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In our study, 70 dysregulated circRNAs, 39 dysregulated miRNAs and 121 dysregulated mRNAs were identified between the APP/PS1 group and the wild-type group at 8 months in the hippocampus of the mice. Through correlation analysis, we identified 11 dysregulated circRNAs, 7 dysregulated miRNAs and 8 dysregulated mRNAs forming 16 relationships in the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the dysregulated circRNAs were most enriched in biological metabolic processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the dysregulation of circRNAs was enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, platelet activation, long-term potentiation and axon guidance. In addition, our findings preliminarily verified that the novel_circ_0003012/mmu-miR-298-3p/Smoc2 signaling axis may regulate the pathophysiology of AD by affecting the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These newly identified circRNAs in networks and signaling pathways reveal potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Mental syndromes such as anxiety and depression are common comorbidities in patients with chronic insomnia disorder (CID). The locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NE) system is considered to be crucial for modulation of emotion and sleep/wake cycle. LC-NE system is also a critical mediator of the stress-induced anxiety. However, whether the LC-NE system contributes to the underlying mechanism linking insomnia and these comorbidities remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the LC-NE system alterations in patients with insomnia and its relationship with depression and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Seventy patients with CID and 63 matched good sleep control (GSC) subjects were recruited and underwent resting-state functional MRI scan. LC-NE functional network was constructed by using seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The alterations in LC-NE FC network in patients with CID and their clinical significance was explored.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with GSC group, the CID group showed decreased left LC-NE FC in the left inferior frontal gyrus, while they had increased LC-NE FC in the left supramarginal gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG). For the right LC-NE FC network, decreased FC was found in left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Interesting, the increased LC-NE FC was located in sensory cortex, while decreased LC-NE FC was located in frontal control cortex. In addition, the FC between the left LC and left MOG was associated with the duration of the disease, while abnormal FC between right LC and left dACC was associated with the anxiety scores in patients with CID.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study found abnormal LC-NE functional network in patients with CID, and the altered LC-NE function in dACC was associated with anxiety symptoms in CID. The present study substantially extended our understanding of the neuropathological basis of CID and provided the potential treatment target for CID patients who also had anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Fluorescence imaging devices have been indispensable in elucidating the workings of the brain in living animals, including unrestrained, active ones. Various devices are available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of many factors. We have developed CMOS-based needle-type imaging devices that are small and lightweight enough to be doubly implanted in freely moving mice. The design also allowed angled implantations to avoid critical areas. We demonstrated the utility of the devices by using them on GCaMP6 mice in a formalin test experiment. Simultaneous implantations to the capsular-lateral central amygdala (CeLC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) were proven to be safe and did not hinder the execution of the study. Analysis of the collected calcium signaling data, supported by behavior data, showed increased activity in both regions as a result of pain stimulation. Thus, we have successfully demonstrated the various advantages of the device in its application in the pain experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, functional networks in resting-state data were investigated with linear Fourier and wavelet-related methods to characterize their frequency content by relying on pre-specified frequency bands. In this study, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), an adaptive time-frequency method, is used to investigate the naturally occurring frequency bands of resting-state data obtained by Group Independent Component Analysis. Specifically, energy-period profiles of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) obtained by EMD are created and compared for different resting-state networks. These profiles have a characteristic distribution for many resting-state networks and are related to the frequency content of each network. A comparison with the linear Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) shows that EMD provides a more frequency-adaptive representation of different types of resting-state networks. Clustering of resting-state networks based on the energy-period profiles leads to clusters of resting-state networks that have a monotone relationship with frequency and energy. This relationship is strongest with EMD, intermediate with MODWT, and weakest with STFT. The identification of these relationships suggests that EMD has significant advantages in characterizing brain networks compared to STFT and MODWT. In a clinical application to early Parkinson’s disease (PD) vs. normal controls (NC), energy and period content were studied for several common resting-state networks. Compared to STFT and MODWT, EMD showed the largest differences in energy and period between PD and NC subjects. Using a support vector machine, EMD achieved the highest prediction accuracy in classifying NC and PD subjects among STFT, MODWT, and EMD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The aim of the current resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to investigate the potential mechanism of schizophrenia through the posterior–anterior cerebrum imbalance in methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rats and to evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as an early-stage intervention. The rats were divided into four groups: the MAM-sham group, vehicle-sham group, MAM-rTMS group, and vehicle-rTMS group. The rTMS treatment was targeted in the visual cortex (VC) in adolescent rats. Granger Causality Analysis (GCA) was used to evaluate the effective connectivity between regions of interest. Results demonstrated a critical right VC–nucleus accumbens (Acb)–orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) pathway in MAM rats; significant differences of effective connectivity (EC) were found between MAM-sham and vehicle-sham groups (from Acb shell to OFC: t = −2.553, p = 0.021), MAM-rTMS and MAM-sham groups (from VC to Acb core: t = −2.206, p = 0.043; from Acb core to OFC: t = 4.861, p &amp;lt; 0.001; from Acb shell to OFC: t = 4.025, p = 0.001), and MAM-rTMS and vehicle-rTMS groups (from VC to Acb core: t = −2.482, p = 0.025; from VC to Acb shell: t = −2.872, p = 0.012; from Acb core to OFC: t = 4.066, p = 0.001; from Acb shell to OFC: t = 3.458, p = 0.004) in the right hemisphere. Results of the early-stage rTMS intervention revealed that right nucleus accumbens played the role as a central hub, and VC was a potentially novel rTMS target region during adolescent schizophrenia. Moreover, the EC of right nucleus accumbens shell and orbitofrontal cortex was demonstrated to be a potential biomarker. To our knowledge, this was the first resting-state fMRI study using GCA to assess the deficits of a visual-reward neural pathway and the effectiveness of rTMS treatment in MAM rats. More randomized controlled trials in both animal models and schizophrenia patients are needed to further elucidate the disease characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<updated>2021-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Falls in older adults are a major public health problem. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are highly prevalent in older adults and are a risk factor for falls. In the absence of a cure for WMHs, identifying potential strategies to counteract the risk of WMHs on falls are of great importance. Physical activity (PA) is a promising countermeasure to reduce both WMHs and falls risk. However, no study has yet investigated whether PA attenuates the association of WMHs with falls risk. We hypothesized that PA moderates the association between WMHs and falls risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventy-six community-dwelling older adults aged 70–80 years old were included in this cross-sectional study. We indexed PA using the Physical Activity Score for the Elderly (PASE) Questionnaire. Falls risk was assessed using the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA), and WMH volume (mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was determined by an experienced radiologist on T2-weighted and PD-weighted MRI scans. We first examined the independent associations of WMH volume and PASE score with PPA. Subsequently, we examined whether PASE moderated the relationship between WMH volume and PPA. We plotted simple slopes to interpret the interaction effects. Age, sex, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score were included as covariates in all models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Participants had a mean age of 74 years (SD = 3 years) and 54 (74%) were female. Forty-nine participants (66%) had a Fazekas score of 1, 19 (26%) had a score of 2, and 6 (8%) a score of 3. Both PASE (β = −0.26 ± 0.11; p = 0.022) and WMH volume (β = 0.23 ± 0.11; p = 0.043) were each independently associated with PPA score. The interaction model indicated that PASE score moderated the association between WMH volume and PPA (β = −0.27 ± 0.12; p = 0.030), whereby higher PASE score attenuated the association between WMHs and falls risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: PA is an important moderator of falls risk. Importantly, older adults with WMH can reduce their risk of falls by increasing their PA.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that commonly affects the elderly; early diagnosis and timely treatment are very important to delay the course of the disease. In the past, most brain regions related to AD were identified based on imaging methods, and only some atrophic brain regions could be identified. In this work, the authors used mathematical models to identify the potential brain regions related to AD. In this study, 20 patients with AD and 13 healthy controls (non-AD) were recruited by the neurology outpatient department or the neurology ward of Peking University First Hospital from September 2017 to March 2019. First, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to construct the brain structural network. Next, the authors set a new local feature index 2hop-connectivity to measure the correlation between different regions. Compared with the traditional graph theory index, 2hop-connectivity exploits the higher-order information of the graph structure. And for this purpose, the authors proposed a novel algorithm called 2hopRWR to measure 2hop-connectivity. Then, a new index global feature score (GFS) based on a global feature was proposed by combing five local features, namely degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, the number of maximal cliques, and 2hop-connectivity, to judge which brain regions are related to AD. As a result, the top ten brain regions identified using the GFS scoring difference between the AD and the non-AD groups were associated to AD by literature verification. The results of the literature validation comparing GFS with the local features showed that GFS was superior to individual local features. Finally, the results of the canonical correlation analysis showed that the GFS was significantly correlated with the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Therefore, the authors believe the GFS can also be used as a new biomarker to assist in diagnosis and objective monitoring of disease progression. Besides, the method proposed in this paper can be used as a differential network analysis method for network analysis in other domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We and others have reported that Notch3 is a regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most common genetic form of vascular dementia, is caused by mutations in Notch3. The present study intended to investigate whether there is a correlation between altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial memory performance in CADASIL transgenic mice. To overcome visual disabilities that hampered behavioral testing of the original mice (on an FVB background) we back-crossed the existing TgN3&lt;sup&gt;R169C&lt;/sup&gt; CADASIL mouse model onto the C57BL/6J background. These animals showed an age-dependent increase in the pathognomonic granular osmiophilic material (GOM) deposition in the hippocampus. Analysis in the Morris water maze task at an age of 6 and 12 months revealed deficits in re-learning and perseverance in the CADASIL transgenic mice. Overexpression of Notch3 alone resulted in deficits in the use of spatial strategies and diminished adult neurogenesis in both age groups. The additional CADASIL mutation compensated the effect on strategy usage but not on adult neurogenesis. In brain bank tissue samples from deceased CADASIL patients we found signs of new neurons, as assessed by calretinin immunohistochemistry, but no conclusive quantification was possible. In summary, while our study confirmed the role of Notch3 in adult neurogenesis, we found a specific effect of the CADASIL mutation only on the reversion of the Notch3 effect on behavior, particularly visible at 6 months of age, consistent with a loss of function. The mutation did not revert the Notch3-dependent changes in adult neurogenesis or otherwise affected adult neurogenesis in this model.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) controls diverse behaviors and physiologic functions, suggesting the existence of multiple VMH neural subtypes with distinct functions. Combing Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification with RNA sequencing (TRAP-seq) data with snRNA-seq data, we identified 24 mouse VMH neuron clusters. Further analysis, including snRNA-seq data from macaque tissue, defined a more tractable VMH parceling scheme consisting of 6 major genetically- and anatomically-differentiated VMH neuron classes with good cross-species conservation. In addition to two major ventrolateral classes, we identified three distinct classes of dorsomedial VMH neurons. Consistent with previously-suggested unique roles for leptin receptor (&lt;i&gt;Lepr&lt;/i&gt;)-expressing VMH neurons, &lt;i&gt;Lepr &lt;/i&gt;expression marked a single dorsomedial class. We also identified a class of glutamatergic VMH neurons that resides in the tuberal region, anterolateral to the neuroanatomical core of the VMH. This atlas of conserved VMH neuron populations provides an unbiased starting point for the analysis of VMH circuitry and function.</content>

 Thirst is a motivational state that drives behaviors to obtain water for fluid homeostasis. We identified two types of central brain interneurons that regulate thirsty water seeking in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, that we term the Janu neurons. Janu-GABA, a local interneuron in the subesophageal zone, is activated by water deprivation and is specific to thirsty seeking. Janu-AstA projects from the subesophageal zone to the superior medial protocerebrum, a higher order processing area. Janu-AstA signals with the neuropeptide Allatostatin A to promote water seeking and to inhibit feeding behavior. NPF (&lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; NPY) neurons are postsynaptic to Janu-AstA for water seeking and feeding through the AstA-R2 galanin-like receptor. NPF neurons use NPF to regulate thirst and hunger behaviors. Flies choose Janu neuron activation, suggesting that thirsty seeking up a humidity gradient is rewarding. These findings identify novel central brain circuit elements that coordinate internal state drives to selectively control motivated seeking behavior.</content>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for massive detection of DNA sequence variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels). For routine screening of numerous samples, these variants are often converted into cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers which are based on the presence versus absence of restriction sites within PCR products. Current computational tools for SNP to CAPS conversion are limited and usually infeasible to use for large datasets as those generated with NGS. Moreover, there is no available tool for massive conversion of MNPs and indels into CAPS markers. Here, we present VCF2CAPS–a new software for identification of restriction endonucleases that recognize SNP/MNP/indel-containing sequences from NGS experiments. Additionally, the program contains filtration utilities not available in other SNP to CAPS converters–selection of markers with a single polymorphic cut site within a user-specified sequence length, and selection of markers that differentiate up to three user-defined groups of individuals from the analyzed population. Performance of VCF2CAPS was tested on a thoroughly analyzed dataset from a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) experiment. A selection of CAPS markers picked by the program was subjected to experimental verification. CAPS markers, also referred to as PCR-RFLPs, belong to basic tools exploited in plant, animal and human genetics. Our new software–VCF2CAPS–fills the gap in the current inventory of genetic software by high-throughput CAPS marker design from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The program should be of interest to geneticists involved in molecular diagnostics. In this paper we show a successful exemplary application of VCF2CAPS and we believe that its usefulness is guaranteed by the growing availability of NGS services.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uDC8hhIenBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The visual system must make predictions to compensate for inherent delays in its processing. Yet little is known, mechanistically, about how prediction aids natural behaviors. Here, we show that despite a 20-30ms intrinsic processing delay, the vertical motion sensitive (VS) network of the blowfly achieves maximally efficient prediction. This prediction enables the fly to fine-tune its complex, yet brief, evasive flight maneuvers according to its initial ego-rotation at the time of detection of the visual threat. Combining a rich database of behavioral recordings with detailed compartmental modeling of the VS network, we further show that the VS network has axonal gap junctions that are critical for optimal prediction. During evasive maneuvers, a VS subpopulation that directly innervates the neck motor center can convey predictive information about the fly’s future ego-rotation, potentially crucial for ongoing flight control. These results suggest a novel sensory-motor pathway that links sensory prediction to behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8TBlQCb56lA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Many students are taught about genome assembly using the dichotomy between the complexity of finding Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles (easy versus hard, respectively). This dichotomy is sometimes used to motivate the use of de Bruijn graphs in practice. In this paper, we explain that while de Bruijn graphs have indeed been very useful, the reason has nothing to do with the complexity of the Hamiltonian and Eulerian cycle problems. We give 2 arguments. The first is that a genome reconstruction is never unique and hence an algorithm for finding Eulerian or Hamiltonian cycles is not part of any assembly algorithm used in practice. The second is that even if an arbitrary genome reconstruction was desired, one could do so in linear time in both the Eulerian and Hamiltonian paradigms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AaSxW5SRoR4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The dynamic interactions between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their cognate protein partners are central to several cell signaling pathways. For example, the association of CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) with its cognate chemokine, interleukin-8 (IL8 or CXCL8) initiates pathways leading to neutrophil-mediated immune responses. The N-terminal domain of chemokine receptors confers ligand selectivity, but unfortunately the conformational dynamics of this intrinsically disordered region remains unresolved. In this work, we have explored the interaction of CXCR1 with IL8 by microsecond time scale coarse-grain simulations, complemented by atomistic models and NMR chemical shift predictions. We show that the conformational plasticity of the &lt;i&gt;apo&lt;/i&gt;-receptor N-terminal domain is restricted upon ligand binding, driving it to an open C-shaped conformation. Importantly, we corroborated the dynamic complex sampled in our simulations against chemical shift perturbations reported by previous NMR studies and show that the trends are similar. Our results indicate that chemical shift perturbation is often not a reporter of residue contacts in such dynamic associations. We believe our results represent a step forward in devising a strategy to understand intrinsically disordered regions in GPCRs and how they acquire functionally important conformational ensembles in dynamic protein-protein interfaces.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZHuW7BxNtJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The adaptive immune system serves as a potent and highly specific defense mechanism against pathogen infection. One component of this system, the effector T cell, facilitates pathogen clearance upon detection of specific antigens by the T cell receptor (TCR). A critical process in effector T cell activation is transmission of signals from the TCR to a key transcriptional regulator, NF-κB. The transmission of this signal involves a highly dynamic process in which helical filaments of Bcl10, a key protein constituent of the TCR signaling cascade, undergo competing processes of polymeric assembly and macroautophagy-dependent degradation. Through computational analysis of three-dimensional, super-resolution optical micrographs, we quantitatively characterize TCR-stimulated Bcl10 filament assembly and length dynamics, and demonstrate that filaments become shorter over time. Additionally, we develop an image-based, bootstrap-like resampling method that demonstrates the preferred association between autophagosomes and both Bcl10-filament ends and punctate-Bcl10 structures, implying that autophagosome-driven macroautophagy is directly responsible for Bcl10 filament shortening. We probe Bcl10 polymerization-depolymerization dynamics with a stochastic Monte-Carlo simulation of nucleation-limited filament assembly and degradation, and we show that high probabilities of filament nucleation in response to TCR engagement could provide the observed robust, homogeneous, and tunable response dynamic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the speed of filament disassembly preferentially at filament ends provides effective regulatory control. Taken together, these data suggest that Bcl10 filament growth and degradation act as an excitable system that provides a digital response mechanism and the reliable timing critical for T cell activation and regulatory processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V-_mpr38Fp8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Inflammation is implicated in the onset and progression of various diseases, including cerebral pathologies. Here, we report that DJ-1, which plays a role within cells as an antioxidant protein, functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and triggers inflammation if released from dead cells into the extracellular space. We first found that recombinant DJ-1 protein induces the production of various inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMMs) and dendritic cells (BMDCs). We further identified a unique peptide sequence in the αG and αH helices of DJ-1 that activates Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4. In the ischemic brain, DJ-1 is released into the extracellular space from necrotic neurons within 24 h after stroke onset and makes direct contact with TLR2 and TLR4 in infiltrating myeloid cells. Although DJ-1 deficiency in a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion did not attenuate neuronal injury, the inflammatory cytokine expression in infiltrating immune cells was significantly decreased. Next, we found that the administration of an antibody to neutralize extracellular DJ-1 suppressed cerebral post-ischemic inflammation and attenuated ischemic neuronal damage. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown function of DJ-1 as a DAMP and suggest that extracellular DJ-1 could be a therapeutic target to prevent inflammation in tissue injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zsBOh2aXGow&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
The pulvinar is the largest nucleus in the primate thalamus and has topographically organized connections with multiple cortical areas, thereby forming extensive cortico‐pulvino‐cortical input‐output loops. Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a causal role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico‐cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task‐dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large‐scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (LIP) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4‐15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4‐15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large‐scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.

 &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders typically characterized by recurrent and uncontrollable seizures, which seriously affects the quality of life of epilepsy patients. The effective tool utilized in the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy is the Electroencephalogram (EEG). The emergence of machine learning promotes the development of automated epilepsy detection techniques. New algorithms are continuously introduced to shorten the detection time and improve classification accuracy. This minireview summarized the latest research of epilepsy detection techniques that focused on acquiring, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification of epileptic EEG signals. The application of seizure prediction and localization based on EEG signals in the diagnosis of epilepsy was also introduced. And then, the future development trend of epilepsy detection technology has prospected at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Currently, the management of acute and chronic pain in clinical practice remains unsatisfactory due to the existence of limited effective treatments, and novel therapeutic strategies for pathological pain are urgently needed. In the past few decades, the role of serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) in the development of pain and diurnal rhythms has been implicated in numerous studies. The expression levels of SGK1 mRNA and protein were found to be elevated in the spinal cord and brain in various pathological pain models. Blocking SGK1 significantly attenuated pain-like responses and the development of pathological pain. These studies provide strong evidence that SGK1 plays a role in the development of various types of pathological pain and that targeting SGK1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for pain management. In this review article, we provide evidence from animal models for the potential role of SGK1 in the regulation of pathological pain caused by inflammation, nerve injury, psychiatric disorders, and chronic opioid exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Due to the relatively small number of neurons (few tens of thousands), the well-established multipurpose model organism Lymnaea stagnalis, great pond snail, has been extensively used to study the functioning of the nervous system. Unlike the more complex brains of higher organisms, L. stagnalis has a relatively simple central nervous system (CNS) with well-defined circuits (e.g., feeding, locomotion, learning, and memory) and identified individual neurons (e.g., cerebral giant cell, CGC), which generate behavioral patterns. Accumulating information from electrophysiological experiments maps the network of neuronal connections and the neuronal circuits responsible for basic life functions. Chemical signaling between synaptic-coupled neurons is underpinned by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. This review looks at the rapidly expanding contributions of mass spectrometry (MS) to neuropeptide discovery and identification at different granularity of CNS organization. Abundances and distributions of neuropeptides in the whole CNS, eleven interconnected ganglia, neuronal clusters, single neurons, and subcellular compartments are captured by MS imaging and single cell analysis techniques. Combining neuropeptide expression and electrophysiological data, and aided by genomic and transcriptomic information, the molecular basis of CNS-controlled biological functions is increasingly revealed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Research on microglia has established the differentiation between the so-called M1 and M2 phenotypes. However, new frameworks have been proposed attempting to discern between meaningful microglia profiles. We have set up an in vitro microglial activation model by adding an injured spinal cord (SCI) lysate to microglial cultures, obtained from postnatal rats, in order to mimic the environment of the spinal cord after injury. We found that under the presence of the SCI lysate microglial cells changed their phenotype, developing less ramified but longer processes, and proliferated. The SCI lysate also led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, downregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4, and a biphasic profile of iNOS. In addition, a latex beads phagocytosis assay revealed the SCI lysate stimulated the phagocytic capacity of microglia. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that microglial cells showed a pro-inflammatory profile in the presence of SCI lysate. Finally, characterization of the microglial activation in the spinal cord on day 7 after contusion injury, we showed that these cells have a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Overall, these results indicate that the use of SCI lysates could be a useful tool to skew microglia towards a closer phenotype to that observed after the spinal cord contusion injury than the use of LPS or IFNγ.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease. It is a chronic and progressive disorder estimated to affect at least 4 million people worldwide. Although the etiology of PD remains unclear, it has been found that the dysfunction of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) in neural terminal happens before the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Recently, accumulating evidence reveals that the PD-linked synaptic genes, including DNAJC6, SYNJ1, and SH3GL2, significantly contribute to the disruptions of SVE, which is vital for the pathogenesis of PD. In addition, the proteins encoded by other PD-associated genes such as SNCA, LRRK2, PRKN, and DJ-1 also play key roles in the regulation of SVE. Here we present the facts about SVE-related genes and discussed their potential relevance to the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) is one of the longest association fiber tracts of the brain. According to the most recent anatomical studies, it may be formed by several layers, suggesting a role in multiple cognitive functions. However, to date, no attempt has been made to dissociate the functional contribution of the IFOF subpathways. In this study, real-time, cortico-subcortical mapping with direct electrostimulation was performed in 111 patients operated on in wide-awake surgery for a right low-grade glioma. Patients performed two behavioral tasks during stimulation, tapping, respectively, mentalizing and visual semantic cognition—two functions supposed to be partly mediated by the IFOF. Responsive white matter sites were first subjected to a clustering analysis to assess potential topological differences in network organization. Then they were used as seeds to generate streamline tractograms based on the HC1021 diffusion dataset (template-based approach). The tractograms obtained for each function were overlapped and contrasted to determine whether some fiber pathways were more frequently involved in one or the other function. The obtained results not only provided strong evidence for a role of the right IFOF in both functions, but also revealed that the tract is dissociable into two functional strata according to a ventral (semantic) and dorsal (mentalizing) compartmentalization. Besides, they showed a high degree of anatomo-functionnal variability across patients in the functional implication of the IFOF, possibly related to symmetrical/hemispheric differences in network organization. Collectively, these findings support the view that the right IFOF is a functionally multi-layered structure, with nevertheless interindividual variations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Retinal ischemia is a common pathomechanism in various eye diseases. Recently, evidence accumulated suggesting that the extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein tenascin-C (Tnc) plays a key role in ischemic degeneration. However, the possible functional role of Tnc in retinal ischemia is not yet known. The aim of our study was to explore retinal function and rod-bipolar/photoreceptor cell degeneration in wild type (WT) and Tnc knock-out (KO) mice after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Therefore, I/R was induced by increasing intraocular pressure in the right eye of wild type (WT I/R) and Tnc KO (KO I/R) mice. The left eye served as untreated control (WT CO and KO CO). Scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were performed to examine rod-bipolar and rod-photoreceptor cell function. Changes of Tnc, rod-bipolar cells, photoreceptors, retinal structure and apoptotic and synaptic alterations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, Western blot, and quantitative real time PCR. We found increased Tnc protein levels 3 days after ischemia, while Tnc immunoreactivity decreased after 7 days. Tnc mRNA expression was comparable in the ischemic retina. ERG measurements after 7 days showed lower a-/b-wave amplitudes in both ischemic groups. Nevertheless, the amplitudes in the KO I/R group were higher than in the WT I/R group. We observed retinal thinning in WT I/R mice after 3 and 7 days. Although compared to the KO CO group, retinal thinning was not observed in the KO I/R group until 7 days. The number of PKCα&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rod-bipolar cells, recoverin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; photoreceptor staining and Prkca and Rcvrn expression were comparable in all groups. However, reduced rhodopsin protein as well as Rho and Gnat1 mRNA expression levels of rod-photoreceptors were found in the WT I/R, but not in the KO I/R retina. Additionally, a lower number of activated caspase 3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells was observed in the KO I/R group. Finally, both ischemic groups displayed enhanced vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) levels. Collectively, KO mice showed diminished rod-photoreceptor degeneration and retinal dysfunction after I/R. Elevated vGlut1 levels after ischemia could be related to an impaired glutamatergic photoreceptor-bipolar cell signaling and excitotoxicity. Our study provides novel evidence that Tnc reinforces ischemic retinal degeneration, possibly by synaptic remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral glucose hypometabolism. Hypometabolism may be partly due to reduced glucose transport at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and across astrocytic and neuronal cell membranes. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) are integral membrane proteins responsible for moving glucose from the bloodstream to parenchymal cells where it is metabolized, and evidence indicates vascular and non-vascular GLUTs are altered in AD brains, a process which could starve the brain of glucose and accelerate cognitive decline. Here we review the literature on glucose transport alterations in AD from human and rodent studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Literature published between 1st January 1946 and 1st November 2020 within EMBASE and MEDLINE databases was searched for the terms “glucose transporters” AND “Alzheimer's disease”. Human and rodent studies were included while reviews, letters, and in-vitro studies were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Forty-three studies fitting the inclusion criteria were identified, covering human (23 studies) and rodent (20 studies). Post-mortem studies showed consistent reductions in GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the hippocampus and cortex of AD brains, areas of the brain closely associated with AD pathology. Tracer studies in rodent models of AD and human AD also exhibit reduced uptake of glucose and glucose-analogs into the brain, supporting these findings. Longitudinal rodent studies clearly indicate that changes in GLUT1 and GLUT3 only occur after amyloid-β pathology is present, and several studies indicate amyloid-β itself may be responsible for GLUT changes. Furthermore, evidence from human and rodent studies suggest GLUT depletion has severe effects on brain function. A small number of studies show GLUT2 and GLUT12 are increased in AD. Anti-diabetic medications improved glucose transport capacity in AD subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: GLUT1 and GLUT3 are reduced in hippocampal and cortical regions in patients and rodent models of AD, and may be caused by high levels of amyloid-β in these regions. GLUT3 reductions appear to precede the onset of clinical symptoms. GLUT2 and GLUT12 appear to increase and may have a compensatory role. Repurposing anti-diabetic drugs to modify glucose transport shows promising results in human studies of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional imaging studies of neurologically intact adults have demonstrated that the right posterior cerebellum is activated during verb generation, semantic processing, sentence processing, and verbal fluency. Studies of patients with cerebellar damage converge to show that the cerebellum supports sentence processing and verbal fluency. However, to date there are no patient studies that investigated the specific importance of the right posterior cerebellum in language processing, because: (i) case studies presented patients with lesions affecting the anterior cerebellum (with or without damage to the posterior cerebellum), and (ii) group studies combined patients with lesions to different cerebellar regions, without specifically reporting the effects of right posterior cerebellar damage. Here we investigated whether damage to the right posterior cerebellum is critical for sentence processing and verbal fluency in four patients with focal stroke damage to different parts of the right posterior cerebellum (all involving Crus II, and lobules VII and VIII). We examined detailed lesion location by going beyond common anatomical definitions of cerebellar anatomy (i.e., according to lobules or vascular territory), and employed a recently proposed functional parcellation of the cerebellum. All four patients experienced language difficulties that persisted for at least a month after stroke but three performed in the normal range within a year. In contrast, one patient with more damage to lobule IX than the other patients had profound long-lasting impairments in the comprehension and repetition of sentences, and the production of spoken sentences during picture description. Spoken and written word comprehension and visual recognition memory were also impaired, however, verbal fluency was within the normal range, together with object naming, visual perception and verbal short-term memory. This is the first study to show that focal damage to the right posterior cerebellum leads to language difficulties after stroke; and that processing impairments persisted in the case with most damage to lobule IX. We discuss these results in relation to current theories of cerebellar contribution to language processing. Overall, our study highlights the need for longitudinal studies of language function in patients with focal damage to different cerebellar regions, with functional imaging to understand the mechanisms that support recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Several investigations have shown language impairments following electrode implantation surgery for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in movement disorders. The impact of the actual stimulation, however, differs between DBS targets with further deterioration in formal language tests induced by thalamic DBS in contrast to subtle improvement observed in subthalamic DBS. Here, we studied speech samples from interviews with participants treated with DBS of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) for essential tremor (ET), or the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson’s disease (PD), and healthy volunteers (each n = 13). We analyzed word frequency and the use of open and closed class words. Active DBS increased word frequency in case of VIM, but not STN stimulation. Further, relative to controls, both DBS groups produced fewer open class words. Whereas VIM DBS further decreased the proportion of open class words, it was increased by STN DBS. Thus, VIM DBS favors the use of relatively common words in spontaneous language, compatible with the idea of lexical simplification under thalamic stimulation. The absence or even partial reversal of these effects in patients receiving STN DBS is of interest with respect to biolinguistic concepts suggesting dichotomous thalamic vs. basal ganglia roles in language processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is increasingly used for presurgical planning in people with medically refractory focal epilepsy. Localization of interictal epileptiform activity, a surrogate for the seizure onset zone whose removal may prevent seizures, is challenging and depends on the use of multiple complementary techniques. Accurate and reliable localization of epileptiform activity from spontaneous MEG data has been an elusive goal. One approach toward this goal is to use a novel Bayesian inference algorithm—the Champagne algorithm with noise learning—which has shown tremendous success in source reconstruction, especially for focal brain sources. In this study, we localized sources of manually identified MEG spikes using the Champagne algorithm in a cohort of 16 patients with medically refractory epilepsy collected in two consecutive series. To evaluate the reliability of this approach, we compared the performance to equivalent current dipole (ECD) modeling, a conventional source localization technique that is commonly used in clinical practice. Results suggest that Champagne may be a robust, automated, alternative to manual parametric dipole fitting methods for localization of interictal MEG spikes, in addition to its previously described clinical and research applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are more predominant in women than men, however there is a lack of understanding as to what neurocognitive mechanisms drive this sex difference. Recent investigation has found a potential moderating role of sex in the relationship between anxiety and the error related negativity (ERN)—a component of error-monitoring that is prevalent in high anxiety individuals—such that females display a positive relationship between anxiety/worry and ERN amplitude. We strove to further explore the influence of sex on the relationship between trait anxiety and performance monitoring, specifically with ERN, as well as extend this work to include another hallmark of anxiety, attentional bias to threat. To meet this end, participants performed the flanker and dot-probe tasks, respectively. We did not find a significant difference in the relationship between attention bias scores and anxiety for female vs. males participants. Furthermore, ΔERN amplitudes were greater in males compared to females, and males had more positive CRN amplitudes than females. There were no significant associations between ERN or ΔERN with anxiety in both male and female participants. However, there was a significant relationship between CRN amplitudes and trait anxiety in male but not female participants. Given these results, the effect of sex on the relationship between components of performance monitoring—namely the CRN and ERN—and anxiety may be more nuanced than the current understanding. Our study was limited to detecting medium to large sized moderation effects. Our findings may be important for future meta-analysis on sex differences in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recurrent circuitry components are distributed widely within the brain, including both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections. Recurrent neuronal networks have potential stability problems, perhaps a predisposition to epilepsy. More generally, instability risks making internal representations of information unreliable. To assess the inherent stability properties of such recurrent networks, we tested a linear summation, non-spiking neuron model with and without a “dynamic leak”, corresponding to the low-pass filtering of synaptic input current by the RC circuit of the biological membrane. We first show that the output of this neuron model, in either of its two forms, follows its input at a higher fidelity than a wide range of spiking neuron models across a range of input frequencies. Then we constructed fully connected recurrent networks with equal numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and randomly distributed weights across all synapses. When the networks were driven by pseudorandom sensory inputs with varying frequency, the recurrent network activity tended to induce high frequency self-amplifying components, sometimes evident as distinct transients, which were not present in the input data. The addition of a dynamic leak based on known membrane properties consistently removed such spurious high frequency noise across all networks. Furthermore, we found that the neuron model with dynamic leak imparts a network stability that seamlessly scales with the size of the network, conduction delays, the input density of the sensory signal and a wide range of synaptic weight distributions. Our findings suggest that neuronal dynamic leak serves the beneficial function of protecting recurrent neuronal circuitry from the self-induction of spurious high frequency signals, thereby permitting the brain to utilize this architectural circuitry component regardless of network size or recurrency.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Extrastriate visual neurons show no firing rate change during a working memory (WM) task in the absence of sensory input, but both αβ oscillations and spike phase locking are enhanced, as is the gain of sensory responses. This lack of change in firing rate is at odds with many models of WM, or attentional modulation of sensory networks. In this article we devised a computational model in which this constellation of results can be accounted for via selective activation of inhibitory subnetworks by a top-down working memory signal. We confirmed the model prediction of selective inhibitory activation by segmenting cells in the experimental neural data into putative excitatory and inhibitory cells. We further found that this inhibitory activation plays a dual role in influencing excitatory cells: it both modulates the inhibitory tone of the network, which underlies the enhanced sensory gain, and also produces strong spike-phase entrainment to emergent network oscillations. Using a phase oscillator model we were able to show that inhibitory tone is principally modulated through inhibitory network gain saturation, while the phase-dependent efficacy of inhibitory currents drives the phase locking modulation. The dual contributions of the inhibitory subnetwork to oscillatory and non-oscillatory modulations of neural activity provides two distinct ways for WM to recruit sensory areas, and has relevance to theories of cortical communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Can we recognize faces with zero experience on faces? This question is critical because it examines the role of experiences in the formation of domain-specific modules in the brain. Investigation with humans and non-human animals on this issue cannot easily dissociate the effect of the visual experience from that of the hardwired domain-specificity. Therefore, the present study built a model of selective deprivation of the experience on faces with a representative deep convolutional neural network, AlexNet, by removing all images containing faces from its training stimuli. This model did not show significant deficits in face categorization and discrimination, and face-selective modules automatically emerged. However, the deprivation reduced the domain-specificity of the face module. In sum, our study provides empirical evidence on the role of nature vs. nurture in developing the domain-specific modules that domain-specificity may evolve from non-specific experience without genetic predisposition, and is further fine-tuned by domain-specific experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Imaging the intact brain of awake behaving mice without the dampening effects of anesthesia, has revealed an exceedingly rich repertoire of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Analyzing and interpreting such complex signals pose many challenges. Traditional analyses of fluorescent changes typically rely on manually outlined static region-of-interests, but such analyses fail to capture the intricate spatiotemporal patterns of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. Moreover, all astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging data obtained from awake behaving mice need to be interpreted in light of the complex behavioral patterns of the animal. Hence processing multimodal data, including animal behavior metrics, stimulation timings, and electrophysiological signals is needed to interpret astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Managing and incorporating these data types into a coherent analysis pipeline is challenging and time-consuming, especially if research protocols change or new data types are added. Here, we introduce Begonia, a MATLAB-based data management and analysis toolbox tailored for the analyses of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in conjunction with behavioral data. The analysis suite includes an automatic, event-based algorithm with few input parameters that can capture a high level of spatiotemporal complexity of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. The toolbox enables the experimentalist to quantify astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in a precise and unbiased way and combine them with other types of time series data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Inherited forms of deafness account for a sizable portion of hearing loss among children and adult populations. Many patients with sensorineural deficits have pathological manifestations in the peripheral auditory system, the inner ear. Within the hearing organ, the cochlea, most of the genetic forms of hearing loss involve defects in sensory detection and to some extent, signaling to the brain via the auditory cranial nerve. This review focuses on peripheral forms of hereditary hearing loss and how these impairments can be studied in diverse animal models or patient-derived cells with the ultimate goal of using the knowledge gained to understand the underlying biology and treat hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes comprise a heterogeneous cell population characterized by distinct morphologies, protein expression and function. Unlike neurons, astrocytes do not generate action potentials, however, they are electrically dynamic cells with extensive electrophysiological heterogeneity and diversity. Astrocytes are hyperpolarized cells with low membrane resistance. They are heavily involved in the modulation of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and express an array of different voltage-dependent and voltage-independent channels to help with this ion regulation. In addition to these K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, astrocytes also express several different types of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; intracellular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in astrocytes has been linked to some of their functional properties. The physiological hallmark of astrocytes is their extensive intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling cascades, which vary at the regional, subregional, and cellular levels. In this review article, we highlight the physiological properties of astrocytes and the implications for their function and influence of network and synaptic activity. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these differences in the context of optogenetic and DREADD experiments and consider whether these tools represent physiologically relevant techniques for the interrogation of astrocyte function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Embryonic Dissociated Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) cultures are often used to investigate the role of novel molecular pathways or drugs in Schwann cell development and myelination. These cultures largely recapitulate the order of cellular and molecular events that occur in Schwann cells of embryonic nerves. However, the timing of Schwann cell developmental transitions, notably the transition from Schwann Cell Precursors (SCP) to immature Schwann cells (iSC) and then to myelinating Schwann cells, has not been estimated so far in this culture system. In this study, we determined the expression profiles of Schwann cell developmental genes during the first week of culture and then compared our data to the expression profiles of these genes in developing spinal nerves. This helped in identifying that SCP transition into iSC between the 5th and 7th day in vitro. Furthermore, we also investigated the transition of immature cells into pro-myelinating and myelinating Schwann cells upon the induction of myelination in vitro. Our results suggest that Schwann cell differentiation beyond the immature stage can be observed as early as 4 days post the induction of myelination in cocultures. Finally, we compared the myelinating potential of coculture-derived Schwann cell monocultures to cultures established from neonatal sciatic nerves and found that both these culture systems exhibit similar myelinating phenotypes. In effect, our results allow for a better understanding and interpretation of coculture experiments especially in studies that aim to elucidate the role of a novel actor in Schwann cell development and myelination.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are essential for neurons and must be optimally distributed along their axon to fulfill local functions. A high density of mitochondria has been observed in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons of an unmyelinated region of the optic nerve, called the glial lamina (GL) in mouse (lamina cribrosa in human). In glaucoma, the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness, the GL is the epicenter of RGC degeneration and is connected to mitochondrial dysfunction. It is generally accepted that the local accumulation of mitochondria in the GL is established due to the higher energy requirement of unmyelinated axons. Here we revisit the connection between mitochondrial positioning and myelin in RGC axons. We show that the high density of mitochondria in the GL is restricted to larger axons and is established before myelination. Thus, contrary to a longstanding belief in the field, the myelination pattern is not responsible for the establishment of the local accumulation of mitochondria in GL axons. Our findings open new research avenues likely critical to understanding the pathophysiology of glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Manipulation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) pathway has been suggested as a therapeutic approach to treat or prevent vision loss due to retinal disease. In this study, we investigated the effects of deleting one copy of Pten in a well-characterized class of retinal ganglion cells called α-ganglion cells in the mouse retina. In Pten&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; retinas, α-ganglion cells did not exhibit major changes in their dendritic structure, although most cells developed a few, unusual loop-forming dendrites. By contrast, α-ganglion cells exhibited a significant decrease in heterologous and homologous gap junction mediated cell coupling with other retinal ganglion and amacrine cells. Additionally, the majority of OFF α-ganglion cells (12/18 cells) formed novel coupling to displaced amacrine cells. The number of connexin36 puncta, the predominant connexin that mediates gap junction communication at electrical synapses, was decreased by at least 50% on OFF α-ganglion cells. Reduced and incorrect gap junction connectivity of α-ganglion cells will affect their functional properties and alter visual image processing in the retina. The anomalous connectivity of retinal ganglion cells would potentially limit future therapeutic approaches involving manipulation of the Pten pathway for treating ganglion cell degeneration in diseases like glaucoma, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: The value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for assessing idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) must be determined. This prospective study aimed to reveal the correlation between CSF biomarkers and clinical symptoms of iNPH and the predictive value of these biomarkers for tap test responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-nine patients with suspected iNPH were recruited, contributed qualified CSF, and underwent a tap test and unified pre- and post-test evaluations of the neurological function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The analysis of biomarkers from the patients’ CSF showed decreased levels of tau and its phosphorylated form, especially in the tap test (+) group. The responsiveness of the tap test was also related to the number of combined symptoms (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and a correlation was found between the end pressure or pressure difference in CSF and tap test responsiveness (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed that P (tap test responsiveness) = 1/1 + e&lt;sup&gt;∧&lt;/sup&gt; − (−5.505 + 55.314 * ratio of p/T-tau − 1.586 * numbers of combined symptoms). The combined indicators (−5.505 + 0.553 * percentage of p/T-tau − 1.586 * numbers of combined symptoms) resulted in the highest sensitivity and specificity of 94.12% and 72.73%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: CSF biomarkers may be assessed to judge tap test responsiveness, which is beneficial for the feasibility of a clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Abstract
Attention promotes the selection of behaviorally relevant sensory signals from the barrage of sensory information available. Visual attention modulates the gain of neuronal activity in all visual brain areas examined, although magnitudes of gain modulations vary across areas. For example, attention gain magnitudes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) vary tremendously across fMRI measurements in humans and electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys. We sought to determine whether these discrepancies are due simply to differences in species or measurement, or more nuanced properties unique to each visual brain area. We also explored whether robust and consistent attention effects, comparable to those measured in humans with fMRI, are observable in the LGN or V1 of monkeys. We measured attentional modulation of multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys engaged in a contrast change detection task requiring shifts in covert visual spatial attention. Rigorous analyses of LGN and V1 multiunit activity revealed robust and consistent attentional facilitation throughout V1, with magnitudes comparable to those observed with fMRI. Interestingly, attentional modulation in the LGN was consistently negligible. These findings demonstrate that discrepancies in attention effects are not simply due to species or measurement differences. We also examined whether attention effects correlated with the feature selectivity of recorded multiunits. Distinct relationships suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity depends upon the unique structure and function of visual brain areas.</content>

Marine bacterial diversity is immense and believed to be driven in part by trade-offs in metabolic strategies. Here we consider heterotrophs that rely on organic carbon as an energy source and present a molecular-level model of cell metabolism that explains the dichotomy between copiotrophs—which dominate in carbon-rich environments—and oligotrophs—which dominate in carbon-poor environments—as the consequence of trade-offs between nutrient transport systems. While prototypical copiotrophs, like &lt;i&gt;Vibrios&lt;/i&gt;, possess numerous phosphotransferase systems (PTS), prototypical oligotrophs, such as SAR11, lack PTS and rely on ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which use binding proteins. We develop models of both transport systems and use them in proteome allocation problems to predict the optimal nutrient uptake and metabolic strategy as a function of carbon availability. We derive a Michaelis–Menten approximation of ABC transport, analytically demonstrating how the half-saturation concentration is a function of binding protein abundance. We predict that oligotrophs can attain nanomolar half-saturation concentrations using binding proteins with only micromolar dissociation constants and while closely matching transport and metabolic capacities. However, our model predicts that this requires large periplasms and that the slow diffusion of the binding proteins limits uptake. Thus, binding proteins are critical for oligotrophic survival yet severely constrain growth rates. We propose that this trade-off fundamentally shaped the divergent evolution of oligotrophs and copiotrophs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XaITgSK02Sw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The central nervous system of humans and other animals modulates spinal cord activity to achieve several locomotion behaviors. Previous neuromechanical models investigated the modulation of human gait changing selected parameters belonging to CPGs (Central Pattern Generators) feedforward oscillatory structures or to feedback reflex circuits. CPG-based models could replicate slow and fast walking by changing only the oscillation’s properties. On the other hand, reflex-based models could achieve different behaviors through optimizations of large dimensional parameter spaces. However, they could not effectively identify individual key reflex parameters responsible for gait characteristics’ modulation. This study investigates which reflex parameters modulate the gait characteristics through neuromechanical simulations. A recently developed reflex-based model is used to perform optimizations with different target behaviors on speed, step length, and step duration to analyze the correlation between reflex parameters and their influence on these gait characteristics. We identified nine key parameters that may affect the target speed ranging from slow to fast walking (0.48 and 1.71 m/s) as well as a large range of step lengths (0.43 and 0.88 m) and step duration (0.51, 0.98 s). The findings show that specific reflexes during stance significantly affect step length regulation, mainly given by positive force feedback of the ankle plantarflexors’ group. On the other hand, stretch reflexes active during swing of iliopsoas and gluteus maximus regulate all the gait characteristics under analysis. Additionally, the results show that the hamstrings’ group’s stretch reflex during the landing phase is responsible for modulating the step length and step duration. Additional validation studies in simulations demonstrated that the modulation of identified reflexes is sufficient to regulate the investigated gait characteristics. Thus, this study provides an overview of possible reflexes involved in modulating speed, step length, and step duration of human gaits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/crkSx4K-c9M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Protected areas are the flagship management tools to secure biodiversity from anthropogenic impacts. However, the extent to which adjacent areas with distinct protection levels host different species numbers and compositions remains uncertain. Here, using reef fishes, European alpine plants, and North American birds, we show that the composition of species in adjacent Strictly Protected, Restricted, and Non-Protected areas is highly dissimilar, whereas the number of species is similar, after controlling for environmental conditions, sample size, and rarity. We find that between 12% and 15% of species are only recorded in Non-Protected areas, suggesting that a non-negligible part of regional biodiversity occurs where human activities are less regulated. For imperiled species, the proportion only recorded in Strictly Protected areas reaches 58% for fishes, 11% for birds, and 7% for plants, highlighting the fundamental and unique role of protected areas and their environmental conditions in biodiversity conservation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MMx7Ri4DYdU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

As a part of growing up, immature orangutans must acquire vast repertoires of skills and knowledge, a process that takes several years of observational social learning and subsequent practice. Adult female and male orangutans show behavioral differences including sex-specific foraging patterns and male-biased dispersal. We investigated how these differing life trajectories affect social interest and emerging ecological knowledge in immatures. We analyzed 15 years of detailed observational data on social learning, associations, and diet repertoires of 50 immatures (16 females and 34 males), from 2 orangutan populations. Specific to the feeding context, we found sex differences in the development of social interest: Throughout the dependency period, immature females direct most of their social attention at their mothers, whereas immature males show an increasing attentional preference for individuals other than their mothers. When attending to non-mother individuals, males show a significant bias toward immigrant individuals and a trend for a bias toward adult males. In contrast, females preferentially attend to neighboring residents. Accordingly, by the end of the dependency period, immature females show a larger dietary overlap with their mothers than do immature males. These results suggest that immature orangutans show attentional biases through which they learn from individuals with the most relevant ecological knowledge. Diversifying their skills and knowledge likely helps males when they move to a new area. In sum, our findings underline the importance of fine-grained social inputs for the acquisition of ecological knowledge and skills in orangutans and likely in other apes as well.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CYdfs1p74LI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The replicability of research results has been a cause of increasing concern to the scientific community. The long-held belief that experimental standardization begets replicability has also been recently challenged, with the observation that the reduction of variability within studies can lead to idiosyncratic, lab-specific results that cannot be replicated. An alternative approach is to, instead, deliberately introduce heterogeneity, known as “heterogenization” of experimental design. Here, we explore a novel perspective in the heterogenization program in a meta-analysis of variability in observed phenotypic outcomes in both control and experimental animal models of ischemic stroke. First, by quantifying interindividual variability across control groups, we illustrate that the amount of heterogeneity in disease state (infarct volume) differs according to methodological approach, for example, in disease induction methods and disease models. We argue that such methods may improve replicability by creating diverse and representative distribution of baseline disease state in the reference group, against which treatment efficacy is assessed. Second, we illustrate how meta-analysis can be used to simultaneously assess efficacy and stability (i.e., mean effect and among-individual variability). We identify treatments that have efficacy and are generalizable to the population level (i.e., low interindividual variability), as well as those where there is high interindividual variability in response; for these, latter treatments translation to a clinical setting may require nuance. We argue that by embracing rather than seeking to minimize variability in phenotypic outcomes, we can motivate the shift toward heterogenization and improve both the replicability and generalizability of preclinical research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Cqv0I8hcBks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Reconstruction of nitrergic neurons (NN) found in one section of the representation of the forepaw of the rat in different cortical compartments in somatosensory area S1 and motor area M1. NN are more densely packed in the upper layers (I‐III) and more sparsely distributed in layer V. Scale bar: 100 μm.







Abstract
Nitrergic neurons (NNs) are inhibitory neurons capable of releasing nitric oxide (NO) that are labeled with NADPHd histochemistry. The rat primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices are a favorable model to investigate NN populations by comparing their morphology, since these areas share the border of forepaw representation. The distribution of the type I NN of the forepaw representation in the S1 and M1 cortices of the rat in different laminar compartments and the morphological parameters related to the cell body and dendritic arborization were measured and compared. We observed that the neuronal density in the S1 (130 NN/mm3) was higher than the neuronal density in the M1 (119 NN/mm3). Most NN neurons were multipolar (S1 with 58%; M1 with 69%), and a minority of the NN neurons were horizontal (S1 with 6%; M1 with 12%). NN found in S1 had a higher verticality index than NN found in M1, and no significant differences were observed for the other morphological parameters. We also demonstrated significant differences in most of the morphological parameters of the NN between different cortical compartments of S1 and M1. Our results indicate that the NN of the forepaw in S1 and M1 corresponds to a neuronal population, where the functionality is independent of the different types of sensory and motor processing. However, the morphological differences found between the cortical compartments of S1 and M1, as well as the higher density of NNs found in S1, indicate that the release of NO varies between the areas.

 Relying on duplex in situ hybridization, targeting PPGAL (pre‐pro‐galanin) and SLC17A6 mRNAs, neurons of the human retrotrapezoid nucleus were identified within the parafacial region of the brainstem. NeuromedinB (NMB), suggested as being a specific marker of RTN neurons in mice by others, was not convincing in our anatomical study, but could benefit from more thorough investigations.







ABSTRACT
The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a hub for respiratory chemoregulation in the mammal brainstem that integrates chemosensory information from peripheral sites and central relays. Chemosensitive neurons of the RTN express specific genetic and molecular determinants which have been used to identify RTN precise location within the brainstem of rodents and non‐human primates. Based on a comparative approach, we hypothesized that among mammals, neurons exhibiting the same specific molecular and genetic signature would have the same function. The co‐expression of preprogalanin (PPGAL) and SLC17A6 (VGluT2) mRNAs with duplex in situ hybridization has been studied in formalin fixed paraffin‐embedded postmortem human brainstems. Two specimens were processed and analyzed in line with RTN descriptions in adult rats and macaques. Double‐labeled PPGAL+/SLC17A6+ neurons were only identified in the parafacial region of the brainstem. These neurons were found surrounding the nucleus of the facial nerve, located ventrally to the nucleus VII on caudal sections, and slightly more dorsally on rostral sections. The expression of neuromedin B (NMB) mRNA as a single marker of chemosensitive RTN neurons has not been confirmed in humans.
The location of the RTN in human adults is provided. This should help to develop investigation tools combining anatomic high‐resolution imaging and respiratory functional investigations to explore the pathogenic role of the RTN in congenital or acquired neurodegenerative diseases.

 &lt;p&gt;Discovered just over 20 years ago, dopamine neurons have the ability to cotransmit both dopamine and glutamate. Yet, the functional roles of dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission and their implications for therapeutic use are just emerging. This review article encompasses the current body of evidence investigating the functions of dopamine neurons of the ventral midbrain that cotransmit glutamate. Since its discovery in dopamine neuron cultures, further work in vivo confirmed dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission across species. From there, growing interest has led to research related to neural functioning including roles in synaptic signaling, development, and behavior. Functional connectome mapping reveals robust connections in multiple forebrain regions to various cell types, most notably to cholinergic interneurons in both the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens and the lateral dorsal striatum. Glutamate markers in dopamine neurons reach peak levels during embryonic development and increase in response to various toxins, suggesting dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission may serve neuroprotective roles. Findings from behavioral analyses reveal prominent roles for dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission in responses to psychostimulants, in positive valence and cognitive systems and for subtle roles in negative valence systems. Insight into dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission informs the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, schizophrenia and Parkinson Disease, with therapeutic implications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;RNA modifications have emerged as an additional layer of regulatory complexity governing the function of almost all species of RNA. N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), the addition of methyl groups to adenine residues, is the most abundant and well understood RNA modification. The current review discusses the regulatory mechanisms governing m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, how this influences neuronal development and function and how aberrant m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A signaling may contribute to neurological disease. M&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is known to regulate the stability of mRNA, the processing of microRNAs and function/processing of tRNAs among other roles. The development of antibodies against m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A has facilitated the application of next generation sequencing to profile methylated RNAs in both health and disease contexts, revealing the extent of this transcriptomic modification. The mechanisms by which m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is deposited, processed, and potentially removed are increasingly understood. Writer enzymes include METTL3 and METTL14 while YTHDC1 and YTHDF1 are key reader proteins, which recognize and bind the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark. Finally, FTO and ALKBH5 have been identified as potential erasers of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, although there in vivo activity and the dynamic nature of this modification requires further study. M&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is enriched in the brain and has emerged as a key regulator of neuronal activity and function in processes including neurodevelopment, learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, and the stress response. Changes to m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A have recently been linked with Schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease. Elucidating the functional consequences of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A changes in these and other brain diseases may lead to novel insight into disease pathomechanisms, molecular biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Both adaptation and novelty detection are an integral part of sensory processing. Recent animal oddball studies have advanced our understanding of circuitry underlying contextual processing in early sensory areas. However, it is unclear how adaptation and mismatch (MM) responses depend on the tuning properties of neurons and their laminar position. Furthermore, given that reduced habituation and sensory overload are among the hallmarks of altered sensory perception in autism, we investigated how oddball processing might be altered in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FX). Using silicon probe recordings and a novel spatial frequency (SF) oddball paradigm, we discovered that FX mice show reduced adaptation and enhanced MM responses compared to control animals. Specifically, we found that adaptation is primarily restricted to neurons with preferred oddball SF in FX compared to WT mice. Mismatch responses, on the other hand, are enriched in the superficial layers of WT animals but are present throughout lamina in FX animals. Last, we observed altered neural dynamics in FX mice in response to stimulus omissions. Taken together, we demonstrated that reduced feature adaptation coexists with impaired laminar processing of oddball responses, which might contribute to altered sensory perception in FX syndrome and autism.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Region-specific plasticity in the striatal circuit plays an important role in the development and long-term maintenance of skills and sequential movement procedures. Studies investigating the molecular substrates that contribute to the plasticity changes during motor skill processes have documented a transition in expression from the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS); however, few studies have explored the expression pattern of molecular substrates in the dorsal striatum during progression of instrumental learning. To address this issue, the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expressions in the subregional dorsal striatum were analyzed during the early and late learning phases of the 10-day sucrose self-administration process. We found that Arc protein is primarily detected in the DMS only in the initial learning stage; however, it is expressed in the DLS during both early and late learning stages. Moreover, Arc expression in the DMS correlated with the number of rewards received later in the training. These data indicated that the Arc expression in subregions of the dorsal striatum shows region-specific transfer and that Arc expression in the DMS contributes to obtaining reward in later learning stage during the process of instrumental learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Delirium is a common serious complication that often occurs after major surgery. The goals of this study were to explore the expression profiles and functional networks of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs in patients of postoperative delirium (POD). Microarray analysis was performed on the peripheral blood samples to identify differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs in 4 POD patients and 4 non-POD volunteers. DE lncRNAs and mRNAs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify the critical biological functions and signaling pathways involved in POD. A total of 1195 DE lncRNAs and 735 DE mRNAs were identified between the POD and non-POD groups. Verified by the RT-qPCR, we identified 14 DE lncRNAs that may relate to the pathogenesis of POD. These 14 DE lncRNAs play important regulatory roles in “glutamate and 5-hydroxytryptamine,” “synaptotagmin 7,” “transient receptor potential channel,” “interleukin-2 production.” There was a regulatory relationship between lncRNA ENST00000530057 and synaptotagmin (Syt) 7 mRNA. The mRNA level of PCLO was up-regulated in POD group. This study showed abundant DE lncRNAs and mRNAs in POD that might help in deciphering the disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of the study was to explore patterns of white matter (WM) alteration in preclinical stage familial Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (fCJD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seven asymptomatic carriers of the PRNP G114V mutation and six non-carriers were recruited from the same fCJD kindred and follow-up obtained from all asymptomatic carriers and two non-carriers 2 years later. Overlapping WM patterns were also explored in asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic CJD patients. All participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments and DTI at baseline and follow-up. DTI data were subjected to whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in WM using tract-based spatial statistics. Three comparisons were conducted: baseline carriers against non-carriers (baseline analysis), changes after 2 years in carriers (follow-up analysis), and differences between patients with symptomatic CJD and healthy controls (CJD patient analysis).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Neither carriers nor non-carriers developed any neurological symptoms during 2 years of follow-up. Baseline analysis showed no differences between the carrier and non-carrier groups in MD and FA. Follow-up analysis showed significantly increased MD in multiple WM tracts, among which increased MD in the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral cingulate gyrus, and left uncinate fasciculus overlapped the patterns observed in patients with symptomatic CJD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Changes in integrity within multiple WM tracts can be detected during the preclinical stage of fCJD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disease that affects millions worldwide and is most prominently associated with broad cognitive decline, including language impairment. Picture description tasks are routinely used to monitor language impairment in AD. Due to the high amount of manual resources needed for an in-depth analysis of thereby-produced spontaneous speech, advanced natural language processing (NLP) combined with machine learning (ML) represents a promising opportunity. In this applied research field though, NLP and ML methodology do not necessarily ensure robust clinically actionable insights into cognitive language impairment in AD and additional precautions must be taken to ensure clinical-validity and generalizability of results. In this study, we add generalizability through multilingual feature statistics to computational approaches for the detection of language impairment in AD. We include 154 participants (78 healthy subjects, 76 patients with AD) from two different languages (106 English speaking and 47 French speaking). Each participant completed a picture description task, in addition to a battery of neuropsychological tests. Each response was recorded and manually transcribed. From this, task-specific, semantic, syntactic and paralinguistic features are extracted using NLP resources. Using inferential statistics, we determined language features, excluding task specific features, that are significant in both languages and therefore represent “generalizable” signs for cognitive language impairment in AD. In a second step, we evaluated all features as well as the generalizable ones for English, French and both languages in a binary discrimination ML scenario (AD vs. healthy) using a variety of classifiers. The generalizable language feature set outperforms the all language feature set in English, French and the multilingual scenarios. Semantic features are the most generalizable while paralinguistic features show no overlap between languages. The multilingual model shows an equal distribution of error in both English and French. By leveraging multilingual statistics combined with a theory-driven approach, we identify AD-related language impairment that generalizes beyond a single corpus or language to model language impairment as a clinically-relevant cognitive symptom. We find a primary impairment in semantics in addition to mild syntactic impairment, possibly confounded by additional impaired cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: Either motor training or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could modulate the neural plasticity after stroke. Therefore, synchronizing the two interventions may optimize the efficiency of recovery. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effect of rTMS along with hand grip training on the neurobehavioral and hand functional recovery in one cohort of subacute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-nine stroke patients were enrolled in a single-center, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial. We tested different intervention effects of rTMS and hand grip training (group A), rTMS alone (group B), and hand grip training alone (group C). For the rTMS-treated groups, patients received 10 consecutive sessions of 5-Hz stimulation over the affected hemisphere with 750 pulses. Jebsen–Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT), Fugl-Meyer assessment of upper extremity (FMA-UE), grip strength, modified Barthel index (mBI), and ipsilesional motor evoked potential (iMEP) latency were assessed and compared across the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that only rTMS along with hand grip training group all improved in JTHFT, FMA-UE, grip strength, and mBI (p ≤ 0.01) compared with the baseline among the three groups. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that rTMS plus hand grip training had much better results in improvement of neurobehavioral outcomes compared to the rTMS alone- and hand grip training alone-treated patients (p &amp;lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were detected in neurophysiologic outcome between intra-groups and inter-groups (p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These proof-of-concept results suggested that rTMS alone with hand grip training was a unique approach to promote hand functional recovery in stroke patients. It provided important information to design a large-scale multi-center clinical trial to further demonstrate the efficiency of the combination of central and peripheral stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:http://www.chictr.org.cn (#ChiCTR1900023443).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: CircRNAs have been found to play a crucial role in the pathological process of various kinds of diseases. However, the role of circRNAs in the formation and rupture of intracranial aneurysm is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Differentially expressed circRNAs profiles between superficial temporal arteries (n = 5) and intracranial aneurysms (n = 5) were analyzed using the Arraystar human circRNAs microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to validate the differential expression of circDUS2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was meant for the location of circDUS2 in human brain vascular smooth muscle cell (HBVSMC). Structural analysis was used to speculate on the function of circDUS2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Five hundred forty-three upregulated and 397 downregulated significantly in intracranial aneurysm as compared to superficial temporal arteries. Quantitative real-time PCR verified the elevated expression of the upregulated circDUS2. The FISH test revealed that circDUS2 is located in the cytoplasm of brain vascular smooth muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study showed differential expression data of circRNAs between superficial temporal artery and intracranial aneurysm and revealed that circDUS2 is a potential molecular marker for intracranial aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Single-cell RNA sequencing technology provides an opportunity to study gene expression at single-cell resolution. However, prevalent dropout events result in high data sparsity and noise that may obscure downstream analyses in single-cell transcriptomic studies. We propose a new method, G2S3, that imputes dropouts by borrowing information from adjacent genes in a sparse gene graph learned from gene expression profiles across cells. We applied G2S3 and ten existing imputation methods to eight single-cell transcriptomic datasets and compared their performance. Our results demonstrated that G2S3 has superior overall performance in recovering gene expression, identifying cell subtypes, reconstructing cell trajectories, identifying differentially expressed genes, and recovering gene regulatory and correlation relationships. Moreover, G2S3 is computationally efficient for imputation in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lOJnB7dMGks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The eukaryotic transcription cycle consists of three main steps: initiation, elongation, and cleavage of the nascent RNA transcript. Although each of these steps can be regulated as well as coupled with each other, their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; dissection has remained challenging because available experimental readouts lack sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to separate the contributions from each of these steps. Here, we describe a novel application of Bayesian inference techniques to simultaneously infer the effective parameters of the transcription cycle in real time and at the single-cell level using a two-color MS2/PP7 reporter gene and the developing fruit fly embryo as a case study. Our method enables detailed investigations into cell-to-cell variability in transcription-cycle parameters as well as single-cell correlations between these parameters. These measurements, combined with theoretical modeling, suggest a substantial variability in the elongation rate of individual RNA polymerase molecules. We further illustrate the power of this technique by uncovering a novel mechanistic connection between RNA polymerase density and nascent RNA cleavage efficiency. Thus, our approach makes it possible to shed light on the regulatory mechanisms in play during each step of the transcription cycle in individual, living cells at high spatiotemporal resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UGmlFnge6Ac&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Switches in brain states, synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation are fundamental processes in our brain that take place concomitantly across several spatial and timescales. All these processes target neuron intrinsic properties and connectivity to achieve specific physiological goals, raising the question of how they can operate without interfering with each other. Here, we highlight the central importance of a timescale separation in the activation of sodium and T-type calcium channels to sustain robust switches in brain states in thalamic neurons that are compatible with synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. We quantify the role of this timescale separation by comparing the robustness of rhythms of six published conductance-based models at the cellular, circuit and network levels. We show that robust rhythm generation requires a T-type calcium channel activation whose kinetics are situated between sodium channel activation and T-type calcium channel inactivation in all models despite their quantitative differences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mLucSWIdP_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) sequencing technologies allow us to investigate three-dimensional chromatin organization at the single-cell level. However, we still need computational tools to deal with the sparsity of the contact maps from single cells and embed single cells in a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. This embedding helps us understand relationships between the cells in different dimensions, such as cell-cycle dynamics and cell differentiation. We present an open-source computational toolbox, scHiCTools, for analyzing single-cell Hi-C data comprehensively and efficiently. The toolbox provides two methods for screening single cells, three common methods for smoothing scHi-C data, three efficient methods for calculating the pairwise similarity of cells, three methods for embedding single cells, three methods for clustering cells, and a build-in function to visualize the cells embedding in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional plot. scHiCTools, written in Python3, is compatible with different platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9wL-tejoXPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

This is also true for colorectal carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome (LS), the most common inherited CRC syndrome. However, a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of these pathways of carcinogenesis, which allows for tailored clinical treatment and even prevention, is still lacking. We suggest a linear dynamical system modeling the evolution of different pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis based on the involved driver mutations. The model consists of different components accounting for independent and dependent mutational processes. We define the driver gene mutation graphs and combine them using the Cartesian graph product. This leads to matrix components built by the Kronecker sum and product of the adjacency matrices of the gene mutation graphs enabling a thorough mathematical analysis and medical interpretation. Using the Kronecker structure, we developed a mathematical model which we applied exemplarily to the three pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis in LS. Beside a pathogenic germline variant in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, driver mutations in &lt;i&gt;APC&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CTNNB1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; are considered. We exemplarily incorporate mutational dependencies, such as increased point mutation rates after MMR deficiency, and based on recent experimental data, biallelic somatic &lt;i&gt;CTNNB1&lt;/i&gt; mutations as common drivers of LS-associated CRCs. With the model and parameter choice, we obtained simulation results that are in concordance with clinical observations. These include the evolution of MMR-deficient crypts as early precursors in LS carcinogenesis and the influence of variants in MMR genes thereon. The proportions of MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient APC-inactivated crypts as first measure for the distribution among the pathways in LS-associated colorectal carcinogenesis are compatible with clinical observations. The approach provides a modular framework for modeling multiple pathways of carcinogenesis yielding promising results in concordance with clinical observations in LS CRCs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZamzTE52rw0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression represent different levels information in biological process, but a comprehensive multiomics analysis of the mammalian heart is lacking. Here, we applied nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing, which detected DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility simultaneously, as well as RNA-seq, for multiomics analysis of the 4 chambers of adult and fetal human hearts, and adult mouse hearts. Our results showed conserved region-specific patterns in the mammalian heart at transcriptome and DNA methylation level. Adult and fetal human hearts showed distinct features in DNA methylome, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptome. Novel long noncoding RNAs were identified in the human heart, and the gene expression profiles of major cardiovascular diseases associated genes were displayed. Furthermore, cross-species comparisons revealed human-specific and mouse-specific differentially expressed genes between the atria and ventricles. We also reported the relationship among multiomics and found there was a bell-shaped relationship between gene-body methylation and expression in the human heart. In general, our study provided comprehensive spatiotemporal and evolutionary insights into the regulation of gene expression in the heart.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/U06HjhHusnE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
The encoding of spatial representations is enabled by synaptic plasticity. The entorhinal cortex sends information to the hippocampus via the lateral (LPP) and medial perforant (MPP) paths that transfer egocentric item‐related and allocentric spatial information, respectively. To what extent LPP and MPP information‐relay results in different homosynaptic synaptic plasticity responses is unclear. We examined the frequency dependency (at 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 Hz) of long‐term potentiation (LTP) and long‐term depression (LTD) at MPP and LPP synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving adult rats. We report that whereas the MPP–DG synapses exhibit a predisposition toward the expression of LTP, LPP–DG synapses prefer to express synaptic depression. The divergence of synaptic plasticity responses is most prominent at afferent frequencies of 5, 100, Hz and 200 Hz. Priming with 10 or 50 Hz significantly modified the subsequent plasticity response in a frequency‐dependent manner, but failed to change the preferred direction of change in synaptic strength of MPP and LPP synapses. Evaluation of the expression of GluN1, GluN2A, or GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor revealed equivalent expression in the outer and middle thirds of the molecular layer where LPP and MPP inputs convene, respectively, thus excluding NMDA receptors as a substrate for the frequency‐dependent differences in bidirectional plasticity. These findings demonstrate that the LPP and MPP inputs to the DG enable differentiated and distinct forms of synaptic plasticity in response to the same afferent frequencies. Effects are extremely robust and resilient to metaplastic priming. These properties may support the functional differentiation of allocentric and item information provided to the DG by the MPP and LPP, respectively, that has been proposed by others. We propose that allocentric spatial information, conveyed by the MPP is encoded through hippocampal LTP in a designated synaptic network. This network is refined and optimized to include egocentric contextual information through LTD triggered by LPP inputs.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The way spatial memory retrieval is represented in the brain remains unclear to date. Previous studies have displayed a hippocampus-centered navigation network using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. There have been some studies on the representation of navigation behavior by signal distribution patterns, but only in the hippocampus and adjacent structures. In this study, we aimed to determine (1) the brain regions that represent information in both intensity and distribution patterns during spatial memory retrieval and (2) whether the patterns of neural responses represent spatial memory retrieval behavior performance. Both univariate analysis [general linear model (GLM)] and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) were employed to reveal the spatial distributions of brain responses elicited by spatial memory retrieval. Correlation analyses were performed to detect the correspondences between brain responses and behavior performance. We found that spatial memory retrieval occurred in widespread brain regions, including the bilateral hippocampi, bilateral superior frontal gyrus, bilateral superior parietal lobules, bilateral occipital lobes, and cerebellum. The amplitude of activation in the left hippocampus showed a significant negative correlation (r = −0.46, p = 0.039) with the number of task completions. Additionally, within-subject classification accuracies based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal patterns of the right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) rostral areas in the Brainnetome Atlas showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.78, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) with retrieval accuracy. In summary, our findings have implications for understanding the separation between navigational and non-navigational states and emphasizing the utility of MVPA in the whole brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Toxoplasma gondii is neurotropic and affects the function of nerve cells, while the mechanism is unclear. LncRNAs are abundantly enriched in the brain and participated in the delicate regulation of the central nervous system (CNS) development. However, whether these lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of microglia activation during the process of T. gondii infection is largely unknown. In this study, the upregulation of a novel lncRNA147410.3 (ENSMUST00000147410.3) was identified as a key factor to influence this process. The target gene of lncRNA147410.3 was predicted and identified as Hoxb3. The localization of lncRNA147410.3 in the brain and cells was proved in the nucleus of neuroglia through FISH assay. Furthermore, the function of lncRNA147410.3 on neuronal cell was confirmed that lncRNA147410.3 could affect proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of mouse microglia by positively regulating Hoxb3. Thus, our study explored the modulatory action of lncRNA147410.3 in T. gondii infected mouse brain, providing a scientific basis for using lncRNA147410.3 as a therapeutic target to treat neurological disorder induced by T. gondii.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective
The aim of this study was to search for genes/variants that modify the effect of LRRK2 mutations in terms of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease.


Methods
We performed the first genomewide association study of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease in LRRK2 mutation carriers (776 cases and 1,103 non‐cases at their last evaluation). Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models were used to identify modifiers of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of LRRK2 mutations, respectively. We also investigated whether a polygenic risk score derived from a published genomewide association study of Parkinson's disease was able to explain variability in penetrance and age‐at‐onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers.


Results
A variant located in the intronic region of CORO1C on chromosome 12 (rs77395454; p value = 2.5E‐08, beta = 1.27, SE = 0.23, risk allele: C) met genomewide significance for the penetrance model. Co‐immunoprecipitation analyses of LRRK2 and CORO1C supported an interaction between these 2 proteins. A region on chromosome 3, within a previously reported linkage peak for Parkinson's disease susceptibility, showed suggestive associations in both models (penetrance top variant: p value = 1.1E‐07; age‐at‐onset top variant: p value = 9.3E‐07). A polygenic risk score derived from publicly available Parkinson's disease summary statistics was a significant predictor of penetrance, but not of age‐at‐onset.


Interpretation
This study suggests that variants within or near CORO1C may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, common Parkinson's disease associated variants collectively increase the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Post mortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function.

The advance in microbiome and metabolome studies has generated rich omics data revealing the involvement of the microbial community in host disease pathogenesis through interactions with their host at a metabolic level. However, the computational tools to uncover these relationships are just emerging. Here, we present MiMeNet, a neural network framework for modeling microbe-metabolite relationships. Using ten iterations of 10-fold cross-validation on three paired microbiome-metabolome datasets, we show that MiMeNet more accurately predicts metabolite abundances (mean Spearman correlation coefficients increase from 0.108 to 0.309, 0.276 to 0.457, and -0.272 to 0.264) and identifies more well-predicted metabolites (increase in the number of well-predicted metabolites from 198 to 366, 104 to 143, and 4 to 29) compared to state-of-art linear models for individual metabolite predictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that MiMeNet can group microbes and metabolites with similar interaction patterns and functions to illuminate the underlying structure of the microbe-metabolite interaction network, which could potentially shed light on uncharacterized metabolites through “Guilt by Association”. Our results demonstrated that MiMeNet is a powerful tool to provide insights into the causes of metabolic dysregulation in disease, facilitating future hypothesis generation at the interface of the microbiome and metabolomics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QTOsI_TZDDI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Stroke is a debilitating condition affecting millions of people worldwide. The development of improved rehabilitation therapies rests on finding biomarkers suitable for tracking functional damage and recovery. To achieve this goal, we perform a spatiotemporal analysis of cortical activity obtained by wide-field calcium images in mice before and after stroke. We compare spontaneous recovery with three different post-stroke rehabilitation paradigms, motor training alone, pharmacological contralesional inactivation and both combined. We identify three novel indicators that are able to track how movement-evoked global activation patterns are impaired by stroke and evolve during rehabilitation: the duration, the smoothness, and the angle of individual propagation events. Results show that, compared to pre-stroke conditions, propagation of cortical activity in the subacute phase right after stroke is slowed down and more irregular. When comparing rehabilitation paradigms, we find that mice treated with both motor training and pharmacological intervention, the only group associated with generalized recovery, manifest new propagation patterns, that are even faster and smoother than before the stroke. In conclusion, our new spatiotemporal propagation indicators could represent promising biomarkers that are able to uncover neural correlates not only of motor deficits caused by stroke but also of functional recovery during rehabilitation. In turn, these insights could pave the way towards more targeted post-stroke therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V5KSb5K32lA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The heart develops from 2 sources of mesoderm progenitors, the first and second heart field (FHF and SHF). Using a single-cell transcriptomic assay combined with genetic lineage tracing and live imaging, we find the FHF and SHF are subdivided into distinct pools of progenitors in gastrulating mouse embryos at earlier stages than previously thought. Each subpopulation has a distinct origin in the primitive streak. The first progenitors to leave the primitive streak contribute to the left ventricle, shortly after right ventricle progenitor emigrate, followed by the outflow tract and atrial progenitors. Moreover, a subset of atrial progenitors are gradually incorporated in posterior locations of the FHF. Although cells allocated to the outflow tract and atrium leave the primitive streak at a similar stage, they arise from different regions. Outflow tract cells originate from distal locations in the primitive streak while atrial progenitors are positioned more proximally. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrates that the primitive streak cells contributing to the ventricles have a distinct molecular signature from those forming the outflow tract and atrium. We conclude that cardiac progenitors are prepatterned within the primitive streak and this prefigures their allocation to distinct anatomical structures of the heart. Together, our data provide a new molecular and spatial map of mammalian cardiac progenitors that will support future studies of heart development, function, and disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kpRtFzPPbgg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Objective
The objective of this study was to report the identification of antibodies against the glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2‐abs) in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and describe the clinical‐immunological features and antibody effects.


Methods
Two sera from 8 patients with similar rat brain immunostaining were used to precipitate the antigen from neuronal cultures. A cell‐based assay (CBA) with GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells was used to assess 596 patients with different neurological disorders, and 23 healthy controls. GluK2‐ab effects were determined by confocal microscopy in cultured neurons and electrophysiology in GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells.


Results
Patients’ antibodies precipitated GluK2. GluK2 antibody‐specificity was confirmed by CBA, immunoprecipitation, GluK2‐immunoabsorption, and GluK2 knockout brain immunohistochemistry. In 2 of 8 samples, antibodies reacted with additional GluK2 epitopes present in GluK1 or GluK3; in both, the reactivity was abrogated after GluK2 immuno‐absorption. Six of 8 patients developed acute encephalitis and clinical or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of predominant cerebellar involvement (4 presenting as cerebellitis, which in 2 patients caused obstructive hydrocephalus), and 2 patients had other syndromes (1 with cerebellar symptoms). One of the samples showed mild reactivity with non‐kainate receptors (alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptors [AMPAR] and N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors [NMDAR]) leading to identify 6 additional cases with GluK2‐abs among patients with anti‐AMPAR (5/71) or anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (1/73). GluK2‐abs internalized GluK2 in HEK293 cells and neurons; these antibody‐effects were reversible in neurons. A significant reduction of GluK2‐mediated currents was observed in cells treated with patients’ GluK2 serum following the time frame of antibody‐mediated GluK2 internalization.


Interpretation
GluK2‐abs associate with an encephalitis with prominent clinicoradiological cerebellar involvement. The antibody effects are predominantly mediated by internalization of GluK2. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 A laser speckle contrast image showing blood flow in the face of a migraineur who had received an infusion of pramlinitide, an agonist for amylin receptors. Amylin is a peptide in the same family as CGRP, with which it shares agonist activity at the AMY1 receptor. Amylin can also provoke migraine‐like attacks, suggesting that an dual amylin‐CGRP antagonist may be effective for migraine. See Ghanizada et al. (pp. 1157–1171) in this issue.</content>

 Objective
To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF) as markers of future phenoconversion to multiple system atrophy (MSA).


Methods
Well‐characterized patients with PAF (n = 32) were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2019 at Mayo Clinic Rochester and followed prospectively with annual visits to determine future phenoconversion to MSA, Parkinson's disease (PD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). ELISA was utilized to measure NfL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF collected at baseline.


Results
Patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years. Five patients converted to MSA, 2 to PD, and 2 to DLB. NfL at baseline was elevated only in patients who later developed MSA, perfectly separating those from future PD and DLB converters as well as non‐converters. ASyn‐PMCA was positive in all but two cases (94%). The PMCA reaction was markedly different in five samples with maximum fluorescence and reaction kinetics previously described in MSA patients; all of these patients later developed MSA.


Interpretation
αSyn‐PMCA is almost invariably positive in the CSF of patients with PAF establishing this condition as α‐synucleinopathy. Both NfL and the magnitude and reaction kinetics of αSyn PMCA faithfully predict which PAF patients will eventually phenoconvert to MSA. This finding has important implications not only for prognostication, but also for future trials of disease modifying therapies, allowing for differentiation of MSA from Lewy body synucleinopathies before motor symptoms develop.

 Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate the gut microbiome in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and how it relates to clinical disease.


Methods
We sequenced the microbiota from healthy controls and relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS patients and correlated the levels of bacteria with clinical features of disease, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), quality of life, and brain magnetic resonance imaging lesions/atrophy. We colonized mice with MS‐derived Akkermansia and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).


Results
Microbiota β‐diversity differed between MS patients and controls but did not differ between RRMS and progressive MS or differ based on disease‐modifying therapies. Disease status had the greatest effect on the microbiome β‐diversity, followed by body mass index, race, and sex. In both progressive MS and RRMS, we found increased Clostridium bolteae, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, and Akkermansia and decreased Blautia wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, and Erysipelotrichaceae CCMM. Unique to progressive MS, we found elevated Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium g24 FCEY and decreased Blautia and Agathobaculum. Several Clostridium species were associated with higher EDSS and fatigue scores. Contrary to the view that elevated Akkermansia in MS has a detrimental role, we found that Akkermansia was linked to lower disability, suggesting a beneficial role. Consistent with this, we found that Akkermansia isolated from MS patients ameliorated EAE, which was linked to a reduction in RORγt+ and IL‐17–producing γδ T cells.


Interpretation
Whereas some microbiota alterations are shared in relapsing and progressive MS, we identified unique bacteria associated with progressive MS and clinical measures of disease. Furthermore, elevated Akkermansia in MS may be a compensatory beneficial response in the MS microbiome. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1195–1211</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system results from subpial hemosiderin deposition due to chronic low‐grade bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The confluent and marginal subpial hemosiderin is best appreciated on iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging sequences. With widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging, the disorder is increasingly being recognized, including in asymptomatic individuals. Gait ataxia, often with hearing impairment is a common clinical presentation. A clinical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage is generally not present. A macrovascular pathology is generally not causative. The most common etiology is dural disease, often dural tears. Prior or less commonly ongoing symptoms of craniospinal hypovolemia may be present. Common etiologies for dural tears include disc disease and trauma, including surgical trauma. Patients with dural tears due to herniated and calcified discs often have a ventral intraspinal fluid collection due to cerebrospinal fluid leak. A precise identification of the dural tear relies on multimodality imaging. It has been speculated that chronic bleeding from fragile blood vessels around the dural tear may be the likely underlying mechanism. Surgical correction of the bleeding source is a logical therapeutic strategy. Clinical outcomes are variable, although neuroimaging evidence of successful dural tear repair is noted. The currently available data regarding use of deferiprone in patients with superficial siderosis is insufficient to recommend its routine use in patients. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1068–1079</content>

 Brain mosaic mutations are a major cause of refractory focal epilepsies with cortical malformations such as focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly, malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy, and ganglioglioma. Here, we collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during epilepsy surgery to search for somatic variants in cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) using targeted droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. In 3 of 12 epileptic patients with known somatic mutations previously identified in brain tissue, we here provide evidence that brain mosaicism can be detected in the CSF‐derived cfDNA. These findings suggest future opportunities for detecting the mutant allele driving epilepsy in CSF. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1248–1252</content>

 Objective
Knowing explicitly where we are is an interpretation of our spatial representations. Reduplicative paramnesia is a disrupting syndrome in which patients present a firm belief of spatial mislocation. Here, we studied the largest sample of patients with delusional misidentifications of space (ie, reduplicative paramnesia) after stroke to shed light on their neurobiology.


Methods
In a prospective, cumulative, case‐control study, we screened 400 patients with acute right‐hemispheric stroke. We included 64 cases and 233 controls. First, lesions were delimited and normalized. Then, we computed structural and functional disconnection maps using methods of lesion‐track and network‐mapping. The maps were compared, controlling for confounders. Second, we built a multivariate logistic model, including clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data. Finally, we performed a nested cross‐validation of the model with a support‐vector machine analysis.


Results
The most frequent misidentification subtype was confabulatory mislocation (56%), followed by place reduplication (19%), and chimeric assimilation (13%). Our results indicate that structural disconnection is the strongest predictor of the syndrome and included 2 distinct streams, connecting right fronto‐thalamic and right occipitotemporal structures. In the multivariate model, the independent predictors of reduplicative paramnesia were the structural disconnection map, lesion sparing of right dorsal fronto‐parietal regions, age, and anosognosia. Good discrimination accuracy was demonstrated (area under the curve = 0.80 [0.75–0.85]).


Interpretation
Our results localize the anatomic circuits that may have a role in the abnormal spatial‐emotional binding and in the defective updating of spatial representations underlying reduplicative paramnesia. This novel data may contribute to better understand the pathophysiology of delusional syndromes after stroke. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1181–1194</content>

 There is an accumulating volume of research into neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). However, inconsistent study designs, inadequate controls, poorly validated tests, and differing settings, interventions, and cultural norms weaken study quality and comparability, hence the understanding of the spectrum, burden, and pathophysiology of these complications. Therefore, a global COVID‐19 Neuro Research Coalition, together with the World Health Organization, has reviewed reports of COVID‐19 neurological complications and harmonized clinical measures for future research. This will facilitate well‐designed studies using precise, consistent case definitions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and neurological complications, with standardized forms for pooled data analyses that nonspecialists can use, including those in low‐income settings.

 Objective
The link between brain function and cardiovascular dynamics is an important issue yet to be elucidated completely. The insula is a neocortical brain area that is thought to have a cardiac chronotropic regulatory function, but its role in cardiac contractility is unknown. We aimed to analyze the variability in heart rate and cardiac contractility after functional activation of different insular regions through direct electrical stimulation (E‐stim) in humans.


Methods
This was an observational, prospective study, including patients admitted for stereo‐electroencephalographic recording because of refractory epilepsy, in whom the insular cortex was implanted. Patients with anatomical or electrophysiological insular abnormalities and those in whom E‐stim produced subjective symptoms were excluded. Variations in heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed during insular E‐stim and compared with control E‐stim of non‐eloquent brain regions and sham stimulations.


Results
Ten patients were included, 5 implanted in the right insula (52 E‐stim) and 5 in the left (37 E‐stim). Demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups were similar. E‐stim of both right and left insulas induced a significant decrease of the CO and HR, and an increase of the SV. E‐stim of control electrodes and sham stimulations were not associated with variations in cardiac function. Blood pressure and respiratory rate remained unaltered.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a direct chronotropic and inotropic cardiac depressor function of the right and left insulas. The evidence of an insular direct cardiac regulatory function might open a path in the prevention or treatment of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

 Objective
Migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurological disease. Its genesis is poorly understood, and there remains unmet clinical need. We aimed to identify mechanisms and thus novel therapeutic targets for migraine using human models of migraine and translational models in animals, with emphasis on amylin, a close relative of calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP).


Methods
Thirty‐six migraine without aura patients were enrolled in a randomized, double‐blind, 2‐way, crossover, positive‐controlled clinical trial study to receive infusion of an amylin analogue pramlintide or human αCGRP on 2 different experimental days. Furthermore, translational studies in cells and mouse models, and rat, mouse and human tissue samples were conducted.


Results
Thirty patients (88%) developed headache after pramlintide infusion, compared to 33 (97%) after CGRP (p = 0.375). Fourteen patients (41%) developed migraine‐like attacks after pramlintide infusion, compared to 19 patients (56%) after CGRP (p = 0.180). The pramlintide‐induced migraine‐like attacks had similar clinical characteristics to those induced by CGRP. There were differences between treatments in vascular parameters. Human receptor pharmacology studies showed that an amylin receptor likely mediates these pramlintide‐provoked effects, rather than the canonical CGRP receptor. Supporting this, preclinical experiments investigating symptoms associated with migraine showed that amylin treatment, like CGRP, caused cutaneous hypersensitivity and light aversion in mice.


Interpretation
Our findings propose amylin receptor agonism as a novel contributor to migraine pathogenesis. Greater therapeutic gains could therefore be made for migraine patients through dual amylin and CGRP receptor antagonism, rather than selectively targeting the canonical CGRP receptor.

 Background
To operationalize the National Institute on Aging – Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) Research Framework for Alzheimer's Disease 6‐stage continuum of clinical progression for persons with abnormal amyloid.


Methods
The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging is a population‐based longitudinal study of aging and cognitive impairment in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We evaluated persons without dementia having 3 consecutive clinical visits. Measures for cross‐sectional categories included objective cognitive impairment (OBJ) and function (FXN). Measures for change included subjective cognitive impairment (SCD), objective cognitive change (ΔOBJ), and new onset of neurobehavioral symptoms (ΔNBS). We calculated frequencies of the stages using different cutoff points and assessed stability of the stages over 15 months.


Results
Among 243 abnormal amyloid participants, the frequencies of the stages varied with age: 66 to 90% were classified as stage 1 at age 50 but at age 80, 24 to 36% were stage 1, 32 to 47% were stage 2, 18 to 27% were stage 3, 1 to 3% were stage 4 to 6, and 3 to 9% were indeterminate. Most stage 2 participants were classified as stage 2 because of abnormal ΔOBJ only (44–59%), whereas 11 to 21% had SCD only, and 9 to 13% had ΔNBS only. Short‐term stability varied by stage and OBJ cutoff points but the most notable changes were seen in stage 2 with 38 to 63% remaining stable, 4 to 13% worsening, and 24 to 41% improving (moving to stage 1).


Interpretation
The frequency of the stages varied by age and the precise membership fluctuated by the parameters used to define the stages. The staging framework may require revisions before it can be adopted for clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1145–1156</content>

 Objective
Migraine is three times more common in women. CGRP plays a critical role in migraine pathology and causes female‐specific behavioral responses upon meningeal application. These effects are likely mediated through interactions of CGRP with signaling systems specific to females. Prolactin (PRL) levels have been correlated with migraine attacks. Here, we explore a potential interaction between CGRP and PRL in the meninges.


Methods
Prolactin, CGRP, and receptor antagonists CGRP8‐37 or Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL were administered onto the dura of rodents followed by behavioral testing. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine PRL, CGRP and Prolactin receptor (Prlr) expression within the dura. Electrophysiology on cultured and back‐labeled trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons was used to assess PRL‐induced excitability. Finally, the effects of PRL on evoked CGRP release from ex vivo dura were measured.


Results
We found that dural PRL produced sustained and long‐lasting migraine‐like behavior in cycling and ovariectomized female, but not male rodents. Prlr was expressed on dural afferent nerves in females with little‐to‐no presence in males. Consistent with this, PRL increased excitability only in female TG neurons innervating the dura and selectively sensitized CGRP release from female ex vivo dura. We demonstrate crosstalk between PRL and CGRP systems as CGRP8‐37 decreases migraine‐like responses to dural PRL. Reciprocally, Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL attenuates dural CGRP‐induced migraine behaviors. Similarly, Prlr deletion from sensory neurons significantly reduced migraine‐like responses to dural CGRP.


Interpretation
This CGRP‐PRL interaction in the meninges is a mechanism by which these peptides could produce female‐selective responses and increase the prevalence of migraine in women. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1129–1144</content>

 Objective
Mutations in the ATXN2 gene (CAG expansions ≥32 repeats) can be a rare cause of Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We recently reported that the stress granule (SG) protein Staufen1 (STAU1) was overabundant in neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patient cells, animal models, and ALS‐TDP‐43 fibroblasts, and provided a link between SG formation and autophagy. We aimed to test if STAU1 overabundance has a role in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases.


Methods
With multiple neurodegenerative patient‐derived cell models, animal models, and human postmortem ALS tissue, we evaluate STAU1 function using biochemical and immunohistological analyses.


Results
We demonstrate STAU1 overabundance and increased total and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in fibroblast cells from patients with ALS with mutations in TDP‐43, patients with dementia with PSEN1 mutations, a patient with parkinsonism with MAPT mutation, Huntington's disease (HD) mutations, and SCA2 mutations. Increased STAU1 levels and mTOR activity were seen in human ALS spinal cord tissues as well as in animal models. Changes in STAU1 and mTOR protein levels were post‐transcriptional. Exogenous expression of STAU1 in wildtype cells was sufficient to activate mTOR and downstream targets and form SGs. Targeting STAU1 by RNAi normalized mTOR, suggesting a potential role for therapy in diseases associated with STAU1 overabundance.


Interpretation
STAU1 overabundance in neurodegeneration is a common phenomenon associated with hyperactive mTOR. Targeting STAU1 with ASOs or miRNA viral vectors may represent a novel, efficacious therapy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by overabundant STAU1. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1114–1128</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26068?af=R"/>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 Objective
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy frequently associated with multiple types of seizures. The classical Na+ channel inhibitors are in general ineffective against the seizures in LGS. Rufinamide is a new Na+ channel inhibitor, but approved for the treatment of LGS. This is not consistent with a choice of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) according to simplistic categorical grouping.


Methods
The effect of rufinamide on the Na+ channel, cellular discharges, and seizure behaviors was quantitatively characterized in native neurons and mammalian models of epilepsy, and compared with the other Na+ channel inhibitors.


Results
With a much faster binding rate to the inactivated Na+ channel than phenytoin, rufinamide is distinctively effective if the seizure discharges chiefly involve short bursts interspersed with hyperpolarized interburst intervals, exemplified by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalograms. Consistently, rufinamide, but not phenytoin, suppresses SWD‐associated seizures in pentylenetetrazol or AY‐9944 models, which recapitulate the major electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations in typical and atypical absence seizures, including LGS.


Interpretation
Na+ channel inhibitors shall have sufficiently fast binding to exert an action during the short bursts and then suppress SWDs, in which cases rufinamide is superior. For the epileptiform discharges where the interburst intervals are not so hyperpolarized, phenytoin could be better because of the higher affinity. Na+ channel inhibitors with different binding kinetics and affinity to the inactivated channels may have different antiseizure scope. A rational choice of ASDs according to in‐depth molecular pharmacology and the attributes of ictal discharges is advisable. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1099–1113</content>

 Risk factors for developing dementia from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) probably differ between MCI subtypes. We investigated how frailty relates to dementia risk in amnestic MCI (a‐MCI; n = 2,799) and non‐amnestic MCI (na‐MCI; n = 629) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Although higher frailty increased dementia risk for people with either a‐MCI or na‐MCI, the larger risk was in na‐MCI (interaction hazard ratio = 1.35 [95% confidence interval = 1.15–1.59], p &amp;lt; 0.001). Even after the onset of clinically significant cognitive impairment, poor general health, quantified by a high degree of frailty, is a significant risk for dementia.

 A rapidly expanding catalog of neurogenetic disorders has encouraged a diagnostic shift towards early clinical whole exome sequencing (WES). Adult primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) frequently exhibit neurological manifestations that overlap with other nervous system disorders. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not routinely analyzed in standard clinical WES bioinformatic pipelines. We reanalyzed 11,424 exomes, enriched with neurological diseases, for pathogenic mtDNA variants. Twenty‐four different mtDNA mutations were detected in 64 exomes, 11 of which were considered disease causing based on the associated clinical phenotypes. These findings highlight the diagnostic uplifts gained by analyzing mtDNA from WES data in neurological diseases. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1240–1247</content>

 Although Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is hypothesized to be a prerequisite for multiple sclerosis (MS), up to 15% of children with a diagnosis of MS were reported to be EBV‐seronegative. When re‐evaluating 25 EBV‐seronegative children out of 189 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome/MS, we found anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody in 11 of 25 (44%) EBV‐seronegative but only 9 of 164 (5.5%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) EBV‐seropositive patients. After critical review, MS remained a plausible diagnosis in only 4 of 14 EBV‐seronegative/MOG antibody–negative patients.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 Objective
During PREVENT (NCT01892345), eculizumab significantly reduced relapse risk versus placebo in patients with aquaporin‐4 immunoglobulin G‐positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD). We report an interim analysis of PREVENT's ongoing open‐label extension (OLE; NCT02003144) evaluating eculizumab's long‐term safety and efficacy.


Methods
Patients who completed PREVENT could enroll in the OLE to receive eculizumab (maintenance dose = 1,200 mg/2 weeks, after a blinded induction phase). Safety and efficacy data from PREVENT and its OLE (interim data cut, July 31, 2019) were combined for this analysis.


Results
Across PREVENT and the OLE, 137 patients received eculizumab and were monitored for a median (range) of 133.3 weeks (5.1–276.9 weeks), for a combined total of 362.3 patient‐years (PY). Treatment‐related adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were 183.5 in 100 PY and 8.6 in 100 PY, respectively. Serious infection rates were 10.2 in 100 PY in eculizumab‐treated patients versus 15.1 in 100 PY in the PREVENT placebo group. No patient developed a meningococcal infection. At 192 weeks (3.7 years), 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.6–97.3) of patients remained adjudicated relapse‐free. The adjudicated annualized relapse rate was 0.025 (95% CI = 0.013–0.048) in all eculizumab‐treated patients versus 0.350 (95% CI = 0.199–0.616) in the PREVENT placebo group. During the OLE, 37% of patients (44 of 119 patients) stopped or decreased background immunosuppressive therapy use.


Interpretation
This analysis demonstrates that eculizumab's long‐term safety profile in NMOSD is consistent with its established profile across other indications. This analysis also demonstrated the sustained ability of long‐term eculizumab treatment to reduce relapse risk in patients with AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1088–1098</content>

 In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), early diagnosis is essential for both current and potential treatments. To find a supportive approach for the diagnosis, we constructed an artificial intelligence‐based prediction model of ALS using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Images of spinal motor neurons derived from healthy control subject and ALS patient iPSCs were analyzed by a convolutional neural network, and the algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.97 for classifying healthy control and ALS. This prediction model by deep learning algorithm with iPSC technology could support the diagnosis and may provide proactive treatment of ALS through future prospective research.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Plants of the genus Cannabis have been used by humans for millennia for a variety of purposes. Perhaps most notable is the use of certain Cannabis strains for their psychoactive effects. More recently, several biologically active molecules within the plants of these Cannabis strains, called phytocannabinoids or simply cannabinoids, have been identified. Furthermore, within human cells, endogenous cannabinoids, or endocannabinoids, as well as the receptors and secondary messengers that give rise to their neuromodulatory effects, have also been characterized. This endocannabinoid system (ECS) is composed of two primary ligands—anandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol; two primary receptors—cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2; and several enzymes involved in biosynthesis and degradation of endocannabinoid ligands including diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Here we briefly summarize cannabinoid signaling and review what has been discerned to date with regard to cannabinoid signaling in the auditory system and its roles in normal physiological function as well as pathological conditions. While much has been uncovered regarding cannabinoid signaling in the central nervous system, less attention has been paid to the auditory system specifically. Still, evidence is emerging to suggest that cannabinoid signaling is critical for the development, maturation, function, and survival of cochlear hair cells (HCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Furthermore, cannabinoid signaling can have profound effects on synaptic connectivity in CNS structures related to auditory processing. While clinical cases demonstrate that endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids impact auditory function, this review highlights several areas, such as SGN development, where more research is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As a typical neuropathic pain, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common complication of herpes zoster (HZ), which seriously affects the normal life and work of patients. The unclear pathogenesis and lack of effective drugs make the clinical efficacy of PHN unsatisfactory. Here, we obtained the transcriptome profile of neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) and DRG in rats infected with varicella zoster virus (VZV) by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) combined with publicly available gene array data sets. Next, the data processing of the transcriptome map was analyzed using bioinformatics methods, including the screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Finally, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of calcium-related genes, and calcium fluorescent probes and calcium colorimetry were used to evaluate the distribution and content of calcium ions in cells after VZV infection. Transcriptome data analysis (GO and KEGG enrichment analysis) showed that calcium disorder played an important role in SH-SY5Y cells infected by VZV and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of the PHN rat model. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of calcium-related genes BHLHA15, CACNA1F, CACNG1, CHRNA9, and STC2 were significantly upregulated, while the expression levels of CHRNA10, HRC, and TNNT3 were significantly downregulated in SH-SY5Y cells infected with VZV. Our calcium fluorescent probe and calcium colorimetric test results showed that VZV could change the distribution of calcium ions in infected cells and significantly increase the intracellular calcium content. In conclusion, our results revealed that the persistence of calcium disorder caused by VZV in nerve cells might be a crucial cause of herpetic neuralgia, and a potential target for clinical diagnosis and treatment of PHN.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Rats have been widely used as an experimental organism in psychological, pharmacological, and behavioral studies by modeling human diseases such as neurological disorders. It is critical to identify and characterize cell fate determinants and their regulatory mechanisms in single-cell resolutions across rat brain regions. Here, we applied droplet-based single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) to systematically profile the single-cell chromatin accessibility across four dissected brain areas in adult Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats with a total of 59,023 single nuclei and identified 16 distinct cell types. Interestingly, we found that different cortex regions exhibit diversity in both cellular compositions and gene regulatory regions. Several cell-type-specific transcription factors (TFs), including SPI1, KLF4, KLF6, and NEUROD2, have been shown to play important roles during the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), astrocytic gliomas, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, our single-nucleus atlas of rat cortex could serve as an invaluable resource for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms underlying diverse cortex cell fates and further revealing the regulatory networks of neuropathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Photoacoustic (PA, or optoacoustic, OA) mesoscopy is a powerful tool for mouse cerebral imaging, which offers high resolution three-dimensional (3D) images with optical absorption contrast inside the optically turbid brain. The image quality of a PA mesoscope relies on the ultrasonic transducer which detects the PA signals. An all-optical ultrasound sensor based on a Fabry-Pérot (FP) polymer cavity has the following advantages: broadband frequency response, wide angular coverage and small footprint. Here, we present 3D PA mesoscope for mouse brain imaging using such an optical sensor. A heating laser was used to stabilize the sensor’s cavity length during the imaging process. To acquire data for a 3D angiogram of the mouse brain, the sensor was mounted on a translation stage and raster scanned. 3D images of the mouse brain vasculature were reconstructed which showed cerebrovascular structure up to a depth of 8 mm with high quality. Imaging segmentation and dual wavelength imaging were performed to demonstrate the potential of the system in preclinical brain research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a minimum-invasive surgical approach to non-incisionally cause the thermos-coagulation inside the human brain. The skull score (SS) has already been approved as one of the most dominant factors related to a successful MRgFUS treatment. In this study, we first reveal the SS distribution of the tremor patients, and correlate the SS with the image feature from customized skull density ratio (cSDR). This correlation might give a direction to future clinical studies for improving the SS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Two hundred and forty-six patients received a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, and a bone-enhanced filter was applied and reconstructed to a high spatial resolution CT images. The SS of all patients would be estimated by the MRgFUS system after importing the reconstructed CT images into the MRgFUS system. The histogram and the cumulative distribution of the SS from all the patients were calculated to show the percentage of the patients whose SS lower than 0.3 and 0.4. The same CT images of all patients were utilized to calculated the cSDR by first segmented the trabecular bone and the cortical bone from the CT images and divided the average trabecular bone intensity (aTBI) by the average cortical bone intensity (aCBI). The Pearson’s correlations between the SS and the cSDR, aTBI, and the aCBI were calculated, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were 19.19 and 50% of the patient who had the SS lower than the empirical threshold 0.3 and 0.4, respectively. The Pearson’s correlation between the SS and the cSDR, aCBI, and the aTBI were R = 0.8145, 0.5723, and 0.8842.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Half of the patients were eligible for the MRgFUS thalamotomy based on the SS, and nearly 20% of patients were empirically difficult to achieve a therapeutic temperature during MRgFUS. The SS and our cSDR are highly correlated, and the SS had a higher correlation with aTBI than with aCBI. This is the first report to explicitly reveal the SS population and indicate a potential way to increase the chance to achieve a therapeutic temperature for those who originally have low SS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Pineal gland (PG) is a structure located in the midline of the brain, and is considered as a main part of the epithalamus. There are numerous reports on the facilitatory role of this area for brain function; hormone secretion and its role in sleep cycle are the major reports. However, reports are rarely available on the direct role of this structure in brain cognition and in information processing. A suggestion for the limited number of such studies is the lack of a standard atlas for the PG; none of the available MRI templates and atlases has provided parcellations for this structure. In this study, we used the three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted MRI data of 152 healthy young volunteers, and provided a probabilistic map of the PG in the standard Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space. The methods included collecting the data using a 64-channel head coil on a 3-Tesla Prisma MRI Scanner, manual delineation of the PG by two experts, and robust template and atlas construction algorithms. This atlas is freely accessible, and we hope importing this atlas in the well-known neuroimaging software packages would help to identify other probable roles of the PG in brain function. It could also be used to study pineal cysts, for volumetric analyses, and to test any associations between the cognitive abilities of the human and the structure of the PG.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Are people with a characteristically large physiological sway rendered particularly unstable when standing on a moving surface? Is postural sway in standing individuals idiosyncratic? In this study, we examine postural sway in individuals standing normally, and when subtle continuous sinusoidal disturbances are applied to their support platform. We calculate consistency between conditions to verify if sway can be considered characteristic of each individual. We also correlate two different aspects of participants’ responses to disturbance; their sway velocity and their regulation of body orientation.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Nineteen healthy adults (age 29.2 ± 3.2 years) stood freely on footplates coaxially aligned with their ankles and attached to a motorized platform. They had their eyes closed, and hips and knees locked with a light wooden board attached to their body. Participants either stood quietly on a fixed platform or on a slowly tilting platform (0.1 Hz sinusoid; 0.2 and 0.4 deg). Postural sway size was separated into two entities: (1) the spontaneous sway velocity component (natural random relatively rapid postural adjustments, RMS body angular velocity) and (2) the evoked tilt gain component (much slower 0.1 Hz synchronous tilt induced by the movement of the platform, measured as peak-to-peak (p-p) gain, ratio of body angle to applied footplate rotation).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There was no correlation between the velocity of an individual’s sway and their evoked tilt gain (r = 0.34, p = 0.15 and r = 0.30, p = 0.22). However, when considered separately, each of the two measurements showed fair to good absolute agreement within conditions. Spontaneous sway velocity consistently increased as participants were subjected to increasing disturbance. Participants who swayed more (or less) did so across all conditions [ICC&lt;sub&gt;(3,k)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.95]. Evoked tilt gain also showed consistency between conditions [ICC&lt;sub&gt;(3,k)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.79], but decreased from least to most disturbed conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The two measurements remain consistent between conditions. Consistency between conditions of two very distinct unrelated measurements reflects the idiosyncratic nature of postural sway. However, sway velocity and tilt gain are not related, which supports the idea that the short-term regulation of stability and the longer-term regulation of orientation are controlled by different processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This review article summarizes various functions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) that are related to language processing. To this end, its connectivity with the left-dominant perisylvian language network was considered, as well as its interaction with other functional networks that, directly or indirectly, contribute to language processing. Language-related functions of the DLPFC comprise various aspects of pragmatic processing such as discourse management, integration of prosody, interpretation of nonliteral meanings, inference making, ambiguity resolution, and error repair. Neurophysiologically, the DLPFC seems to be a key region for implementing functional connectivity between the language network and other functional networks, including cortico-cortical as well as subcortical circuits. Considering clinical aspects, damage to the DLPFC causes psychiatric communication deficits rather than typical aphasic language syndromes. Although the number of well-controlled studies on DLPFC language functions is still limited, the DLPFC might be an important target region for the treatment of pragmatic language disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The use of upper limb vibration (ULV) during exercise and rehabilitation continues to gain popularity as a modality to improve function and performance. Currently, a lack of knowledge of the pathways being altered during ULV limits its effective implementation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether indirect ULV modulates transmission along spinal and corticospinal pathways that control the human forearm. All measures were assessed under CONTROL (no vibration) and ULV (30 Hz; 0.4 mm displacement) conditions while participants maintained a small contraction of the right flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle. To assess spinal pathways, Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes) elicited by stimulation of the median nerve were recorded from FCR with motor response (M-wave) amplitudes matched between conditions. An H-reflex conditioning paradigm was also used to assess changes in presynaptic inhibition by stimulating the superficial radial (SR) nerve (5 pulses at 300Hz) 37 ms prior to median nerve stimulation. Cutaneous reflexes in FCR elicited by stimulation of the SR nerve at the wrist were also recorded. To assess corticospinal pathways, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex were recorded from the right FCR and biceps brachii (BB). ULV significantly reduced H-reflex amplitude by 15.7% for both conditioned and unconditioned reflexes (24.0 ± 15.7 vs. 18.4 ± 11.2% M&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;; p &amp;lt; 0.05). Middle latency cutaneous reflexes were also significantly reduced by 20.0% from CONTROL (−1.50 ± 2.1% Mmax) to ULV (−1.73 ± 2.2% Mmax; p &amp;lt; 0.05). There was no significant effect of ULV on MEP amplitude (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Therefore, ULV inhibits cutaneous and H-reflex transmission without influencing corticospinal excitability of the forearm flexors suggesting increased presynaptic inhibition of afferent transmission as a likely mechanism. A general increase in inhibition of spinal pathways with ULV may have important implications for improving rehabilitation for individuals with spasticity (SCI, stroke, MS, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Equilibrium propagation is a learning framework that marks a step forward in the search for a biologically-plausible implementation of deep learning, and could be implemented efficiently in neuromorphic hardware. Previous applications of this framework to layered networks encountered a vanishing gradient problem that has not yet been solved in a simple, biologically-plausible way. In this paper, we demonstrate that the vanishing gradient problem can be mitigated by replacing some of a layered network's connections with random layer-skipping connections in a manner inspired by small-world networks. This approach would be convenient to implement in neuromorphic hardware, and is biologically-plausible.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dopamine is an important chemical messenger in the brain, which modulates movement, reward, motivation, and memory. Different populations of neurons can produce and release dopamine in the brain and regulate different behaviors. Here we focus our discussion on a small but distinct group of dopamine-producing neurons, which display the most profound loss in the ventral substantia nigra pas compacta of patients with Parkinson’s disease. This group of dopaminergic neurons can be readily identified by a selective expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and accounts for 70% of total nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in both human and mouse brains. Recently, we presented the first whole-brain circuit map of these ALDH1A1-positive dopaminergic neurons and reveal an essential physiological function of these neurons in regulating the vigor of movement during the acquisition of motor skills. In this review, we first summarize previous findings of ALDH1A1-positive nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and their connectivity and functionality, and then provide perspectives on how the activity of ALDH1A1-positive nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is regulated through integrating diverse presynaptic inputs and its implications for potential Parkinson’s disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) is common after acute ischemic stroke and adversely affects the quality of life. SCI is associated with an increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Identifying biomarkers which could predict long-term cognitive outcomes of post-stroke SCI is of importance for early intervention. This study aims to investigate the association between circulating neurofilament light (NfL) and long-term cognitive function in patients with post-stroke SCI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal study recruited 304 patients with post-stroke SCI, and serum NfL levels were determined at baseline. These patients were followed up for 12 months for the observation of cognitive change. Cognitive performances were assessed by a Chinese version of the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status-40 (TICS-40) scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The patients were divided into a progression group (as determined by decreased TICS-40 scores) and a stable group (as determined by increased or unchanged TICS-40 scores). The progression group had significantly higher serum NfL levels than the stable group at baseline. Serum NfL levels were predictive for longitudinal cognitive decline during follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings imply that circulating NfL could predict the long-term cognitive change of patients with post-stroke SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebrovascular dysfunction and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular damage to cerebrovessels in AD may result in alterations in vascular clearance mechanisms leading to amyloid deposition around blood vessels and diminished neurovascular-coupling. The sequelae of molecular events leading to these early pathogenic changes remains elusive. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive in-depth molecular characterization of the proteomic changes in enriched cerebrovessel fractions isolated from the inferior frontal gyrus of autopsy AD cases with low (85.5 ± 2.9 yrs) vs. high (81 ± 4.4 yrs) CAA score, aged-matched control (87.4 ± 1.5 yrs) and young healthy control (47 ± 3.3 yrs) cases. We employed a 10-plex tandem isobaric mass tag approach in combination with our ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography MS/MS (Q-Exactive) method. Enriched cerebrovascular fractions showed very high expression levels of proteins specific to endothelial cells, mural cells (pericytes and smooth muscle cells), and astrocytes. We observed 150 significantly regulated proteins in young vs. aged control cerebrovessels. The top pathways significantly modulated with aging included chemokine, reelin, HIF1α and synaptogenesis signaling pathways. There were 213 proteins significantly regulated in aged-matched control vs. high CAA cerebrovessels. The top three pathways significantly altered from this comparison were oxidative phosphorylation, Sirtuin signaling pathway and TCA cycle II. Comparison between low vs. high CAA cerebrovessels identified 84 significantly regulated proteins. Top three pathways significantly altered between low vs. high CAA cerebrovessels included TCA Cycle II, Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, high CAA cases included more advanced AD pathology thus cerebrovascular effects may be driven by the severity of amyloid and Tangle pathology. These descriptive proteomic changes provide novel insights to explain the age-related and AD-related cerebrovascular changes contributing to AD pathogenesis. Particularly, disturbances in energy bioenergetics and mitochondrial biology rank among the top AD pathways altered in cerebrovessels. Targeting these failed mechanisms in endothelia and mural cells may provide novel disease modifying targets for developing therapeutic strategies against cerebrovascular deterioration and promoting cerebral perfusion in AD. Our future work will focus on interrogating and validating these novel targets and pathways and their functional significance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective
To characterize patients with extracranial giant cell arteritis with intracranial involvement.


Methods
In a multicenter retrospective study we included 31 patients with systemic GCA with intracranial involvement. Clinical characteristics, pattern of arterial involvement and cytokine profiles were assessed. Patients with GCA without intracranial involvement (n = 17), and with intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 25) served as controls.


Results
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 18 (69.2%) patients with and in 16 (100%) without intracranial involvement (P = 0.02). Headache was complained by 15 (50.0%) patients with and 13 (76.5%) patients without intracranial involvement (P = 0.03). Posterior circulation arteries were affected in 26 (83.9%), anterior circulation arteries in 17 (54.8%) and both territories in 12 (38.7%) patients. Patients with GCA had vertebral artery stenosis proximal and, in contrast, patients with atherosclerosis distal to the origin of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Among patients with GCA with intracranial involvement, 11 (37.9%) patients had a rapid progressive disease course characterized by short‐term recurrent ischemic events. The median mRS at follow‐up in these patients was 4 (IQR 2.0–6.0) and 4 (36.4%) patients died. Vessel wall expression of IL6 and IL17 was significantly increased in patients with rapid progressive course.


Interpretation
Typical characteristics of GCA, headache and an elevated ESR, are frequently absent in patients with intracranial involvement. However, differentiation of intracranial GCA from atherosclerosis can be facilitated by the typical pattern of vertebral artery stenosis. About one‐third of patients with intracranial GCA had a rapid progressive course with poor outcome. IL17 and IL6 may represent potential future treatment targets.

 Abstract
The hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex are implicated in both episodic memory and encoding of position in an environment. In the present study, we examine the impact of locomotor behaviors associated with movement in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions on population activity patterns in these two brain structures. We utilized a five‐looped, squared spiral track containing stair segments, ramp segments, and flat segments. In addition to encoding locations along the full route, posterior parietal cortex population activity demonstrates strong pattern recurrence for similar action types at different locations in the environment. Additionally, posterior parietal and hippocampal neurons exhibit parallel modulation in the scale of representation that follows behavioral dynamics required for track traversal. These findings build on prior work examining spatial mapping in the vertical dimension and provide a better understanding of how a series of actions and visited locations can be coordinated in the generation of episodic memory.</content>

Depression is characterized by deficits in the reinforcement learning (RL) process. Although many computational and neural studies have extended our knowledge of the impact of depression on RL, most focus on habitual control (model-free RL), yielding a relatively poor understanding of goal-directed control (model-based RL) and arbitration control to find a balance between the two. We investigated the effects of subclinical depression on model-based and model-free learning in the prefrontal–striatal circuitry. First, we found that subclinical depression is associated with the attenuated state and reward prediction error representation in the insula and caudate. Critically, we found that it accompanies the disrupted arbitration control between model-based and model-free learning in the predominantly inferior lateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar cortex. We also found that depression undermines the ability to exploit viable options, called exploitation sensitivity. These findings characterize how subclinical depression influences different levels of the decision-making hierarchy, advancing previous conflicting views that depression simply influences either habitual or goal-directed control. Our study creates possibilities for various clinical applications, such as early diagnosis and behavioral therapy design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9aeQWxZ7b3A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Extracellular recording is an accessible technique used in animals and humans to study the brain physiology and pathology. As the number of recording channels and their density grows it is natural to ask how much improvement the additional channels bring in and how we can optimally use the new capabilities for monitoring the brain. Here we show that for any given distribution of electrodes we can establish exactly what information about current sources in the brain can be recovered and what information is strictly unobservable. We demonstrate this in the general setting of previously proposed kernel Current Source Density method and illustrate it with simplified examples as well as using evoked potentials from the barrel cortex obtained with a Neuropixels probe and with compatible model data. We show that with conceptual separation of the estimation space from experimental setup one can recover sources not accessible to standard methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wu2qYM5r6Go&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Dual‐labeling immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing were used to characterize neurons in the basolateral amygdala that express SMI‐32+ nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs). Most of the neurons with strong somatic and dendritic expression of NNFs were parvalbumin+ (PV+) interneurons, as well as nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs) that project to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. The graphical abstract shows six SMI‐32+ neurons (diffuse brown staining); five are also stained for PV (blue particulate staining) and one is PV‐negative (arrow). Studies in the cortex suggest that the SMI‐32+ neurons identified in this study may be especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) containing nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (NNFs) localized with the SMI‐32 monoclonal antibody have been shown to be especially vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present investigation is the first to study the expression of SMI‐32+ NNFs in neurons of the basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala (BNC), which contains cortex‐like PNs and nonpyramidal neurons (NPNs). We observed that PNs in the rat basolateral nucleus (BL), but not in the lateral (LAT) or basomedial (BM) nuclei, have significant levels of SMI‐32‐ir in their somata with antibody diluents that did not contain Triton X‐100, but staining in these cells was greatly attenuated when the antibody diluent contained 0.3% Triton. Using Triton‐containing diluents, we found that all SMI‐32+ neurons in all three of the BNC nuclei were NPNs. Using a dual‐labeling immunoperoxidase technique, we demonstrated that most of these SMI‐32+ NPNs were parvalbumin‐positive (PV+) or somatostatin‐positive NPNs but not vasoactive intestinal peptide‐positive or neuropeptide Y‐positive NPNs. Using a technique that combines retrograde tracing with SMI‐32 immunohistochemistry using intermediate levels of Triton in the diluent, we found that all BNC neurons projecting to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) were large NPNs, and most were SMI‐32+. In contrast, BNC neurons projecting to the ventral striatum or cerebral cortex were PNs that expressed low levels of SMI‐32 immunoreactivity (SMI‐32‐ir) in the BL, and no SMI‐32‐ir in the LAT or BM. These data suggest that the main neuronal subpopulations in the BNC that degenerate in AD may be PV+ and MD‐projecting NPNs.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Why can we still not translate preclinical research to clinical treatments for acute strokes? Despite &amp;gt; 1000 successful preclinical studies, drugs, and concepts for acute stroke, only two have reached clinical translation. This is the translational block. Yet, we continue to routinely model strokes using almost the same concepts we have used for over 30 years. Methodological improvements and criteria from the last decade have shed some light but have not solved the problem. In this conceptual analysis, we review the current status and reappraise it by thinking “out-of-the-box” and over the edges. As such, we query why other scientific fields have also faced the same translational failures, to find common denominators. In parallel, we query how migraine, multiple sclerosis, and hypothermia in hypoxic encephalopathy have achieved significant translation successes. Should we view ischemic stroke as a “chronic, relapsing, vascular” disease, then secondary prevention strategies are also a successful translation. Finally, based on the lessons learned, we propose how stroke should be modeled, and how preclinical and clinical scientists, editors, grant reviewers, and industry should reconsider their routine way of conducting research. Translational success for stroke treatments may eventually require a bold change with solutions that are outside of the box.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The early detection and grading of gliomas is important for treatment decision and assessment of prognosis. Over the last decade numerous automated computer analysis tools have been proposed, which can potentially lead to more reliable and reproducible brain tumor diagnostic procedures. In this paper, we used the gradient-based features extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images to depict the subtle changes within brains of patients with gliomas. Based on the gradient features, we proposed a novel two-phase classification framework for detection and grading of gliomas. In the first phase, the probability of each local feature being related to different types (e.g., diseased or healthy for detection, benign or malignant for grading) was calculated. Then the high-level feature representing the whole MRI image was generated by concatenating the membership probability of each local feature. In the second phase, the supervised classification algorithm was used to train a classifier based on the high-level features and patient labels of the training subjects. We applied this framework on the brain imaging data collected from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for glioma detection, and the public TCIA datasets including glioblastomas (WHO IV) and low-grade gliomas (WHO II and III) data for glioma grading. The experimental results showed that the gradient-based classification framework could be a promising tool for automatic diagnosis of brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurological injuries such as strokes can lead to important loss in motor function. Thanks to neuronal plasticity, some of the lost functionality may be recovered over time. However, the recovery process is often slow and incomplete, despite the most effective conventional rehabilitation therapies. As we improve our understanding of the rules governing activity-dependent plasticity, neuromodulation interventions are being developed to harness neural plasticity to achieve faster and more complete recovery. Here, we review the principles underlying stimulation-driven plasticity as well as the most commonly used stimulation techniques and approaches. We argue that increased spatiotemporal precision is an important factor to improve the efficacy of neurostimulation and drive a more useful neuronal reorganization. Consequently, closed-loop systems and optogenetic stimulation hold theoretical promise as interventions to promote brain repair after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Training under high interference conditions through interleaved practice (IP) results in performance suppression during training but enhances long-term performance relative to repetitive practice (RP) involving low interference. Previous neuroimaging work addressing this contextual interference effect of motor learning has relied heavily on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology resulting in mixed reports of prefrontal cortex (PFC) recruitment under IP and RP conditions. We sought to clarify these equivocal findings by imaging bilateral PFC recruitment using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while discrete key pressing sequences were trained under IP and RP schedules and subsequently tested following a 24-h delay. An advantage of fNIRS over the fMRI BOLD response is that the former measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes independently allowing for assessment of cortical hemodynamics even when there is neurovascular decoupling. Despite slower sequence performance durations under IP, bilateral PFC oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin values did not differ between practice conditions. During test, however, slower performance from those previously trained under RP coincided with hemispheric asymmetry in PFC recruitment. Specifically, following RP, test deoxygenated hemoglobin values were significantly lower in the right PFC. The present findings contrast with previous behavioral demonstrations of increased cognitive demand under IP to illustrate a more complex involvement of the PFC in the contextual interference effect. IP and RP incur similar levels of bilateral PFC recruitment, but the processes underlying the recruitment are dissimilar. PFC recruitment during IP supports action reconstruction and memory elaboration while RP relies on PFC recruitment to maintain task variation information in working memory from trial to trial. While PFC recruitment under RP serves to enhance immediate performance, it does not support long-term performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Social media platforms offer convenient, instantaneous social sharing on a mass scale with tremendous impact on public perceptions, opinions, and behavior. There is a need to understand why information spreads including the human motivations, cognitive processes, and neural dynamics of large-scale sharing. This study introduces a novel approach for investigating the effect social media messaging and in-person discussion has on the inter-brain dynamics within small groups of participants. The psychophysiological impact of information campaigns and narrative messaging within a closed social media environment was assessed using 24-channel wireless EEG. Data were acquired from three- or four-person groups while subjects debated contemporary social issues framed by four scenarios of varying controversy: (a) investing in ethical vs. unethical corporations, (b) selecting travel destination based on social awareness, (c) determining verdict in a murder trial and the punishment of life in prison or death penalty, and (d) decision to vaccinate. Pre-/post-scenario questionnaires assess the effects of the social media information. Inter-brain coherence between subject pairs on each social issue discussed by subjects was analyzed by concordance, agreement vs. disagreement, and by group unanimity, unanimous vs. not unanimous. Subject pairs that agreed on the social issues raised in the scenarios had significantly greater inter-brain coherence in gamma frequency range than disagreeing pairs over cortical regions known to be involved in social interactions. These effects were magnified when comparing groups where subject pairs were unanimous in their stance on the social issues for some but not all scenarios. While there was considerable overlap between scenarios in what EEG channels were significant, there was enough variability to indicate the possibility of scenario-specific effects on inter-brain coherence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dizocilpine (MK-801), a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDA-R) antagonist, can induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in healthy individuals, implicating NMDA-R hypofunction in disease pathogenesis. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also implicated in schizophrenia, and expression is regulated by NMDA-R activity, suggesting a functional link. We previously found that BDNF signaling was upregulated by MK-801 in cultured hippocampal astrocytes, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. To address this issue, the levels of BDNF expression and secretion were evaluated in hippocampal astrocytes incubated with MK-801 by ELISA and qPCR, with and without NMDA co-incubation or pretreatment of either the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059 or the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. The apoptosis, viability, and proliferation of the astrocytes were also examined. In the current study, we demonstrate that MK-801 treatment (20 μM for 5 days) enhances the proliferation of rat cultured hippocampal astrocytes. Expression of BDNF mRNA was enhanced after 24 h in MK-801, but returned to near baseline over the next 24 h in the continued presence of MK-801. However, two successive 24-h treatments enhanced BDNF expression. These application regimens had no effect on apoptosis or proliferation rate. Co-addition of NMDA significantly inhibited MK-801-induced upregulation of BDNF. Similarly, MK-801-induced BDNF upregulation was blocked by pretreatment with inhibitors of PI3K and ERK1/2, but not by inhibitors of p38 and JNK. These findings suggested that astrocytes may contribute to the acute neurological and behavioral response to MK-801 treatment via a transient increase in BDNF expression involving NMDA-R–PI3K–ERK signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A secondary injury induced by a spinal cord injury (SCI) remains the main cause of devastating neural dysfunction; therefore, it has been the subject of focused research for many years. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been found to participate in the SCI process, and this finding presents a high potential for diagnosis and treatment; however, the role of lncRNA in a secondary injury induced by SCI remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory effect of lncRNA growth arrest–specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in secondary injury during SCI. The SCI mice model and hypoxic cellular model were established to research the roles of lncRNA GAS5 during SCI. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to determine the expression levels of microR-93 (miR-93) and lncRNA GAS5. Western blot analysis of the apoptosis regulator protein and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was conducted to evaluate neuron cell apoptosis. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were calculated to assess neurological function. Flow cytometry was used to determine neuron cell apoptosis. The associations among GAS5, miR-93, and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were disclosed using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, RNA pulldown assay, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. QRT-PCR demonstrated that GAS5 was significantly upregulated in both the SCI mice and hypoxic cellular models. GAS5 knockdown suppressed neuron cell apoptosis and inflammatory response in the SCI mice model. Further studies have indicated that GAS5 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-93 in neuronal cells. In addition, PTEN was a target of miR-93, and GAS5 knockdown exhibited its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects through the miR-93/PTEN axis. These findings suggest that the GAS5/miR-93/PTEN axis may be a promising therapeutic target for SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Dementia is a gradual decline in cognitive ability and is becoming more common in our elderly population. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as a slight clinical deterioration of memory capacity, below the level of normal aging, but does not constitute a clinical diagnosis of dementia. To date, no interventions have been proven to cure MCI and dementia fully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purpose: To evaluate the potential effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and evaluate the methodological quality of systematic reviews (SRs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We conducted a literature search for SRs with meta-analyses in seven Chinese and international databases through October 1, 2020. The basic characteristics of the included SRs/meta-analyses and the basic information of the original included randomized controlled trials were extracted by three reviewers independently. A meta-analysis of the original randomized controlled trials from the included SRs/meta-analyses was performed using Stata 12.0 software. The Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 was used to assess the methodological quality of the included SRs/meta-analyses, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was used to rate the quality of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 35 SRs/meta-analyses were included, and the majority showed that acupuncture was more effective than western medicine or conventional therapy for MCI and dementia [odds ratio =1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24, 1.56]. There was a statistically significant difference in the Mini-Mental State Examination score (weighted mean difference = 1.23; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.68; p &amp;lt; 0.00001), and there was no significant improvement in the activities of daily living score (weighted mean difference = 1.58; 95% CI: −0.02, 3.18; p = 0.053). The assessment results of Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 showed that the methodological quality of most included SRs/meta-analyses was critically low; the lowest scores were items 2, 7, and 10. For Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, of the 73 outcomes, 50 (68.5%) outcomes were low or very low quality, and 23 (31.5%) outcomes were moderate quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Acupuncture can be considered as an alternative for the treatment of MCI and dementia when western medicine or other therapies are contraindicated. More high-quality evidence is needed to determine further the effectiveness of acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, the incidence of which is significantly increased in elderly patients. One of the long-lasting effects of sepsis is cognitive impairment defined as a new deficit or exacerbation of preexisting deficits in global cognition or executive function. Normal brain function is dependent on moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow to match the increased demands of active brain regions. This homeostatic mechanism, termed neurovascular coupling (NVC, also known as functional hyperemia), is critically dependent on the production of vasodilator NO by microvascular endothelial cells in response to mediators released from activated astrocytes. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that sepsis in aging leads to impairment of NVC responses early after treatment and that this neurovascular dysfunction associates with impairments in cognitive performance and vascular endothelial dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we used a commonly studied bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, to induce sepsis in experimental animals (males, 24 months of age) and subjected experimental animals to a standard clinical protocol of 3 doses of ampicillin i.p. and 14 days of amoxicillin added to the drinking water. NVC responses, endothelial function and cognitive performance were measured in septic and age-matched control groups within 14 days after the final antibiotic treatment. Our data demonstrate that sepsis in aging significantly impairs NVC responses measured in somatosensory cortex during whisker stimulation, significantly impairs endothelial function in isolated and pressure cannulated aorta rings in response to acetylcholine stimulation. No significant impairment of cognitive function in post-sepsis aged animals has been observed when measured using the PhenoTyper homecage based system. Our findings suggest that sepsis-associated endothelial dysfunction and impairment of NVC responses may contribute to long-term cognitive deficits in older sepsis survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The mitochondrial ATP synthase emerges as key hub of cellular functions controlling the production of ATP, cellular signaling, and fate. It is regulated by the ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), which is highly abundant in neurons. Herein, we ablated or overexpressed IF1 in mouse neurons to show that IF1 dose defines the fraction of active/inactive enzyme in vivo, thereby controlling mitochondrial function and the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses indicate that IF1 dose regulates mitochondrial metabolism, synaptic function, and cognition. Ablation of IF1 impairs memory, whereas synaptic transmission and learning are enhanced by IF1 overexpression. Mechanistically, quenching the IF1-mediated increase in mtROS production in mice overexpressing IF1 reduces the increased synaptic transmission and obliterates the learning advantage afforded by the higher IF1 content. Overall, IF1 plays a key role in neuronal function by regulating the fraction of ATP synthase responsible for mitohormetic mtROS signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/q6ZupBs9I6E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/VtERbAWvuPU/article"/>

 &lt;p&gt;by Jordi van Gestel, Andreas Wagner&lt;/p&gt;

The repeated evolution of multicellularity led to a wide diversity of organisms, many of which are sessile, including land plants, many fungi, and colonial animals. Sessile organisms adhere to a surface for most of their lives, where they grow and compete for space. Despite the prevalence of surface-associated multicellularity, little is known about its evolutionary origin. Here, we introduce a novel theoretical approach, based on spatial lineage tracking of cells, to study this origin. We show that multicellularity can rapidly evolve from two widespread cellular properties: cell adhesion and the regulatory control of adhesion. By evolving adhesion, cells attach to a surface, where they spontaneously give rise to primitive cell collectives that differ in size, life span, and mode of propagation. Selection in favor of large collectives increases the fraction of adhesive cells until a surface becomes fully occupied. Through kin recognition, collectives then evolve a central-peripheral polarity in cell adhesion that supports a division of labor between cells and profoundly impacts growth. Despite this spatial organization, nascent collectives remain cryptic, lack well-defined boundaries, and would require experimental lineage tracking technologies for their identification. Our results suggest that cryptic multicellularity could readily evolve and originate well before multicellular individuals become morphologically evident.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VtERbAWvuPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation. Genetic forms of FTLD and ALS are caused by pathogenic variants in various genes, such as PGRN (progranulin). To date, depletion of parkin E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a key mitophagy regulator, has been reported in sporadic ALS patients and ALS mice models with TDP-43 proteinopathy. In this work, we show parkin downregulation also in fibroblasts derived from FTLD patients with four different PGRN pathogenic variants. We corroborate this finding in control fibroblasts upon PGRN silencing, demonstrating additionally the decrease of parkin downstream targets, mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). Importantly, we show that TDP-43 overexpression rescues PRKN levels upon transient PGRN silencing, but not in FTLD fibroblasts with PGRN pathogenic variants, despite upregulating PGRN levels in both cases. Further observation of PRKN downregulation upon TDP-43 silencing, suggests that TDP-43 loss-of-function contributes to PRKN decrease. Our results provide further evidence that parkin downregulation might be a common and systemic phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases with TDP- 43 loss-of-function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A common hypothesis explains autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a neurodevelopmental disorder linked to excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance in neuronal network connectivity. Mutation of genes including Met and downstream signaling components, e.g., PTEN, Tsc2 and, Rheb are involved in the control of synapse formation and stabilization and were all considered as risk genes for ASD. While the impact of Met on glutamatergic synapses was widely appreciated, its contribution to the stability of inhibitory, GABAergic synapses is poorly understood. The stabilization of GABAergic synapses depends on clustering of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin. Here, we show in vivo and in vitro that Met is necessary and sufficient for the stabilization of GABAergic synapses via induction of gephyrin clustering. Likewise, we provide evidence for Met-dependent gephyrin clustering via activation of mTOR. Our results support the notion that deficient GABAergic signaling represents a pathomechanism for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are constituted of abnormally phosphorylated tau, is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The oligomeric aggregates of tau in AD brain (AD O-tau) are believed to trigger NFT spreading by seeding normal tau aggregation as toxic seeds, in a prion-like fashion. Here, we revealed the features of AD O-tau by Western blots using antibodies against various epitopes and determined the effect of dephosphorylation on the seeding activity of AD O-tau by capture and seeded aggregation assays. We found that N-terminal truncated and C-terminalhyperphosphorylated tau species were enriched in AD O-tau. Dephosphorylation of AD O-tau by alkaline phosphatasediminished its activity in capturing tau in vitro and ininducing insoluble aggregates in cultured cells. Our resultssuggested that dephosphorylation passivated the seeding activity ofAD O-tau. Inhibition of phosphorylation may be a potentstrategy to prevent the spreading of tau patho3logy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Purpose&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether combining multiple radiomics signatures derived from the subregions of glioblastoma (GBM) can improve survival prediction of patients with GBM.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In total, 129 patients were included in this study and split into training (n = 99) and test (n = 30) cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from each tumor region then radiomics scores were obtained separately using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) COX regression. A clinical nomogram was also constructed using various clinical risk factors. Radiomics nomograms were constructed by combing a single radiomics signature from the whole tumor region with clinical risk factors or combining three radiomics signatures from three tumor subregions with clinical risk factors. The performance of these models was assessed by the discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness metrics, and was compared with that of the clinical nomogram.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Incorporating the three radiomics signatures, i.e., Radscores for ET, NET, and ED, into the radiomics-based nomogram improved the performance in estimating survival (C-index: training/test cohort: 0.717/0.655) compared with that of the clinical nomogram (C-index: training/test cohort: 0.633/0.560) and that of the radiomics nomogram based on single region radiomics signatures (C-index: training/test cohort: 0.656/0.535).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The multiregional radiomics nomogram exhibited a favorable survival stratification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.677106"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Since each individual subject may present completely different encephalogram (EEG) patterns with respect to other subjects, existing subject-independent emotion classifiers trained on data sampled from cross-subjects or cross-dataset generally fail to achieve sound accuracy. In this scenario, the domain adaptation technique could be employed to address this problem, which has recently got extensive attention due to its effectiveness on cross-distribution learning. Focusing on cross-subject or cross-dataset automated emotion recognition with EEG features, we propose in this article a robust multi-source co-adaptation framework by mining diverse correlation information (MACI) among domains and features with l&lt;sub&gt;2,1&lt;/sub&gt;−norm as well as correlation metric regularization. Specifically, by minimizing the statistical and semantic distribution differences between source and target domains, multiple subject-invariant classifiers can be learned together in a joint framework, which can make MACI use relevant knowledge from multiple sources by exploiting the developed correlation metric function. Comprehensive experimental evidence on DEAP and SEED datasets verifies the better performance of MACI in EEG-based emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
