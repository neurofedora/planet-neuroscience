                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cognition is shaped by signals from outside and within the body. Following recent evidence of interoceptive signals modulating higher-level cognition, we examined whether breathing changes the production and perception of quantities. In Experiment 1, 22 adults verbally produced on average larger random numbers after inhaling than after exhaling. In Experiment 2, 24 further adults estimated the numerosity of dot patterns that were briefly shown after either inhaling or exhaling. Again, we obtained on average larger responses following inhalation than exhalation. These converging results extend models of situated cognition according to which higher-level cognition is sensitive to transient interoceptive states.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Homeostatic plasticity maintains network stability by adjusting excitation, inhibition, or the intrinsic excitability of neurons, but the developmental regulation and coordination of these distinct forms of homeostatic plasticity remains poorly understood. A major contributor to this information gap is the lack of a uniform paradigm for chronically manipulating activity at different developmental stages. To overcome this limitation, we utilized Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to directly suppress neuronal activity in layer (L) 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) at two important developmental timepoints: the classic visual system critical period (CP, P24-29), and adulthood (P45-55). We show that 24 hours of DREADD-mediated activity suppression simultaneously induces excitatory synaptic scaling up and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons during the CP, consistent with previous observations using prolonged visual deprivation. Importantly, manipulations known to block these forms of homeostatic plasticity when induced pharmacologically or via visual deprivation also prevented DREADD-induced homeostatic plasticity. We next used the same paradigm to suppress activity in adult animals. Surprisingly, while excitatory synaptic scaling persisted into adulthood, intrinsic homeostatic plasticity was completely absent. Finally, we found that homeostatic changes in quantal inhibitory input onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons were absent during the CP but present in adults. Thus, the same population of neurons can express distinct sets of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms at different development stages. Our findings suggest that homeostatic forms of plasticity can be recruited in a modular manner according to the evolving needs of a developing neural circuit.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Encoding and retrieval of memory are two processes serving distinct biological purposes but operating in highly overlapping brain circuits. It is unclear how the two processes are coordinated in the same brain regions, especially in the hippocampal CA1 region where the two processes converge at the cellular level. Here we find that the neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF)-positive interneurons at stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) in CA1 play opposite roles in memory encoding and retrieval. These interneurons show high activities in learning and low activities in recall. Increasing their activity facilitates learning but impairs recall. They inhibit the entorhinal- but dis-inhibit the CA3- inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells and thereby either suppress or elevate CA1 pyramidal cells' activity depending on animal's behavioral states. Thus, by coordinating entorhinal- and CA3- dual inputs to CA1, these SLM interneurons are key to switching the hippocampus between encoding and retrieval modes.</content>

 Abstract
The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. There is still no available disease‐modifying strategy against PD, whose management is mainly symptomatic. A growing amount of preclinical evidence shows that a complex interplay between autophagy dysregulation, mitochondrial impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and excessive neuroinflammation underlies PD pathogenesis. Identifying key molecules linking these pathological cellular processes may substantially aid in our deeper understanding of PD pathophysiology and the development of novel effective therapeutic approaches. Emerging preclinical evidence indicates that apelin, an endogenous neuropeptide acting as a ligand of the orphan G protein‐coupled receptor APJ, may play a key neuroprotective role in PD pathogenesis, via inhibition of apoptosis and dopaminergic neuronal loss, autophagy enhancement, antioxidant effects, endoplasmic reticulum stress suppression, as well as prevention of synaptic dysregulation in the striatum, excessive neuroinflammation, and glutamate‐induced excitotoxicity. Underlying signaling pathways involve phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 1/2, and inositol requiring kinase 1α/XBP1/C/EBP homologous protein. Herein, we discuss the role of apelin/APJ axis and associated molecular mechanisms on the pathogenesis of PD in vitro and in vivo and provide evidence for its challenging therapeutic potential.</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 The upregulation of 14‐3‐3ζ facilitates the transformation of labile object recognition memory (ORM) into stable ORM and causes the increase in brain‐derived growth factor (BDNF) expression, which further aids in the consolidation of newly formed ORM to long‐term memory. The blockage of either 14‐3‐3ζ or BDNF expression abolishes the formation of long‐term ORM (LT‐ORM).

Abstract
The consolidation of new memories into long‐lasting memories is multistage process characterized by distinct temporal dynamics. However, our understanding on the initial stage of transformation of labile memory of recent experience into stable memory remains elusive. Here, with the use of rats and mice overexpressing a memory enhancer called regulator of G protein signaling 14 of 414 amino acids (RGS14414) as a tool, we show that the expression of RGS14414 in male rats' perirhinal cortex (PRh), which is a brain area crucial for object recognition memory (ORM), enhanced the ORM to the extent that it caused the conversion of labile short‐term ORM (ST‐ORM) expected to last for 40 min into stable long‐term ORM (LT‐ORM) traceable after a delay of 24 hr, and that the temporal window of 40 to 60 min after object exposure not only was key for this conversion but also was the time frame when a surge in 14‐3‐3ζ protein was observed. A knockdown of 14‐3‐3ζ gene abrogated both the increase in 14‐3‐3ζ protein and the formation of LT‐ORM. Furthermore, this 14‐3‐3ζ upregulation increased brain‐derived growth factor (BDNF) levels in the time frame of 60 min and 24 hr and 14‐3‐3ζ knockdown decreased the BDNF levels, and a deletion of BDNF gene produced loss in mice ability to form LT‐ORM. Thus, within 60 min of object exposure, 14‐3‐3ζ facilitated the conversion of labile ORM into stable ORM, whereas beyond the 60 min, it mediated the consolidation of the stable memory into long‐lasting ORM by regulating BDNF signaling.</content>

 Here, we employed the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) model of compulsive‐like behavioral persistence to investigate possible associations between stereotypic motor behavior and cognitive flexibility as measured in the T‐maze continuous alternation task. H but not N animals presented with istradefylline‐sensitive spontaneous alternation and stereotypy, in that istradefylline at both doses significantly improved the spontaneous alternation scores and attenuated the stereotypical expression of H animals.

Abstract
Repetitive behavioral phenotypes are a trait of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD). Such behaviors are typified by complex interactions between cognitive and neurobiological processes which most likely contribute to the suboptimal treatment responses often observed. To this end, exploration of the adenosinergic system may be useful, since adenosine‐receptor modulation has previously shown promise to restore control over voluntary behavior and improve cognition in patients presenting with motor repetition. Here, we employed the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) model of compulsive‐like behavioral persistence, seeking to investigate possible associations between stereotypic motor behavior and cognitive flexibility as measured in the T‐maze continuous alternation task (T‐CAT). The effect of istradefylline, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist at two doses (10 and 20 mg kg−1 day−1) on the expression of stereotypy and T‐CAT performance in high (H) and non‐(N) stereotypical animals, was investigated in comparison to a control intervention (six groups; n = 8 or 9 per group). No correlation between H behavior and T‐CAT performance was found. However, H but not N animals presented with istradefylline‐sensitive spontaneous alternation and stereotypy, in that istradefylline at both doses significantly improved the spontaneous alternation scores and attenuated the stereotypical expression of H animals. Thus, evidence is presented that anti‐adenosinergic drug action improves repetitive behavior and spontaneous alternation in stereotypical deer mice, putatively pointing to a shared psychobiological construct underlying naturalistic stereotypy and alterations in cognitive flexibility in deer mice.</content>

Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as intermediate hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the etiological agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. As neuropeptide signaling in host snails can be altered by trematode infection, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptide precursors in Biomphalaria glabrata, the major intermediate host for S. mansoni in the Western Hemisphere. Three transcripts that encode peptides belonging to the FMRF‐NH2‐related peptide (FaRP) family were identified in B. glabrata. One transcript encoded a precursor polypeptide (Bgl‐FaRP1; 292 amino acids) that included eight copies of the tetrapeptide FMRF‐NH2 and single copies of FIRF‐NH2, FLRF‐NH2, and pQFYRI‐NH2. The second transcript encoded a precursor (Bgl‐FaRP2; 347 amino acids) that comprised 14 copies of the heptapeptide GDPFLRF‐NH2 and 1 copy of SKPYMRF‐NH2. The precursor encoded by the third transcript (Bgl‐FaRP3; 287 amino acids) recapitulated Bgl‐FaRP2 but lacked the full SKPYMRF‐NH2 peptide. The three precursors shared a common signal peptide, suggesting a genomic organization described previously in gastropods. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on the nervous systems of B. glabrata and B. alexandrina, a major intermediate host for S. mansoni in Egypt. FMRF‐NH2‐like immunoreactive (FMRF‐NH2‐li) neurons were located in regions of the central nervous system associated with reproduction, feeding, and cardiorespiration. Antisera raised against non‐FMRF‐NH2 peptides present in the tetrapeptide and heptapeptide precursors labeled independent subsets of the FMRF‐NH2‐li neurons. This study supports the participation of FMRF‐NH2‐related neuropeptides in the regulation of vital physiological and behavioral systems that are altered by parasitism in Biomphalaria.</content>

&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; is a serious human and animal pathogen threat exhibiting extraordinary capacity for acquiring new antibiotic resistance traits in the pathogen population worldwide.
The development of fast, affordable and effective diagnostic solutions capable of discriminating between antibiotic-resistant and susceptible &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; strains would be of huge benefit for effective disease detection and treatment. Here we develop a diagnostics solution that uses Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation–Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and machine learning, to identify signature profiles of antibiotic resistance to either multidrug or benzylpenicillin in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Using ten different supervised learning techniques, we have analysed a set of 82 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; isolates collected from 67 cows diagnosed with bovine mastitis across 24 farms. For the multidrug phenotyping analysis, LDA, linear SVM, RBF SVM, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, MLP neural network and QDA had Cohen’s kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin phenotyping analysis, RBF SVM, MLP neural network, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, linear SVM, QDA, LDA, and random forests had Cohen’s kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin the diagnostic systems achieved up to (mean result ± standard deviation over 30 runs on the test set): accuracy = 97.54% ± 1.91%, sensitivity = 99.93% ± 0.25%, specificity = 95.04% ± 3.83%, and Cohen’s kappa = 95.04% ± 3.83%. Moreover, the diagnostic platform complemented by a protein-protein network and 3D structural protein information framework allowed the identification of five molecular determinants underlying the susceptible and resistant profiles. Four proteins were able to classify multidrug-resistant and susceptible strains with 96.81% ± 0.43% accuracy. Five proteins, including the previous four, were able to classify benzylpenicillin resistant and susceptible strains with 97.54% ± 1.91% accuracy. Our approach may open up new avenues for the development of a fast, affordable and effective day-to-day diagnostic solution, which would offer new opportunities for targeting resistant bacteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h7E2Q_2fGQQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We present a general physicochemical sampling model for olfaction, based on established pharmacological laws, in which arbitrary combinations of odorant ligands and receptors can be generated and their individual and collective effects on odor representations and olfactory performance measured. Individual odor ligands exhibit receptor-specific affinities and efficacies; that is, they may bind strongly or weakly to a given receptor, and can act as strong agonists, weak agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists. Ligands interacting with common receptors compete with one another for dwell time; these competitive interactions appropriately simulate the degeneracy that fundamentally defines the capacities and limitations of odorant sampling. The outcome of these competing ligand-receptor interactions yields a pattern of receptor activation levels, thereafter mapped to glomerular presynaptic activation levels based on the convergence of sensory neuron axons. The metric of greatest interest is the mean discrimination sensitivity, a measure of how effectively the olfactory system at this level is able to recognize a small change in the physicochemical quality of a stimulus. This model presents several significant outcomes, both expected and surprising. First, adding additional receptors reliably improves the system’s discrimination sensitivity. Second, in contrast, adding additional ligands to an odor scene initially can improve discrimination sensitivity, but eventually will reduce it as the number of ligands increases. Third, the presence of antagonistic ligand-receptor interactions produced clear benefits for sensory system performance, generating higher absolute discrimination sensitivities and increasing the numbers of competing ligands that could be present before discrimination sensitivity began to be impaired. Finally, the model correctly reflects and explains the modest reduction in odor discrimination sensitivity exhibited by transgenic mice in which the specificity of glomerular targeting by primary olfactory neurons is partially disrupted.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QetEW3-tyP0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Human movements with or without vision exhibit timing (i.e. speed and duration) and variability characteristics which are not well captured by existing computational models. Here, we introduce a stochastic optimal feedforward-feedback control (SFFC) model that can predict the nominal timing and trial-by-trial variability of self-paced arm reaching movements carried out with or without online visual feedback of the hand. In SFFC, movement timing results from the minimization of the intrinsic factors of effort and variance due to constant and signal-dependent motor noise, and movement variability depends on the integration of visual feedback. Reaching arm movements data are used to examine the effect of online vision on movement timing and variability, and test the model. This modelling suggests that the central nervous system predicts the effects of sensorimotor noise to generate an optimal feedforward motor command, and triggers optimal feedback corrections to task-related errors based on the available limb state estimate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/j0tKNrqoHlE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the leading platform for the production of biopharmaceuticals with human-like glycosylation. The standard practice for cell line generation relies on trial and error approaches such as adaptive evolution and high-throughput screening, which typically take several months. Metabolic modeling could aid in designing better producer cell lines and thus shorten development times. The genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of CHO can accurately predict growth rates. However, in order to predict rational engineering strategies it also needs to accurately predict intracellular fluxes. In this work we evaluated the agreement between the fluxes predicted by parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA) using the CHO GSMM and a wide range of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C metabolic flux data from literature. While glycolytic fluxes were predicted relatively well, the fluxes of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were vastly underestimated due to too low energy demand. Inclusion of computationally estimated maintenance energy significantly improved the overall accuracy of intracellular flux predictions. Maintenance energy was therefore determined experimentally by running continuous cultures at different growth rates and evaluating their respective energy consumption. The experimentally and computationally determined maintenance energy were in good agreement. Additionally, we compared alternative objective functions (minimization of uptake rates of seven nonessential metabolites) to the biomass objective. While the predictions of the uptake rates were quite inaccurate for most objectives, the predictions of the intracellular fluxes were comparable to the biomass objective function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XPTg3xYZeQk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Existing software tools for topology-based pathway enrichment analysis are either computationally inefficient, have undesirable statistical power, or require expert knowledge to leverage the methods’ capabilities. To address these limitations, we have overhauled NetGSA, an existing topology-based method, to provide a computationally-efficient user-friendly tool that offers interactive visualization. Pathway enrichment analysis for thousands of genes can be performed in minutes on a personal computer without sacrificing statistical power. The new software also removes the need for expert knowledge by directly curating gene-gene interaction information from multiple external databases. Lastly, by utilizing the capabilities of Cytoscape, the new software also offers interactive and intuitive network visualization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sI-LUVLcQJw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Cancer cells display massive dysregulation of key regulatory pathways due to now well-catalogued mutations and other DNA-related aberrations. Moreover, enormous heterogeneity has been commonly observed in the identity, frequency and location of these aberrations across individuals with the same cancer type or subtype, and this variation naturally propagates to the transcriptome, resulting in myriad types of dysregulated gene expression programs. Many have argued that a more integrative and quantitative analysis of heterogeneity of DNA and RNA molecular profiles may be necessary for designing more systematic explorations of alternative therapies and improving predictive accuracy. We introduce a representation of multi-&lt;i&gt;omics&lt;/i&gt; profiles which is sufficiently rich to account for observed heterogeneity and support the construction of quantitative, integrated, metrics of variation. Starting from the network of interactions existing in Reactome, we build a library of “paired DNA-RNA aberrations” that represent prototypical and recurrent patterns of dysregulation in cancer; each two-gene “Source-Target Pair” (STP) consists of a “source” regulatory gene and a “target” gene whose expression is plausibly “controlled” by the source gene. The STP is then “aberrant” in a joint DNA-RNA profile if the source gene is DNA-aberrant (&lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., mutated, deleted, or duplicated), and the downstream target gene is “RNA-aberrant”, meaning its expression level is outside the normal, baseline range. With &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; STPs, each sample profile has exactly one of the 2&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt; possible configurations. We concentrate on subsets of STPs, and the corresponding reduced configurations, by selecting tissue-dependent minimal coverings, defined as the smallest family of STPs with the property that every sample in the considered population displays at least one aberrant STP within that family. These minimal coverings can be computed with integer programming. Given such a covering, a natural measure of cross-sample diversity is the extent to which the particular aberrant STPs composing a covering vary from sample to sample; this variability is captured by the entropy of the distribution over configurations. We apply this program to data from TCGA for six distinct tumor types (breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver, and kidney cancer). This enables an efficient simplification of the complex landscape observed in cancer populations, resulting in the identification of novel signatures of molecular alterations which are not detected with frequency-based criteria. Estimates of cancer heterogeneity across tumor phenotypes reveals a stable pattern: entropy increases with disease severity. This framework is then well-suited to accommodate the expanding complexity of cancer genomes and epigenomes emerging from large consortia projects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5uFgp5U90fw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Tonic activity in the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which holds the upper eyelid open, is interrupted during blinks. Here, we demonstrate a monosynpatic pathway from cells distributed along the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus that targets, and presumably inhibits, levator motoneurons for blinks triggered from the face.







Abstract
For normal viewing, the eyes are held open by the tonic actions of the levator palpebrae superioris (levator) muscle raising the upper eyelid. This activity is interrupted during blinks, when the eyelid sweeps down to spread the tear film or protect the cornea. We examined the circuit connecting the principal trigeminal nucleus to the levator motoneurons by use of both anterograde and retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. Injections of anterograde tracer were made into the principal trigeminal nucleus using either a stereotaxic approach or localization following physiological characterization of trigeminal second order neurons. Anterogradely labeled axonal arbors were located both within the caudal central subdivision, which contains levator motoneurons, and in the adjacent supraoculomotor area. Labeled boutons made synaptic contacts on retrogradely labeled levator motoneurons indicating a monosynaptic connection. As the eye is also retracted through the actions of the rectus muscles during a blink, we examined whether these trigeminal injections labeled boutons contacting rectus motoneurons within the oculomotor nucleus. These were not found when the injection sites were confined to the principal trigeminal nucleus region. To identify the source of the projection to the levator motoneurons, we injected retrograde tracer into the oculomotor complex. Retrogradely labeled cells were confined to a narrow, dorsoventrally oriented cell population that lined the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus. Presumably these cells inhibit levator motoneurons, while other parts of the trigeminal sensory complex are activating orbicularis oculi motoneurons, when a blink is initiated by sensory stimuli contacting the face.</content>

 Whilst SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines are very safe, we report four cases of the bifacial weakness with paraesthesias variant of Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS) occurring within three weeks of vaccination with the Oxford‐AstraZeneca SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine. This rare neurological syndrome has previously been reported in association with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection itself. Our cases were given either intravenous immunoglobulin, oral steroids, or no treatment. We suggest vigilance for cases of bifacial weakness with paraesthesias variant GBS following vaccination for SARS‐CoV‐2 and that post‐vaccination surveillance programs ensure robust data capture of this outcome, to assess for causality.

 As of April 22, 2021, around 1.5 million individuals in 3 districts of Kerala, India had been vaccinated with COVID‐19 vaccines. Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1‐S/nCoV‐19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid‐March to mid‐April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain‐Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within two weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All 7 patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4 to10 fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in &amp;lt;20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

 &lt;p&gt;Feature selection is an important part of building a machine learning model.
By eliminating redundant or misleading features from data, the machine learning
model can achieve better performance while reducing the demand on com-puting
resources. Metaheuristic algorithms are mostly used to implement feature
selection such as swarm intelligence algorithms and evolutionary algorithms.
However, they suffer from the disadvantage of relative complexity and slowness.
In this paper, a concise method is proposed for universal feature selection.
The proposed method uses a fusion of the filter method and the wrapper method,
rather than a combination of them. In the method, one-hoting encoding is used
to preprocess the dataset, and random forest is utilized as the classifier. The
proposed method uses normalized frequencies to assign a value to each feature,
which will be used to find the optimal feature subset. Furthermore, we propose
a novel approach to exploit the outputs of mutual information, which allows for
a better starting point for the experiments. Two real-world dataset in the
field of intrusion detection were used to evaluate the proposed method. The
evaluation results show that the proposed method outperformed several
state-of-the-art related works in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score
and AUC.

 &lt;p&gt;Several studies with brain signals suggested that bottom-up and top-down
influences are exerted through distinct frequency bands among visual cortical
areas. It has been recently shown that theta and gamma rhythms subserve
feedforward, whereas the feedback influence is dominated by the alpha-beta
rhythm in primates. A few theoretical models for reproducing these effects have
been proposed so far. Here we show that a simple but biophysically plausible
two-network motif composed of spiking-neuron models and chemical synapses can
exhibit feedforward and feedback influences through distinct frequency bands.
Differently from previous studies, this kind of model allows us to study
directed influences not only at the population level, by using a proxy for the
local field potential, but also at the cellular level, by using the neuronal
spiking series.

 &lt;p&gt;Realizing the potential of mixed-signal neuromorphic processors for
ultra-low-power inference and learning requires efficient use of their
inhomogeneous analog circuitry as well as sparse, time-based information
encoding and processing. Here, we investigate spike-timing-based spatiotemporal
receptive fields of output-neurons in the Spatiotemporal Correlator (STC)
network, for which we used excitatory-inhibitory balanced disynaptic inputs
instead of dedicated axonal or neuronal delays. We present hardware-in-the-loop
experiments with a mixed-signal DYNAP-SE neuromorphic processor, in which
five-dimensional receptive fields of hardware neurons were mapped by randomly
sampling input spike-patterns from a uniform distribution. We find that, when
the balanced disynaptic elements are randomly programmed, some of the neurons
display distinct receptive fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a neuron was
tuned to detect a particular spatiotemporal feature, to which it initially was
non-selective, by activating a different subset of the inhomogeneous analog
synaptic circuits. The energy dissipation of the balanced synaptic elements is
one order of magnitude lower per lateral connection (0.65 nJ vs 9.3 nJ per
spike) than former delay-based neuromorphic hardware implementations. Thus, we
show how the inhomogeneous synaptic circuits could be utilized for
resource-efficient implementation of STC network layers, in a way that enables
synapse-address reprogramming as a discrete mechanism for feature tuning.

 &lt;p&gt;Quality-Diversity algorithms refer to a class of evolutionary algorithms
designed to find a collection of diverse and high-performing solutions to a
given problem. In robotics, such algorithms can be used for generating a
collection of controllers covering most of the possible behaviours of a robot.
To do so, these algorithms associate a behavioural descriptor to each of these
behaviours. Each behavioural descriptor is used for estimating the novelty of
one behaviour compared to the others. In most existing algorithms, the
behavioural descriptor needs to be hand-coded, thus requiring prior knowledge
about the task to solve. In this paper, we introduce: Autonomous Robots
Realising their Abilities, an algorithm that uses a dimensionality reduction
technique to automatically learn behavioural descriptors based on raw sensory
data. The performance of this algorithm is assessed on three robotic tasks in
simulation. The experimental results show that it performs similarly to
traditional hand-coded approaches without the requirement to provide any
hand-coded behavioural descriptor. In the collection of diverse and
high-performing solutions, it also manages to find behaviours that are novel
with respect to more features than its hand-coded baselines. Finally, we
introduce a variant of the algorithm which is robust to the dimensionality of
the behavioural descriptor space.

 &lt;p&gt;Animals are known to make efficient probabilistic inferences based on
uncertain and noisy information from the outside world. Although it is known
that generic neural networks can perform near-optimal point estimation by
probabilistic population codes which has been proposed as a neural basis for
encoding of probability distribution, the mechanisms of sampling-based
inference has not been clarified. In this study, we trained two types of
artificial neural networks: feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) and recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) to perform sampling based probabilistic inference. Then,
we analyzed and compared the mechanisms of sampling in the RNN with those in
the FFNN. As a result, it was found that sampling in RNN is performed by a
mechanism that efficiently utilizes the properties of dynamical systems, unlike
FFNN. It was also found that sampling in RNNs acts as an inductive bias,
enabling more accurate estimation than in MAP estimation. These results will
provide important implications for the discussion of the relationship between
dynamical systems and information processing in neural networks.

 &lt;p&gt;Deep Learning's outstanding track record across several domains has stemmed
from the use of error backpropagation (BP). Several studies, however, have
shown that it is impossible to execute BP in a real brain. Also, BP still
serves as an important and unsolved bottleneck for memory usage and speed. We
propose a simple, novel algorithm, the Front-Contribution algorithm, as a
compact alternative to BP. The contributions of all weights with respect to the
final layer weights are calculated before training commences and all the
contributions are appended to weights of the final layer, i.e., the effective
final layer weights are a non-linear function of themselves. Our algorithm then
essentially collapses the network, precluding the necessity for weight updation
of all weights not in the final layer. This reduction in parameters results in
lower memory usage and higher training speed. We show that our algorithm
produces the exact same output as BP, in contrast to several recently proposed
algorithms approximating BP. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Our work provides a foundation to
effectively utilize these presently under-explored &quot;front contributions&quot;, and
serves to inspire the next generation of training algorithms.

 &lt;p&gt;Theoretical analyses for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generally
assume an arbitrarily large family of discriminators and do not consider the
characteristics of the architectures used in practice. We show that this
framework of analysis is too simplistic to properly analyze GAN training. To
tackle this issue, we leverage the theory of infinite-width neural networks to
model neural discriminator training for a wide range of adversarial losses via
its Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Our analytical results show that GAN
trainability primarily depends on the discriminator's architecture. We further
study the discriminator for specific architectures and losses, and highlight
properties providing a new understanding of GAN training. For example, we find
that GANs trained with the integral probability metric loss minimize the
maximum mean discrepancy with the NTK as kernel. Our conclusions demonstrate
the analysis opportunities provided by the proposed framework, which paves the
way for better and more principled GAN models. We release a generic GAN
analysis toolkit based on our framework that supports the empirical part of our
study.

 &lt;p&gt;Comprehending the nature of action potentials is fundamental to our
understanding of the functioning of nervous systems in general. Here we
consider their evolution and describe their functions of communication,
modulation and computation within nervous systems. The ionic mechanisms
underlying action potentials in the squid giant axon were first described by
Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 and their findings have formed our orthodox view of
how the physiological action potential functions. However, substantial evidence
has now accumulated to show that the action potential is accompanied by a
synchronized coupled soliton pressure pulse in the cell membrane, the action
potential pulse (APPulse). Here we explore the interactions between the soliton
and the ionic mechanisms known to be associated with the action potential.
Computational models of the action potential usually describe it as a binary
event, but we suggest that it is quantum ternary event known as the
computational action potential (CAP), whose temporal fixed point is threshold,
rather than the rather plastic action potential peak used in other models. The
CAP accompanies the APPulse and the Physiological action potential. Therefore,
we conclude that nerve impulses appear to be an ensemble of three inseparable,
interdependent, concurrent states: the physiological action potential, the
APPulse and the CAP.

 &lt;p&gt;Algorithms implementing populations of agents which interact with one another
and sense their environment may exhibit emergent behavior such as
self-organization and swarm intelligence. Here a swarm system, called
Databionic swarm (DBS), is introduced which is able to adapt itself to
structures of high-dimensional data characterized by distance and/or
density-based structures in the data space. By exploiting the interrelations of
swarm intelligence, self-organization and emergence, DBS serves as an
alternative approach to the optimization of a global objective function in the
task of clustering. The swarm omits the usage of a global objective function
and is parameter-free because it searches for the Nash equilibrium during its
annealing process. To our knowledge, DBS is the first swarm combining these
approaches. Its clustering can outperform common clustering methods such as
K-means, PAM, single linkage, spectral clustering, model-based clustering, and
Ward, if no prior knowledge about the data is available. A central problem in
clustering is the correct estimation of the number of clusters. This is
addressed by a DBS visualization called topographic map which allows assessing
the number of clusters. It is known that all clustering algorithms construct
clusters, irrespective of the data set contains clusters or not. In contrast to
most other clustering algorithms, the topographic map identifies, that
clustering of the data is meaningless if the data contains no (natural)
clusters. The performance of DBS is demonstrated on a set of benchmark data,
which are constructed to pose difficult clustering problems and in two
real-world applications.

 &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 infections have well described systemic manifestations, especially
respiratory problems. There are currently no specific treatments or vaccines
against the current strain. With higher case numbers, a range of neurological
symptoms are becoming apparent. The mechanisms responsible for these are not
well defined, other than those related to hypoxia and microthrombi. We
speculate that sustained systemic immune activation seen with SARS-CoV-2 may
also cause secondary autoimmune activation in the CNS. Patients with chronic
neurological diseases may be at higher risk because of chronic secondary
respiratory disease and potentially poor nutritional status. Here, we review
the impact of COVID-19 on people with chronic neurological diseases and
potential mechanisms. We believe special attention to protecting people with
neurodegenerative disease is warranted. We are concerned about a possible
delayed pandemic in the form of an increased burden of neurodegenerative
disease after acceleration of pathology by systemic COVID-19 infections.

 &lt;p&gt;The modern deep learning method based on backpropagation has surged in
popularity and has been used in multiple domains and application areas. At the
same time, there are other -- less-known -- machine learning algorithms with a
mature and solid theoretical foundation whose performance remains unexplored.
One such example is the brain-like Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural
Network (BCPNN). In this paper, we introduce StreamBrain -- a framework that
allows neural networks based on BCPNN to be practically deployed in
High-Performance Computing systems. StreamBrain is a domain-specific language
(DSL), similar in concept to existing machine learning (ML) frameworks, and
supports backends for CPUs, GPUs, and even FPGAs. We empirically demonstrate
that StreamBrain can train the well-known ML benchmark dataset MNIST within
seconds, and we are the first to demonstrate BCPNN on STL-10 size networks. We
also show how StreamBrain can be used to train with custom floating-point
formats and illustrate the impact of using different bfloat variations on BCPNN
using FPGAs.

 &lt;p&gt;Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) is emerging as an efficient and biologically
plausible alternative to the ubiquitous backpropagation algorithm for training
deep neural networks. Despite relying on random feedback weights for the
backward pass, DFA successfully trains state-of-the-art models such as
Transformers. On the other hand, it notoriously fails to train convolutional
networks. An understanding of the inner workings of DFA to explain these
diverging results remains elusive. Here, we propose a theory for the success of
DFA. We first show that learning in shallow networks proceeds in two steps: an
alignment phase, where the model adapts its weights to align the approximate
gradient with the true gradient of the loss function, is followed by a
memorisation phase, where the model focuses on fitting the data. This two-step
process has a degeneracy breaking effect: out of all the low-loss solutions in
the landscape, a network trained with DFA naturally converges to the solution
which maximises gradient alignment. We also identify a key quantity underlying
alignment in deep linear networks: the conditioning of the alignment matrices.
The latter enables a detailed understanding of the impact of data structure on
alignment, and suggests a simple explanation for the well-known failure of DFA
to train convolutional neural networks. Numerical experiments on MNIST and
CIFAR10 clearly demonstrate degeneracy breaking in deep non-linear networks and
show that the align-then-memorise process occurs sequentially from the bottom
layers of the network to the top.

 &lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system empowering humans to communicate
with or control the outside world with exclusively brain intentions.
Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs are promising solutions due to their
convenient and portable instruments. Motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) is a kind of
most widely focused EEG signals, which reveals a subjects movement intentions
without actual actions. Despite the extensive research of MI-EEG in recent
years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to the
massive noises in EEG signals (e.g., low signal noise ratio and incomplete EEG
signals), and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relationships between
EEG signals and certain brain activities. Most existing works either only
consider EEG as chain-like sequences neglecting complex dependencies between
adjacent signals or performing simple temporal averaging over EEG sequences. In
this paper, we introduce both cascade and parallel convolutional recurrent
neural network models for precisely identifying human intended movements by
effectively learning compositional spatio-temporal representations of raw EEG
streams. The proposed models grasp the spatial correlations between physically
neighboring EEG signals by converting the chain like EEG sequences into a 2D
mesh like hierarchy. An LSTM based recurrent network is able to extract the
subtle temporal dependencies of EEG data streams. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale MI-EEG dataset (108 subjects, 3,145,160 EEG records) have
demonstrated that both models achieve high accuracy near 98.3% and outperform a
set of baseline methods and most recent deep learning based EEG recognition
models, yielding a significant accuracy increase of 18% in the cross-subject
validation scenario.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has dramatically disrupted healthcare systems. Two rapid WHO pulse surveys studied disruptions in mental health services, but did not particularly focus on neurology. Here, a global survey was conducted and addresses the impact of the pandemic on neurology services.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A cross-sectional study was carried out in which 34 international neurological associations were asked to distribute the survey to national associations. The responses represented the national situation, in November–December 2020, with regard to the main disrupted neurological services, reasons and the mitigation strategies implemented as well as the disruption on training of residents and on neurological research. A comparison with the situation in February–April 2020, first pandemic wave, was also requested.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;54 completed surveys came from 43 countries covering all the 6 WHO regions. Overall, neurological services disruption was reported as mild by 26%, moderate by 30%, complete by 13% of associations. The most affected services were cross-sectoral neurological services (57%) and neurorehabilitation (56%). The second wave of the pandemic, however, was associated with the improvement of service provision for diagnostics services (44%) and for neurorehabilitation (41%). Governmental directives were the major cause of services’ disruption (56%). Mitigation strategies were mostly established through telemedicine (48%). Almost half of respondents reported a significant impact on neurological research (48%) and educational activities (60%). Most associations (67%) were not involved in decision making for neurological patients’ issues by their national government.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic affects neurological services and raises the universal need for the development of neurological health care at the policy, systems and services levels. A global national plan on mitigation strategies for disruption of neurological services during pandemic situations should be established and neurological scientific and patients associations should get involved in decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Visually guided reaching precision and accuracy depend on the level of coupling between movements of the eyes and hand. In the present study, participants performed central fixations and either saccadic or smooth pursuit eye movements during fast and accurate reaching tasks involving eye–hand coupling and decoupling to better understand type of eye movement influence over upper limb control. Some eye–hand coupling and decoupling tasks also included hand reversals, where the hand moves away from the target to direct a cursor toward the target to account for various levels of hand–cursor and eye–cursor coupling. Regardless of eye-movement type, eye–hand–cursor coupling produced an endpoint accuracy advantage over decoupling. Use of hand reversal decreased peak speed and increased response time of the hand, whether considering fixation or a given eye movement. Use of smooth pursuit slowed hand movements relative to saccades, yet improved endpoint accuracy. Compared to central fixations, using smooth pursuit also slowed hand movements, while using saccades decreased, thus improved, hand reaction times. Data suggest an advantage, when using smooth pursuit to track the hand movement for the greatest endpoint accuracy, an advantage when using saccades for the fastest movements, and an eye–hand coupling advantage when using saccades for the shortest reactions. Researchers should provide clear eye-movement instructions for participants and/or monitor the eyes when assessing similar upper limb control to account for possible differences in eye movements used. Moreover, the type of eye movement chosen for participants should correspond to the primary goal of the task.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The perception of putative pheromones or social odors (PPSO) in humans is a widely debated topic because the published results seem ambiguous. Our research aimed to evaluate how cross-modal processing of PPSO and gender voice can affect the behavioral and psychophysiological states of the subject during a listening task with a bodily contact medium, and how these effects could be gender related. Before the experimental session, three embodied media, were exposed to volatilized estratetraenol (Estr), 5α-androst-16-en-3 α-ol (Andr), and Vaseline oil. The experimental session consisted in listening to a story that were transmitted, with a male or female voice, by the communicative medium via a Bluetooth system during a listening task, recorded through 64-active channel electroencephalography (EEG). The sense of co-presence and social presence, elicited by the medium, showed how the established relationship with the medium was gender dependent and modulated by the PPSO. In particular, Andr induced greater responses related to co-presence. The gender of the participants was related to the co-presence desire, where women imagined higher medium co-presence than men. EEG findings seemed to be more responsive to the PPSO–gender voice interaction, than behavioral results. The mismatch between female PPSO and male voice elicited the greatest cortical flow of information. In the case of the Andr–male voice condition, the trained model appeared to assign more relevance to the flow of information to the right frontotemporal regions (involved in odor recognition memory and social behavior). The Estr–male voice condition showed activation of the bilateral frontoparietal network, which is linked to cognitive control, cognitive flexibility, and auditory consciousness. The model appears to distinguish the dissonance condition linked to Andr matched with a female voice: it highlights a flow of information to the right occipital lobe and to the frontal pole. The PPSO could influence the co-presence judgements and EEG response. The results seem suggest that could be an implicit pattern linked to PPSO-related gender differences and gender voice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Shank2 is an abundant postsynaptic scaffolding protein that is known to regulate excitatory synapse assembly and synaptic transmission and has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Previous studies on Shank2-mutant mice provided mechanistic insights into their autistic-like phenotypes, but it remains unclear how transcriptomic patterns are changed in brain regions of the mutant mice in age- and gene dosage-dependent manners. To this end, we performed RNA-Seq analyses of the transcripts from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of heterozygous and homozygous Shank2-mutant mice lacking exons 6 and 7 at juvenile (week 3) and adult (week 12) stages. Juvenile heterozygous Shank2-mutant mice showed upregulation of glutamate synapse-related genes, downregulation of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, and transcriptomic changes that are opposite to those observed in ASD (anti-ASD) such as upregulation of ASD_down (downregulated in ASD), GABA neuron-related, and oligodendrocyte-related genes. Juvenile homozygous Shank2 mice showed upregulation of chromatin-related genes and transcriptomic changes that are in line with those occurring in ASD (pro-ASD) such as downregulation of ASD_down, GABA neuron-related, and oligodendrocyte-related genes. Adult heterozygous and homozygous Shank2-mutant mice both exhibited downregulation of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes and pro-ASD transcriptomic changes. Therefore, the gene dosage- and age-dependent effects of Shank2 deletions in mice include differential transcriptomic changes across distinct functional contexts, including synapses, chromatin, ribosomes, mitochondria, GABA neurons, and oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;T1 relaxation and water mobility generate eloquent MRI tissue contrasts with great diagnostic value in many neuroradiological applications. However, conventional methods do not adequately quantify the microscopic heterogeneity of these important biophysical properties within a voxel, and therefore have limited biological specificity. We describe a new correlation spectroscopic (CS) MRI method for measuring how T1 and mean diffusivity (MD) co-vary in microscopic tissue environments. We develop a clinical pulse sequence that combines inversion recovery (IR) with single-shot isotropic diffusion encoding (IDE) to efficiently acquire whole-brain MRIs with a wide range of joint T1-MD weightings. Unlike conventional diffusion encoding, the IDE preparation ensures that all subvoxel water pools are weighted by their MDs regardless of the sizes, shapes, and orientations of their corresponding microscopic diffusion tensors. Accordingly, IR-IDE measurements are well-suited for model-free, quantitative spectroscopic analysis of microscopic water pools. Using numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and data from healthy volunteers we demonstrate how IR-IDE MRIs can be processed to reconstruct maps of two-dimensional joint probability density functions, i.e., correlation spectra, of subvoxel T1-MD values. In vivo T1-MD spectra show distinct cerebrospinal fluid and parenchymal tissue components specific to white matter, cortical gray matter, basal ganglia, and myelinated fiber pathways, suggesting the potential for improved biological specificity. The one-dimensional marginal distributions derived from the T1-MD correlation spectra agree well with results from other relaxation spectroscopic and quantitative MRI studies, validating the T1-MD contrast encoding and the spectral reconstruction. Mapping subvoxel T1-diffusion correlations in patient populations may provide a more nuanced, comprehensive, sensitive, and specific neuroradiological assessment of the non-specific changes seen on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted MRIs (DWIs) in cancer, ischemic stroke, or brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;As a complication-prone operation, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become the first-line surgical approach for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of DBS-associated complications.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We have reviewed a consecutive series of patients with PD undergoing DBS procedures to describe the type, severity, management, and outcome of postoperative complications from January 2011 to December 2018. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify statistically significant risk factors. We also described our surgical strategies to minimize the adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 225 patients underwent 229 DBS implantation procedures (440 electrodes), of whom 20 patients experienced 23 DBS-associated complications, including ten operation-related complications and 13 hardware-related ones. Univariate analysis elucidated that comorbid medical conditions (P = 0.024), hypertension (P = 0.003), early-stage operation (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and unilateral electrode implantation (P = 0.029) as risk factors for overall complications, or more specifically, operation-related complications demonstrated in the stratified analysis. In contrast, no risk factor for hardware-related complications was identified. Statistical significances of hypertension (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.14–9.71, P = 0.027) and early-stage (OR = 11.04, 95% CI: 2.42–50.45, P = 0.002) were further validated via multivariate analysis. As the annual number of DBS procedures increased, the incidence of complications gradually decreased (R = −0.699, P &amp;lt; 0.01). Additionally, there was a strong correlation between surgical complications and unplanned readmission (R = 0.730, P &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The importance of cumulative experience and relevant technique modifications should be addressed to prevent DBS-associated complications and unplanned readmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: The present study was conducted to verify a promising experimental setup which demonstrated an inversed Stroop-effect (much faster responses for incongruent relative to congruent Stroop trials) following a mismatching tone. In the matching condition, which was an almost exact replication of the original study, participants were required to indicate whether word color and word meaning were matching, whereas in the response conflict condition, instruction was the same as in a classical Stroop task and required the participants to respond to the word color. As in the original study, each trial was preceded by a sine tone which was deviant in pitch in 20% of the trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The main result was that the Stroop effect was not inversed after deviant tones, neither under the matching task instruction nor under the response conflict task instruction. The Stroop effect was unaffected by the previous “conceptual mismatch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The current study failed to replicate the astonishing concept of “conflict priming” reported in previous work and does not open the doors for a new window on sequences of conflicts. Nevertheless, the failed replication is valuable for future research, since it demonstrated that “Conflict Priming” as a facilitation of processing of conflict trials following deviant tones, is not an confirmed finding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Prior behavioral work has shown that selective restudy of some studied items leaves recall of the other studied items unaffected when lag between study and restudy is short, but improves recall of the other items when lag is prolonged. The beneficial effect has been attributed to context retrieval, assuming that selective restudy reactivates the context at study and thus provides a retrieval cue for the other items (Bäuml, 2019). Here the results of two experiments are reported, in each of which subjects studied a list of items and then, after a short 2-min or a prolonged 10-min lag, restudied some of the list items. Participants' electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during both the study and restudy phases. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, subjects engaged in a mental context reinstatement task immediately before the restudy phase started, trying to mentally reinstate the study context. Results of Experiment 1 revealed a theta/alpha power increase from study to restudy after short lag and an alpha/beta power decrease after long lag. Engagement in the mental context reinstatement task in Experiment 2 eliminated the decrease in alpha/beta power. The results are consistent with the view that the observed alpha/beta decrease reflects context retrieval, which became obsolete when there was preceding mental context reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background While research has consistently identified an association between long-term cannabis use and memory impairments, few studies have examined this relationship in a polydrug context (i.e., when combining cannabis with other substances).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aims: In this preliminary study, we used event-related potentials to examine the recognition process in a visual episodic memory task in cannabis users (CU) and cannabis polydrug users (PU). We hypothesized that CU and PU will have both–behavioral and psychophysiological–indicators of memory processes affected, compared to matched non-using controls with the PU expressing more severe changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods 29 non-using controls (CG), 24 CU and 27 PU were enrolled into the study. All participants completed a visual learning recognition task while brain electrical activity was recorded. Event-related potentials were calculated for familiar (old) and new images from a signal recorded during a subsequent recognition test. We used receiver operating characteristic curves for behavioral data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results The groups did not differ in memory performance based on receiver operating characteristic method in accuracy and discriminability indicators nor mean reaction times for old/new images. The frontal old/new effect expected from prior research was observed for all participants, while a parietal old/new effect was not observed. While, the significant differences in the late parietal component (LPC) amplitude was observed between CG and PU but not between CG and CU nor CU and PU. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the mean amplitude of the LPC component as a predictor of memory performance accuracy indicator. LPC amplitude predicts recognition accuracy only in the CG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion The results showed alterations in recognition memory processing in CU and PU groups compared to CG, which were not manifested on the behavioral level, and were the most prominent in cannabis polydrug users. We interpret it as a manifestation of the cumulative effect of multiple drug usage in the PU group.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The long-term effects of impairment have a negative impact on the quality of life of stroke patients in terms of not using the affected limb even after some recovery (i.e., learned non-use). Immersive virtual reality (IVR) has been introduced as a new approach for the treatment of stroke rehabilitation. We propose an IVR-based therapeutic approach to incorporate positive reinforcement components in motor coordination as opposed to constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). This study aimed to investigate the effect of IVR-reinforced physical therapy that incorporates positive reinforcement components in motor coordination. To simulate affected upper limb function loss in patients, a wrist weight was attached to the dominant hand of participant. Participants were asked to choose their right or left hand to reach toward a randomly allocated target. The movement of the virtual image of the upper limb was reinforced by visual feedback to participants, that is, the participants perceived their motor coordination as if their upper limb was moving to a greater degree than what was occurring in everyday life. We found that the use of the simulated affected limb was increased after the visual feedback enhancement intervention, and importantly, the effect was maintained even after gradual withdrawal of the visual amplification. The results suggest that positive reinforcement within the IVR could induce an effect on decision making in hand usage.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Purpose&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the study was to investigate the brain functional alteration in patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) by evaluating the spontaneous neural activity changes using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;The rs-fMRI data of 30 TAO patients (15 active and 15 inactive) and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were included for analyses. The ALFF values were calculated and compared among groups. Correlations between ALFF values and clinical metrics were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with HCs, active TAOs showed significantly decreased ALFF values in the left middle occipital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, and cuneus. Compared with inactive TAOs, active TAOs showed significantly increased ALFF values in the bilateral precuneus. Additionally, inactive TAOs showed significantly decreased ALFF values in the left middle occipital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, cuneus, and bilateral precuneus than HCs. The ALFF value in the right precuneus of TAOs was positively correlated with clinical activity score (r = 0.583, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r = 0.377, P = 0.040), and negatively correlated with disease duration (r = −0.382, P = 0.037). Moreover, the ALFF value in the left middle occipital gyrus of TAOs was positively correlated with visual acuity (r = 0.441, P = 0.015).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;TAO patients had altered spontaneous brain activities in the left occipital lobe and bilateral precuneus. The neuropsychological aspect of the disease should be noticed during clinical diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The fear of being in the focus of attention in social situations can develop into a social anxiety disorder (SAD). The classical treatment for SAD is cognitive behavioral therapy, which is in many cases accompanied by drug treatments. A promising alternative treatment is physical activity (PA) interventions, because regular PA has been shown to be suitable for reducing anxiety in general. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42020191181) as well as two additional searches. Our aim was to investigate whether PA interventions are a suitable treatment for SAD and whether PA is suitable for reducing social anxiety (SA) in general. For studies with randomized controlled trial designs, a not statistically significant effect of medium size toward lower general SA symptomatology was found in the PA group in comparison with the control group (d = −0.24, p = 0.377). For studies with longitudinal designs, significantly lower SA symptoms were found after PA treatments (d = −0.22, p = 0.001). The effect of PA on SA was stronger for adults than for children and adolescents (p = 0.003). For cross-sectional studies, a small negative association between SA symptoms and the amount of PA was found, i.e., lower SA was found for people who were more physically active (r = −0.12, p = 0.003). We conclude that PA is a promising means for the (additional) treatment of SAD or to reduce SA in general in non-clinical samples, but more research in which high-quality studies with randomized controlled trial designs are used is needed. Furthermore, open questions with respect to moderating variables (e.g., age, sex, BMI, type of intervention, stress, amount of regular PA before the intervention, and comorbidities) remain still open.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Syntactic processing has often been considered an utmost example of unconscious automatic processing. In this line, it has been demonstrated that masked words containing syntactic anomalies are processed by our brain triggering event related potential (ERP) components similar to the ones triggered by conscious syntactic anomalies, thus supporting the automatic nature of the syntactic processing. Conversely, recent evidence also points out that regardless of the level of awareness, emotional information and other relevant extralinguistic information modulate conscious syntactic processing too. These results are also in line with suggestions that, under certain circumstances, syntactic processing could also be flexible and context-dependent. However, the study of the concomitant automatic but flexible conception of syntactic parsing is very scarce. Hence, to this aim, we examined whether and how masked emotional words (positive, negative, and neutral masked adjectives) containing morphosyntactic anomalies (half of the cases) affect linguistic comprehension of an ongoing unmasked sentence that also can contain a number agreement anomaly between the noun and the verb. ERP components were observed to emotional information (EPN), masked anomalies (LAN and a weak P600), and unmasked ones (LAN/N400 and P600). Furthermore, interactions in the processing of conscious and unconscious morphosyntactic anomalies and between unconscious emotional information and conscious anomalies were detected. The findings support, on the one hand, the automatic nature of syntax, given that syntactic components LAN and P600 were observed to unconscious anomalies. On the other hand, the flexible, permeable, and context-dependent nature of the syntactic processing is also supported, since unconscious information modulated conscious syntactic components. This double nature of syntactic processing is in line with theories of automaticity, suggesting that even unconscious/automatic, syntactic processing is flexible, adaptable, and context-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: To identify individuals with preclinical cognitive impairment, researchers proposed the concept of objectively-defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD). However, it is not clear whether Obj-SCD has characteristic brain function changes. In this study, we aimed at exploring the changing pattern of brain function activity in Obj-SCD individuals and the similarities and differences with mild cognitive impairments (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: 37 healthy control individuals, 25 Obj-SCD individuals (with the impairment in memory and language domain), and 28 aMCI individuals were included. Resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological tests were performed. fALFF was used to reflect the local functional activity and compared between groups. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the fALFF values of significantly changed regions and neuropsychological performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found similar functional activity enhancements in some local brain regions in the Obj-SCD and aMCI groups, including the left orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus and the left median cingulate and paracingulate gyri. However, some changes in local functional activities of the Obj-SCD group showed different patterns from the aMCI group. Compared with healthy control (HC), the Obj-SCD group showed increased local functional activity in the right middle occipital gyrus, decreased local functional activity in the left precuneus and the left inferior temporal gyrus. In the Obj-SCD group, in normal band, the fALFF value of the right middle occipital gyrus was significantly negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r = −0.450, p = 0.024) and Animal Verbal Fluency Test (AFT) score (r = −0.402, p = 0.046); the left inferior temporal gyrus was significantly positively correlated with MMSE score (r = 0.588, p = 0.002). In slow-4 band, the fALFF value of the left precuneus was significantly positively correlated with MMSE score (r = 0.468, p = 0.018) and AFT score (r = 0.600, p = 0.002). In the aMCI group, the fALFF value of the left orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus was significantly positively correlated with Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) long delay cued recall score (r = 0.506, p = 0.006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The Obj-SCD group showed a unique changing pattern; the functional changes of different brain regions have a close but different correlation with cognitive impairment, indicating that there may be a complex pathological basis inside. This suggests that Obj-SCD may be a separate stage of cognitive decline before aMCI and is helpful to the study of preclinical cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Immune surveillance is an essential process that safeguards the homeostasis of a healthy brain. Among the increasing diversity of immune cells present in the central nervous system (CNS), microglia have emerged as a prominent leukocyte subset with key roles in the support of brain function and in the control of neuroinflammation. In fact, impaired microglial function is associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Interestingly, these pathologies are also typified by protein aggregation and proteostasis dysfunction at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These processes trigger activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is a conserved signaling network that maintains the fidelity of the cellular proteome. Remarkably, beyond its role in protein folding, the UPR has also emerged as a key regulator of the development and function of immune cells. However, despite this evidence, the contribution of the UPR to immune cell homeostasis, immune surveillance, and neuro-inflammatory processes remains largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss the potential contribution of the UPR in brain-associated immune cells in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of clinical cognitive disorders. Post-operative delirium (POD) is a common complication after total hip replacement. We aimed to investigate the relationship between SCD and POD in patients undergoing total hip replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Our study recruited 214 cognitively intact individuals from the Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder And Biomarker Lifestyle (PNDABLE) study in the final analysis. SCD was diagnosed with Subjective Cognitive Decline Scale (SCDS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The incidence of POD was evaluated by using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and POD severity was measured by using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ40, Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau levels were measured by enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Overall, the incidence of POD was 26.64% (57/214), including 32.43% (36/111) in the SCD group and 20.39% (21/103) in the NC group. With the increase of age, the incidence of POD in all age groups increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for SCD, Aβ42, Aβ40, P-tau, and T-tau, SCD (OR 2.32, CI 1.18–4.55, P = 0.01) and the increased CSF level of P-tau (OR 1.04, CI 1.01–1.06, P &amp;lt; 0.001) were risk factors for POD, while the level of aβ42 (OR 0.99, CI 0.99–1.00, P &amp;lt; 0.001) was a protective factor for POD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: SCD is one of the preoperative risk factors for POD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: This study was registered at China Clinical Trial Registry (Chictr200033439).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-dependent accumulation of amyloid-β, provoking increasing brain amyloidopathy, triggers abnormal patterns of neuron activity and circuit synchronization in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as observed in human AD patients and AD mouse models. Recent studies on AD mouse models, mimicking this age-dependent amyloidopathy, identified alterations in CA1 neuron excitability. However, these models generally also overexpress mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and there is a lack of a clear correlation of neuronal excitability alterations with progressive amyloidopathy. The active development of computational models of AD points out the need of collecting such experimental data to build a reliable disease model exhibiting AD-like disease progression. We therefore used the feature extraction tool of the Human Brain Project (HBP) Brain Simulation Platform to systematically analyze the excitability profile of CA1 pyramidal neuron in the APPPS1 mouse model. We identified specific features of neuron excitability that best correlate either with over-expression of mutated APP and PS1 or increasing Aβ amyloidopathy. Notably, we report strong alterations in membrane time constant and action potential width and weak alterations in firing behavior. Also, using a CA1 pyramidal neuron model, we evidence amyloidopathy-dependent alterations in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, cluster analysis of these recordings showed that we could reliably assign a trace to its correct group, opening the door to a more refined, less variable analysis of AD-affected neurons. This inter-disciplinary analysis, bringing together experimentalists and modelers, helps to further unravel the neuronal mechanisms most affected by AD and to build a biologically plausible computational model of the AD brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aging affects the vestibular system and may disturb the perception of verticality and lead to increased visual dependence (VD). Studies have identified that abnormal upright perception influences the risk of falling. The aim of our study was to evaluate subjective visual vertical (SVV) and VD using a mobile virtual reality-based system for SVV assessment (VIRVEST) in older adults with falls and evaluate its relationship with clinical balance assessment tools, dizziness, mental state, and depression level. This study included 37 adults &amp;gt;65 years who experienced falls and 40 non-faller age-matched controls. Three tests were performed using the VIRVEST system: a static SVV, dynamic SVV with clockwise and counter-clockwise background stimulus motion. VD was calculated as the mean of absolute values of the rod tilt from each trial of dynamic SVV minus the mean static SVV rod tilt. Older adults who experienced falls manifested significantly larger biases in static SVV (p = 0.012), dynamic SVV (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and VD (p = 0.014) than controls. The increase in static SVV (odds ratio = 1.365, p = 0.023), dynamic SVV (odds ratio = 1.623, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and VD (odds ratio = 1.460, p = 0.010) tilt by one degree significantly related to falls risk in the faller group. Fallers who had a high risk of falling according to the Tinetti test exhibited significantly higher tilts of dynamic SVV than those who had a low or medium risk (p = 0.037). In the faller group, the increase of the dynamic SVV tilt by one degree was significantly related to falls risk according to the Tinetti test (odds ratio = 1.356, p = 0.049). SVV errors, particularly with the dynamic SVV test (i.e., greater VD) were associated with an increased risk of falling in the faller group. The VIRVEST system may be applicable in clinical settings for SVV testing and predicting falls in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol levels have been associated with age-related cognitive decline, however, such an association has not been comprehensively explored in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). To address this uncertainty, the current cross-sectional study examined the cholesterol profile and cognitive performance in a cohort of PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function was evaluated using two validated assessments (ACE-R and SCOPA-COG) in 182 people with PD from the Australian Parkinson’s Disease Registry. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and Triglyceride (TRG) levels were examined within this cohort. The influence of individual lipid subfractions on domain-specific cognitive performance was investigated using covariate-adjusted generalised linear models.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Females with PD exhibited significantly higher lipid subfraction levels (TC, HDL, and LDL) when compared to male counterparts. While accounting for covariates, HDL levels were strongly associated with poorer performance across multiple cognitive domains in females but not males. Conversely, TC and LDL levels were not associated with cognitive status in people with PD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Higher serum HDL associates with poorer cognitive function in females with PD and presents a sex-specific biomarker for cognitive impairment in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have been found to be a highly vulnerable group, with a higher prevalence of severe cases and negative outcomes. Research has focused on the reasons why older adults are at greater risk; Sleep-related factors have been suggested as one possible explanation for this. An individual’s sleep pattern undergoes significant changes over the course of their life. In older adults a specific sleep profile can be observed, one characterized by advanced sleep timing, a morningness preference, longer sleep-onset latency, shorter overall sleep duration, increased sleep fragmentation, reduced slow-wave sleep and, increased wake time after sleep onset. Additionally, an increased prevalence of sleep disorders can be observed, such as obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. Previous research has already linked sleep disorders (especially sleep apnea) with COVID-19, but few studies have focused specifically on the older population. We believe that the intrinsic sleep patterns of older adults, and the prevalence of sleep disorders in this population, may be important factors that could explain why they are at a greater risk of negative COVID-19 outcomes. In this review, we discuss the relationship between sleep and COVID-19 among older adults, focusing on three different aspects: (1) Sleep-related issues that might increase the likelihood of getting infected by SARS-COV-2; (2) Sleep disturbances that might increase the predisposition to worse COVID-19 prognosis and outcomes; and (3) COVID-19-related aspects affecting community-dwelling older adults, such as social isolation, quarantine, and home confinement, among others, that might impact sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tinnitus can be a burdensome condition on both individual and societal levels. Many aspects of this condition remain elusive, including its underlying mechanisms, ultimately hindering the development of a cure. Interdisciplinary approaches are required to overcome long-established research challenges. This review summarizes current knowledge in various tinnitus-relevant research fields including tinnitus generating mechanisms, heterogeneity, epidemiology, assessment, and treatment development, in an effort to highlight the main challenges and provide suggestions for future research to overcome them. Four common themes across different areas were identified as future research direction: (1) Further establishment of multicenter and multidisciplinary collaborations; (2) Systematic reviews and syntheses of existing knowledge; (3) Standardization of research methods including tinnitus assessment, data acquisition, and data analysis protocols; (4) The design of studies with large sample sizes and the creation of large tinnitus-specific databases that would allow in-depth exploration of tinnitus heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Gait performance is a potential clinical marker for the progression of MCI into dementia. However, the relationship between gait and brain functional connectivity (FC) in older adults with MCI remains unclear. Forty-five subjects [MCI group, n = 23; healthy control (HC) group, n = 22] were recruited. Each subject performed a walking task (Task 01), counting backward–walking task (Task 02), naming animals–walking task (Task 03), and calculating–walking task (Task 04). The gait parameters and cerebral oxygenation signals from the left prefrontal cortex (LPFC), right prefrontal cortex (RPFC), left motor cortex (LMC), right motor cortex (RMC), left occipital leaf cortex (LOL), and right occipital leaf cortex (ROL) were obtained simultaneously. Wavelet phase coherence was calculated in two frequency intervals: low frequency (interval I, 0.052–0.145 Hz) and very low frequency (interval II, 0.021–0.052 Hz). Results showed that the FC of RPFC–RMC is significantly lower in interval I in Task 03 compared with that in Task 02 in the MCI group (p = 0.001). Also, the right relative symmetry index (IDpsR) is significantly lower in Task 03 compared with that in Task 02 (p = 0.000). The IDpsR is positively correlated with the FC of RPFC–RMC in interval I in the MCI group (R = 0.205, p = 0.041). The gait symmetry such as left relative symmetry index (IDpsL) and IDpsR is significantly lower in the dual-task (DT) situation compared with the single task in the two groups (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The results suggested that the IDpsR might reflect abnormal change in FC of RPFC–RMC in interval I in the MCI population during Task 03. The gait symmetry is affected by DTs in both groups. The findings of this study may have a pivotal role in the early monitoring and intervention of brain dysfunction among older adults with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 For a more complete understanding of molecular mechanisms, it is important to study macromolecules and their assemblies in the broader context of the cell. This context can be visualized at nanometer resolution in three dimensions (3D) using electron cryo-tomography, which requires tilt series to be recorded and computationally aligned, currently limiting throughput. Additionally, the high-resolution signal preserved in the raw tomograms is currently limited by a number of technical difficulties, leading to an increased false-positive detection rate when using 3D template matching to find molecular complexes in tomograms. We have recently described a 2D template matching approach that addresses these issues by including high-resolution signal preserved in single-tilt images. A current limitation of this approach is the high computational cost that limits throughput. We describe here a GPU-accelerated implementation of 2D template matching in the image processing software &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;TEM that allows for easy scaling and improves the accessibility of this approach. We apply 2D template matching to identify ribosomes in images of frozen-hydrated &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; cells with high precision and sensitivity, demonstrating that this is a versatile tool for &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; visual proteomics and &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt;structure determination. We benchmark the results with 3D template matching of tomograms acquired on identical sample locations and identify strengths and weaknesses of both techniques, which offer complementary information about target localization and identity.</content>

 How cells tune the size of their subcellular parts to scale with cell size is a fundamental question in cell biology. Until now, most studies on the size control of organelles and other subcellular structures have focused on scaling relationships with cell volume, which can be explained by limiting pool mechanisms. Here, we uncover a distinct scaling relationship with cell length rather than volume, revealed by mathematical modeling and quantitative imaging of yeast actin cables. The extension rate of cables decelerates as they approach the rear of the cell, until cable length matches cell length. Further, the deceleration rate scales with cell length. These observations are quantitatively explained by a 'balance-point' model, which stands in contrast to the limiting pool mechanisms and that senses the linear dimensions of the cell.</content>

 During HIV-1 particle formation, the requisite plasma membrane curvature is thought to be solely driven by the retroviral Gag protein. Here, we reveal that the cellular I-BAR protein IRSp53 is required for the progression of HIV-1 membrane curvature to complete particle assembly. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of IRSp53 gene expression induces a decrease in viral particle production and a viral bud arrest at half completion. Single molecule localization microscopy at the cell plasma membrane shows a preferential localization of IRSp53 around HIV-1 Gag assembly sites. In addition, we observe the presence of IRSp53 in purified HIV-1 particles. Finally, HIV-1 Gag protein preferentially localizes to curved membranes induced by IRSp53 I-BAR domain on giant unilamellar vesicles. Overall, our data reveal a strong interplay between IRSp53 I-BAR and Gag at membranes during virus assembly. This highlights IRSp53 as a crucial host factor in HIV-1 membrane curvature and its requirement for full HIV-1 particle assembly.</content>

 Transcoelomic spread of cancer cells across the peritoneal cavity occurs in most initially diagnosed ovarian cancer (OC) patients and accounts for most cancer-related death. However, how OC cells interact with peritoneal stromal cells to evade the immune surveillance remains largely unexplored. Here, through an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identified IL20RA, which decreased dramatically in OC patients during peritoneal metastasis, as a key factor preventing the transcoelomic metastasis of OC. Reconstitution of IL20RA in highly metastatic OC cells greatly suppresses the transcoelomic metastasis. OC cells, when disseminate into the peritoneal cavity, greatly induce peritoneum mesothelial cells to express IL-20 and IL-24, which in turn activate the IL20RA downstream signaling in OC cells to produce mature IL-18, eventually resulting in the polarization of macrophages into the M1-like subtype to clear the cancer cells. Thus, we show an IL-20/IL20RA-mediated crosstalk between OC and mesothelial cells that supports a metastasis-repressing immune microenvironment.</content>

 Lipid droplets are lipid storage organelles found in nearly all cell types from adipocytes to cancer cells. Although increasingly implicated in disease, current methods to study lipid droplets in vertebrate models rely on static imaging or the use of fluorescent dyes, limiting investigation of their rapid in vivo dynamics. To address this, we created a lipid droplet transgenic reporter in whole animals and cell culture by fusing tdTOMATO to Perilipin-2 (PLIN2), a lipid droplet structural protein. Expression of this transgene in transparent &lt;i&gt;casper&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish enabled in vivo imaging of adipose depots responsive to nutrient deprivation and high-fat diet. Simultaneously, we performed a large-scale in vitro chemical screen of 1280 compounds and identified several novel regulators of lipolysis in adipocytes. Using our &lt;i&gt;Tg(-3.5ubb:plin2-tdTomato)&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish line, we validated several of these novel regulators and revealed an unexpected role for nitric oxide in modulating adipocyte lipid droplets. Similarly, we expressed the PLIN2-tdTOMATO transgene in melanoma cells and found that the nitric oxide pathway also regulated lipid droplets in cancer. This model offers a tractable imaging platform to study lipid droplets across cell types and disease contexts using chemical, dietary, or genetic perturbations.</content>

 Maintenance of cell size homeostasis is a property that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Cell size homeostasis is brought about by the co-ordination of cell division with cell growth, and requires restriction of smaller cells from undergoing mitosis and cell division, whilst allowing larger cells to do so. Cyclin-CDK is the fundamental driver of mitosis and therefore ultimately ensures size homeostasis. Here we dissect determinants of CDK activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;to investigate how cell size information is processed by the cell cycle network in fission yeast. We develop a high-throughput single-cell assay system of CDK activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and show that inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK encodes cell size information, with the phosphatase PP2A aiding to set a size threshold for division. CDK inhibitory phosphorylation works synergistically with PP2A to prevent mitosis in smaller cells. Finally, we find that diploid cells of equivalent size to haploid cells exhibit lower CDK activity in response to equal cyclin-CDK enzyme concentrations, suggesting that CDK activity is reduced by increased DNA levels. Therefore, scaling of cyclin-CDK levels with cell size, CDK inhibitory phosphorylation, PP2A, and DNA-dependent inhibition of CDK activity, all inform the cell cycle network of cell size, thus contributing to cell-size homeostasis.</content>

 A tightly regulated innate immune response to trypanosome infections is critical to strike a balance between parasite control and inflammation-associated pathology. In this study, we make use of the recently established Trypanosoma carassii infection model in larval zebrafish to study the early response of macrophages and neutrophils to trypanosome infections in vivo. We consistently identified high- and low-infected individuals and were able to simultaneously characterize their differential innate response. Not only did macrophage and neutrophil number and distribution differ between the two groups, but also macrophage morphology and activation state. Exclusive to high-infected zebrafish, was the occurrence of foamy macrophages characterized by a strong pro-inflammatory profile and potentially associated with an exacerbated immune response as well as susceptibility to the infection. To our knowledge this is the first report of the occurrence of foamy macrophages during an extracellular trypanosome infection.</content>

 &lt;i&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/i&gt; infection (CDI) remains an urgent global One Health threat. The genetic heterogeneity seen across &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; underscores its wide ecological versatility and has driven the significant changes in CDI epidemiology seen in the last 20 years. We analysed an international collection of over 12,000 &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; genomes spanning the eight currently defined phylogenetic clades. Through whole-genome average nucleotide identity, and pangenomic and Bayesian analyses, we identified major taxonomic incoherence with clear species boundaries for each of the recently described cryptic clades CI-III. The emergence of these three novel genomospecies predates clades C1-5 by millions of years, rewriting the global population structure of &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; specifically and taxonomy of the &lt;i&gt;Peptostreptococcaceae&lt;/i&gt; in general. These genomospecies all show unique and highly divergent toxin gene architecture, advancing our understanding of the evolution of &lt;i&gt;C. difficile&lt;/i&gt; and close relatives. Beyond the taxonomic ramifications, this work may impact the diagnosis of CDI.</content>

 Plexins are semaphorin receptors that play essential roles in mammalian neuronal axon guidance and in many other important mammalian biological processes. Plexin signaling depends on a semaphorin-induced dimerization mechanism, and is modulated by small GTPases of the Rho family, of which RND1 serves as a plexin activator yet its close homolog RhoD an inhibitor. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we showed that RND1 reinforces the plexin dimerization interface whereas RhoD destabilizes it due to their differential interaction with the cell membrane. Upon binding plexin at the Rho-GTPase binding domain (RBD), RND1 and RhoD interact differently with the inner leaflet of the cell membrane, and exert opposite effects on the dimerization interface via an allosteric network involving the RBD, RBD linkers, and a buttress segment adjacent to the dimerization interface. The differential membrane interaction is attributed to the fact that, unlike RND1, RhoD features a short C-terminal tail and a positively charged membrane interface.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The organization of micron-sized, multi-microtubule arrays from individual microtubules is essential for diverse cellular functions. The microtubule polymer is largely viewed as a passive building block during the organization process. An exception is the ‘tubulin code’ where alterations to tubulin at the amino acid level can influence the activity of microtubule-associated proteins. Recent studies reveal that micron-scale geometrical features of individual microtubules and polymer networks, such as microtubule length, overlap length, contact angle, and lattice defects, can also regulate the activity of microtubule-associated proteins and modulate polymer dynamics. We discuss how the interplay between such geometrical properties of the microtubule lattice and the activity of associated proteins direct multiple aspects of array organization, from microtubule nucleation and coalignment to specification of array dimensions and remodeling of dynamic networks. The mechanisms reviewed here highlight micron-sized features of microtubules as critical parameters to be routinely investigated in the study of microtubule self-organization.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In severe viral pneumonia, including Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the viral replication phase is often followed by hyperinflammation, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. We previously demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (⍺&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-AR) antagonists can prevent hyperinflammation and death in mice. Here, we conducted retrospective analyses in two cohorts of patients with acute respiratory distress (ARD, n = 18,547) and three cohorts with pneumonia (n = 400,907). Federated across two ARD cohorts, we find that patients exposed to ⍺&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-AR antagonists, as compared to unexposed patients, had a 34% relative risk reduction for mechanical ventilation and death (OR = 0.70, p = 0.021). We replicated these methods on three pneumonia cohorts, all with similar effects on both outcomes. All results were robust to sensitivity analyses. These results highlight the urgent need for prospective trials testing whether prophylactic use of ⍺&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-AR antagonists ameliorates lower respiratory tract infection-associated hyperinflammation and death, as observed in COVID-19.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Dynamic facial expressions are crucial for communication in primates. Due to the difficulty to control shape and dynamics of facial expressions across species, it is unknown how species-specific facial expressions are perceptually encoded and interact with the representation of facial shape. While popular neural network models predict a joint encoding of facial shape and dynamics, the neuromuscular control of faces evolved more slowly than facial shape, suggesting a separate encoding. To investigate these alternative hypotheses, we developed photo-realistic human and monkey heads that were animated with motion capture data from monkeys and humans. Exact control of expression dynamics was accomplished by a Bayesian machine-learning technique. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that human observers learned cross-species expressions very quickly, where face dynamics was represented largely independently of facial shape. This result supports the co-evolution of the visual processing and motor control of facial expressions, while it challenges appearance-based neural network theories of dynamic expression recognition.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Temporal continuity of object identity is a feature of natural visual input, and is potentially exploited -- in an unsupervised manner -- by the ventral visual stream to build the neural representation in inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Here we investigated whether plasticity of individual IT neurons underlies human core-object-recognition behavioral changes induced with unsupervised visual experience. We built a single-neuron plasticity model combined with a previously established IT population-to-recognition-behavior linking model to predict human learning effects. We found that our model, after constrained by neurophysiological data, largely predicted the mean direction, magnitude and time course of human performance changes. We also found a previously unreported dependency of the observed human performance change on the initial task difficulty. This result adds support to the hypothesis that tolerant core object recognition in human and non-human primates is instructed -- at least in part -- by naturally occurring unsupervised temporal contiguity experience.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The female meiotic spindles of most animals are acentrosomal and undergo striking morphological changes while transitioning from metaphase to anaphase. The ultra-structure of acentrosomal spindles, and how changes to this structure correlate with such dramatic spindle rearrangements remains largely unknown. To address this, we applied light microscopy, large-scale electron tomography and mathematical modeling of female meiotic &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;spindles undergoing the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Combining these approaches, we find that meiotic spindles are dynamic arrays of short microtubules that turn over on second time scales. The results show that the transition from metaphase to anaphase correlates with an increase in the number of microtubules and a decrease in their average length. Detailed analysis of the tomographic data revealed that the length of microtubules changes significantly during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. This effect is most pronounced for those microtubules located within 150 nm of the chromosome surface. To understand the mechanisms that drive this transition, we developed a mathematical model for the microtubule length distribution that considers microtubule growth, catastrophe, and severing. Using Bayesian inference to compare model predictions and data, we find that microtubule turn-over is the major driver of the observed large-scale reorganizations. Our data suggest that in metaphase only a minor fraction of microtubules, those that are closest to the chromosomes, are severed. The large majority of microtubules, which are not in close contact with chromosomes, do not undergo severing. Instead, their length distribution is fully explained by growth and catastrophe alone. In anaphase, even microtubules close to the chromosomes show no signs of cutting. This suggests that the most prominent drivers of spindle rearrangements from metaphase to anaphase are changes in nucleation and catastrophe rate. In addition, we provide evidence that microtubule severing is dependent on the presence of katanin.</content>

 Ca2+ signaling is a major contributor to sensory hair cell function in the cochlea. Oncomodulin (OCM) is a Ca2+ binding protein preferentially expressed in outer hair cells of the cochlea and few other specialized cell types. Here, we expand on our previous reports and show that OCM prevents early progressive hearing loss in mice of two different genetic backgrounds: CBA/CaJ and C57Bl/6J. In both backgrounds, genetic disruption of Ocm leads to early progressive hearing loss as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). In both strains, loss of Ocm reduced hearing across lifetime (hearing span) by more than 50% relative to wild type (WT). Even though the two WT strains have very different hearing spans, OCM plays a considerable and similar role within their genetic environment to regulate hearing function. The accelerated ARHL of the Ocm KO illustrates the importance of Ca2+ signaling in maintaining hearing health.</content>

 Insects adapt their response to stimuli, such as odours, according to their pairing with positive or negative reinforcements, such as sugar or shock. Recent electrophysiological and imaging findings in Drosophila melanogaster allow detailed examination of the neural mechanisms supporting acquisition, forgetting, and assimilation of memories. Drawing on this data, we identify a series of microcircuits within the mushroom bodies that reveal, for each motivational state, three different roles of dopaminergic and mushroom body output neurons in the memory dynamics. These microcircuits share components and form a unified system for rapid memory acquisition, transfer from short-term to long-term, and exploration/exploitation trade-off. We show that combined with a novel biologically plausible learning rule, a computational model of the full circuit reproduces the observed changes in the activity of each of these neurons in conditioning paradigms and can be used for flexible behavioural control.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA/DNA binding protein that normally resides in the nucleus. However, FUS forms pathologic cytoplasmic inclusions in two neurodegenerative disorders, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While a majority of ALS cases with FUS pathology can be explained by pathogenic mutations in the FUS gene, the vast majority of FTLD-FUS cases are not caused by FUS mutations and the reason why FUS forms inclusions is unknown. Therefore, identification of other non-genetic mechanisms that cause FUS to accumulate in the cytoplasm is crucial to understanding FTLD and ALS pathogenesis. To this end, DNA damage is known to trigger DNA-PK to phosphorylate FUS at N-terminal residues leading to FUS accumulation in the cytoplasm. However, the functional consequences of FUS phosphorylation are unknown. In this study, we performed proximity-dependent biotin labeling via ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APEX2) paired with mass spectrometry to investigate whether phosphorylation shifts the FUS interactome and protein function. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026578. We identified a highly interrelated interactome between wild-type, phosphomimetic FUS (a proxy for phosphorylated FUS), and the pathogenic ALS-linked mutant P525L FUS. We demonstrate that expression of phosphomimetic FUS shifts the FUS interactome toward more cytoplasmic functions including mediation of mRNA metabolism and translation. Our findings reveal that phosphorylation of FUS may disrupt homeostatic translation and mRNA metabolism. These results highlight the importance of phosphorylation as a modulator of FUS interactions and functions with a potential link to disease pathogenesis.</content>

 The neuropilin receptors and their secreted semaphorin ligands play key roles in brain circuit development by regulating numerous crucial neuronal processes, including the maturation of synapses and migration of GABAergic interneurons. Consistent with its developmental roles, the neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) locus contains polymorphisms in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Nrp2 deficient mice show autism-like behavioral deficits and propensity to develop seizures. In order to determine the pathophysiology in Nrp2 deficiency, we examined the hippocampal numbers of interneuron subtypes and inhibitory regulation of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in mice lacking one or both copies of Nrp2. Immunostaining for interneuron subtypes revealed that Nrp2-/- mice have reduced number of parvalbumin, somatostatin and Neuropeptide Y cells, mainly in CA1. Whole cell recordings identified reduced firing and hyperpolarized shift in resting membrane potential in CA1 pyramidal neurons from Nrp2+/- and Nrp2-/- mice compared to age-matched wild-type controls indicating decrease in intrinsic excitability. Simultaneously, the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) are reduced in Nrp2 deficient mice. A convulsive dose of kainic acid evoked electrographic and behavioral seizures with significantly shorter latency, longer duration and higher severity in Nrp2-/- compared to Nrp2+/+ animals. Finally, Nrp2+/- and Nrp2-/-, but not Nrp2+/+, mice have impaired cognitive flexibility demonstrated by reward-based reversal learning, a task associated with hippocampal circuit function. Together these data demonstrate a broad reduction in interneuron subtypes and compromised inhibition in CA1 of Nrp2-/- mice, which could contribute to the heightened seizure susceptibility and behavioral deficits consistent with an ASD/epilepsy phenotype.</content>

 Levodopa-based drugs are widely used for mitigating the complications induced by PD. Despite the positive effects, several issues regarding the way that levodopa changes brain activities have remained unclear. Methods-A combined strategy using EEG data and graph theory was used for investigating how levodopa changed connectome and processing hubs of the brain during resting-state. Obtained results were subjected to ANOVA test and multiple-comparison post-hoc correction procedure. Results: Results showed that graph topology of PD patients was not significantly different with the healthy group during eyes-closed condition while in eyes-open condition statistical significant differences were found. The main effect of levodopa medication was observed for gamma-band activity of the brain in which levodopa changed the brain connectome toward a star-like topology. Considering the beta subband of EEG data, graph leaf number increased following levodopa medication in PD patients. Enhanced brain connectivity in gamma band and reduced beta band connections in basal ganglia were also observed after levodopa medication. Furthermore, source localization using dipole fitting showed that levodopa prescription suppressed the activity of collateral trigone. Conclusion: Our combined EEG and graph analysis showed that levodopa medication changed the brain connectome, especially in the high-frequency range of EEG (beta and gamma).</content>

 Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the death of specific neuron types in particular brain regions. What makes the death of specific neuron types particularly harmful for the integrity and dynamics of the respective network is not well understood. To start addressing this question we used the most up-to-date biologically-realistic dense neocortical microcircuit (NMC) of rodent, which has reconstructed a volume of 0.3 mm3 and containing 31,000 neurons, 36 million synapses, and 55 morphological cell types arranged in 6 cortical layers. Using modern network science tools, we identified hub-neurons in the NMC, that are connected synaptically to a large number of their neighbors and systematically examined the impact of abolishing these cells. In general, the structural integrity of the network is robust to cells' attack; yet, attacking hub neurons strongly impacted the small worldness topology of the network, whereas similar attacks on random neurons have a negligible effect. Such hub-specific attacks are also impactful on the network dynamics, both when the network is at its spontaneous synchronous state and when it was presented with synchronized thalamo-cortical visual-like input. We found that attacking layer 5 hub neurons are most harmful to the structural and functional integrity of the NMC. The significance of our results for understanding the role of specific neuron types and cortical layers for disease manifestation is discussed.</content>

 The default mode network (DMN) is the most prominent intrinsic connectivity network, serving as a key architecture of the brain's functional organization. Conversely, dysregulation of the DMN is characteristic of major neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the field still lacks mechanistic insights into the regulation of the DMN and effective interventions for DMN dysregulation. The current study approached this problem by manipulating neural synchrony, particularly, alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations, a dominant intrinsic oscillatory activity that has been increasingly associated with the DMN in both function and physiology. Using high-definition (HD) alpha-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (-tACS) to stimulate the cortical source of alpha oscillations, in combination with simultaneous EEG-fMRI, we demonstrated that -tACS (vs. sham control) not only augmented EEG alpha oscillations but also strengthened fMRI and (source-level) alpha connectivity within the core of the DMN. Importantly, increase in alpha oscillations mediated the DMN connectivity enhancement. These findings thus identify a mechanistic link between alpha oscillations and DMN functioning. That transcranial alpha modulation can upregulate the DMN further highlights an effective non-invasive intervention to normalize DMN functioning in various disorders.</content>

 Sensory experiences are often driven by an animal's self-motion and locomotion is known to modulate neural responses in the mouse visual system. This modulation is hypothesised to improve the processing of behaviourally relevant visual inputs, which may change rapidly during locomotion. However, little is known about how locomotion modulates the temporal dynamics (time courses) of visually-evoked neural responses. Here, we analysed the temporal dynamics of single neuron and population responses to dot field stimuli moving at a range of visual speeds using the Visual Coding dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Science (Siegle et al, 2021). Single neuron responses had diverse temporal dynamics that varied between stationary and running sessions. Increased dynamic range and more reliable responses in running sessions enabled faster, stronger and more persistent encoding of visual speed. Population activity reflected the temporal dynamics of single neuron responses, including their modulation by locomotor state - neural trajectories of population activity made more direct transitions between baseline and stimulus steady states in running sessions. The structure of population coding also changed with locomotor state - population activity prioritised the encoding of visual speed in running, but not stationary sessions. Our results reveal a profound influence of locomotion on the temporal dynamics of neural responses. We demonstrate that during locomotion, mouse visual areas prioritise the encoding of potentially fast-changing, behaviourally relevant visual features.</content>

 Computerization of diagnostic neglect tests can deepen our knowledge of neglect specific abnormalities, by effortlessly providing additional behavioral markers that are hardly extractable from existing paper-and-pencil versions. However, so far it is not known whether the digitization and/or a change in size format impact neglect patients' search behavior and test scores and thus require adjustments of cut-off criteria. We compared the Center of cancellation (CoC) measure of right hemisphere stroke patients with spatial neglect in two cancellation tasks across different modalities (paper-and-pencil vs. digital) and display sizes (small, medium, large). We found that the CoC measure did neither vary considerably between paper-and-pencil versus digital versions, nor between different digital size formats. The CoC derived from cancellation tasks thus seems robust to test digitization. A further aim of the present study was to evaluate three additional parameters of search behavior which became available through digitization. We observed slower search behavior, increased distance between two consecutively identified items, and signs of a more strategic search for neglect patients than control patients without neglect. Machine learning classifications indicated that - beyond the CoC measure - the latter three variables can help to differentiate stroke patients with spatial neglect from those without.</content>

 A network of left frontal and temporal brain regions supports 'high-level' language processing-including the processing of word meanings, as well as word-combinatorial processing-across presentation modalities. This 'core' language network has been argued to store our knowledge of words and constructions as well as constraints on how those combine to form sentences. However, our linguistic knowledge additionally includes information about sounds (phonemes) and how they combine to form clusters, syllables, and words. Is this knowledge of phoneme combinatorics also represented in these language regions? Across five fMRI experiments, we investigated the sensitivity of high-level language processing brain regions to sub-lexical linguistic sound patterns by examining responses to diverse nonwords-sequences of sounds/letters that do not constitute real words (e.g., punes, silory, flope). We establish robust responses in the language network to visually (Experiment 1a, n=605) and auditorily (Experiments 1b, n=12, and 1c, n=13) presented nonwords relative to baseline. In Experiment 2 (n=16), we find stronger responses to nonwords that obey the phoneme-combinatorial constraints of English. Finally, in Experiment 3 (n=14) and a post-hoc analysis of Experiment 2, we provide suggestive evidence that the responses in Experiments 1 and 2 are not due to the activation of real words that share some phonology with the nonwords. The results suggest that knowledge of phoneme combinatorics and representations of sub-lexical linguistic sound patterns are stored within the same fronto-temporal network that stores higher-level linguistic knowledge and supports word and sentence comprehension.</content>

 Mounting evidence suggests that during conscious states, the electrodynamics of the cortex are poised near a critical point or phase transition, and that this near-critical behavior supports the vast flow of information through cortical networks during conscious states. Here, for the first time, we empirically identify the specific critical point near which conscious cortical dynamics operate as the edge-of-chaos critical point, or the boundary between stability and chaos. We do so by applying the recently developed modified 0-1 chaos test to electrocorticography (ECoG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from the cortices of humans and macaques across normal waking, generalized seizure, GABAergic anesthesia, and psychedelic states. Our evidence suggests that cortical information processing is disrupted during unconscious states because of a transition of cortical dynamics away from this critical point; conversely, we show that psychedelics may increase the information-richness of cortical activity by tuning cortical electrodynamics closer to this critical point. Finally, we analyze clinical electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC), and show that assessing the proximity of cortical electrodynamics to the edge-of-chaos critical point may be clinically useful as a new biomarker of consciousness.</content>

 Experiencing intrusive distressing memories of a traumatic event(s) is a prominent symptom profile for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms associated with this symptom profile can be invaluable for effective treatment for PTSD. Here, we investigated the functional role of the nucleus reuniens (RE), a midline thalamic in modulating stressor-related memory. Female Long Evans rats were implanted with a cannula aimed at the RE. The RE was pharmacologically inactivated via muscimol (0.5 mM) prior to exposure to the predator odor stressor trimethylthiazoline (TMT; synthetically derived fox feces component) or water (controls) in a distinct context with bedding material (Experiment 1) or no bedding (Experiment 2). To measure context reactivity, the index of the contextual memory, 2 weeks following exposure to TMT, rats were re-exposed to the TMT-paired context (in the absence of TMT). In Experiment 1, during context re-exposure (with bedding), inactivation of the RE had no effect on context reactivity. In Experiment 2, during context re-exposure (no bedding), rats previous exposed to TMT showed decreased immobility compared to controls, indicating reactivity to the context and likely related to increased exploration of the environment. Rats in the TMT group that received RE inactivation showed increased immobility relative to rats that received aCSF, suggesting that muscimol pre-treatment blunted context reactivity. In conclusion, recruitment of the RE in stressor-related contextual memory appears to be dependent on the contextual environment and whether the animal is able to engage in different stress coping strategies.</content>

 Classification and characterization of neuronal types is critical for understanding their function and dysfunction. Neuronal classification schemes typically rely on measurements of electrophysiological, morphological and molecular features, but aligning these data sets has been challenging. Here, we present a unified classification of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the sole retinal output neurons. We used visually-evoked responses to classify 1777 mouse RGCs into 42 types. We also obtained morphological or transcriptomic data from subsets and used these measurements to align the functional classification to publicly available morphological and transcriptomic data sets. We created an online database that allows users to browse or download the data and to classify RGCs from their light responses using a machine-learning algorithm. This work provides a resource for studies of RGCs, their upstream circuits in the retina, and their projections in the brain, and establishes a framework for future efforts in neuronal classification and open data distribution.</content>

 The supraspinal connectome is essential for normal behavior and homeostasis and consists of a wide range of sensory, motor, and autonomic projections from brain to spinal cord. Extensive work spanning a century has largely mapped the cell bodies of origin, yet their broad distribution and complex spatial relationships present significant challenges to the dissemination and application of this knowledge. Fields that study disruptions of supraspinal projections, for example spinal cord injury, have focused mostly on a handful of major populations that carry motor commands, with only limited consideration of dozens more that provide autonomic or crucial motor modulation. More comprehensive information is essential to understand the functional consequences of different injuries and to better evaluate the efficacy of treatments. Using viral retrograde labeling, 3D imaging, and registration to standard neuro-anatomical atlases we now provide a platform to profile the entire supraspinal connectome by rapidly visualizing and quantifying tens of thousands of supraspinal neurons, each assigned to more than 60 identified regions and nuclei throughout the brains of adult mice. We then use this tool to compare the lumbar versus cervically-projecting connectomes, to profile brain-wide the sensitivity of supraspinal populations to graded spinal injuries, and to correlate locomotor recovery with connectome measurements. To share these insights in an intuitive manner, we present an interactive web-based resource, which aims to spur progress by broadening understanding and analyses of essential but understudied supraspinal populations.</content>

 The striatum is a major subcortical connection hub that has been heavily implicated in a wide array of motor and cognitive functions. Here, we developed a normative multimodal, data-driven microstructural parcellation of the striatum using multiple magnetic resonance imaging-based metrics (mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and the ratio between T1- and T2-weighted structural) from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset (n=329 unrelated participants, age range: 22-35, F/M: 185/144). We further explored the biological and functional relationships of this parcellation by relating our findings to motor and cognitive performance in tasks known to involve the striatum as well as demographics. We identified 5 spatially distinct striatal components, for each hemisphere. We also show the gain in component stability when using multimodal versus unimodal metrics. Our findings suggest distinct microstructural patterns in the human striatum that are largely symmetric and that relate mostly to age and sex. Our work also highlights the putative functional relevance of these striatal components to different designations based on a Neurosynth meta-analysis.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The ability to discriminate competing, ecologically relevant stimuli, and initiate contextually appropriate behaviors, is a key brain function. Neurons in the deep superior colliculus (dSC) integrate multisensory inputs and activate descending projections to premotor pathways responsible for orienting and attention, which often involve adjustments to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. However, the neural pathways that subserve physiological components of orienting are poorly understood. We report that orienting responses to optogenetic dSC stimulation are accompanied by short-latency autonomic, respiratory and electroencephalographic effects in conscious rats, closely mimicking those evoked by naturalistic alerting stimuli. Physiological responses occurred in the absence of detectable aversion or fear and persisted under urethane anesthesia, indicating independence from emotional stress. Moreover, autonomic responses were replicated by selective stimulation of dSC inputs to the medullary reticular formation, a major target of dSC motor efferents, This disynaptic pathway represent a likely substrate for autonomic components of orienting.</content>

To survive, animals have to quickly modify their behaviour when the reward changes. The internal representations responsible for this are updated through synaptic weight changes, mediated by certain neuromodulators conveying feedback from the environment. In previous experiments, we discovered a form of hippocampal Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) that is sequentially modulated by acetylcholine and dopamine. Acetylcholine facilitates synaptic depression, while dopamine retroactively converts the depression into potentiation. When these experimental findings were implemented as a learning rule in a computational model, our simulations showed that cholinergic-facilitated depression is important for reversal learning. In the present study, we tested the model’s prediction by optogenetically inactivating cholinergic neurons in mice during a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task with changing rewards. We found that reversal learning, but not initial place learning, was impaired, verifying our computational prediction that acetylcholine-modulated plasticity promotes the unlearning of old reward locations. Further, differences in neuromodulator concentrations in the model captured mouse-by-mouse performance variability in the optogenetic experiments. Our line of work sheds light on how neuromodulators enable the learning of new contingencies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iA1twVExQEE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators in the central nervous system (CNS). However, their roles in the cerebellum are currently unclear. In this work, we identified the isoform 204 of lncRNA &lt;i&gt;Gm2694&lt;/i&gt; (designated as &lt;i&gt;lncRNA-Promoting Methylation&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;lncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt;)) is highly expressed in the cerebellum and derived from the antisense strand of the upstream region of &lt;i&gt;Cerebellin-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt;), a well-known critical cerebellar synaptic organizer. &lt;i&gt;LncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt; exhibits similar spatiotemporal expression pattern as &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; in the postnatal mouse cerebellum and activates the transcription of &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; through Pax6/Mll1-mediated H3K4me3. In mouse cerebellum, &lt;i&gt;lncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt;, Pax6/Mll1, and H3K4me3 are all associated with the regulatory regions of &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt;. Knockdown of &lt;i&gt;lncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt; in cerebellum causes deficiencies in &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; expression, cerebellar synaptic integrity, and motor function. Together, our work reveals an lncRNA-mediated transcriptional activation of &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; through Pax6-Mll1-H3K4me3 and provides novel insights of the essential roles of lncRNA in the cerebellum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xpLhYAqbyS4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The speed of muscle contraction is related to body size; muscles in larger species contract at slower rates. Since contraction speed is a property of the myosin isoform expressed in a muscle, we investigated how sequence changes in a range of muscle myosin II isoforms enable this slower rate of muscle contraction. We considered 798 sequences from 13 mammalian myosin II isoforms to identify any adaptation to increasing body mass. We identified a correlation between body mass and sequence divergence for the motor domain of the 4 major adult myosin II isoforms (β/Type I, IIa, IIb, and IIx), suggesting that these isoforms have adapted to increasing body mass. In contrast, the non-muscle and developmental isoforms show no correlation of sequence divergence with body mass. Analysis of the motor domain sequence of β-myosin (predominant myosin in Type I/slow and cardiac muscle) from 67 mammals from 2 distinct clades identifies 16 sites, out of 800, associated with body mass (p&lt;sub&gt;adj&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) but not with the clade (p&lt;sub&gt;adj&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Both clades change the same small set of amino acids, in the same order from small to large mammals, suggesting a limited number of ways in which contraction velocity can be successfully manipulated. To test this relationship, the 9 sites that differ between human and rat were mutated in the human β-myosin to match the rat sequence. Biochemical analysis revealed that the rat–human β-myosin chimera functioned like the native rat myosin with a 2-fold increase in both motility and in the rate of ADP release from the actin–myosin crossbridge (the step that limits contraction velocity). Thus, these sequence changes indicate adaptation of β-myosin as species mass increased to enable a reduced contraction velocity and heart rate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/selZOH0i93g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Hypoxia has an immense effect on the retina, especially on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It causes cell damage and results in vision loss. In this study, the electrical RGC activity under hypoxic conditions is analyzed using a multielectrode array‐based ex vivo model.

Abstract
Several eye diseases, for example, retinal artery occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, are associated with retinal hypoxia. The lack of oxygen in the retina, especially in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causes cell damage up to cell degeneration and leads to blindness. Using multielectrode array recordings, an ex vivo hypoxia acute model was established to analyze the electrical activity of murine wild‐type retinae under hypoxic stress conditions. Hypoxia was induced by exchanging the perfusion with oxygen‐saturated medium by nitrogen‐saturated medium. Hypoxic periods of 0 min (control) up to 60 min were tested on the retinae of adult female C57BL/6J mice. The electrical RGC activity vanished during hypoxia, but conditionally returned after the reestablishment of conventional test conditions. With increasing duration of hypoxia, the returning RGC activity decreased. After a hypoxic period of 30 min and a subsequent recovery time of 30 min, 59.43 ± 11.35% of the initially active channels showed a restored RGC activity. The survival rate of retinal cells after hypoxic stress was analyzed by a live/dead staining assay using two‐photon laser scanning microscopy. For detailed information about molecular changes caused by hypoxia, a microarray gene expression analysis was performed. Furthermore, the effect of 2‐aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine, 1 mM) on retinae under hypoxic stress was tested. Treatment with taurine resulted in an increase in the RGC response rate after hypoxia and also increased the survival rate of retinal cells under hypoxic stress, confirming its potential as promising candidate for neuroprotective therapies of eye diseases.</content>

 This is the first study to demonstrate functional as well as structural plasticity of the central olfactory networks, following surgical treatment for olfactory dysfunction. Our results help to confirm the neuroanatomical corelates of olfactory function and dysfunction.

Abstract
Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is more common than hearing loss, partial blindness, or blindness and can have a significant impact on the quality of life. Moreover, unexplained OD is an early biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases and increases 5‐year mortality risk. Structural alterations in olfactory eloquent brain regions may represent the neuroanatomical correlates of OD. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced gray matter (GM) volume in areas of presumed olfactory relevance in patients with OD. However, being cross‐sectional in nature, these studies do not provide evidence of causality, for which longitudinal work is required. At present, however, longitudinal studies addressing olfactory structural plasticity are limited, both in number and methodological approach: to our knowledge, such work has not included parallel functional imaging to confirm the relevance of structural change. We therefore performed a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study investigating structural and functional plasticity in 24 patients undergoing surgical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis, compared with 17 healthy controls. We demonstrated functionally significant structural plasticity within the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and temporal poles in patients 3 months after surgery. Of interest, GM volume decreased in these regions, in association with increased psychophysical scores and BOLD signal. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate both structural and functional plasticity of the central olfactory networks, thereby confirming these areas as neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory function/dysfunction.</content>

 The topology of brain networks along the menstrual cycle (MC), estimated in 24 women (N = 24), is influenced by estradiol blood levels. The betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG), in the alpha frequency band, increased in the peri‐ovulatory phase (a). The estradiol levels predicted the BC variance in rPCG (b) and, accordingly, its variations during the luteal phase (expressed as the difference between the mid‐luteal and peri‐ovulatory time points of the MC) correlated positively with the variation of the BC of the rPCG (c).

Abstract
The menstrual cycle (MC) is a sex hormone‐related phenomenon that repeats itself cyclically during the woman's reproductive life. In this explorative study, we hypothesized that coordinated variations of multiple sex hormones may affect the large‐scale organization of the brain functional network and that, in turn, such changes might have psychological correlates, even in the absence of overt clinical signs of anxiety and/or depression. To test our hypothesis, we investigated longitudinally, across the MC, the relationship between the sex hormones and both brain network and psychological changes. We enrolled 24 naturally cycling women and, at the early‐follicular, peri‐ovulatory, and mid‐luteal phases of the MC, we performed: (a) sex hormone dosage, (b) magnetoencephalography recording to study the brain network topology, and (c) psychological questionnaires to quantify anxiety, depression, self‐esteem, and well‐being. We showed that during the peri‐ovulatory phase, in the alpha band, the leaf fraction and the tree hierarchy of the brain network were reduced, while the betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG) was increased. Furthermore, the increase in BC was predicted by estradiol levels. Moreover, during the luteal phase, the variation of estradiol correlated positively with the variations of both the topological change and environmental mastery dimension of the well‐being test, which, in turn, was related to the increase in the BC of rPCG. Our results highlight the effects of sex hormones on the large‐scale brain network organization as well as on their possible relationship with the psychological state across the MC. Moreover, the fact that physiological changes in the brain topology occur throughout the MC has widespread implications for neuroimaging studies.</content>

 Abstract
Epilepsy is a debilitating disorder of uncontrollable recurrent seizures that occurs as a result of imbalances in the brain excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signals, that could stem from a range of functional and structural neuronal impairments. Globally, nearly 70 million people are negatively impacted by epilepsy and its comorbidities. One such comorbidity is the effect epilepsy has on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which plays a role in the control of blood circulation, respiration and gastrointestinal function. These epilepsy‐induced impairments in the circulatory and respiratory systems may contribute toward sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although, various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of epilepsy on ANS, the linking pathological mechanism still remains unclear. Channelopathies and seizure‐induced damages in ANS‐control brain structures were some of the causal/pathological candidates of cardiorespiratory comorbidities in epilepsy patients, especially in those who were drug resistant. However, emerging preclinical research suggest that neurotransmitter/receptor dysfunction and synaptic changes in the ANS may also contribute to the epilepsy‐related autonomic disorders. Thus, pathological mechanisms of cardiorespiratory dysfunction should be elucidated by considering the modifications in anatomy and physiology of the autonomic system caused by seizures. In this regard, we present a comprehensive review of the current literature, both clinical and preclinical animal studies, on the cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy and elucidate the possible pathological mechanisms of these findings, in hopes to prevent SUDEP especially in patients who are drug resistant.</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Quantum measurement theory is applied to quantum-like modeling of coherent
generation of perceptions and emotions and generally for emotional coloring of
conscious experiences. In quantum theory, a system should be separated from an
observer. The brain performs self-measurements. To model them, we split the
brain into two subsystems, unconsciousness and consciousness. They correspond
to a system and an observer. The states of perceptions and emotions are
described through the tensor product decomposition of the unconscious state
space; similarly, there are two classes of observables, for conscious
experiencing of perceptions and emotions, respectively. Emotional coloring is
coupled to quantum contextuality: emotional observables determine contexts.
Such contextualization reduces degeneration of unconscious states. The
quantum-like approach should be distinguished from consideration of the genuine
quantum physical processes in the brain (cf. Penrose and Hameroff). In our
approach the brain is a macroscopic system which information processing can be
described by the formalism of quantum theory.

 &lt;p&gt;One of the greatest research challenges of this century is to understand the
neural basis for how behavior emerges in brain-body-environment systems. To
this end, research has flourished along several directions but have
predominantly focused on the brain. While there is in an increasing acceptance
and focus on including the body and environment in studying the neural basis of
behavior, animal researchers are often limited by technology or tools.
Computational models provide an alternative framework within which one can
study model systems where ground-truth can be measured and interfered with.
These models act as a hypothesis generation framework that would in turn guide
experimentation. Furthermore, the ability to intervene as we please, allows us
to conduct in-depth analysis of these models in a way that cannot be performed
in natural systems. For this purpose, information theory is emerging as a
powerful tool that can provide insights into the operation of these
brain-body-environment models. In this work, I provide an introduction, a
review and discussion to make a case for how information theoretic analysis of
computational models is a potent research methodology to help us better
understand the neural basis of behavior.

 &lt;p&gt;This document introduces a hypothesized framework on the functional nature of
primitive neural network. It discusses such an idea that the activity of
neurons and synapses can symbolically reenact the dynamic changes in the world
and enable an adaptive system of behavior. More specifically, the network
achieves these without participating in an algorithmic structure. When a
neuron's activation represents some symbolic element in the environment, each
of its synapses can indicate a potential change to the element and its future
state. The efficacy of a synaptic connection further specifies the element's
particular probability for, or contribution to, such a change. A neuron's
activation is transformed to its postsynaptic targets as it fires, resulting in
a chronological shift of the represented elements. As the inherent function of
summation in a neuron integrates the various presynaptic contributions, the
neural network mimics the collective causal relationship of events in the
observed environment.

 &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a neurological disorder, always coming with abnormal brain
seizures activity of complex randomness and unpredictability, which have
brought obstacles for the improvement of epileptic treatment. However, the
mechanism of the epileptic randomness has not been unfolded. Inspired by the
recent experimental finding that astrocyte G protein coupled receptor involves
in the stochastic epileptic seizures, we proposed a cortical tripartite
synaptic network of neurons and astrocytes with the G protein noise, which is
capable to explain the stochastic process of epileptic seizures in the
involvement of the G protein noise, a Gaussian distributed noise which explains
the heterogeneity of the G protein types and the nonuniform environmental
effect. Based on this model, we have discussed the dynamical stochastic
induction process of the epileptic seizures statistically by performing totally
60 simulation trials. Our simulation results showed that the increase of the
noise intensity could induce the epileptic seizures state coexisting with the
increase of frequency and in vitro epileptic depolarization blocks. Meanwhile,
there has been a bistable state of the noise intensity for the neurons
switching among the regular sparse spiking and the epileptic seizure state.
This random presence of epileptic seizure state would be absent when the noise
intensity continues to increase, then the neurons start to stay in epileptic
seizures steadily, but with an increase of the epileptic depolarization block
duration. The simulation results also shed light on the fact that the calcium
signals in astrocytes have played significant roles in the pattern formation of
both the random and steady epileptic seizure state. Our results on the
stochastic process of the epileptic seizures could provide potential theory for
improvement for the epileptic prediction and treatment.

 &lt;p&gt;In the past few years, significant advancements were made in reconstruction
of observed natural images from fMRI brain recordings using deep-learning
tools. Here, for the first time, we show that dense 3D depth maps of observed
2D natural images can also be recovered directly from fMRI brain recordings. We
use an off-the-shelf method to estimate the unknown depth maps of natural
images. This is applied to both: (i) the small number of images presented to
subjects in an fMRI scanner (images for which we have fMRI recordings -
referred to as &quot;paired&quot; data), and (ii) a very large number of natural images
with no fMRI recordings (&quot;unpaired data&quot;). The estimated depth maps are then
used as an auxiliary reconstruction criterion to train for depth reconstruction
directly from fMRI. We propose two main approaches: Depth-only recovery and
joint image-depth RGBD recovery. Because the number of available &quot;paired&quot;
training data (images with fMRI) is small, we enrich the training data via
self-supervised cycle-consistent training on many &quot;unpaired&quot; data (natural
images &amp;amp; depth maps without fMRI). This is achieved using our newly defined and
trained Depth-based Perceptual Similarity metric as a reconstruction criterion.
We show that predicting the depth map directly from fMRI outperforms its
indirect sequential recovery from the reconstructed images. We further show
that activations from early cortical visual areas dominate our depth
reconstruction results, and propose means to characterize fMRI voxels by their
degree of depth-information tuning. This work adds an important layer of
decoded information, extending the current envelope of visual brain decoding
capabilities.

 &lt;p&gt;The representation used for solutions in optimization can have a significant
impact on the performance of the optimization method. Traditional population
based evolutionary methods have homogeneous populations where all solutions use
the same representation. If different representations are to be considered,
different runs are required to investigate the relative performance. In this
paper, we illustrate the use of a population based evolutionary method, Fresa,
inspired by the propagation of Strawberry plants, which allows for multiple
representations to co-exist in the population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresa is implemented in the Julia language. Julia provides dynamic typing and
multiple dispatch. In multiple dispatch, the function invoked is determined,
dynamically at run time, by the types of the arguments passed to it. This
enables a generic implementation of key steps in the plant propagation
algorithm which allows for a heterogeneous population. The search procedure
then leads to a competition between representations automatically.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple case study from the design of operating conditions for a batch
reactor system is used to illustrate heterogeneous population based search.

 &lt;p&gt;Public charging station occupancy prediction plays key importance in
developing a smart charging strategy to reduce electric vehicle (EV) operator
and user inconvenience. However, existing studies are mainly based on
conventional econometric or time series methodologies with limited accuracy. We
propose a new mixed long short-term memory neural network incorporating both
historical charging state sequences and time-related features for multistep
discrete charging occupancy state prediction. Unlike the existing LSTM
networks, the proposed model separates different types of features and handles
them differently with mixed neural network architecture. The model is compared
to a number of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning approaches
based on the EV charging data obtained from the open data portal of the city of
Dundee, UK. The results show that the proposed method produces very accurate
predictions (99.99% and 81.87% for 1 step (10 minutes) and 6 step (1 hour)
ahead, respectively, and outperforms the benchmark approaches significantly
(+22.4% for one-step-ahead prediction and +6.2% for 6 steps ahead). A
sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of the model
parameters on prediction accuracy.

 &lt;p&gt;Neural language models can be successfully trained on source code, leading to
applications such as code completion. However, their versatile autoregressive
self-supervision objective overlooks important global sequence-level features
that are present in the data such as syntactic correctness or compilability. In
this work, we pose the problem of learning to generate compilable code as
constraint satisfaction. We define an Energy-Based Model (EBM) representing a
pre-trained generative model with an imposed constraint of generating only
compilable sequences. We then use the KL-Adaptive Distributional Policy
Gradient algorithm (Khalifa et al., 2021) to train a generative model
approximating the EBM. We conduct experiments showing that our proposed
approach is able to improve compilability rates without sacrificing diversity
and complexity of the generated samples.

 &lt;p&gt;Nowadays, DevOps pipelines of huge projects are getting more and more
complex. Each job in the pipeline might need different requirements including
specific hardware specifications and dependencies. To achieve minimal makespan,
developers always apply as much machines as possible. Consequently, others may
be stalled for waiting resource released. Minimizing the makespan of each job
using a few resource is a challenging problem. In this study, it is aimed to 1)
automatically determine the priority of jobs to reduce the waiting time in the
line, 2) automatically allocate the machine resource to each job. In this work,
the problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. We use GA
algorithm to automatically determine job priorities and resource demand for
minimizing individual makespan and resource usage. Finally, the experimental
results show that our proposed priority list generation algorithm is more
effective than current priority list producing method in the aspects of

 &lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, synaptic plasticity refers to the set of mechanisms driving
the dynamics of neuronal connections, called synapses and represented by a
scalar value, the synaptic weight. A Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
rule is a biologically-based model representing the time evolution of the
synaptic weight as a functional of the past spiking activity of adjacent
neurons. A general mathematical framework has been introduced in [37].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper we develop and investigate a scaling approach of these models
based on several biological assumptions. Experiments show that long-term
synaptic plasticity evolves on a much slower timescale than the cellular
mechanisms driving the activity of neuronal cells, like their spiking activity
or the concentration of various chemical components created/suppressed by this
spiking activity. For this reason, a scaled version of the stochastic model of
[37] is introduced and a limit theorem, an averaging principle, is stated for a
large class of plasticity kernels. A companion paper [36] is entirely devoted
to the tightness properties used to prove these convergence results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These averaging principles are used to study two important STDP models:
pair-based rules and calcium-based rules. Our results are compared with the
approximations of neuroscience STDP models. A class of discrete models of STDP
rules is also investigated for the analytical tractability of its limiting
dynamical system.

 &lt;p&gt;The dynamical system described herein uses a hybrid cellular automata (CA)
mechanism to attain reversibility, and this approach is adapted to create a
novel block cipher algorithm called HCA. CA are widely used for modeling
complex systems and employ an inherently parallel model. Therefore,
applications derived from CA have a tendency to fit very well in the current
computational paradigm where scalability and multi-threading potential are
quite desirable characteristics. HCA model has recently received a patent by
the Brazilian agency INPI. Several evaluations and analyses performed on the
model are presented here, such as theoretical discussions related to its
reversibility and an analysis based on graph theory, which reduces HCA security
to the well-known Hamiltonian cycle problem that belongs to the NP-complete
class. Finally, the cryptographic robustness of HCA is empirically evaluated
through several tests, including avalanche property compliance and the NIST
randomness suite.

 &lt;p&gt;Taking the role of a computer naturalist, a journey is taken through bio
inspired algorithms taking account on algorithms which are inspired on living
being behaviors. A compilation of algorithms is made considering several
reviews or surveys of bio-inspired heuristics and swarm intelligence until 2020
year. A classification is made considering kingdoms as used by biologists
generating several branches for animalia, bacteria, plants, fungi and protista
to develop a taxonomy.

 &lt;p&gt;Deep learning techniques are increasingly being adopted for classification
tasks over the past decade, yet explaining how deep learning architectures can
achieve state-of-the-art performance is still an elusive goal. While all the
training information is embedded deeply in a trained model, we still do not
understand much about its performance by only analyzing the model. This paper
examines the neuron activation patterns of deep learning-based classification
models and explores whether the models' performances can be explained through
neurons' activation behavior. We propose two approaches: one that models
neurons' activation behavior as a graph and examines whether the neurons form
meaningful communities, and the other examines the predictability of neurons'
behavior using entropy. Our comprehensive experimental study reveals that both
the community quality (modularity) and entropy are closely related to the deep
learning models' performances, thus paves a novel way of explaining deep
learning models directly from the neurons' activation pattern.

 &lt;p&gt;Each year a growing number of wind farms are being added to power grids to
generate electricity. The power curve of a wind turbine, which exhibits the
relationship between generated power and wind speed, plays a major role in
assessing the performance of a wind farm. Neural networks have been used for
power curve estimation. However, they do not produce a confidence measure for
their output, unless computationally prohibitive Bayesian methods are used. In
this paper, a probabilistic neural network with Monte Carlo dropout is
considered to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty of the power curve
estimation. This approach offers a minimal increase in computational complexity
over deterministic approaches. Furthermore, by incorporating a probabilistic
loss function, the noise or aleatoric uncertainty in the data is estimated. The
developed network captures both model and noise uncertainty which is found to
be useful tools in assessing performance. Also, the developed network is
compared with existing ones across a public domain dataset showing superior
performance in terms of prediction accuracy.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04651"/>

		<updated>2021-06-10T01:30:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We propose that the entirety of the prefrontal cortex can be seen as
fundamentally premotor in nature. By this, we mean that the prefrontal cortex
consists of an action abstraction hierarchy whose core function is the
potentiation and depotentiation of possible action plans at different levels of
granularity. We argue that the apex of the hierarchy should revolve around the
process of goal selection, which we posit is inherently a form of abstract
action optimization. Anatomical and functional evidence supports the idea that
this hierarchy originates on the orbital surface of the brain and extends
dorsally to motor cortex. Our view, therefore, positions the orbitofrontal
cortex as the central site for the optimization of goal selection policies, and
suggests that other proposed roles are aspects of this more general function.
We conclude by proposing that the dynamical systems approach, which works well
in motor systems, can be extended to the rest of prefrontal cortex. Our
proposed perspective will reframe outstanding questions, open up new areas of
inquiry, and will align theories of prefrontal function with evolutionary
principles.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Surrogate algorithms such as Bayesian optimisation are especially designed
for black-box optimisation problems with expensive objectives, such as
hyperparameter tuning or simulation-based optimisation. In the literature,
these algorithms are usually evaluated with synthetic benchmarks which are well
established but have no expensive objective, and only on one or two real-life
applications which vary wildly between papers. There is a clear lack of
standardisation when it comes to benchmarking surrogate algorithms on
real-life, expensive, black-box objective functions. This makes it very
difficult to draw conclusions on the effect of algorithmic contributions. A new
benchmark library, EXPObench, provides first steps towards such a
standardisation. The library is used to provide an extensive comparison of six
different surrogate algorithms on four expensive optimisation problems from
different real-life applications. This has led to new insights regarding the
relative importance of exploration, the evaluation time of the objective, and
the used model. A further contribution is that we make the algorithms and
benchmark problem instances publicly available, contributing to more uniform
analysis of surrogate algorithms. Most importantly, we include the performance
of the six algorithms on all evaluated problem instances. This results in a
unique new dataset that lowers the bar for researching new methods as the
number of expensive evaluations required for comparison is significantly
reduced.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;One of the key difficulties in using estimation-of-distribution algorithms is
choosing the population size(s) appropriately: Too small values lead to genetic
drift, which can cause enormous difficulties. In the regime with no genetic
drift, however, often the runtime is roughly proportional to the population
size, which renders large population sizes inefficient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a recent quantitative analysis which population sizes lead to
genetic drift, we propose a parameter-less version of the compact genetic
algorithm that automatically finds a suitable population size without spending
too much time in situations unfavorable due to genetic drift.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prove a mathematical runtime guarantee for this algorithm and conduct an
extensive experimental analysis on four classic benchmark problems both without
and with additive centered Gaussian posterior noise. The former shows that
under a natural assumption, our algorithm has a performance very similar to the
one obtainable from the best problem-specific population size. The latter
confirms that missing the right population size in the original cGA can be
detrimental and that previous theory-based suggestions for the population size
can be far away from the right values; it also shows that our algorithm as well
as a previously proposed parameter-less variant of the cGA based on parallel
runs avoid such pitfalls. Comparing the two parameter-less approaches, ours
profits from its ability to abort runs which are likely to be stuck in a
genetic drift situation.

Here, the authors introduce a cage-in-framework structure in which reorientation of the cage cation does not alter the cubic symmetry of the perovskite lattice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/fT6ZdpFmtaE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Acute aerobic exercise performed prior to training may assist with motor skill acquisition through enhancement of motor cortical plasticity. In addition, high-intensity exercise performed after training improves retention, although the mechanisms of this are unclear. We hypothesized that acute continuous moderate-intensity exercise performed post-motor training would also assist with motor skill retention and that this behavioral change would be positively correlated with neural markers of training-related cortical adaptation. Participants [&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 33; assigned to an exercise (EXE) or control (CON) group] completed a single visuomotor training session using bilateral wrist movements while movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) were collected. After motor training, the EXE group exercised for 20 min [70% of heart rate reserve (HRR)] and the CON group read for the same amount of time. Both groups completed two post-training tests after exercise/rest: 10 min and ~ 30 min once heart rate returned to resting level in EXE. Retention and transfer tests were both completed 1 and 7 days later. MRCPs measured training-related neural adaptations during the first visit and motor performance was assessed as time and trajectory to the target. The EXE group had better performance than CON at retention (significant 7 days post-training). MRCP amplitudes increased from early to late motor training and this amplitude change was correlated with motor performance at retention. Results suggest that moderate-intensity exercise post-motor training helps motor skill retention and that there may be a relationship with motor training-related cortical adaptations that is enhanced with post-motor training exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical regulatory role in motor coordination, cognition, behavior, language, memory, and learning, hence overseeing a multiplicity of functions. Cerebellar development begins during early embryonic development, lasting until the first postnatal years. Particularly, the greatest increase of its volume occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy, which represents a critical period for cerebellar maturation. Preterm birth and all the related prenatal and perinatal contingencies may determine both dysmaturative and lesional events, potentially involving the developing cerebellum, and contributing to the constellation of the neuropsychiatric outcomes with several implications in setting-up clinical follow-up and early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Motivational and attentional processes energize action sequences to facilitate evolutionary competition and promote behavioral fitness. Decades of neuropharmacology, electrophysiology and electrochemistry research indicate that the mesocorticolimbic DA pathway modulates both motivation and attention. More recently, it was realized that mesocorticolimbic DA function is tightly regulated by the brain’s endocannabinoid system and greatly influenced by exogenous cannabinoids—which have been harnessed by humanity for medicinal, ritualistic, and recreational uses for 12,000 years. Exogenous cannabinoids, like the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, produce their effects by acting at binding sites for naturally occurring endocannabinoids. The brain’s endocannabinoid system consists of two G-protein coupled receptors, endogenous lipid ligands for these receptor targets, and several synthetic and metabolic enzymes involved in their production and degradation. Emerging evidence indicates that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol is necessary to observe concurrent increases in DA release and motivated behavior. And the historical pharmacology literature indicates a role for cannabinoid signaling in both motivational and attentional processes. While both types of behaviors have been scrutinized under manipulation by either DA or cannabinoid agents, there is considerably less insight into prospective interactions between these two important signaling systems. This review attempts to summate the relevance of cannabinoid modulation of DA release during operant tasks designed to investigate either motivational or attentional control of behavior. We first describe how cannabinoids influence DA release and goal-directed action under a variety of reinforcement contingencies. Then we consider the role that endocannabinoids might play in switching an animal’s motivation from a goal-directed action to the search for an alternative outcome, in addition to the formation of long-term habits. Finally, dissociable features of attentional behavior using both the 5-choice serial reaction time task and the attentional set-shifting task are discussed along with their distinct influences by DA and cannabinoids. We end with discussing potential targets for further research regarding DA-cannabinoid interactions within key substrates involved in motivation and attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that the T allele of rs405509 located in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) promotor region is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the effect of the T/T allele on brain function in non-demented aging is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed the effects of the rs405509 T/T allele on cognitive performances using multiple neuropsychological tests and local brain function using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant differences were found between T/T carriers and G allele carriers on general cognitive status, memory, and attention (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Rs-fMRI analyses demonstrated decreased amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the right middle frontal gyrus, decreased percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) in the right middle frontal gyrus, increased regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the right cerebellar tonsil and decreased ReHo in the right putamen, and decreased degree centrality (DC) in the left middle frontal gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected). Furthermore, significant correlations were found between cognitive performance and these neuroimaging changes (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that T/T allele may serve as an independent risk factor that can influence brain function in different regions in non-demented aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Systematic reviews of neuroimaging studies confirm stimulus-induced activity in response to verbal and non-verbal self-referential processing (SRP) in cortical midline structures, temporoparietal cortex and insula. Whether SRP can be causally modulated by way of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has also been investigated in several studies. Here we summarize the NIBS literature including 27 studies of task-based SRP comparing response between verbal and non-verbal SRP tasks. The studies differed in design, experimental tasks and stimulation parameters. Results support the role of left inferior parietal lobule (left IPL) in verbal SRP and for the medial prefrontal cortex when valenced stimuli were used. Further, results support roles for the bilateral parietal lobe (IPL, posterior cingulate cortex), the sensorimotor areas (the primary sensory and motor cortex, the premotor cortex, and the extrastriate body area) and the insula in non-verbal SRP (bodily self-consciousness). We conclude that NIBS may differentially modulate verbal and non-verbal SRP by targeting the corresponding brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A prominent goal of neuroscience is to improve our understanding of how brain structure and activity interact to produce perception, emotion, behavior, and cognition. The brain’s network activity is inherently organized in distinct spatiotemporal patterns that span scales from nanometer-sized synapses to meter-long nerve fibers and millisecond intervals between electrical signals to decades of memory storage. There is currently no single imaging method that alone can provide all the relevant information, but intelligent combinations of complementary techniques can be effective. Here, we thus present the latest advances in biomedical and biological engineering on photoacoustic neuroimaging in the context of complementary imaging techniques. A particular focus is placed on recent advances in whole-brain photoacoustic imaging in rodent models and its influential role in bridging the gap between fluorescence microscopy and more non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We consider current strategies to address persistent challenges, particularly in developing molecular contrast agents, and conclude with an overview of potential future directions for photoacoustic neuroimaging to provide deeper insights into healthy and pathological brain processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Photocoagulation is used for the treatment of retinal ischemic disease. However, due to the invasive nature of photocoagulation and variety of melanin concentrations between individuals, it is challenging to avoid damaging the adjacent photoreceptors and inducing several side effects. Previous studies indicate the role of laser power, duration, and spot size on retinal lesions, but the effect of interspot distance of the laser pulses needs to be considered in panretinal photocoagulation. In this study, we examine different parameters of photocoagulation on lesions of the retina in rabbit, finding that the lesion level of the outer nuclear layer of the retina depended on the pulse duration and laser spot size, and decreasing interspot distance could completely abolish the photoreceptor layer. The degeneration of the photoreceptor by photocoagulation occurred in 24 h and was not restored afterward. We then conducted panretinal photocoagulation in rabbit and found that oxidative stress was decreased in the inner nuclear layer of the retina, and pupillary light reflex and ERG signals were impaired. Our study could provide a rabbit model to explore the mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration and therapies for the side effects after photocoagulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a widely used tool to estimate the effective connectivity of specified models of a brain network. Finding the model explaining measured data is one of the most important outstanding problems in Bayesian modeling. Using heuristic model search algorithms enables us to find an optimal model without having to define a model set a priori. However, the development of such methods is cumbersome in the case of large model-spaces. We aimed to utilize commonly used graph theoretical search algorithms for DCM to create a framework for characterizing them, and to investigate relevance of such methods for single-subject and group-level studies. Because of the enormous computational demand of DCM calculations, we separated the model estimation procedure from the search algorithm by providing a database containing the parameters of all models in a full model-space. For test data a publicly available fMRI dataset of 60 subjects was used. First, we reimplemented the deterministic bilinear DCM algorithm in the ReDCM R package, increasing computational speed during model estimation. Then, three network search algorithms have been adapted for DCM, and we demonstrated how modifications to these methods, based on DCM posterior parameter estimates, can enhance search performance. Comparison of the results are based on model evidence, structural similarities and the number of model estimations needed during search. An analytical approach using Bayesian model reduction (BMR) for efficient network discovery is already available for DCM. Comparing model search methods we found that topological algorithms often outperform analytical methods for single-subject analysis and achieve similar results for recovering common network properties of the winning model family, or set of models, obtained by multi-subject family-wise analysis. However, network search methods show their limitations in higher level statistical analysis of parametric empirical Bayes. Optimizing such linear modeling schemes the BMR methods are still considered the recommended approach. We envision the freely available database of estimated model-spaces to help further studies of the DCM model-space, and the ReDCM package to be a useful contribution for Bayesian inference within and beyond the field of neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Due to the point-like nature of neuronal spiking, efficient neural network simulators often employ event-based simulation schemes for synapses. Yet many types of synaptic plasticity rely on the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell as a third factor in addition to pre- and postsynaptic spike times. In some learning rules membrane potentials not only influence synaptic weight changes at the time points of spike events but in a continuous manner. In these cases, synapses therefore require information on the full time course of membrane potentials to update their strength which a priori suggests a continuous update in a time-driven manner. The latter hinders scaling of simulations to realistic cortical network sizes and relevant time scales for learning. Here, we derive two efficient algorithms for archiving postsynaptic membrane potentials, both compatible with modern simulation engines based on event-based synapse updates. We theoretically contrast the two algorithms with a time-driven synapse update scheme to analyze advantages in terms of memory and computations. We further present a reference implementation in the spiking neural network simulator NEST for two prototypical voltage-based plasticity rules: the Clopath rule and the Urbanczik-Senn rule. For both rules, the two event-based algorithms significantly outperform the time-driven scheme. Depending on the amount of data to be stored for plasticity, which heavily differs between the rules, a strong performance increase can be achieved by compressing or sampling of information on membrane potentials. Our results on computational efficiency related to archiving of information provide guidelines for the design of learning rules in order to make them practically usable in large-scale networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Dystonic opisthotonus is defined as a backward arching of the neck and trunk, which ranges in severity from mild backward jerks to life-threatening prolonged severe muscular spasms. It can be associated with generalized dystonic syndromes or, rarely, present as a form of axial truncal dystonia. The etiologies vary from idiopathic, genetic, tardive, hereditary-degenerative, or associated with parkinsonism. We report clinical cases of dystonic opisthotonus associated with adult-onset dystonic syndromes, that benefitted from globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Clinical data from patients with dystonic syndromes who underwent comprehensive medical review, multidisciplinary assessment, and tailored medical and neurosurgical managements were prospectively analyzed. Quantification of dystonia severity pre- and postoperatively was performed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and quantification of overall pain severity was performed using the Visual Analog Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Three male patients, with age of onset of the dystonic symptoms ranging from 32 to 51 years old, were included. Tardive dystonia, adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism and adult-onset idiopathic axial dystonia were the etiologies identified. Clinical investigation and management were tailored according to the complexity of the individual presentations. Although they shared common clinical features of adult-onset dystonia, disabling dystonic opisthotonus, refractory to medical management, was the main indication for GPi-DBS in all patients presented. The severity of axial dystonia ranged from disturbance of daily function to life-threatening truncal distortion. All three patients underwent bilateral GPi DBS at a mean age of 52 years (range 48–55 years), after mean duration of symptoms prior to DBS of 10.7 years (range 4–16 years). All patients showed a rapid and sustained clinical improvement of their symptoms, notably of the dystonic opisthotonos, at postoperative follow-up ranging from 20 to 175 months. In some, the ability to resume activities of daily living and reintegration into the society was remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Adult-onset dystonic syndromes predominantly presenting with dystonic opisthotonus are relatively rare. The specific nature of dystonic opisthotonus remains a treatment challenge, and thorough investigation of this highly disabling condition with varying etiologies is often necessary. Although patients may be refractory to medical management and botulinum toxin injection, Globus pallidus stimulation timed and tailored provided symptomatic control in this cohort and may be considered in other carefully selected cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;We quantitatively analyzed high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with infantile spasms (IS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 60 children with IS hospitalized from January 2019 to August 2020. Sixty healthy age-matched children comprised the control group. Time–frequency analysis was used to quantify γ, ripple, and fast ripple (FR) oscillation energy changes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;γ, ripple, and FR oscillations dominated in the temporal and frontal lobes. The average HFO energy of the sleep stage is lower than that of the wake stage in the same frequency bands in both the normal control (NC) and IS groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The average HFO energy of the IS group was significantly higher than that of the NC group in γ band during sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The average HFO energy of S and Post-S stage were higher than that of sleep stage in γ band (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In the ripple band, the average HFO energy of Pre-S, S, and Post-S stage was higher than that of sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in BASED score between the effective and ineffective groups. The interaction of curative efficacy × frequency and the interaction of curative efficacy × state are statistically significant. The average HFO energy of the effective group was lower than that of the ineffective group in the sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.05). For the 16 children deemed “effective” in the IS group, the average HFO energy of three frequency bands was not significantly different before compared with after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Scalp EEG can record HFOs. The energy of HFOs can distinguish physiological HFOs from pathological ones more accurately than frequency. On scalp EEG, γ oscillations can better detect susceptibility to epilepsy than ripple and FR oscillations. HFOs can trigger spasms. The analysis of average HFO energy can be used as a predictor of the effectiveness of epilepsy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The growing implementation of digital education comes with an increased need to understand the impact of digital tools on learning. Previous behavioral studies have shown that handwriting on paper is more effective for learning than typing on a keyboard. However, the impact of writing with a digital pen on a tablet remains to be clarified. In the present study, we compared learning by handwriting with an ink pen on paper, handwriting with a digital pen on a tablet, and typing on a keyboard. Behavioral and electroencephalographic indices were measured immediately after learning with each writing tool. The moods of the subjects during the training were also assessed. The participants were divided according to their use of digital pen in their everyday lives, allowing us to take into account the effect of the familiarity with the digital pen on the learning process (familiar group vs. unfamiliar group). We performed an EEG experiment applying a repetition priming paradigm. In each trial, a learned foreign language word (prime word) and a mother tongue word (target word) were consecutively presented. The target word was either semantically identical to the prime word (repetitive condition) or different (non-repetitive condition). We assumed that a larger priming effect on N400 reflects larger learning progress. The familiar group showed a greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the digital or ink pen than those learned with the keyboard. The unfamiliar group showed the greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the ink pen compared with words learned by typing. In addition, positive mood during learning was significantly higher during handwriting than during typing, regardless of the groups. On the other hand, the behavioral indices were not influenced by the writing tool. These results suggest that the movements involved in handwriting allow a greater memorization of new words. The advantage of handwriting over typing might also be caused by a more positive mood during learning. Finally, our results show that handwriting with a digital pen and tablet can increase the ability to learn compared with keyboard typing once the individuals are accustomed to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In daily life, the meaning of color plays an important role in execution and inhibition of a motor response. For example, the symbolism of traffic light can help pedestrians and drivers to control their behavior, with the color green/blue meaning go and red meaning stop. However, we don’t always stop with a red light and sometimes start a movement with it in such a situation as drivers start pressing the brake pedal when a traffic light turns red. In this regard, we investigated how the prior knowledge of traffic light signals impacts reaction times (RTs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) in a Go/No-go task. We set up Blue Go/Red No-go and Red Go/Blue No-go tasks with three different go signal (Go) probabilities (30, 50, and 70%), resulting in six different conditions. The participants were told which color to respond (Blue or Red) just before each condition session but didn’t know the Go probability. Neural responses to Go and No-go signals were recorded at Fz, Cz, and Oz (international 10–20 system). We computed RTs for Go signal and N2 and P3 amplitudes from the ERP data. We found that RT was faster when responding to blue than red light signal and also was slower with lower Go probability. Overall, N2 amplitude was larger in Red Go than Blue Go trial and in Red No-go than Blue No-go trial. Furthermore, P3 amplitude was larger in Red No-go than Blue No-go trial. Our findings of RT and N2 amplitude for Go ERPs could indicate the presence of Stroop-like interference, that is a conflict between prior knowledge about traffic light signals and the meaning of presented signal. Meanwhile, the larger N2 and P3 amplitudes in Red No-go trial as compared to Blue No-go trial may be due to years of experience in stopping an action in response to a red signal and/or attention. This study provides the better understanding of the effect of prior knowledge of color on behavioral responses and its underlying neural mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Ischemic leukoaraiosis (ILA) is related to cognitive impairment and vascular dementia in the elderly. One possible mechanism could be the disruption of white matter (WM) tracts and network function that connect distributed brain regions involved in cognition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between structural connectome and cognitive functions in ILA patients. A total of 89 patients with ILA (Fazekas score ≥ 3) and 90 healthy controls (HCs) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological examinations and diffusion tensor imaging scans. The tract-based spatial statistics approach was employed to investigate the WM integrity. Graph theoretical analysis was further applied to construct the topological architecture of the structural connectome in ILA patients. Partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between network measures and cognitive performances in the ILA group. Compared with HCs, the ILA patients showed widespread WM integrity disruptions. The ILA group displayed increased characteristic path length (L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) and decreased global network efficiency at the level of the whole brain relative to HCs, and reduced nodal efficiencies, predominantly in the frontal–subcortical and limbic system regions. Furthermore, these structural connectomic alterations were associated with cognitive impairment in ILA patients. The association between WM changes (i.e., fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measures) and cognitive function was mediated by the structural connectivity measures (i.e., local network efficiency and L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;). In conclusion, cognitive impairment in ILA patients is related to microstructural disruption of multiple WM fibers and topological disorganization of structural networks, which have implications in understanding the relationship between ILA and the possible attendant cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;People’s characteristics can affect their perception of the physical environment, and the judgments and estimates they make about their surroundings. Estimates of the environment change based on observers’ metabolic state, physical properties, and the potential effort they would need to exert for a certain action. The functional role of such scaling is to provide agents with information on possible actions and their energetic costs. Combining actions with costs facilitates both higher-level planning (e.g., choosing an optimal running speed on a marathon) as well as planning on lower levels of an action hierarchy, such as determining the best movement trajectories for energy-efficient action. Recently, some of the findings on reported effects of effort on perception have been challenged as arising from task demands—participants guessing the purpose of the experimental manipulation and adjusting their estimates as a result. Arguably however, the failed replications used overly distracting cover stories which may have introduced task demands of their own, and masked other effects. The current study tested the generality of effects of potential effort on height and distance perception, employing effective yet not distracting cover stories. Four experiments attempted to identify conditions under which anticipated effort may systematically change perceptual estimates. Experiment 1 found that height estimates were not influenced by the effort required to place objects of different weights onto surfaces of varying heights. Experiments 2, 3 used two different effort manipulations (walking vs. hopping; and carrying an empty vs. a heavy backpack, respectively) and found that these did not influence estimates of distance (to be) traveled. Experiment 4 also used backpack weight to manipulate effort but critically, unlike Exp. 1–3 it did not employ a cover story and participants did not traverse distances after giving estimates. In contrast with the first three experiments, distances in the final experiment were estimated as longer when participants were encumbered by a backpack. Combined, these results suggest that the measured effects on the estimation of distance were due to how participants construed the task rather than being of a perceptual nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a cortical structure based on its cell types, connectivity features, and developmental characteristics. This part of the amygdala is considered to be the main entry site of processed and multisensory information delivered via cortical and thalamic afferents. Although GABAergic inhibitory cells in the BLA comprise only 20% of the entire neuronal population, they provide essential control over proper network operation. Previous studies have uncovered that GABAergic cells in the basolateral amygdala are as diverse as those present in other cortical regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex. To understand the role of inhibitory cells in various amygdala functions, we need to reveal the connectivity and input-output features of the different types of GABAergic cells. Here, I review the recent achievements in uncovering the diversity of GABAergic cells in the basolateral amygdala with a specific focus on the microcircuit organization of these inhibitory cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Multiple projection neurons are often activated to initiate behavior. A question that then arises is, what is the unique functional role of each neuron activated? We address this issue in the feeding system of Aplysia. Previous experiments identified a projection neuron [cerebral buccal interneuron 2 (CBI-2)] that can trigger ingestive motor programs but only after it is repeatedly stimulated, i.e., initial programs are poorly defined. As CBI-2 stimulation continues, programs become progressively more ingestive (repetition priming occurs). This priming results, at least in part, from persistent actions of peptide cotransmitters released from CBI-2. We now show that in some preparations repetition priming does not occur. There is no clear seasonal effect; priming and non-priming preparations are encountered throughout the year. CBI-2 is electrically coupled to a second projection neuron, cerebral buccal interneuron 3 (CBI-3). In preparations in which priming does not occur, we show that ingestive activity is generated when CBI-2 and CBI-3 are coactivated. Programs are immediately ingestive, i.e., priming is not necessary, and a persistent state is not induced. Our data suggest that dynamic changes in the configuration of activity can vary and be determined by the complement of projection neurons that trigger activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Connected networks are a fundamental structure of neurobiology. Understanding these networks will help us elucidate the neural mechanisms of computation. Mathematically speaking these networks are “graphs”—structures containing objects that are connected. In neuroscience, the objects could be regions of the brain, e.g., fMRI data, or be individual neurons, e.g., calcium imaging with fluorescence microscopy. The formal study of graphs, graph theory, can provide neuroscientists with a large bank of algorithms for exploring networks. Graph theory has already been applied in a variety of ways to fMRI data but, more recently, has begun to be applied at the scales of neurons, e.g., from functional calcium imaging. In this primer we explain the basics of graph theory and relate them to features of microscopic functional networks of neurons from calcium imaging—neuronal graphs. We explore recent examples of graph theory applied to calcium imaging and we highlight some areas where researchers new to the field could go awry.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Synaptic and axonal glutamatergic signaling to NG2 glia in white matter is critical for the cells’ differentiation and activity dependent myelination. However, in gray matter the impact of neuron-to-NG2 glia signaling is still elusive, because most of these cells keep their non-myelinating phenotype throughout live. Early in postnatal development, hippocampal NG2 glia express AMPA receptors with a significant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability allowing for plasticity of the neuron-glia synapses, but whether this property changes by adulthood is not known. Moreover, it is unclear whether NG2 glia express auxiliary transmembrane AMPA receptor related proteins (TARPs), which modify AMPA receptor properties, including their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability. Through combined molecular and functional analyses, here we show that hippocampal NG2 glia abundantly express TARPs γ4, γ7, and γ8 as well as cornichon (CNIH)-2. TARP γ8 undergoes profound downregulation during development. Receptors of adult NG2 glia showed an increased sensitivity to blockers of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable AMPA receptors, but this increase mainly concerned receptors located close to the soma. Evoked synaptic currents of NG2 glia were also sensitive to blockers of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable AMPA receptors. The presence of AMPA receptors with varying Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability during postnatal maturation may be important for the cells’ ability to sense and respond to local glutamatergic activity and for regulating process motility, differentiation, and proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells and are widely distributed throughout the body. MCs are not only classically viewed as effector cells of some allergic diseases but also participate in host defense, innate and acquired immunity, homeostatic responses, and immunoregulation. Mounting evidence indicates that activation of MCs releasing numerous vasoactive and inflammatory mediators has effects on the nervous system and has been involved in different pain conditions. Here, we review the latest advances made about the implication of MCs in pain. Possible cellular and molecular mechanisms regarding the crosstalk between MC and the nervous system in the initiation and maintenance of pain are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;The extent of neurodegeneration underlying essential tremor (ET) remains a matter of debate. Despite various extents of cerebellar atrophy on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), previous studies have shown substantial heterogeneity and included a limited number of patients. Novel automated pipelines allow detailed segmentation of cerebellar lobules based on structural MRI.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To compare the volumes of cerebellar lobules in ET patients with those in healthy controls (HCs) using an automated segmentation pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Structural MRI scans of ET patients eligible for deep brain stimulation (n = 55) and of age-matched and gender-matched HCs (n = 55, from the IXI database) were segmented using the automated CEREbellum Segmentation pipeline. Lobule-specific volume differences between the ET and HC groups were evaluated using a general linear model corrected for multiple tests.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Total brain tissue volumes did not differ between the ET and HC groups. ET patients demonstrated reduced volumes of lobules I-II, left Crus II, left VIIB, and an increased volume of right X when compared with the HC group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A large cohort of ET patients demonstrated subtle signs of decreased cerebellar lobule volumes. These findings oppose the hypothesis of localized atrophy in cerebellar motor areas in ET, but not the possibility of cerebellar pathophysiology in ET. Prospective investigations using alternative neuroimaging modalities may further elucidate the pathophysiology of ET and provide insights into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dementia is a global public health problem and its impact is bound to increase in the next decades, with a rapidly aging world population. Dementia is by no means an obligatory outcome of aging, although its incidence increases exponentially in old age, and its onset may be insidious. In the absence of unequivocal biomarkers, the accuracy of cognitive profiling plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis of this condition. In this Perspective article, we highlight the utility of brief global cognitive tests in the diagnostic process, from the initial detection stage for which they are designed, through the differential diagnosis of dementia. We also argue that neuropsychological training and expertise are critical in order for the information gathered from these omnibus cognitive tests to be used in an efficient and effective way, and thus, ultimately, for them to fulfill their potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Normative aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) propagation alter anatomical connections among brain parcels. However, the interaction between the trajectories of age- and AD-linked alterations in the topology of the structural brain network is not well understood. In this study, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets of 139 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were used to document their structural brain networks. The 139 participants consist of 45 normal controls (NCs), 37 with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 27 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 30 AD patients. All subjects were further divided into three subgroups based on their age (56–65, 66–75, and 71–85 years). After the structural connectivity networks were built using anatomically-constrained deterministic tractography, their global and nodal topological properties were estimated, including network efficiency, characteristic path length, transitivity, modularity coefficient, clustering coefficient, and betweenness. Statistical analyses were then performed on these metrics using linear regression, and one- and two-way ANOVA testing to examine group differences and interactions between aging and AD propagation. No significant interactions were found between aging and AD propagation in the global topological metrics (network efficiency, characteristic path length, transitivity, and modularity coefficient). However, nodal metrics (clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality) of some cortical parcels exhibited significant interactions between aging and AD propagation, with affected parcels including left superior temporal, right pars triangularis, and right precentral. The results collectively confirm the age-related deterioration of structural networks in MCI and AD patients, providing novel insight into the cross effects of aging and AD disorder on brain structural networks. Some early symptoms of AD may also be due to age-associated anatomic vulnerability interacting with early anatomic changes associated with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the sole and selective gateway for nuclear transport and its dysfunction has been associated with many diseases. The metazoan NPC subcomplex RanBP2, which consists of RanBP2 (Nup358), RanGAP1-SUMO1 and Ubc9, regulates the assembly and function of the NPC. The roles of immune signaling in regulation of NPC remain poorly understood. Here, we show that in human and murine T cells, following TCR stimulation, protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) directly phosphorylates RanGAP1 to facilitate RanBP2 subcomplex assembly and nuclear import and, thus, the nuclear translocation of AP-1 transcription factor. Mechanistically, TCR stimulation induces the translocation of activated PKC-θ to the NPC, where it interacts with and phosphorylates RanGAP1 on Ser&lt;sup&gt;504&lt;/sup&gt; and Ser&lt;sup&gt;506&lt;/sup&gt;. RanGAP1 phosphorylation increases its binding affinity for Ubc9, thereby promoting sumoylation of RanGAP1 and, finally, assembly of the RanBP2 subcomplex. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of PKC-θ as a direct regulator of nuclear import and uncover a phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of RanGAP1, delineating a novel link between TCR signaling and assembly of the RanBP2 NPC subcomplex.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Nuclear Factor 90 (NF90) is a novel virus sensor that serves to initiate antiviral innate immunity by triggering the stress granules (SGs) formation. However, the regulation of the NF90-SGs pathway remain largely unclear. We found that Tim-3, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of NF90 and inhibits NF90-SGs mediated antiviral immunity. Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) infection induces the up-regulation and activation of Tim-3 in macrophages which in turn recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM47 to the zinc finger domain of NF90 and initiated a proteasome-dependent degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination at Lys297. Targeted inactivation of the Tim-3 enhances the NF90 downstream SGs formation by selectively increasing the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a, the expression of SGs markers G3BP1 and TIA-1, and protected mice from VSV challenge. These findings provide insights into the crosstalk between Tim-3 and other receptors in antiviral innate immunity and its related clinical significance.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Due to an inability to ethically access developing human brain tissue as well as identify prospective cases, early-arising neurodevelopmental and cell-specific signatures of Schizophrenia (Scz) have remained unknown and thus undefined. To overcome these challenges, we utilized Scz patient-derived stem cells to generate 3D cerebral organoids to model neuropathology of Scz during this critical period. We discovered that Scz organoids exhibited ventricular neuropathology resulting in altered progenitor survival and disrupted neurogenesis. This ultimately yielded fewer neurons within developing cortical fields of Scz organoids. Single-cell sequencing revealed that Scz progenitors were specifically depleted of neuronal programming factors leading to a remodeling of cell-lineages, altered differentiation trajectories, and distorted cortical cell-type diversity. While Scz organoids were 99.95% similar in their macromolecular diversity to Ctrls, four GWAS factors (PTN, COMT, PLCL1, and PODXL) and peptide fragments belonging to the POU-domain transcription factor family (e.g. POU3F2/BRN2) were altered. This revealed that Scz organoids principally differed not in their proteomic diversity, but specifically in their total quantity of disease and neurodevelopmental factors at the molecular level. Single-cell sequencing also subsequently identified cell-type specific alterations in neuronal programming factors and growth factors, and specifically replicated the depletion of POU3F2 (BRN2) and PTN in both Scz progenitors and neurons. Consequently, in two mechanistic rescue experiments we identified that the transcription factor POU3F2 (BRN2) and growth factor PTN operate as mechanistic substrates of neurogenesis and cellular survival, respectively, in Scz organoids. This suggests that multiple mechanisms of Scz exist in patient-derived organoids, and that these disparate mechanisms converge upon primordial brain developmental pathways such as neuronal differentiation, survival, and growth factor support, which may amalgamate to elevate intrinsic risk of Scz.</content>

		<content type="html">
 When people make inferences about other peoples minds, called theory of mind (ToM), a network in the cerebral cortex becomes active. ToM experiments sometimes use the false belief task, in which subjects decide whether a story character believes A or B. The &quot;false&quot; belief occurs if the character believes A when B is true. We devised a version in which subjects judged whether a cartoon head &quot;believed&quot; a ball to be in box 1 or box 2. The task was a visual, reaction-time version of a ToM task. We proposed two alternative hypotheses. In hypothesis 1, cortical regions of interest within the ToM network should distinguish between false and true belief trials, reflecting outside information that the subjects have about the cartoon character. In hypothesis 2, the ToM network should distinguish between conditions only if the subjects think that the cartoon character can distinguish between the conditions, thus reflecting a model of the internal contents of the cartoon characters mind. The results supported hypothesis 2. Events that the cartoon could not &quot;see&quot; did not affect activity in the ToM network; the same events, when the cartoon could apparently &quot;see&quot; them, significantly affected activity in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The results support the view that the right TPJ participates in modeling the mental states of others, rather than in evaluating the accuracy of the beliefs of others, and may help explain why previous experiments showed mixed results when directly comparing false belief to true belief conditions.

Significance statementHow do we understand the minds of others? A specific network of areas in the human brain is known to emphasize building models of other peoples minds. In one traditional hypothesis, this network helps us distinguish whether someone elses beliefs are true or false. Here we show that the network is relatively insensitive to ones own, outside knowledge about whether someone elses beliefs are true or false. Instead, at least one node in the network appears to limit itself mainly to reconstructing the other persons point of view. This social cognition network may be more about empathy than about critical evaluation.

 In the past decades, there has been a growing scientific interest in characterizing neural correlates of meditation training. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying meditation remain elusive. In the present work, we investigated meditation-related changes in structural and functional connectivities (SC and FC, respectively). For this purpose, we scanned experienced meditators and control (naive) subjects using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to acquire structural and functional data during two conditions, resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). In this way, we aimed to characterize and distinguish both short-term and long-term modifications in the brains structure and function. First, we performed a network-based analysis of anatomical connectivity. Then, to analyze the fMRI data, we calculated whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) estimates, relying on a dynamical network model to replicate BOLD signals spatio-temporal structure, akin to FC with lagged correlations. We compared the estimated EC, FC, and SC links as features to train classifiers to predict behavioral conditions and group identity. The whole-brain SC analysis revealed strengthened anatomical connectivity across large-scale networks for meditators compared to controls. We found that differences in SC were reflected in the functional domain as well. We demonstrated through a machine-learning approach that EC features were more informative than FC and SC solely. Using EC features we reached high performance for the condition-based classification within each group and moderately high accuracies when comparing the two groups in each condition. Moreover, we showed that the most informative EC links that discriminated between meditators and controls involved the same large-scale networks previously found to have increased anatomical connectivity. Overall, the results of our whole-brain model-based approach revealed a mechanism underlying meditation by providing causal relationships at the structure-function level.</content>

 Long-term memory (LTM) requires learning-induced synthesis of new proteins allocated to specific neurons and synapses in a neural circuit. Not all learned information, however, becomes permanent memory. How the brain gates relevant information into LTM remains unclear. In Drosophila adults, a single training session in an olfactory aversive task is not sufficient to induce protein synthesis-dependent LTM. Instead, multiple spaced training sessions are required. Here, we report that initial learning induces neural activity in the early /{beta} subset of Kenyon cells of the mushroom body (MB), and output from these neurons inhibits LTM formation. Specifically in response to spaced training, Schnurri activates CREBB expression which then appears to suppress the inhibitory output from MB. One training session can enhance LTM formation when this inhibitory effect is relieved. We propose that learning-induced protein synthesis and spaced training-induced CREBB act antagonistically to modulate output from early /{beta} MB neurons during LTM formation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Hallucinations are a prominent transdiagnostic psychiatric symptom but are also prevalent in individuals who do not require clinical care. Moreover, persistent psychosis-like experience in otherwise healthy individuals may be related to increased risk to transition to a psychotic disorder. This suggests a common etiology across clinical and non-clinical individuals along a multidimensional psychosis continuum that may be detectable in structural variations of the brain. The current diffusion tensor imaging study assessed healthy individuals to identify possible differences in white matter associated with hallucination proneness (HP). This approach circumvents potential confounds related to medication, hospitalization, and disease progression common in clinical individuals. We determined how HP relates to white matter integrity in selected association, commissural, and projection fiber pathways putatively linked to psychosis. Increased HP was associated with enhanced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right uncinate fasciculus, the right anterior and posterior arcuate fasciculus, and the corpus callosum. Although FA in cortico-cerebellar pathways revealed no relationship, streamline quantity between the left cerebellum and the right motor cortex positively correlated with HP. These findings support the notion of a psychosis continuum, providing first evidence of structural white matter variability associated with HP in healthy individuals. Furthermore, alterations in the targeted pathways likely indicate an association between HP-related structural variations and the putative salience and attention mechanisms that these pathways subserve.</content>

 This study investigated the hypothesis that neural markers associated with arbitrary decision-making are present in higher order, deliberate decisions. Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate the effect of higher order decision content on neurophysiological markers such as the readiness potential and the P300 potential. An experiment was designed to measure, evaluate, and compare these electroencephalographic potentials under both arbitrary and deliberate choice conditions. Participants were presented with legal cases and had to convict and acquit criminal offenders. Distinct readiness potentials and P300 potentials were observed for both arbitrary and deliberate decisions across all participants. These findings support the hypothesis that the readiness potential and the P300 potential are present in the neurophysiological data for higher order deliberate decisions. The study also showed initial findings of how the readiness potential may inherently relate to decision content. Increased readiness potential amplitudes were observed for participants with previous exposure to violent crime when they had to acquit or convict criminals accused of violent crimes.</content>

 Locomotion is a key feature of healthy animals, which depends on their ability to move -or not to move-for their survival. The hatchling Xenopus laevis tadpole responds to trunk skin stimulation by swimming away, and its developing nervous system is simple enough to make it an ideal model organism to study the control of locomotion. This vertebrate embryo relies on excitatory cells in the skin to detect the sensory stimulus, which is quickly sent to the brain via ascending sensory pathway neurons. When the stimulation is strong enough, descending reticulospinal neurons are activated in the hindbrain and the spinal cord, after a long and variable delay. The activation of reticulospinal neurons indicates the initiation of swimming and sustains the rhythmic firing of CPG (central pattern generator) neurons, among which are motor neurons. The tadpole is then able to rhythmically contract trunk muscles, allowing the undulatory movement of swimming. However, how the tadpoles developing brain exerts descending control over reticulospinal neurons, and thus over the spinal CPG centers, is not fully understood yet. In this work, we recorded extracellular activity in the hindbrain of the tadpole to identify firing units that are involved in the long and variable delay to swim initiation following trunk skin stimulation. We isolated firing units that mediate distinct motor output. We subsequently grouped them in populations based on their firing patterns in response to skin stimulation and motor output. We propose a novel neural circuitry for sensory processing and descending motor control exerted by the hindbrain of the hatchling tadpole, which could account for the long and variable delay to reticulospinal neuron activation, and thus swim initiation.</content>

 Understanding how consciousness arises from neural activity remains one of the biggest challenges for neuroscience. Numerous theories have been proposed in recent years, each gaining independent empirical support. Currently, there is no comprehensive, quantitative and theory-neutral overview of the field that enables an evaluation of how theoretical frameworks interact with empirical research. We provide a birds eye view on studies that interpreted their findings in light of at least one of four leading neuroscientific theories of consciousness (N=412 experiments), asking how methodological choices of the researchers might affect the final conclusions. We found that supporting a specific theory can be predicted solely from methodological choices, irrespective of findings. Furthermore, most studies interpret their findings post-hoc, rather than a-priori testing critical predictions of the theories. Our results highlight challenges for the field and provide researchers with a unique, open-access website to further analyze trends in the neuroscience of consciousness.</content>

 The spatial distribution of visual items allows us to infer the presence of latent causes in the world. For instance, a spatial cluster of ants allows us to infer the presence of a common food source. However, optimal inference requires the integration of a computationally intractable number of world states in real world situations. For example, optimal inference about whether a common cause exists based on N spatially distributed visual items requires marginalizing over both the location of the latent cause and 2N possible affiliation patterns (where each item may be affiliated or non-affiliated with the latent cause). How might the brain approximate this inference? We show that subject behaviour deviates qualitatively from Bayes-optimal, in particular showing an unexpected positive effect of N (the number of visual items) on the false-alarm rate. We propose several &quot;point-estimating&quot; observer models that fit subject behaviour better than the Bayesian model. They each avoid a costly computational marginalization over at least one of the variables of the generative model by &quot;committing&quot; to a point estimate of at least one of the two generative model variables. These findings suggest that the brain may implement partially committal variants of Bayesian models when detecting latent causes based on complex real world data.</content>

 Gene expression analysis is becoming increasingly utilized in neuro-immunology research, and there is a growing need for non-programming scientists to be able to analyze their own genomic data. MGEnrichment is a web application developed both to disseminate to the community our curated database of microglia-relevant gene lists, and to allow non-programming scientists to easily conduct statistical enrichment analysis on their gene expression data. Users can upload their own gene IDs to assess the relevance of their expression data against gene lists from other studies. We include example datasets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from human postmortem brain samples from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and matched controls. We demonstrate how MGEnrichment can be used to expand the interpretations of these DEG lists in terms of regulation of microglial gene expression and provide novel insights into how ASD DEGs may be implicated specifically in microglial development, microbiome responses and relationships to other neuropsychiatric disorders. This tool will be particularly useful for those working in microglia, autism spectrum disorders, and neuro-immune activation research. MGEnrichment is available at https://ciernialab.shinyapps.io/MGEnrichmentApp/ and further online documentation and datasets can be found at https://github.com/ciernialab/MGEnrichmentApp. The app is released under the GNU GPLv3 open source license.</content>

 INTRODUCTION: Earlier studies of the effects of childhood socioeconomic status (SES) on later life cognitive function consistently report a social gradient in later life cognitive function. Evidence for their effects on cognitive decline is, however, less clear. METHODS: The sample consists of 5,324 participants in the Whitehall II Study, 8,572 in the Health and Retirement Study, and 1,413 in the Kame Project, who completed self-report questionnaires on their early-life experiences and underwent repeated cognitive assessments. We characterised cognitive trajectories using latent class mixed models, and explored associations between childhood SES and latent class membership using logistic regressions. RESULTS: We identified distinct trajectories classes for all cognitive measures examined. Childhood socioeconomic deprivation was associated with an increased likelihood of being in a lower trajectory class. DISCUSSION: Our findings support the notions that cognitive ageing is a heterogeneous process and early-life circumstances may have lasting effects on cognition across the life-course.

 The neocortex is a widely interconnected neuronal network. All such networks have a connectivity structure, which limits the possible combinations of neuronal activations across it. In this sense, the network can be said to contain solutions, i.e., for each given external input the cortex may yield a specific combination of neuronal activations/output. If the cortex has a variety of states, a given input could result in a range of possible outputs. There will also be a vast range of outputs that are not possible due to the network structure. Here we use intracellular recordings in SI neurons to show that remote intracortical electrical perturbation can impact such constraints on the responses to given tactile input patterns. Whereas each given tactile input pattern induced a wide set of preferred response states, when combined with cortical perturbation they induced response states that did not otherwise occur. The findings indicate that the physiological network structure can dynamically change as the state of any given cortical region changes, thereby enabling a very rich, multifactorial, perceptual capability.</content>

Abstract
Egg laying in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis is regulated by the photoperiod; long‐day conditions (16L8D) promote egg laying whereas medium‐day conditions (12L12D) suppress it. In this snail, a caudo‐dorsal cell hormone (CDCH) is produced by neurosecretory cells, CDCs in the cerebral ganglion (CG), and its release triggers ovulation and subsequent egg laying. However, the physiological basis for photoperiod‐dependent egg laying remains unraveled. Here, we compared electrophysiological properties of CDCs between 16L8D and 12L12D using intracellular recording, and found that CDC excitability is higher in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Striking differences are as follows: (1) a shallower resting membrane potential in 16L8D than in 12L12D, and (2) a smaller threshold voltage (minimum depolarization from rest to elicit action potentials) in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Switching of the excitability can be a physiological basis of a photoperiod‐dependent CDCH release. Simultaneous intracellular dye injection identified two morphological subtypes of CDCs, validating a previous report. Both types bear short lateral extensions in CG, some of which probably function as integration sites of photoperiodic inputs. In addition, we found two novel CDCH‐immunoreactive cell groups (CDCCOM and SCm) in the CG besides conventional CDCs and small cells expressing CDCH. The CDCCOM with cell bodies and fibers in the neurohemal commissure may be involved in triggering ovulation. Notably, the total number of CDCs is larger than that previously reported, the right CDC cluster with more cells than the left. Our findings are instructive in following the neurophysiology of photoperiodism in L. stagnalis.</content>

 Abstract
The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interact during a myriad of cognitive processes including decision‐making and long‐term memory consolidation. Exactly how the mPFC and hippocampus interact during goal‐directed decision‐making remains to be fully elucidated. During periods of rest, bursts of high‐frequency oscillations, termed sharp‐wave ripple (SWR), appear in the local field potential. Impairing SWRs on the maze or during post‐learning rest can interfere with memory‐guided decision‐making and memory consolidation. We hypothesize that the hippocampus and mPFC bidirectionally interact during SWRs to support memory consolidation and decision‐making. Rats were trained on the neuroeconomic spatial decision‐making task, Restaurant Row, to make serial stay‐skip decisions where the amount of effort (delay to reward) varied upon entry to each restaurant. Hippocampal cells and SWRs were recorded in rats with the mPFC transduced with inhibitory DREADDs. We found that disrupting the mPFC impaired consolidating SWRs in the hippocampus. Hippocampal SWR rates depended on the internalized value of the reward (derived from individual flavor preferences), a parameter important in decision‐making, and disrupting the mPFC changed this relationship. Additionally, we found a dissociation between SWRs that occurred while rats were on the maze dependent upon whether those SWRs occurred while the rat was anticipating food reward or during post‐reward consumption.</content>

Neurons rely on localized mitochondria to fulfill spatially heterogeneous metabolic demands. Mitochondrial aging occurs on timescales shorter than the neuronal lifespan, necessitating transport of fresh material from the soma. Maintaining an optimal distribution of healthy mitochondria requires an interplay between a stationary pool localized to sites of high metabolic demand and a motile pool capable of delivering new material. Interchange between these pools can occur via transient fusion / fission events or by halting and restarting entire mitochondria. Our quantitative model of neuronal mitostasis identifies key parameters that govern steady-state mitochondrial health at discrete locations. Very infrequent exchange between stationary and motile pools optimizes this system. Exchange via transient fusion allows for robust maintenance, which can be further improved by selective recycling through mitophagy. These results provide a framework for quantifying how perturbations in organelle transport and interactions affect mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons, a key aspect underlying many neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SDw2RNzxDJU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Climate drivers such as humidity and temperature may play a key role in influenza seasonal transmission dynamics. Such a relationship has been well defined for temperate regions. However, to date no models capable of capturing the diverse seasonal pattern in tropical and subtropical climates exist. In addition, multiple influenza viruses could cocirculate and shape epidemic dynamics. Here we construct seven mechanistic epidemic models to test the effect of two major climate drivers (humidity and temperature) and multi-strain co-circulation on influenza transmission in Hong Kong, an influenza epidemic center located in the subtropics. Based on model fit to long-term influenza surveillance data from 1998 to 2018, we found that a simple model incorporating the effect of both humidity and temperature best recreated the influenza epidemic patterns observed in Hong Kong. The model quantifies a bimodal effect of absolute humidity on influenza transmission where both low and very high humidity levels facilitate transmission quadratically; the model also quantifies the monotonic but nonlinear relationship with temperature. In addition, model results suggest that, at the population level, a shorter immunity period can approximate the co-circulation of influenza virus (sub)types. The basic reproductive number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; estimated by the best-fit model is also consistent with laboratory influenza survival and transmission studies under various combinations of humidity and temperature levels. Overall, our study has developed a simple mechanistic model capable of quantifying the impact of climate drivers on influenza transmission in (sub)tropical regions. This model can be applied to improve influenza forecasting in the (sub)tropics in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hlsPTASAxno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Treating macaques with an anti-α4β7 antibody under the umbrella of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) during early SIV infection can lead to viral remission, with viral loads maintained at &amp;lt; 50 SIV RNA copies/ml after removal of all treatment in a subset of animals. Depletion of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; lymphocytes in controllers resulted in transient recrudescence of viremia, suggesting that the combination of cART and anti-α4β7 antibody treatment led to a state where ongoing immune responses kept the virus undetectable in the absence of treatment. A previous mathematical model of HIV infection and cART incorporates immune effector cell responses and exhibits the property of two different viral load set-points. While the lower set-point could correspond to the attainment of long-term viral remission, attaining the higher set-point may be the result of viral rebound. Here we expand that model to include possible mechanisms of action of an anti-α4β7 antibody operating in these treated animals. We show that the model can fit the longitudinal viral load data from both IgG control and anti-α4β7 antibody treated macaques, suggesting explanations for the viral control associated with cART and an anti-α4β7 antibody treatment. This effective perturbation to the virus-host interaction can also explain observations in other nonhuman primate experiments in which cART and immunotherapy have led to post-treatment control or resetting of the viral load set-point. Interestingly, because the viral kinetics in the various treated animals differed—some animals exhibited large fluctuations in viral load after cART cessation—the model suggests that anti-α4β7 treatment could act by different primary mechanisms in different animals and still lead to post-treatment viral control. This outcome is nonetheless in accordance with a model with two stable viral load set-points, in which therapy can perturb the system from one set-point to a lower one through different biological mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xrStXoZPNXw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

When presented with complex rhythmic auditory stimuli, humans are able to track underlying temporal structure (e.g., a “beat”), both covertly and with their movements. This capacity goes far beyond that of a simple entrained oscillator, drawing on contextual and enculturated timing expectations and adjusting rapidly to perturbations in event timing, phase, and tempo. Previous modeling work has described how entrainment to rhythms may be shaped by event timing expectations, but sheds little light on any underlying computational principles that could unify the phenomenon of expectation-based entrainment with other brain processes. Inspired by the predictive processing framework, we propose that the problem of rhythm tracking is naturally characterized as a problem of continuously estimating an underlying phase and tempo based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations. We present two inference problems formalizing this insight: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing) and PATIPPET (Phase and Tempo Inference). Variational solutions to these inference problems resemble previous “Dynamic Attending” models of perceptual entrainment, but introduce new terms representing the dynamics of uncertainty and the influence of expectations in the absence of sensory events. These terms allow us to model multiple characteristics of covert and motor human rhythm tracking not addressed by other models, including sensitivity of error corrections to inter-event interval and perceived tempo changes induced by event omissions. We show that positing these novel influences in human entrainment yields a range of testable behavioral predictions. Guided by recent neurophysiological observations, we attempt to align the phase inference framework with a specific brain implementation. We also explore the potential of this normative framework to guide the interpretation of experimental data and serve as building blocks for even richer predictive processing and active inference models of timing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VrvLG3Bm1C4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 We analyzed the expression of the perineuronal nets (PNNs) in mouse and marmoset brain. We found that in both species, its expression is present in many subcortical regions and it is strongly associated with the reproductive circuit. We showed that males show higher level of PNNs than females and in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala (MeApd) the PNN is surrounding cells positive for the estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1). These data suggest a new role of PNN in controlling innate behavior circuits and sexual dimorphism.







Abstract
Perineuronal nets are extracellular glycoprotein structures that have been found on some neurons in the central nervous system and that have been shown to regulate their structural plasticity. Until now work on perineuronal nets has been focused on their role in cortical structures where they are selectively expressed on parvalbumin‐positive neurons and are reported to restrict the experience‐dependent plasticity of inhibitory afferents. Here, we examined the expression of perineuronal nets subcortically, showing that they are expressed in several discrete structures, including nuclei that comprise the brain network controlling reproductive behaviors (e.g., mounting, lordosis, aggression, and social defense). In particular, perineuronal nets were found in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala, the medial preoptic nucleus, the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus and adjacent tuberal nucleus, and the ventral premammillary nucleus in both the mouse and primate brain. Comparison of perineuronal nets in male and female mice revealed a significant sexually dimorphic expression, with expression found prominently on estrogen receptor expressing neurons in the medial amygdala. These findings suggest that perineuronal nets may be involved in regulating neural plasticity in the mammalian reproductive system.</content>

 Objective
X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X‐ALD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive demyelination ranging from mild myelopathic forms (adrenomyeloneuropathy, AMN) to severe cerebral variants (adult cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, ACALD). The study's aim was to compare cognitive function in adult‐onset X‐ALD phenotypes.


Methods
Cognitive function in various domains (intelligence, attention, memory, executive function, processing speed) was assessed in N = 172 adults (n = 117 AMN, n = 30 arrested ACALD, n = 25 acute ACALD) using comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. Phenotype differences were examined by analyses of variance.


Results
X‐ALD phenotypes significantly differed in non‐verbal intelligence, sustained attention, verbal encoding, non‐verbal recognition, and processing speed (ps &amp;lt; .050). No group differences emerged regarding verbal intelligence, verbal retrieval and recognition, and executive function (ps &amp;gt; .050). Specifically, patients with acute ACALD showed severe cognitive deficits compared to AMN and norm data, with largest effects on processing speed. Contrary, cognition was overall intact in AMN patients, independent of sex and corticospinal tract involvement, and those with arrested ACALD showed mild cognitive dysfunction, particularly in verbal encoding and processing speed.


Interpretation
Cerebral demyelination in X‐ALD patients causes white matter dementia, mainly characterized by an extreme slowdown in processing speed associated with deficits in attention and learning. Most AMN patients show intact cognitive function. Future prospective, longitudinal studies with more sensitive imaging techniques are required to clarify whether early mild cognitive dysfunction found in some AMN patients may be associated with subtle myelin abnormalities that do not yet appear as white matter lesions on cMRI but have the potential to serve as early predictors of later cerebral progression.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) has been consistently described in patients with acute/subacute cerebellar injuries. However, studies with chronic patients have had controversial findings that have not been explored with new cerebellar-target tests, such as the CCAS scale (CCAS-S). The objective of this research is to prove and contrast the usefulness of the CCAS-S and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test to evaluate cognitive/affective impairments in patients with chronic acquired cerebellar lesions, and to map the cerebellar areas whose lesions correlated with dysfunctions in these tests. CCAS-S and MoCA were administrated to 22 patients with isolated chronic cerebellar strokes and a matched comparison group. The neural bases underpinning both tests were explored with multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) methods. MoCA and CCAS-S had an adequate test performance with efficient discrimination between patients and healthy volunteers. However, only impairments determined by the CCAS-S resulted in significant regional localization within the cerebellum. Specifically, patients with chronic cerebellar lesions in right-lateralized posterolateral regions manifested cognitive impairments inherent to CCAS. These findings concurred with the anterior-sensorimotor/posterior-cognitive dichotomy in the human cerebellum and revealed clinically intra- and cross-lobular significant regions (portions of right lobule VI, VII, Crus I-II) for verbal tasks that overlap with the “language” functional boundaries in the cerebellum. Our findings prove the usefulness of MoCA and CCAS-S to reveal cognitive impairments in patients with chronic acquired cerebellar lesions. This study extends the understanding of long-term CCAS and introduces multivariate LSM methods to identify clinically intra- and cross-lobular significant regions underpinning chronic CCAS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chiari malformation type I (CMI) is a neural disorder with sensory, cognitive, and motor defects, as well as headaches. Radiologically, the cerebellar tonsils extend below the foramen magnum. To date, the relationships among adult age, brain morphometry, surgical status, and symptom severity in CMI are unknown. The objective of this study was to better understand the relationships among these variables using causal modeling techniques. Adult CMI patients (80% female) who either had (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 150) or had not (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 151) undergone posterior fossa decompression surgery were assessed using morphometric measures derived from magnetic resonance images (MRI). MRI-based morphometry showed that the area of the CSF pocket anterior to the cervico-medullary junction (anterior CSF space) correlated with age at the time of MRI (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; =  − .21). Also, self-reported pain increased with age (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = .11) and decreased with anterior CSF space (r =  − .18). Age differences in self-reported pain were mediated by anterior CSF space in the cervical spine area—and this effect was particularly salient for non-decompressed CMI patients. As CMI patients age, the anterior CSF space decreases, and this is associated with increased pain—especially for non-decompressed CMI patients. It is recommended that further consideration of age-related decreases in anterior CSF space in CMI patients be given in future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disease usually manifesting in adulthood. We performed a prospective 1-year longitudinal study in 14 presymptomatic mutation carriers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1), 11 ataxic patients, and 21 healthy controls. SCA1 patients had a median disease duration of 6 years (range 2–16) and SARA score of 7 points (range 3.5–20). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1 had an estimated time before disease onset of 9.7 years (range 4–30), and no signs of ataxia. At baseline, SCA1 patients significantly differed from controls in SARA score (Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia), cognitive tests, and structural MRI measures. Significant volume loss was found in cerebellum, brainstem, basal ganglia, and cortical thinning in frontal, temporal, and occipital regions. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1 did not differ from controls. At 1-year follow-up, SCA1 patients showed significant increase in SARA score, and decreased volume of cerebellum (− 0.6%), pons (− 5.5%), superior cerebellar peduncles (− 10.7%), and midbrain (− 3.0%). Signs of disease progression were also observed in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;pre&lt;/em&gt;SCA1 subjects, with increased SARA score and reduced total cerebellar volume. Our exploratory study suggests that clinical scores and MRI measures provide valuable data to monitor and quantify the earliest changes associated with the preclinical and the symptomatic phases of SCA1 disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioma is highly lethal because of its high malignancy. Ubiquitination, a type of ubiquitin-dependent protein modification, has been reported to play an oncogenic or tumor-suppressive role in glioma development, depending on the targets. Ring finger protein 139 (RNF139) is a membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase serving as a tumor suppressor by ubiquitylation-dependently suppressing cell growth. Herein, we firstly confirmed the abnormal downregulation of RNF139 in glioma tissues and cell lines. In glioma cells, ectopic RNF139 overexpression could inhibit, whereas RNF139 knockdown could aggravate the aggressive behaviors of glioma cells, including hyperproliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, in two glioma cell lines, RNF139 overexpression inhibited, whereas RNF139 knockdown enhanced the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT). In a word, we demonstrate the aberration in RNF139 expression in glioma tissue samples and cell lines. RNF139 serves as a tumor-suppressor in glioma by inhibiting glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoting glioma cell apoptosis through regulating PI3K/AKT signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Desminopathies (MIM*601419) are clinically heterogeneous, manifesting with myopathy and/or cardiomyopathy and with intra-sarcoplasmic desmin-positive deposits. They have either an autosomal dominant (AD) or recessive (AR) pattern of inheritance. Desmin is a crucial intermediate filament protein regulating various cellular functions in muscle cells. Here, we report a 13-year-old girl, born of second-degree consanguineous parents, with normal developmental milestones, who presented with dilated cardiomyopathy, respiratory insufficiency and predominant distal upper limb weakness. A striking feature on muscle biopsy was the presence of a peripheral chain of nuclei in addition to myopathic features. Immunostaining showed complete lack of desmin expression, further confirmed by western blot analysis. Ultrastructurally, subsarcolemmal granular material, expanded Z-band aggregation, distortion of myofilaments, focal Z-band streaming, lobed and clustered myonuclei were observed. Next-generation sequencing revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation c.448C&amp;gt;T, p.R150X in the patient, while the parents were heterozygous carriers. Single mitochondrial DNA deletion and isolated complex IV deficiency were noted. Our findings add to the ever-expanding phenotype and molecular spectrum of desminopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Octopus cells in the posteroventral cochlear nucleus exhibit characteristic onset responses to broad band transients but are little investigated in response to more complex sound stimuli. In this paper, we propose a phenomenological, but biophysically motivated, modeling approach that allows to simulate responses of large populations of octopus cells to arbitrary sound pressure waves. The model depends on only few parameters and reproduces basic physiological characteristics like onset firing and phase locking to amplitude modulations. Simulated responses to speech stimuli suggest that octopus cells are particularly sensitive to high-frequency transients in natural sounds and their sustained firing to phonemes provides a population code for sound level.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vestibular migraine (VM) is one of the most common causes of vertigo in clinical practice but it is not always easy to make the correct diagnosis. Our aims were to find out how VM patients differ from migraine only (MO) patients, to evaluate co-morbid depression in these two groups and to determine if their disease has an effect on their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We studied 50 definite VM and 35 MO patients. Each patient was asked about: age of onset, duration of headaches, presence of aura, headache characteristics, triggering factors, associated features, motion sickness history and family history of migraine. VM patients were also asked about their vertigo attacks and accompanying symptoms. Each patient also completed the following questionnaires: (1) Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS); (2) headache severity with VAS (Visual Analog Scale); (3) Allodynia Symptom Checklist (ASC-12); (4) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); (5) World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire Short Form-12 (WHOQL-SF12); (6) Activities Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC). VM patients also completed the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We found that VM patients were more likely than MO patients to be female, post-menopausal, depressed, motion sick, complaining of imbalance and of food-triggered headaches. In contrast, MO patients were more likely than VM patients to have severe headaches and that these can be triggered by certain odors and by noise.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our findings showed differences between VM and MO patients and attention to these differences could help clinicians diagnose, characterize and manage their VM patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We examined how implicit and explicit memories contribute to sensorimotor adaptation of movement extent during goal-directed reaching. Twenty subjects grasped the handle of a horizontal planar robot that rendered spring-like resistance to movement. Subjects made rapid “out-and-back” reaches to capture a remembered visual target at the point of maximal reach extent. The robot’s resistance changed unpredictably between reaches, inducing target capture errors that subjects attempted to correct from one trial to the next. Each subject performed over 400 goal-directed reaching trials. Some trials were performed without concurrent visual cursor feedback of hand motion. Some trials required self-assessment of performance between trials, whereby subjects reported peak reach extent on the most recent trial. This was done by either moving a cursor on a horizontal display (visual self-assessment), or by moving the robot’s handle back to the recalled location (proprioceptive self-assessment). Control condition trials performed either without or with concurrent visual cursor feedback of hand motion did not require self-assessments. We used step-wise linear regression analyses to quantify the extent to which prior reach errors and explicit memories of reach extent contribute to subsequent reach performance. Consistent with prior reports, providing concurrent visual feedback of hand motion increased reach accuracy and reduced the impact of past performance errors on future performance, relative to the corresponding no-vision control condition. By contrast, we found no impact of interposed self-assessment on subsequent reach performance or on how prior target capture errors influence subsequent reach performance. Self-assessments were biased toward the remembered target location and they spanned a compressed range of values relative to actual reach extents, demonstrating that declarative memories of reach performance systematically differed from actual performances. We found that multilinear regression could best account for observed data variability when the regression model included only implicit memories of prior reach performance; including explicit memories (self-assessments) in the model did not improve its predictive accuracy. We conclude therefore that explicit memories of prior reach performance do not contribute to implicit sensorimotor adaptation of movement extent during goal-directed reaching under conditions of environmental uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hypothyroidism causes somatic, psychosocial and affective psychosis, including depression-like behaviors. In this study, (hypothyroidism group; HP group) adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were induced to hypothyroidism after 5 weeks of exposure to 0.05% propylthiouracil (PTU) in potable water, control animals (CON group) were given the same amount of water. The following behavioral experiments were conducted, respectively: open-field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST).

                  &lt;/span&gt; in the HP group rats was much lower than that in the CON group. The hypothyroid rats also showed weight loss, much longer immobility time in tail suspension test and forced swimming test. Besides, 5 weeks of PTU administration was associated with significantly decreased expression levels of 5-HT&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq7&quot;&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt; receptor proteins compared with control group, which were significantly negatively correlated with immobility time in FST and TST. In conclusion, our results suggest that hypothyroidism induces depressive behaviors through the influence of the serotonin system, and the decreased expression of the 5-HT&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq9&quot;&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt; receptor is an important cause of the depressive behaviors in hypothyroidism.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is a gait intervention in which gait-disordered patients synchronise footsteps to music or metronome cues. Musical ‘groove’, the tendency of music to induce movement, has previously been shown to be associated with faster gait, however, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; groove affects gait remains unclear. One mechanism by which groove may affect gait is that of beat salience: music that is higher in groove has more salient musical beats, and higher beat salience might reduce the cognitive demands of perceiving the beat and synchronizing footsteps to it. If groove’s effects on gait are driven primarily by the impact of beat salience on cognitive demands, then groove’s effects might only be present in contexts in which it is relevant to reduce cognitive demands. Such contexts could include task parameters that increase cognitive demands (such as the requirement to synchronise to the beat), or individual differences that may make synchronisation more cognitively demanding. Here, we examined whether high beat salience can account for the effects of high-groove music on gait. First, we increased the beat salience of low-groove music to be similar to that of high-groove music by embedding metronome beats in low and high-groove music. We examined whether low-groove music with high beat salience elicited similar effects on gait as high-groove music. Second, we examined the effect of removing the requirement to synchronise footsteps to the beat (i.e., allowing participants to walk freely with the music), which is thought to remove the cognitive demand of synchronizing movements to the beat. We tested two populations thought to be sensitive to the cognitive demands of synchronisation, weak beat-perceivers and older adults. We found that increasing the beat salience of low-groove music increased stride velocity, but strides were still slower than with high-groove music. Similarly, removing the requirement to synchronise elicited faster, less variable gait, and reduced bias for stability, but high-groove music still elicited faster strides than low-groove music. These findings suggest that beat salience contributes to groove’s effect on gait, but it does not fully account for it. Despite reducing task difficulty by equalizing beat salience and removing the requirement to synchronise, high-groove music still elicited faster, less variable gait. Therefore, other properties of groove also appear to play a role in groove’s effect on gait.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress appears to be a key feature of many neurodegenerative diseases either as a cause or consequence of disease. A range of molecules are subject to oxidation, but in particular, proteins are an important target and measure of oxidative stress. Proteins are subject to a range of oxidative modifications at reactive cysteine residues, and depending on the level of oxidative stress, these modifications may be reversible or irreversible. A range of experimental approaches has been developed to characterize cysteine oxidation of proteins. In particular, mass spectrometry-based proteomic methods have emerged as a powerful means to identify and quantify cysteine oxidation sites on a proteome scale; however, their application to study neurodegenerative diseases is limited to date. Here we provide a guide to these approaches and highlight the under-exploited utility of these methods to measure oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases for biomarker discovery, target engagement and to understand disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transcriptional regulation is essential for the correct functioning of cells during development and in postnatal life. The basic Helix-loop-Helix (bHLH) superfamily of transcription factors is well conserved throughout evolution and plays critical roles in tissue development and tissue maintenance. A subgroup of this family, called neural lineage bHLH factors, is critical in the development and function of the central nervous system. In this review, we will focus on the function of one subgroup of neural lineage bHLH factors, the Neurod family. The Neurod family has four members: Neurod1, Neurod2, Neurod4, and Neurod6. Available evidence shows that these four factors are key during the development of the cerebral cortex but also in other regions of the central nervous system, such as the cerebellum, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. We will also discuss recent reports that link the dysfunction of these transcription factors to neurological disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Handwriting is a complex activity including motor planning and visuomotor integration and referring to some brain areas identified as “writing centers.” Although temporal features of handwriting are as important as spatial ones, to our knowledge, there is no evidence of the description of specific brain areas associated with handwriting tempo. People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) show handwriting impairments that are mainly referred to as the temporal features of the task. The aim of this work was to assess differences in the brain activation pattern elicited by handwriting between PwMS and healthy controls (HC), with the final goal of identifying possible areas specific for handwriting tempo. Subjects were asked to write a sentence at their spontaneous speed. PwMS differed only in temporal handwriting features from HC and showed reduced activation with a subset of the clusters observed in HC. Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed between handwriting temporal parameters and the activity in the brain areas resulting from the contrast analysis, HC &amp;gt; PwMS. We found that the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) negatively correlated with the duration of the sentence, indicating that the higher the right IPL activity, the faster the handwriting performance. We propose that the right IPL might be considered a “writing tempo center.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Disrupted functional asymmetry of cerebral hemispheres may be altered in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, little is known about whether anomalous brain asymmetries originate from inter- and/or intra-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) at rest in OCD. In this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to 40 medication-free patients with OCD and 38 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs). Data were analyzed using the parameter of asymmetry (PAS) and support vector machine methods. Patients with OCD showed significantly increased PAS in the left posterior cingulate cortex, left precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus, and right inferior occipital gyrus and decreased PAS in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC), left inferior parietal lobule, and left cerebellum Crus I. A negative correlation was found between decreased PAS in the left DLPFC and Yale–Brown Obsessive-compulsive Scale compulsive behavior scores in the patients. Furthermore, decreased PAS in the bilateral MCC could be used to distinguish OCD from HCs with a sensitivity of 87.50%, an accuracy of 88.46%, and a specificity of 89.47%. These results highlighted the contribution of disrupted asymmetry of intra-hemispheric FC within and outside the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits at rest in the pathophysiology of OCD, and reduced intra-hemispheric FC in the bilateral MCC may serve as a potential biomarker to classify individuals with OCD from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As a physiological process and high-level cognitive behavior, emotion is an important subarea in neuroscience research. Emotion recognition across subjects based on brain signals has attracted much attention. Due to individual differences across subjects and the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals, the performance of conventional emotion recognition methods is relatively poor. In this paper, we propose a self-organized graph neural network (SOGNN) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. Unlike the previous studies based on pre-constructed and fixed graph structure, the graph structure of SOGNN are dynamically constructed by self-organized module for each signal. To evaluate the cross-subject EEG emotion recognition performance of our model, leave-one-subject-out experiments are conducted on two public emotion recognition datasets, SEED and SEED-IV. The SOGNN is able to achieve state-of-the-art emotion recognition performance. Moreover, we investigated the performance variances of the models with different graph construction techniques or features in different frequency bands. Furthermore, we visualized the graph structure learned by the proposed model and found that part of the structure coincided with previous neuroscience research. The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The electroencephalography (EEG) is a well-established non-invasive method in neuroscientific research and clinical diagnostics. It provides a high temporal but low spatial resolution of brain activity. To gain insight about the spatial dynamics of the EEG, one has to solve the inverse problem, i.e., finding the neural sources that give rise to the recorded EEG activity. The inverse problem is ill-posed, which means that more than one configuration of neural sources can evoke one and the same distribution of EEG activity on the scalp. Artificial neural networks have been previously used successfully to find either one or two dipole sources. These approaches, however, have never solved the inverse problem in a distributed dipole model with more than two dipole sources. We present ConvDip, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, that solves the EEG inverse problem in a distributed dipole model based on simulated EEG data. We show that (1) ConvDip learned to produce inverse solutions from a single time point of EEG data and (2) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all focused performance measures. (3) It is more flexible when dealing with varying number of sources, produces less ghost sources and misses less real sources than the comparison methods. It produces plausible inverse solutions for real EEG recordings from human participants. (4) The trained network needs &amp;lt;40 ms for a single prediction. Our results qualify ConvDip as an efficient and easy-to-apply novel method for source localization in EEG data, with high relevance for clinical applications, e.g., in epileptology and real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The Approximate Number System (ANS) allows humans and non-human animals to estimate large quantities without counting. It is most commonly studied in visual contexts (i.e., with displays containing different numbers of dots), although the ANS may operate on all approximate quantities regardless of modality (e.g., estimating the number of a series of auditory tones). Previous research has shown that there is a link between ANS and mathematics abilities, and that this link is resilient to differences in visual experience (Kanjlia et al., 2018). However, little is known about the function of the ANS and its relationship to mathematics abilities in the absence of other types of sensory input. Here, we investigated the acuity of the ANS and its relationship with mathematics abilities in a group of students from the Sichuan Province in China, half of whom were deaf. We found, consistent with previous research, that ANS acuity improves with age. We found that mathematics ability was predicted by Non-verbal IQ and Inhibitory Control, but not visual working memory capacity or Attention Network efficiencies. Even above and beyond these predictors, ANS ability still accounted for unique variance in mathematics ability. Notably, there was no interaction with hearing, which indicates that the role played by the ANS in explaining mathematics competence is not modulated by hearing capacity. Finally, we found that age, Non-verbal IQ and Visual Working Memory capacity were predictive of ANS performance when controlling for other factors. In fact, although students with hearing loss performed slightly worse than students with normal hearing on the ANS task, hearing was no longer significantly predictive of ANS performance once other factors were taken into account. These results indicate that the ANS is able to develop at a consistent pace with other cognitive abilities in the absence of auditory experience, and that its relationship with mathematics ability is not contingent on sensory input from hearing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ability to finely control our movement is key to achieving many of the educational milestones and life-skills we develop throughout our lives. Despite the centrality of coordination to early development, there is a vast gap in our understanding of the underlying biology. Like most complex traits, both genetics and environment influence motor coordination, however, the specific genes, early environmental risk factors and molecular pathways are unknown. Previous studies have shown that about 5% of school-age children experience unexplained difficulties with motor coordination. These children are said to have Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). For children with DCD, these motor coordination difficulties significantly impact their everyday life and learning. DCD is associated with poorer academic achievement, reduced quality of life, it can constrain career opportunities and increase the risk of mental health issues in adulthood. Despite the high prevalence of coordination difficulties, many children remain undiagnosed by healthcare professionals. Compounding under-diagnosis in the clinic, research into the etiology of DCD is severely underrepresented in the literature. Here we present the first genome-wide association study to examine the genetic basis of early motor coordination in the context of motor difficulties. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children we generate a derived measure of motor coordination from four components of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, providing an overall measure of coordination across the full range of ability. We perform the first genome-wide association analysis focused on motor coordination (N = 4542). No single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) met the threshold for genome-wide significance, however, 59 SNPs showed suggestive associations. Three regions contained multiple suggestively associated SNPs, within five preliminary candidate genes: IQSEC1, LRCC1, SYNJ2B2, ADAM20, and ADAM21. Association to the gene IQSEC1 suggests a potential link to axon guidance and dendritic projection processes as a potential underlying mechanism of motor coordination difficulties. This represents an interesting potential mechanism, and whilst further validation is essential, it generates a direct window into the biology of motor coordination difficulties. This research has identified potential biological drivers of DCD, a first step towards understanding this common, yet neglected neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Understanding rhythmic behavior in the context of coupled auditory and motor systems has been of interest to neurological rehabilitation, in particular, to facilitate walking. Recent work based on behavioral measures revealed an entrainment effect of auditory rhythms on motor rhythms. In this study, we propose a method to compute the neural component of such a process from an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. A simple auditory-motor synchronization paradigm was used, where 28 healthy participants were instructed to synchronize their finger-tapping with a metronome. The computation of the neural outcome measure was carried out in two blocks. In the first block, we used Generalized Eigendecomposition (GED) to reduce the data dimensionality to the component which maximally entrained to the metronome frequency. The scalp topography pointed at brain activity over contralateral sensorimotor regions. In the second block, we computed instantaneous frequency from the analytic signal of the extracted component. This returned a time-varying measure of frequency fluctuations, whose standard deviation provided our “stability index” as a neural outcome measure of auditory-motor coupling. Finally, the proposed neural measure was validated by conducting a correlation analysis with a set of behavioral outcomes from the synchronization task: resultant vector length, relative phase angle, mean asynchrony, and tempo matching. Significant moderate negative correlations were found with the first three measures, suggesting that the stability index provided a quantifiable neural outcome measure of entrainment, with selectivity towards phase-correction mechanisms. We address further adoption of the proposed approach, especially with populations where sensorimotor abilities are compromised by an underlying pathological condition. The impact of using stability index can potentially be used as an outcome measure to assess rehabilitation protocols, and possibly provide further insight into neuropathological models of auditory-motor coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aggressive behaviors comprise verbal and/or physical aggression directed toward oneself, others, or objects and are highly prevalent among psychiatric patients, especially patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and severe intellectual disabilities. Some of these patients are considered refractory to treatment, and functional neurosurgery targeting the amygdala can result in widespread plastic brain changes that might reflect ceasing of some abnormal brain function, offering symptom alleviation. This study investigated cortical thickness changes in refractory aggressive behavior patients that were treated with bilateral amygdala ablation and compared to control patients presenting non-refractory aggressive behavior [three refractory and seven non-refractory patients, all males diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities]. The Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) was used to quantify behavior and magnetic resonance imaging was performed to investigate cortical thickness. Before surgery, both groups presented similar total OAS score, however refractory patients presented higher physical aggression against others. After surgery the refractory group showed 88% average reduction of aggressive behavior. Imaging analysis showed that while refractory patients present an overall reduction in cortical thickness compared to non-refractory patients across both timepoints, the local pattern of thickness difference found in areas of the neurocircuitry of aggressive behavior present before surgery is diminished and no longer detected after surgery. These results corroborate the hypotheses on induction of widespread neuronal plasticity following functional neurosurgical procedures resulting in modifications in brain morphology and improvement in behavior. Further studies are necessary to determine the underlying cause of these morphological changes and to better understand and improve treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The development and stabilization of neuronal circuits are critical to proper brain function. Synapses are the building blocks of neural circuits. Here we examine the effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin on synaptic transmission in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF). We find that perfusion of oxytocin onto acute brain slices significantly increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) of S1BF L2/3 pyramidal neurons at P10 and P14, but reduces it at the later ages of P22 and P28; the transition occurs at around P18. Since oxytocin expression is itself regulated by sensory experience, we also examine whether the effects of oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission correlate with that of sensory experience. We find that, indeed, the effects of sensory experience and oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission of L2/3 pyramidal neurons both peak at around P14 and plateau around P18, suggesting that they regulate a specific form of synaptic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, with a sensitive/critical period ending around P18. Consistently, oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) expression in glutamatergic neurons of the upper layers of the cerebral cortex peaks around P14. By P28, however, Oxtr expression becomes more prominent in GABAergic neurons, especially somatostatin (SST) neurons. At P28, oxytocin perfusion increases inhibitory synaptic transmission and reduces excitatory synaptic transmission, effects that result in a net reduction of neuronal excitation, in contrast to increased excitation at P14. Using oxytocin knockout mice and Oxtr conditional knockout mice, we show that loss-of-function of oxytocin affects baseline excitatory synaptic transmission, while Oxtr is required for oxytocin-induced changes in excitatory synaptic transmission, at both P14 and P28. Together, these results demonstrate that oxytocin has complex and dynamic functions in regulating synaptic transmission in cortical L2/3 pyramidal neurons. These findings add to existing knowledge of the function of oxytocin in regulating neural circuit development and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dementia describes a set of symptoms that occur in neurodegenerative disorders and that is characterized by gradual loss of cognitive and behavioral functions. Recently, non-invasive neurofeedback training has been explored as a potential complementary treatment for patients suffering from dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Here we systematically reviewed studies that explored neurofeedback training protocols based on electroencephalography or functional magnetic resonance imaging for these groups of patients. From a total of 1,912 screened studies, 10 were included in our final sample (N = 208 independent participants in experimental and N = 81 in the control groups completing the primary endpoint). We compared the clinical efficacy across studies, and evaluated their experimental designs and reporting quality. In most studies, patients showed improved scores in different cognitive tests. However, data from randomized controlled trials remains scarce, and clinical evidence based on standardized metrics is still inconclusive. In light of recent meta-research developments in the neurofeedback field and beyond, quality and reporting practices of individual studies are reviewed. We conclude with recommendations on best practices for future studies that investigate the effects of neurofeedback training in dementia and cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is an intracellular parasite that causes a long-term latent infection of neurons. Using a custom MATLAB-based mapping program in combination with a mouse model that allows us to permanently mark neurons injected with parasite proteins, we found that &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt;-injected neurons (TINs) are heterogeneously distributed in the brain, primarily localizing to the cortex followed by the striatum. In addition, we determined that cortical TINs are commonly (&amp;gt;50%) excitatory neurons (FoxP2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and that striatal TINs are often (&amp;gt;65%) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) (FoxP2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). By performing single neuron patch-clamping on striatal TINs and neighboring uninfected MSNs, we discovered that TINs have highly aberrant electrophysiology. As approximately 90% of TINs will die by 8 weeks post-infection, this abnormal physiology suggests that injection with &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; protein— either directly or indirectly— affects neuronal health and survival. Collectively, these data offer the first insights into which neurons interact with &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; and how these interactions alter neuron physiology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</content>

 The COVID-19 pandemic originating in the Wuhan province of China in late 2019 has impacted global health, causing increased mortality among elderly patients and individuals with comorbid conditions. During the passage of the virus through affected populations, it has undergone mutations, some of which have recently been linked with increased viral load and prognostic complexities. Several of these variants are point mutations that are difficult to diagnose using the gold standard quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method and necessitates widespread sequencing which is expensive, has long turn-around times, and requires high viral load for calling mutations accurately. Here, we repurpose the high specificity of &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;novicida&lt;/i&gt; Cas9 (FnCas9) to identify mismatches in the target for developing a lateral flow assay that can be successfully adapted for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV2 infection as well as for detecting point mutations in the sequence of the virus obtained from patient samples. We report the detection of the S gene mutation N501Y (present across multiple variant lineages of SARS-CoV2) within an hour using lateral flow paper strip chemistry. The results were corroborated using deep sequencing on multiple wild type (n=37) and mutant (n=22) viral RNA samples with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 97%. The design principle can be rapidly adapted for other mutations (as shown also for E484K and T716I) highlighting the advantages of quick optimization and roll-out of CRISPR diagnostics (CRISPRDx) for disease surveillance even beyond COVID-19. This study was funded by Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, India.</content>

 Integration of binding information by macromolecular entities is fundamental to cellular functionality. Recent work has shown that such integration cannot be explained by pairwise cooperativities, in which binding is modulated by binding at another site. Higher-order cooperativities (HOCs), in which binding is collectively modulated by multiple other binding events, appear to be necessary but an appropriate mechanism has been lacking. We show here that HOCs arise through allostery, in which effective cooperativity emerges indirectly from an ensemble of dynamically interchanging conformations. Conformational ensembles play important roles in many cellular processes but their integrative capabilities remain poorly understood. We show that sufficiently complex ensembles can implement any form of information integration achievable without energy expenditure, including all patterns of HOCs. Our results provide a rigorous biophysical foundation for analysing the integration of binding information through allostery. We discuss the implications for eukaryotic gene regulation, where complex conformational dynamics accompanies widespread information integration.</content>

 Chromatin, which consists of DNA and associated proteins, contains genetic information and is a mechanical component of the nucleus. Heterochromatic histone methylation controls nucleus and chromosome stiffness, but the contribution of heterochromatin protein HP1α (CBX5) is unknown. We used a novel HP1α auxin-inducible degron human cell line to rapidly degrade HP1α. Degradation did not alter transcription, local chromatin compaction, or histone methylation, but did decrease chromatin stiffness. Single-nucleus micromanipulation reveals that HP1α is essential to chromatin-based mechanics and maintains nuclear morphology, separate from histone methylation. Further experiments with dimerization-deficient HP1α&lt;sup&gt;I165E&lt;/sup&gt; indicate that chromatin crosslinking via HP1α dimerization is critical, while polymer simulations demonstrate the importance of chromatin-chromatin crosslinkers in mechanics. In mitotic chromosomes, HP1α similarly bolsters stiffness while aiding in mitotic alignment and faithful segregation. HP1α is therefore a critical chromatin-crosslinking protein that provides mechanical strength to chromosomes and the nucleus throughout the cell cycle and supports cellular functions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Germ granules are protein-RNA condensates that segregate with the embryonic germline. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryos, germ (P) granule assembly requires MEG-3, an intrinsically-disordered protein that forms RNA-rich condensates on the surface of PGL condensates at the core of P granules. MEG-3 is related to the GCNA family and contains an N-terminal disordered region (IDR) and a predicted ordered C-terminus featuring an HMG-like motif (HMGL). We find that MEG-3 is modular protein that uses its IDR to bind RNA and its C-terminus to drive condensation. The HMGL motif mediates binding to PGL-3 and is required for co-assembly of MEG-3 and PGL-3 condensates &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Mutations in HMGL cause MEG-3 and PGL-3 to form separate condensates that no longer co-segregate to the germline or recruit RNA. Our findings highlight the importance of protein-based condensation mechanisms and condensate-condensate interactions in the assembly of RNA-rich germ granules.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels participate in calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) influx and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release. TRP channels have not been studied in &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; or any other apicomplexan parasite. In this work we characterize TgGT1_310560, a protein predicted to possess a TRP domain (TgTRPPL-2) and determined its role in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. TgTRPPL-2 localizes to the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;ΔTgTRPPL-2&lt;/i&gt; mutant was defective in growth and cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx from both extracellular and intracellular sources. Heterologous expression of TgTRPPL-2 in HEK-3KO cells allowed its functional characterization. Patching of ER-nuclear membranes demonstrates that TgTRPPL-2 is a non-selective cation channel that conducts Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Pharmacological blockers of TgTRPPL-2 inhibit Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and parasite growth. This is the first report of an apicomplexan ion channel that conducts Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and may initiate a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling cascade that leads to the stimulation of motility, invasion and egress. TgTRPPL-2 is a potential target for combating Toxoplasmosis.</content>

 The zebra finch (&lt;i&gt;Taeniopygia guttata&lt;/i&gt;) is a socially monogamous and colonial opportunistic breeder with pronounced sexual differences in singing and plumage coloration. Its natural history has led to it becoming a model species for research into sex differences in vocal communication, as well as behavioral, neural and genomic theories of imitative auditory learning. As scientists tap into the genetic and behavioral diversity of both wild and captive lineages, the zebra finch will continue to inform research into culture, learning and social bonding, as well as adaptability to a changing climate.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Only a fraction of cancer patients benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitors. This may be partly due to the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) that forms a barrier for T cells. Comparing 5 preclinical mouse tumor models with heterogeneous tumor microenvironments, we aimed to relate the rate of tumor stiffening with the remodeling of ECM architecture and to determine how these features affect intratumoral T cell migration. An ECM-targeted strategy, based on the inhibition of lysyl oxidase (LOX) was used. In vivo stiffness measurements were found to be strongly correlated with tumor growth and ECM crosslinking but negatively correlated with T cell migration. Interfering with collagen stabilization reduces ECM content and tumor stiffness leading to improved T cell migration and increased efficacy of anti-PD-1 blockade. This study highlights the rationale of mechanical characterizations in solid tumors to understand resistance to immunotherapy and of combining treatment strategies targeting the ECM with anti-PD-1 therapy.</content>

The amygdala is a brain area involved in emotional regulation and pain. Over the course of the last 20 years, multiple researchers have studied sensory and motor connections within the amygdala in trying to understand the ultimate role of this structure in pain perception and descending control of pain. A number of investigators have been using cell-type specific manipulations to probe the underlying circuitry of the amygdala. As data have accumulated in this research space, we recognized a critical need for a single framework to integrate these data and evaluate emergent system-level responses. In this manuscript, we present an agent-based computational model of two distinct inhibitory neuron populations in the amygdala, those that express protein kinase C delta (PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;) and those that express somatostatin (SOM). We utilized a network of neural links to simulate connectivity and the transmission of inhibitory signals between neurons. Type-specific parameters describing the response of these neurons to noxious stimuli were estimated from published physiological and immunological data as well as our own wet-lab experiments. The model outputs an abstract measure of pain, which is calculated in terms of the cumulative pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive activity across neurons in both hemispheres of the amygdala. Results demonstrate the ability of the model to produce changes in pain that are consistent with published studies and highlight the importance of several model parameters. In particular, we found that the relative proportion of PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; and SOM neurons within each hemisphere is a key parameter in predicting pain and we explored model predictions for three possible values of this parameter. We compared model predictions of pain to data from our earlier behavioral studies and found areas of similarity as well as distinctions between the data sets. These differences, in particular, suggest a number of wet-lab experiments that could be done in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Gu4XwB9cP4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Collagen forms a characteristic triple helical structure and plays a central role for stabilizing the extra-cellular matrix. After a C-terminal nucleus formation folding proceeds to form long triple-helical fibers. The molecular details of triple helix folding process is of central importance for an understanding of several human diseases associated with misfolded or unstable collagen fibrils. However, the folding propagation is too rapid to be studied by experimental high resolution techniques. We employed multiple Molecular Dynamics simulations starting from unfolded peptides with an already formed nucleus to successfully follow the folding propagation in atomic detail. The triple helix folding was found to propagate involving first two chains forming a short transient template. Secondly, three residues of the third chain fold on this template with an overall mean propagation of ~75 ns per unit. The formation of loops with multiples of the repeating unit was found as a characteristic misfolding event especially when starting from an unstable nucleus. Central Gly→Ala or Gly→Thr substitutions resulted in reduced stability and folding rates due to structural deformations interfering with folding propagation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BEGFFLCXFNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Cytometry analysis has seen a considerable expansion in recent years in the maximum number of parameters that can be acquired in a single experiment. In response to this technological advance there has been an increased effort to develop new computational methodologies for handling high-dimensional single cell data acquired by flow or mass cytometry. Despite the success of numerous algorithms and published packages to replicate and outperform traditional manual analysis, widespread adoption of these techniques has yet to be realised in the field of immunology. Here we present CytoPy, a Python framework for automated analysis of cytometry data that integrates a document-based database for a data-centric and iterative analytical environment. In addition, our algorithm agnostic design provides a platform for open-source cytometry bioinformatics in the Python ecosystem. We demonstrate the ability of CytoPy to phenotype T cell subsets in whole blood samples even in the presence of significant batch effects due to technical and user variation. The complete analytical pipeline was then used to immunophenotype the local inflammatory infiltrate in individuals with and without acute bacterial infection. CytoPy is open-source and licensed under the MIT license. CytoPy is open source and available at https://github.com/burtonrj/CytoPy, with notebooks accompanying this manuscript (https://github.com/burtonrj/CytoPyManuscript) and software documentation at https://cytopy.readthedocs.io/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8IPwo40Bi6A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Our longitudinal study revealed increases of the amygdala during the postpartum period. Volumes and subvolumes of the amygdala were analyzed by integrating imaging‐based signal intensities with cytoarchitectonically defined probabilities.
​

Abstract
Research exploring the underlying neuroanatomical correlates of early motherhood seems to suggest that the period after giving birth is marked by tissue increases in the mother's brain. While some studies point to the amygdala as one of the areas undergoing postpartum changes, existing analyses did not discriminate between the different subregions of this functionally heterogeneous structure. Thus, to further extend this understudied field of research and to better understand the potential role of the amygdala when transitioning to motherhood, we applied an advanced region‐of‐interest technique that enabled us to analyze the amygdala as a whole as well as its different subareas, specifically the left and right centromedian (CM), laterobasal (LB), and superficial (SF) regions. Comparing the brains of 14 healthy women between immediate postpartum (within 1–2 days of childbirth) and late postpartum (at 4–6 weeks after childbirth), we revealed increases of the amygdala. However, effects manifested differentially across subareas, with particularly strong effects for the SF region, moderate effects for the CM region, and no effects for the LB region. These findings might reflect region‐specific adaptations of the mother's brain tuning into the distinct and ever‐changing needs of a newborn, either as a cause for it or as a consequence thereof.</content>

 Abstract
The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to neurodegeneration. Physical activity, specifically increasing cardiorespiratory fitness via aerobic exercise, shows promise as a potential method for mitigating hippocampal decline in humans. Numerous studies have now investigated associations between the structure and function of the hippocampus and engagement in physical activity. Still, there remains continued debate and confusion about the relationship between physical activity and the human hippocampus. In this review, we describe the current state of the physical activity and exercise literature as it pertains to the structure and function of the human hippocampus, focusing on four magnetic resonance imaging measures: volume, diffusion tensor imaging, resting‐state functional connectivity, and perfusion. We conclude that, despite significant heterogeneity in study methods, populations of interest, and scope, there are consistent positive findings, suggesting a promising role for physical activity in promoting hippocampal structure and function throughout the lifespan.</content>

 Abstract
The hippocampus is known to be involved in source memory across a wide variety of stimuli and source types. Thus, source memory activity in the hippocampus is thought to be domain‐general such that different types of source information are similarly processed in the hippocampus. However, there is some evidence of domain‐specificity for spatial and temporal source information. The current fMRI study aimed to determine whether patterns of activity in the hippocampus differed for two types of visual source information: spatial location and background color. Participants completed three runs of a spatial memory task and three runs of a color memory task. During the study phase, 32 line drawings of common objects and animals were presented to either the left or right of fixation for the spatial memory task or on either a red or green background for the color memory task. During the test phase of both tasks, 48 object word labels were presented in the center of the screen and participants classified the corresponding item as old and previously on the “left”/on a “green” background, old and previously on the “right”/on a “red” background, or “new.” Two analysis methods were employed to assess whether hippocampal activity differed between the two source types: a general linear model analysis and a classification‐based searchlight multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The searchlight MVPA revealed that activity associated with spatial memory and color memory could be classified with above‐chance accuracy in a region of the right anterior hippocampus, and a follow‐up analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of memory accuracy. These results indicate that different types of source memory are represented by distinct patterns of activity in the hippocampus.</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Both electroacupuncture and constraint-induced movement therapy have been reported to produce therapeutic effects on the recovery of ischemic stroke. The combined use of these two therapies is not rare clinically, although its effectiveness is not yet clear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of electroacupuncture and constraint-induced movement therapy in ischemic stroke rats, and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. Ischemic stroke rat models were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Then, the rats were assigned to receive one of the following interventions: sole electroacupuncture, sole constraint-induced movement therapy, the combination of both therapies, and no treatment. Functional recovery was assessed with the beam balance test and rotarod test. The infarct volume of the brain and the expression of the molecules Nogo-A, P75&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;, NGF, BDNF, and VEGF in the brain tissue were investigated. The results demonstrated that the combination of the two therapies significantly improved neurological functional recovery in ischemic stroke rats compared to each therapy alone (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). We also observed a significant decrease in infarct volume in rats receiving the combined treatment. Nogo-A and P75&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; were downregulated and NGF, BDNF, and VEGF were upregulated in the combined treatment rats compared to the control rats. In conclusion, the combination of electroacupuncture and constraint-induced movement therapy enhanced functional recovery after ischemic stroke in rats, and it is a promising treatment strategy in the rehabilitation of stroke. The anti-Nogo-A effect of electroacupuncture may explain its good compatibility with CIMT in ischemic stroke rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The rise of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has led to a deeper understanding of cortical processing of pain. Central to these advances has been the identification and analysis of “functional networks”, often derived from groups of pre-selected pain regions. In this study our main objective was to identify functional brain networks related to pain perception by examining whole-brain activation, avoiding the need for a priori selection of regions. We applied a data-driven technique—Constrained Principal Component Analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA)—that identifies networks without assuming their anatomical or temporal properties. Open-source fMRI data collected during a thermal pain task (33 healthy participants) were subjected to fMRI-CPCA for network extraction, and networks were associated with pain perception by modelling subjective pain ratings as a function of network activation intensities. Three functional networks emerged: a sensorimotor response network, a salience-mediated attention network, and the default-mode network. Together, these networks constituted a brain state that explained variability in pain perception, both within and between individuals, demonstrating the potential of data-driven, whole-brain functional network techniques for the analysis of pain imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

We end by musing over some points now on our wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Samples sent for biomarker determination as part of routine practice, and formally diagnosed as AD, CJD, and PSY, were used as comparators.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twenty-four patients with LGI1 encephalitis were compared to 39 AD, 20 CJD and 20 PSY. No significant difference was observed in T-tau, P-tau, and Aβ1-42 levels between LGI1 encephalitis and PSY patients. T-Tau and P-Tau levels were significantly lower in LGI1 encephalitis (231 and 43 ng/L) than in AD (621 and 90 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and CJD patients (4327 and 55 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Nf L concentrations of LGI1 encephalitis (2039 ng/L) were similar to AD (2,765 ng/L) and significantly higher compared to PSY (1223 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005), but significantly lower than those of CJD (13,457 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Higher levels of Nf L were observed in LGI1 encephalitis presenting with epilepsy (3855 ng/L) compared to LGI1 without epilepsy (1490 ng/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02). No correlation between CSF biomarkers’ levels and clinical outcome could be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LGI encephalitis patients showed higher Nf L levels than PSY, comparable to AD, and even higher when presenting epilepsy suggesting axonal or synaptic damage linked to epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Aphasia is a recognized presenting symptom of thalamic lesions. Little is known regarding its frequency and phenotype. We examined the frequency of thalamic aphasia following Isolated Acute unilateral ischemic Lesions in the Thalamus (IALT) with respect to lesion location. Furthermore, we characterized thalamic aphasia according to affected language domains and severity.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fifty-two patients with IALT were analyzed [44% female, median age: 73 years (IQR: 60–79)]. Lesion location was determined using 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and categorized as anterior, posterior, paramedian or inferolateral. Standardized language assessment was performed using the validated Aphasia checklist (ACL) directly after symptom onset. Aphasia was defined as an ACL sum score of &amp;lt; 135 (range: 0–148).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Of 52 patients, 23 (44%) fulfilled the ACL diagnostic criteria for aphasia, including nearly all lesion locations and both sides. The average ACL sum score was 132 ± 11 (range: 98–147). Aphasia was characterized by deficits within domains of complex understanding of speech and verbal fluency. Patients with left anterior IALT were most severely affected, having significantly lower ACL scores than all other patients (117 ± 13 vs. 135 ± 8; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In particular, aphasia in patients with left anterior IALT was characterized by significantly worse performance in the rating of verbal communication, verbal fluency, and naming (all &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Aphasia occurs in almost half of patients with focal thalamic lesions. Thalamic aphasia is not confined to one predefined thalamic lesion location, but language deficits are particularly pronounced in patients with left anterior IALT presenting with a distinct pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The etiology of transient global amnesia (TGA) is still a matter of debate. Based, among others, on the observation of a close temporal relation between certain events and subsequent TGA episodes, recent proposals discuss the relevance of stress-associated processes impacting on hippocampal functioning. Circadian, infra- and ultradian rhythmicity has been found to play a relevant role in the multifactorial pathomechanisms of various disorders but has not been thoroughly studied in TGA.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Data of patients with a final diagnosis of TGA were collected in Mannheim, Germany (06/1999–01/2018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 404), and in the Kansai district, Japan (04/2006–03/2018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 261). Chronological patterns of TGA occurrence were determined.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Significant circadian rhythmicity of TGA occurrence with bimodal peaks (mid-morning, late afternoon) was found for the entire population (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002) and for either sub-cohort (Mannheim: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003, Kansai: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007). This finding was confirmed for either sex (women: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004, men: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004) and different age groups (&amp;lt; 65 years: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0009, ≥ 65 years: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003). There was no variation according to day of the week, month or season, but the proportion of patients with a weekday episode was significantly higher in the Mannheim cohort (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We identified a robust circadian rhythm in TGA occurrence which remarkably applied to either of the two study sites located on different continents and which was independent of sex and age. In light of abundant evidence of circadian rhythmicity of both, components of the human stress response system and memory, chronobiological analyses may provide an opportunity to further uncover the mechanisms underlying TGA.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Recording brain activity during speech production using magnetoencephalography (MEG) can help us to understand the dynamics of speech production. However, these measurements are challenging due to the induced artifacts coming from several sources such as facial muscle activity, lower jaw and head movements. Here, we aimed to characterize speech-related artifacts, focusing on head movements, and subsequently present an approach to remove these artifacts from MEG data. We recorded MEG from 11 healthy participants while they pronounced various syllables in different loudness. Head positions/orientations were extracted during speech production to investigate its role in MEG distortions. Finally, we present an artifact rejection approach using the combination of regression analysis and signal space projection (SSP) in order to correct the induced artifact from MEG data. Our results show that louder speech leads to stronger head movements and stronger MEG distortions. Our proposed artifact rejection approach could successfully remove the speech-related artifact and retrieve the underlying neurophysiological signals. As the presented artifact rejection approach was shown to remove artifacts arising from head movements, induced by overt speech in the MEG, it will facilitate research addressing the neural basis of speech production with MEG.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Aim&lt;p&gt;In PET imaging, the different types of radiotracers and accumulations, as well as the diversity of disease patterns, make the analysis of molecular imaging data acquired in vivo challenging. Here, we evaluate and validate a semi-automated MRI template-based data analysis tool that allows preclinical PET images to be aligned to a self-created PET template. Based on the user-defined volume-of-interest (VOI), image data can then be evaluated using three different semi-quantitative parameters: normalized activity, standardized uptake value, and uptake ratio.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;The nuclear medicine Data Processing Analysis tool (NU_DPA) was implemented in Matlab. Testing and validation of the tool was performed using two types of radiotracers in different kinds of stroke-related brain diseases in rat models. The radiotracers used are 2-[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG), a metabolic tracer with symmetrical distribution in brain, and [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, a target-selective radioligand specifically binding to p-selectin. After manual image import, the NU_DPA tool automatically creates an averaged PET template out of the acquired PET images, to which all PET images are then aligned onto. The added MRI template-based information, resized to the lower PET resolution, defines the VOI and also allows a precise subdivision of the VOI into individual sub-regions. The aligned PET images can then be evaluated semi-quantitatively for all regions defined in the MRI atlas. In addition, a statistical analysis and evaluation of the semi-quantitative parameters can then be performed in the NU_DPA tool.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Using ischemic stroke data in Wistar rats as an example, the statistical analysis of the tool should be demonstrated. In this [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET experiment, three different experimental states were compared: healthy control state, ischemic stroke without electrical stimulation, ischemic stroke with electrical stimulation. Thereby, statistical data evaluation using the NU_DPA tool showed that the glucose metabolism in a photothrombotic lesion can be influenced by electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our NU_DPA tool allows a very flexible data evaluation of small animal PET data in vivo including statistical data evaluation. Using the radiotracers [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, it was shown that the semi-automatic MRI-template based data analysis of the NU_DPA tool is potentially suitable for both metabolic radiotracers as well as target-selective radiotracers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is a key factor to obtain good surgical outcome for refractory epilepsy patients. However, no technique, so far, can precisely locate the EZ, and there are barely any reports on the combined application of multiple technologies to improve the localization accuracy of the EZ. In this study, we aimed to explore the use of a multimodal method combining PET-MRI, fluid and white matter suppression (FLAWS)—a novel MRI sequence, and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) automated analysis to delineate EZ. We retrospectively collected 15 patients with refractory epilepsy who underwent surgery and used the above three methods to detect abnormal brain areas of all patients. We compared the PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFO results with traditional methods to evaluate their diagnostic value. The sensitivities, specificities of locating the EZ, and marking extent removed versus not removed [RatioChann(ev)] of each method were compared with surgical outcome. We also tested the possibility of using different combinations to locate the EZ. The marked areas in every patient established using each method were also compared to determine the correlations among the three methods. The results showed that PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs can provide more information about potential epileptic areas than traditional methods. When detecting the EZs, the sensitivities of PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs were 68.75, 53.85, and 87.50%, and the specificities were 80.00, 33.33, and 100.00%. The RatioChann(ev) of HFO-marked contacts was significantly higher in patients with good outcome than those with poor outcome (p&amp;lt; 0.05). When intracranial electrodes covered all the abnormal areas indicated by neuroimaging with the overlapping EZs being completely removed referred to HFO analysis, patients could reach seizure-free (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The periphery of the lesion marked by neuroimaging may be epileptic, but not every lesion contributes to seizures. Therefore, approaches in multimodality can detect EZ more accurately, and HFO analysis may help in defining real epileptic areas that may be missed in the neuroimaging results. The implantation of intracranial electrodes guided by non-invasive PET-MRI and FLAWS findings as well as HFO analysis would be an optimized multimodal approach for locating EZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676755"/>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating motor deficit in a subset of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients that is poorly responsive to levodopa or deep brain stimulation (DBS) of established PD targets. The proposal of a DBS target in the midbrain, known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), to address FOG was based on its observed neuropathology in PD and its hypothesized involvement in locomotor control as a part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). Initial reports of PPN DBS were met with enthusiasm; however, subsequent studies reported mixed results. A closer review of the MLR basic science literature, suggests that the closely related cuneiform nucleus (CnF), dorsal to the PPN, may be a superior site to promote gait. Although suspected to have a conserved role in the control of gait in humans, deliberate stimulation of a homolog to the CnF in humans using directional DBS electrodes has not been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;As part of an open-label Phase 1 clinical study, one PD patient with predominantly axial symptoms and severe FOG refractory to levodopa therapy was implanted with directional DBS electrodes (Boston Science Vercise Cartesia&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) targeting the CnF bilaterally. Since the CnF is a poorly defined reticular nucleus, targeting was guided both by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and anatomical landmarks. Intraoperative stimulation and microelectrode recordings were performed near the targets with leg EMG surface recordings in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Post-operative imaging revealed accurate targeting of both leads to the designated CnF. Intraoperative stimulation near the target at low thresholds in the awake patient evoked involuntary electromyography (EMG) oscillations in the legs with a peak power at the stimulation frequency, similar to observations with CnF DBS in animals. Oscillopsia was the primary side effect evoked at higher currents, especially when directed posterolaterally. Directional DBS could mitigate oscillopsia.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;DTI-based targeting and intraoperative stimulation to evoke limb EMG activity may be useful methods to help target the CnF accurately and safely in patients. Long term follow-up and detailed gait testing of patients undergoing CnF stimulation will be necessary to confirm the effects on FOG.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04218526.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the improvement effect of occipital repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with escitalopram oxalate tablets on pre-attentive processing in patients with first-episode, medication-naive depression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Patients who were hospitalized between January and December 2019 were selected. They were randomly allocated to real occipital rTMS stimulation group with 27 cases receiving intermittent theta-burst (iTBS) and sham stimulation group with 24 cases over 20 days. The rTMS treatment target is located at the Oz point of the occipital region. Both groups took escitalopram oxalate tablets, and the average daily drug dose was 15.294 ± 5.041 mg. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess the symptoms of depression before and after treatment, and mismatch negativity (MMN) was used to assess the improvement of pre-attentive processing before and after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After 20 days of treatment, the total score of HAMD (13.495 ± 3.700) in both groups was significantly lower than that before treatment [21.910 ± 3.841, F(1, 49) = 46, 3.690, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. After treatment, the latency of MMN in the real stimulation group (182.204 ± 31.878 ms) was significantly lower than that in the sham stimulation group (219.896 ± 42.634 ms, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the amplitude of MMN in the real stimulation group (−7.107 ± 3.374 ms) was significantly higher than that in the sham stimulation group (−2.773 ± 3.7 32 ms, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Occipital rTMS treatment can enhance the early therapeutic effect and effectively improve the pre-attentive processing of patients with depression and provide a scientific basis for the new target of rTMS therapy in clinical patients with depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Essential tremor (ET) is a highly prevalent neurological disorder characterized by action-induced tremors involving the hand, voice, head, and/or face. Importantly, hand tremor is present in nearly all forms of ET, resulting in impaired fine motor skills and diminished quality of life. To advance early diagnostic approaches for ET, automated handwriting tasks and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer an opportunity to develop early essential clinical biomarkers. In this study, we present a novel approach for the early clinical diagnosis and monitoring of ET based on integrating handwriting and neuroimaging analysis. We demonstrate how the analysis of fine motor skills, as measured by an automated Archimedes’ spiral task, is correlated with neuroimaging biomarkers for ET. Together, we present a novel modeling approach that can serve as a complementary and promising support tool for the clinical diagnosis of ET and a large range of tremors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ocular activity is known to be sensitive to variations in mental workload, and recent studies have successfully related the distribution of eye fixations to the mental load. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of the spatial distribution of fixations as a measure of mental workload and its sensitivity to different types of demands imposed by the task: mental, temporal, and physical. To test the research hypothesis, two experimental studies were run: Experiment 1 evaluated the sensitivity of an index of spatial distribution (Nearest Neighbor Index; NNI) to changes in workload. A sample of 30 participants participated in a within-subject design with different types of task demands (mental, temporal, physical) applied to Tetris game; Experiment 2 investigated the accuracy of the index through the analysis of 1-min epochs during the execution of a visual-spatial task (the “spot the differences” puzzle game). Additionally, NNI was compared to a better-known ocular mental workload index, the entropy rate. The data analysis showed a relation between the NNI and the different workload levels imposed by the tasks. In particular: Experiment 1 demonstrated that increased difficulty, due to higher temporal demand, led to a more dispersed pattern with respect to the baseline, whereas the mental demand led to a more grouped pattern of fixations with respect to the baseline; Experiment 2 indicated that the entropy rate and the NNI show a similar pattern over time, indicating high mental workload after the first minute of activity. That suggests that NNI highlights the greater presence of fixation groups and, accordingly, the entropy indicates a more regular and orderly scanpath. Both indices are sensitive to changes in workload and they seem to anticipate the drop in performance. However, the entropy rate is limited by the use of the areas of interest, making it impossible to apply it in dynamic contexts. Conversely, NNI works with the entire scanpath and it shows sensitivity to different types of task demands. These results confirm the NNI as a measure applicable to different contexts and its potential use as a trigger in adaptive systems implemented in high-risk settings, such as control rooms and transportation systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, ripples 80–250 Hz, fast ripples 250–500 Hz) are biomarkers of epileptic tissue. They are most commonly observed over areas generating seizures and increase in occurrence during the ictal compared to the interictal period. It has been hypothesized that their rate correlates with the severity of epilepsy and seizure in affected individuals. In the present study, it was aimed to investigate whether the HFO count mirrors the observed behavioral seizure severity using a kainate rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizures were selected during the chronic epilepsy phase of this model and classified by behavioral severity according to the Racine scale. Seizures with Racine scale 5&amp;amp;6 were considered generalized and severe. HFOs were marked in 24 seizures during a preictal, ictal, and postictal EEG segment. The duration covered by the HFO during these different segments was analyzed and compared between mild and severe seizures. HFOs were significantly increased during ictal periods (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and significantly decreased during postictal periods (p &amp;lt; 0.03) compared to the ictal segment. Ictal ripples (p = 0.04) as well as fast ripples (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in severe seizures compared to mild seizures. The present study demonstrates that ictal HFO occurrence mirrors seizure severity in a chronic focal epilepsy model in rats. This is similar to recent observations in patients with refractory mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, postictal HFO decrease might reflect postictal inhibition of epileptic activity. Overall results provide additional evidence that HFOs can be used as biomarkers for measuring seizure severity in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Illusions give intriguing insights into perceptual and neural dynamics. In the auditory continuity illusion, two brief tones separated by a silent gap may be heard as one continuous tone if a noise burst with appropriate characteristics fills the gap. This illusion probes the conditions under which listeners link related sounds across time and maintain perceptual continuity in the face of sudden changes in sound mixtures. Conceptual explanations of this illusion have been proposed, but its neural basis is still being investigated. In this work we provide a dynamical systems framework, grounded in principles of neural dynamics, to explain the continuity illusion. We construct an idealized firing rate model of a neural population and analyze the conditions under which firing rate responses persist during the interruption between the two tones. First, we show that sustained inputs and hysteresis dynamics (a mismatch between tone levels needed to activate and inactivate the population) can produce continuous responses. Second, we show that transient inputs and bistable dynamics (coexistence of two stable firing rate levels) can also produce continuous responses. Finally, we combine these input types together to obtain neural dynamics consistent with two requirements for the continuity illusion as articulated in a well-known theory of auditory scene analysis: responses persist through the noise-filled gap if noise provides sufficient evidence that the tone continues and if there is no evidence of discontinuities between the tones and noise. By grounding these notions in a quantitative model that incorporates elements of neural circuits (recurrent excitation, and mutual inhibition, specifically), we identify plausible mechanisms for the continuity illusion. Our findings can help guide future studies of neural correlates of this illusion and inform development of more biophysically-based models of the auditory continuity illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The microbiota plays important roles in host metabolism and immunity, and its disruption affects adult brain physiology and behavior. Although such findings have been attributed to altered neurodevelopment, few studies have actually examined microbiota effects on the developing brain. This review focuses on developmental effects of the earliest exposure to microbes. At birth, the mammalian fetus enters a world teeming with microbes which colonize all body sites in contact with the environment. Bacteria reach the gut within a few hours of birth and cause a measurable response in the intestinal epithelium. In adults, the gut microbiota signals to the brain via the vagus nerve, bacterial metabolites, hormones, and immune signaling, and work in perinatal rodents is beginning to elucidate which of these signaling pathways herald the very first encounter with gut microbes in the neonate. Neural effects of the microbiota during the first few days of life include changes in neuronal cell death, microglia, and brain cytokine levels. In addition to these effects of direct exposure of the newborn to microbes, accumulating evidence points to a role for the maternal microbiota in affecting brain development via bacterial molecules and metabolites while the offspring is still in utero. Hence, perturbations to microbial exposure perinatally, such as through C-section delivery or antibiotic treatment, alter microbiota colonization and may have long-term neural consequences. The perinatal period is critical for brain development and a close look at microbiota effects during this time promises to reveal the earliest, most primary effects of the microbiota on neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The striatum participates in numerous important behaviors. Its principal projection neurons use GABA and peptides as neurotransmitters and interact extensively with interneurons, including cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) that are tonically active. Dissecting the interactions between projection neurons and ChIs is important for uncovering the role and mechanisms of the striatal microcircuits. Here, by combining several optogenetic tools with cell type-specific electrophysiological recordings, we uncovered direct electrical coupling between D1-type projection neurons and ChIs, in addition to the chemical transmission between these two major cell types. Optogenetic stimulation or inhibition led to bilateral current exchanges between D1 neurons and ChIs, which can be abolished by gap junction blockers. We further confirmed the presence of gap junctions through paired electrophysiological recordings and dye microinjections. Finally, we found that activating D1 neurons promotes basal activity of ChIs via gap junctions. Collectively, these results reveal the coexistence of the chemical synapse and gap junctions between D1 neurons and ChIs, which contributes to maintaining the tonically active firing patterns of ChIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the most common neurological diseases. However, the impact of ischemic stroke on human cerebral tissue remains largely unknown due to a lack of ischemic human brain samples. In this study, we applied cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to evaluate the effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Pathway analysis showed the relationships between vitamin digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, and complement and coagulation cascades. Combinational verification with transcriptome and gene expression analysis of different cell types revealed fatty acids-related PPAR signaling pathway and pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) as key markers of neuronal cells in response to OGD/R. These findings suggest that, although there remain some limitations to be improved, our ischemic stroke model using human cerebral organoids would be a potentially useful tool when combined with other conventional two-dimensional (2D) mono-culture systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Early life stress has profound effects on the development of the central nervous system. We exposed 9-day-old rat pups to a 24 h maternal deprivation (MD) and sacrificed them as young adults (60-day-old), with the aim to study the effects of early stress on forebrain circuitry. We estimated numbers of various immunohistochemically defined interneuron subpopulations in several neocortical regions and in the hippocampus. MD rats showed reduced numbers of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex, compared with controls. Numbers of reelin-expressing and calretinin-expressing interneurons were also reduced in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas, but unaltered in the neocortex of MD rats. The number of calbinin-expressing interneurons in the neocortex was similar in the MD rats compared with controls. We analyzed cell death in 15-day-old rats after MD and found no difference compared to control rats. Thus, our results more likely reflect the downregulation of markers than the actual loss of interneurons. To investigate synaptic activity in the hippocampus we immunostained for glutamatergic and inhibitory vesicular transporters. The number of inhibitory synapses was decreased in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in MD rats, with the normal number of excitatory synapses. Our results indicate complex, cell type-specific, and region-specific alterations in the inhibitory circuitry induced by maternal deprivation. Such alterations may underlie symptoms of MD at the behavioral level and possibly contribute to mechanisms by which early life stress causes neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is a severe cerebrovascular disease with high mortality and morbidity. In recent years, reperfusion treatments based on thrombolytic and thrombectomy are major managements for ischemic stroke patients, and the recanalization time window has been extended to over 24 h. However, with the extension of the time window, the risk of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury following reperfusion therapy becomes a big challenge for patient outcomes. I/R injury leads to neuronal death due to the imbalance in metabolic supply and demand, which is usually related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitophagy is a type of selective autophagy referring to the process of specific autophagic elimination of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria to prevent the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent cell death. Recent advances have implicated the protective role of mitophagy in cerebral ischemia is mainly associated with its neuroprotective effects in I/R injury. This review discusses the involvement of mitochondria dynamics and mitophagy in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and I/R injury in particular, focusing on the therapeutic potential of mitophagy regulation and the possibility of using mitophagy-related interventions as an adjunctive approach for neuroprotective time window extension after ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms. Recent studies examining the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the AD phenotype have demonstrated a significant influence on both inflammation and cognition. However, different studies on the effect of high-fat diet on AD pathology have reported conflicting conclusions. To explore the involvement of HFD in AD, we investigated phenotypic and metabolic changes in an AD mouse model in response to HFD. The results indicated there was no significant effect on Aβ levels or contextual memory due to HFD treatment. Of note, HFD did moderate neuroinflammation, despite spurring inflammation and increasing cholesterol levels in the periphery. In addition, diet affected gut microbiota symbiosis, altering the production of bacterial metabolites. HFD created a favorable microenvironment for bile acid alteration and arachidonic acid metabolism in APP/PS1 mice, which may be related to the observed improvement in LXR/PPAR expression. Our previous research demonstrated that Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) significantly ameliorated impaired learning and memory. Furthermore, HLJDD may globally suppress inflammation and lipid accumulation to relieve cognitive impairment after HFD intervention. It was difficult to define the effect of HFD on AD progression because the results were influenced by confounding factors and biases. Although there was still obvious damage in AD mice treated with HFD, there was no deterioration and there was even a slight remission of neuroinflammation.

 &lt;p&gt;MAP2K5, a member of the MAPK family, is associated with central nervous system disorders. However, neural functional of Map2k5 from animal models were not well examined so far. Here, we established a Map2k5-targeted knockout mouse model to investigate the behavior phenotypes and its underlying molecular mechanism. Our results showed that female Map2k5 mutant mice manifested decreased circadian-dependent ambulatory locomotion, coordination, and fatigue. Male Map2k5 mutant mice displayed impairment in open field exploration and prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response (ASR) when compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, Map2k5 mutant mice showed a decreased dopaminergic cell survival and tyrosine hydroxylase levels in nigrostriatal pathway, indicating a crucial role of MAP2K5 in regulating dopamine system in the central nervous system. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating that Map2k5 mutant mice displayed phenotypes by disturbing the dopamine system in the central nervous system, implicating Map2k5 mutant mouse as a promising model for many dopamine related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Chromosome 4q deletion is one of the most frequently detected genomic imbalance events in congenital heart disease (CHD) patients. However, a portion of CHD-associated 4q deletions without known CHD genes suggests unknown CHD genes within these intervals. Here, we have shown that knockdown of &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt;, a 4q interval gene, disrupted sarcomeric integrity of cardiomyocytes and caused reduced cardiomyocyte number in human embryonic stem cell differentiation model. Molecular analyses revealed decreased expression of second heart field (SHF) marker genes and impaired NOTCH and SHH signaling in &lt;i&gt;SORBS2-&lt;/i&gt;knockdown cells. Exogenous SHH rescued &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt; knockdown-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation defects. &lt;i&gt;Sorbs2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse mutants had atrial septal hypoplasia/aplasia or double atrial septum (DAS) derived from impaired posterior SHF with a similar expression alteration. Rare &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt; variants were significantly enriched in a cohort of 300 CHD patients. Our findings indicate that &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt; is a regulator of SHF development and its variants contribute to CHD pathogenesis. The presence of DAS in &lt;i&gt;Sorbs2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; hearts reveals the first molecular etiology of this rare anomaly linked to paradoxical thromboembolism.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Precise and efficient insertion of large DNA fragments into somatic cells using gene editing technologies to label or modify endogenous proteins remains challenging. Non-specific insertions/deletions (INDELs) resulting from the non-homologous end joining pathway make the process error-prone. Further, the insert is not readily removable. Here, we describe a method called &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;CRISP&lt;/span&gt;R-mediated &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;nsertion of &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;xon (CRISPIE) that can precisely and reversibly label endogenous proteins using CRISPR/Cas9-based editing. CRISPIE inserts a designer donor module, which consists of an exon encoding the protein sequence flanked by intron sequences, into an intronic location in the target gene. INDELs at the insertion junction will be spliced out, leaving mRNAs nearly error-free. We used CRISPIE to fluorescently label endogenous proteins in mammalian neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; with previously unachieved efficiency. We demonstrate that this method is broadly applicable, and that the insert can be readily removed later. CRISPIE permits protein sequence insertion with high fidelity, efficiency, and flexibility.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Intracellular density impacts the physical nature of the cytoplasm and can globally affect cellular processes, yet density regulation remains poorly understood. Here, using a new quantitative phase imaging method, we determined that dry-mass density in fission yeast is maintained in a narrow distribution and exhibits homeostatic behavior. However, density varied during the cell cycle, decreasing during G2, increasing in mitosis and cytokinesis, and dropping rapidly at cell birth. These density variations were explained by a constant rate of biomass synthesis, coupled to slowdown of volume growth during cell division and rapid expansion post-cytokinesis. Arrest at specific cell-cycle stages exacerbated density changes. Spatially heterogeneous patterns of density suggested links between density regulation, tip growth, and intracellular osmotic pressure. Our results demonstrate that systematic density variations during the cell cycle are predominantly due to modulation of volume expansion, and reveal functional consequences of density gradients and cell-cycle arrests.</content>

		<content type="html">
 3D eukaryotic genome organization provides the structural basis for gene regulation. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, genome folding is characterized by somatic homolog pairing, where homologous chromosomes are intimately paired from end to end; however, how homologs identify one another and pair has remained mysterious. Recently, this process has been proposed to be driven by specifically interacting 'buttons' encoded along chromosomes. Here, we turned this hypothesis into a quantitative biophysical model to demonstrate that a button-based mechanism can lead to chromosome-wide pairing. We tested our model using live-imaging measurements of chromosomal loci tagged with the MS2 and PP7 nascent RNA labeling systems. We show solid agreement between model predictions and experiments in the pairing dynamics of individual homologous loci. Our results strongly support a button-based mechanism of somatic homolog pairing in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and provide a theoretical framework for revealing the molecular identity and regulation of buttons.</content>

 Diverse subtypes of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) display a wide spectrum of histomorphologies, proteogenomic alterations, immune cell infiltration patterns, and clinical behavior. Delineating the cells of origin for different RCC subtypes will provide mechanistic insights into their diverse pathobiology. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to develop benign and...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/A1KeQXAAtik&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Large-scale tissue deformation during biological processes such as morphogenesis requires cellular rearrangements. The simplest rearrangement in confluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells, called a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must execute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion molecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time compared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this idea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1 transitions, which we call the “T1 delay time”. We study how variations in T1 delay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of tissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based timescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show that the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale collective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two. We extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent extension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1 delay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and rosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a more elastic-like—and less fluid-like—tissue response. Our work suggests that molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen global tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6fEXLvSFyso&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Divisive normalization (DN) is a prominent computational building block in the brain that has been proposed as a canonical cortical operation. Numerous experimental studies have verified its importance for capturing nonlinear neural response properties to simple, artificial stimuli, and computational studies suggest that DN is also an important component for processing natural stimuli. However, we lack quantitative models of DN that are directly informed by measurements of spiking responses in the brain and applicable to arbitrary stimuli. Here, we propose a DN model that is applicable to arbitrary input images. We test its ability to predict how neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) respond to natural images, with a focus on nonlinear response properties within the classical receptive field. Our model consists of one layer of subunits followed by learned orientation-specific DN. It outperforms linear-nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations and makes a significant step towards the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Unlike deep CNNs, our compact DN model offers a direct interpretation of the nature of normalization. By inspecting the learned normalization pool of our model, we gained insights into a long-standing question about the tuning properties of DN that update the current textbook description: we found that within the receptive field oriented features were normalized preferentially by features with similar orientation rather than non-specifically as currently assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YVhoXxf95tQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Adaptive cognitive-control involves a hierarchical cortico-striatal gating system that supports selective updating, maintenance, and retrieval of useful cognitive and motor information. Here, we developed a task that independently manipulates selective gating operations into working-memory (input gating), from working-memory (output gating), and of responses (motor gating) and tested the neural dynamics and computational principles that support them. Increases in gating demands, captured by gate switches, were expressed by distinct EEG correlates at each gating level that evolved dynamically in partially overlapping time windows. Further, categorical representations of specific maintained items and of motor responses could be decoded from EEG when the corresponding gate was switching, thereby linking gating operations to prioritization. Finally, gate switching at all levels was related to increases in the motor decision threshold as quantified by the drift diffusion model. Together these results support the notion that cognitive gating operations scaffold on top of mechanisms involved in motor gating.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v7U_RTY-wRA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The purinergic 2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor expressed in satellite glial cells (SGCs) is involved in the inflammatory response, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) participates in the process of neurogenic inflammation, such as that in diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) and peripheral neuralgia. The main purpose of this study was to explore the role of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in DNP hypersensitivity mediated by TRPV1 in the rat and its possible mechanism. A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related neuropathic pain (NPP) named the DNP rat model was established in this study. The mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of DNP rats were increased after intrathecal injection of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist A438079, and the mRNA and protein levels of TRPV1 in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were decreased in DNP rats treated with A438079 compared to untreated DNP rats; in addition, A438079 also decreased the phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the DNP group. Based on these results, the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor might be involved in DNP mediated by TRPV1.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;With the arrival of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the challenges arising from Big Data, neuromorphic chip concepts are seen as key solutions for coping with the massive amount of unstructured data streams by moving the computation closer to the sensors, the so-called “edge computing.” Augmenting these chips with emerging memory technologies enables these edge devices with non-volatile and adaptive properties which are desirable for low power and online learning operations. However, an energy- and area-efficient realization of these systems requires disruptive hardware changes. Memristor-based solutions for these concepts are in the focus of research and industry due to their low-power and high-density online learning potential. Specifically, the filamentary-type valence change mechanism (VCM memories) have shown to be a promising candidate In consequence, physical models capturing a broad spectrum of experimentally observed features such as the pronounced cycle-to-cycle (c2c) and device-to-device (d2d) variability are required for accurate evaluation of the proposed concepts. In this study, we present an in-depth experimental analysis of d2d and c2c variability of filamentary-type bipolar switching HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nano-sized crossbar devices and match the experimentally observed variabilities to our physically motivated JART VCM compact model. Based on this approach, we evaluate the concept of parallel operation of devices as a synapse both experimentally and theoretically. These parallel synapses form a synaptic array which is at the core of neuromorphic chips. We exploit the c2c variability of these devices for stochastic online learning which has shown to increase the effective bit precision of the devices. Finally, we demonstrate that stochastic switching features for a pattern classification task that can be employed in an online learning neural network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy, electrical stimulation from intracranial electrodes is frequently used for the localization of seizure onset zones and related pathological networks. The ability of electrically stimulated tissue to generate beta and gamma range oscillations, called rapid-discharges, is a frequent indication of an epileptogenic zone. However, a limit of intracranial stimulation is the fixed physical location and number of implanted electrodes, leaving numerous clinically and functionally relevant brain regions unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an alternative technique relying exclusively on non-penetrating surface electrodes, namely an orientation-tunable form of temporally interfering (TI) electric fields to target the CA3 of the mouse hippocampus which focally evokes seizure-like events (SLEs) having the characteristic frequencies of rapid-discharges, but without the necessity of the implanted electrodes. The orientation of the topical electrodes with respect to the orientation of the hippocampus is demonstrated to strongly control the threshold for evoking SLEs. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of Pulse-width-modulation of square waves as an alternative to sine waves for TI stimulation. An orientation-dependent analysis of classic implanted electrodes to evoke SLEs in the hippocampus is subsequently utilized to support the results of the minimally invasive temporally interfering fields. The principles of orientation-tunable TI stimulation seen here can be generally applicable in a wide range of other excitable tissues and brain regions, overcoming several limitations of fixed electrodes which penetrate tissue and overcoming several limitations of other non-invasive stimulation methods in epilepsy, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) coupled to robotic assistive devices have shown promise for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. However, little has been reported that compares the clinical and physiological effects of a BCI intervention for upper limb stroke rehabilitation with those of conventional therapy. This study assesses the feasibility of an intervention with a BCI based on electroencephalography (EEG) coupled to a robotic hand orthosis for upper limb stroke rehabilitation and compares its outcomes to conventional therapy. Seven subacute and three chronic stroke patients (M = 59.9 ± 12.8) with severe upper limb impairment were recruited in a crossover feasibility study to receive 1 month of BCI therapy and 1 month of conventional therapy in random order. The outcome measures were comprised of: Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), hand dynamometry, and EEG. Additionally, BCI performance and user experience were measured. All measurements were acquired before and after each intervention. FMA-UE and ARAT after BCI (23.1 ± 16; 8.4 ± 10) and after conventional therapy (21.9 ± 15; 8.7 ± 11) were significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.017) compared to baseline (17.5 ± 15; 4.3 ± 6) but were similar between therapies (p &amp;gt; 0.017). Via TMS, corticospinal tract integrity could be assessed in the affected hemisphere of three patients at baseline, in five after BCI, and four after conventional therapy. While no significant difference (p &amp;gt; 0.05) was found in patients’ affected hand strength, it was higher after the BCI therapy. EEG cortical activations were significantly higher over motor and non-motor regions after both therapies (p &amp;lt; 0.017). System performance increased across BCI sessions, from 54 (50, 70%) to 72% (56, 83%). Patients reported moderate mental workloads and excellent usability with the BCI. Outcome measurements implied that a BCI intervention using a robotic hand orthosis as feedback has the potential to elicit neuroplasticity-related mechanisms, similar to those observed during conventional therapy, even in a group of severely impaired stroke patients. Therefore, the proposed BCI system could be a suitable therapy option and will be further assessed in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The presence of iron is an important factor for normal brain functions, whereas excessive deposition of iron may impair normal cognitive function in the brain and lead to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). MRI has been widely applied to characterize brain structural and functional changes caused by AD. However, the effectiveness of using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for the analysis of brain iron deposition is still unclear, especially within the context of early AD diagnosis. Thus, in this study, we aim to explore the relationship between brain iron deposition measured by SWI with the progression of AD using various feature selection and classification methods. The proposed model was evaluated on a 69-subject SWI imaging dataset consisting of 24 AD patients, 21 mild cognitive impairment patients, and 24 normal controls. The identified AD progression-related regions were then compared with the regions reported from previous genetic association studies, and we observed considerable overlap between these two. Further, we have identified a new potential AD-related gene (MEF2C) closely related to the interaction between iron deposition and AD progression in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;With the development of electrical stimulation technology, traditional transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) technology has been found to have the drawback of not targeting a specific area accurately. Studies have shown that optimizing the number and position of electrodes during electrical stimulation has a very good effect on enhancing brain stimulation accuracy. At present, an increasing number of laboratories have begun to optimize tACS. However, there has been no study summarizing the optimization methods of tACS. Determining whether different optimization methods are effective and the optimization approach could provide information that could guide future tACS research. We describe the results of recent research on tACS optimization and integrate the optimization approaches of tACS in recent research. Optimization approaches can be classified into two groups: high-definition electrical stimulation and interference modulation electrical stimulation. The optimization methods can be divided into five categories: high-definition tACS, phase-shifted tACS, amplitude-modulated tACS, the temporally interfering (TI) method, and the intersectional short pulse (ISP) method. Finally, we summarize the latest research on hardware useful for tACS improvement and outline future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;An expansion of the corticothalamic transfer function into eigenmodes and resonant poles is used to derive a simple formula for evoked response potentials (ERPs) in various states of arousal. The transfer function corresponds to the cortical response to an external stimulus, which encodes all the information and properties of the linear system. This approach links experimental observations of resonances and characteristic timescales in brain activity with physically based neural field theory (NFT). The present work greatly simplifies the formula of the analytical ERP, and separates its spatial part (eigenmodes) from the temporal part (poles). Within this framework, calculations involve contour integrations that yield an explicit expression for ERPs. The dominant global mode is considered explicitly in more detail to study how the ERP varies with time in this mode and to illustrate the method. For each arousal state in sleep and wake, the resonances of the system are determined and it is found that five poles are sufficient to study the main dynamics of the system in waking eyes-open and eyes-closed states. Similarly, it is shown that six poles suffice to reproduce ERPs in rapid-eye movement sleep, sleep state 1, and sleep state 2 states, whereas just four poles suffice to reproduce the dynamics in slow wave sleep. Thus, six poles are sufficient to preserve the main global ERP dynamics of the system for all states of arousal. These six poles correspond to the dominant resonances of the system at slow-wave, alpha, and beta frequencies. These results provide the basis for simplified analytic treatment of brain dynamics and link observations more closely to theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The nature of phonological representations has been extensively studied in phonology and psycholinguistics. While full specification is still the norm in psycholinguistic research, underspecified representations may better account for perceptual asymmetries. In this paper, we report on a mismatch negativity (MMN) study with Dutch listeners who took part in a passive oddball paradigm to investigate when the brain notices the difference between expected and observed vowels. In particular, we tested neural discrimination (indicating perceptual discrimination) of the tense mid vowel pairs /o/-/ø/ (place contrast), /e/-/ø/ (labiality or rounding contrast), and /e/-/o/ (place and labiality contrast). Our results show (a) a perceptual asymmetry for place in the /o/-/ø/ contrast, supporting underspecification of [CORONAL] and replicating earlier results for German, and (b) a perceptual asymmetry for labiality for the /e/-/ø/ contrast, which was not reported in the German study. A labial deviant [ø] (standard /e/) yielded a larger MMN than a deviant [e] (standard /ø/). No asymmetry was found for the two-feature contrast. This study partly replicates a similar MMN study on German vowels, and partly presents new findings indicating cross-linguistic differences. Although the vowel inventory of Dutch and German is to a large extent comparable, their (morpho)phonological systems are different, which is reflected in processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain–computer interface (BCI) has developed rapidly over the past two decades, mainly due to advancements in machine learning. Subjects must learn to modulate their brain activities to ensure a successful BCI. Feedback training is a practical approach to this learning process; however, the commonly used classifier-dependent approaches have inherent limitations such as the need for calibration and a lack of continuous feedback over long periods of time. This paper proposes an online data visualization feedback protocol that intuitively reflects the EEG distribution in Riemannian geometry in real time. Rather than learning a hyperplane, the Riemannian geometry formulation allows iterative learning of prototypical covariance matrices that are translated into visualized feedback through diffusion map process. Ten subjects were recruited for MI-BCI (motor imagery-BCI) training experiments. The subjects learned to modulate their sensorimotor rhythm to centralize the points within one category and to separate points belonging to different categories. The results show favorable overall training effects in terms of the class distinctiveness and EEG feature discriminancy over a 3-day training with 30% learners. A steadily increased class distinctiveness in the last three sessions suggests that the advanced training protocol is effective. The optimal frequency band was consistent during the 3-day training, and the difference between subjects with good or low MI-BCI performance could be clearly observed. We believe that the proposed feedback protocol has promising application prospect.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The apparent stochastic nature of neuronal activity significantly affects the reliability of neuronal coding. To quantify the encountered fluctuations, both in neural data and simulations, the notions of variability and randomness of inter-spike intervals have been proposed and studied. In this article we focus on the concept of the instantaneous firing rate, which is also based on the spike timing. We use several classical statistical models of neuronal activity and we study the corresponding probability distributions of the instantaneous firing rate. To characterize the firing rate variability and randomness under different spiking regimes, we use different indices of statistical dispersion. We find that the relationship between the variability of interspike intervals and the instantaneous firing rate is not straightforward in general. Counter-intuitively, an increase in the randomness (based on entropy) of spike times may either decrease or increase the randomness of instantaneous firing rate, in dependence on the neuronal firing model. Finally, we apply our methods to experimental data, establishing that instantaneous rate analysis can indeed provide additional information about the spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests that in vitro neural networks created from dissociated neurons may be used for computing and performing machine learning tasks. To develop a better artificial intelligent system, a hybrid bio-silicon computer is worth exploring, but its performance is still inferior to that of a silicon-based computer. One reason may be that a living neural network has many intrinsic properties, such as random network connectivity, high network sparsity, and large neural and synaptic variability. These properties may lead to new design considerations, and existing algorithms need to be adjusted for living neural network implementation. This work investigates the impact of neural variations and random connections on inference with learning algorithms. A two-layer hybrid bio-silicon platform is constructed and a five-step design method is proposed for the fast development of living neural network algorithms. Neural variations and dynamics are verified by fitting model parameters with biological experimental results. Random connections are generated under different connection probabilities to vary network sparsity. A multi-layer perceptron algorithm is tested with biological constraints on the MNIST dataset. The results show that a reasonable inference accuracy can be achieved despite the presence of neural variations and random network connections. A new adaptive pre-processing technique is proposed to ensure good learning accuracy with different living neural network sparsity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) must adapt to several environmental challenges including microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and isolation while performing highly controlled movements with complex equipment. Head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) is an analog used to study spaceflight factors including body unloading and headward fluid shifts. We recently reported how HDBR with elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) affects visuomotor adaptation. Here we expand upon this work and examine the effects of HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on brain activity during visuomotor adaptation. Eleven participants (34 ± 8 years) completed six functional MRI (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post-HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. During fMRI, participants completed a visuomotor adaptation task, divided into baseline, early, late and de-adaptation. Additionally, we compare brain activity between this NASA campaign (30-day HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a different campaign with a separate set of participants (60-day HDBR with normal atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, n = 8; 34.25 ± 7.9 years) to characterize the specific effects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Participants were included by convenience. During early adaptation across the HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intervention, participants showed decreasing activation in temporal and subcortical brain regions, followed by post- HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recovery. During late adaptation, participants showed increasing activation in the right fusiform gyrus and right caudate nucleus during HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; this activation normalized to baseline levels after bed rest. There were no correlations between brain changes and adaptation performance changes from pre- to post HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, there were no statistically significant differences between the HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group and the HDBR controls, suggesting that changes in brain activity were due primarily to bed rest rather than elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Five HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; participants presented with optic disc edema, a sign of Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). An exploratory analysis of HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; participants with and without signs of SANS revealed no group differences in brain activity during any phase of the adaptation task. Overall, these findings have implications for spaceflight missions and training, as ISS missions require individuals to adapt to altered sensory inputs over long periods in space. Further, this is the first study to verify the HDBR and elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effects on the neural correlates of visuomotor adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem nucleus, is the primary source of the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) in the brain. The LC receives input from widespread brain regions, and projects throughout the forebrain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. LC neurons release NE to control arousal, but also in the context of a variety of sensory-motor and behavioral functions. Despite its brain-wide effects, much about the role of LC-NE in behavior and the circuits controlling LC activity is unknown. New evidence suggests that the modular input-output organization of the LC could enable transient, task-specific modulation of distinct brain regions. Future work must further assess whether this spatial modularity coincides with functional differences in LC-NE subpopulations acting at specific times, and how such spatiotemporal specificity might influence learned behaviors. Here, we summarize the state of the field and present new ideas on the role of LC-NE in learned behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Astroglia display a wide range of spontaneous and behavioral state-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. During heightened vigilance, noradrenergic signaling leads to quasi-synchronous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations encompassing soma and processes across the brain-wide astroglia network. Distinct from this vigilance-associated global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rise are apparently spontaneous fluctuations within spatially restricted microdomains. Over the years, several strategies have been pursued to shed light on the physiological impact of these signals including deletion of endogenous ion channels or receptors and reduction of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through buffering, extrusion or inhibition of release. Some experiments that revealed the most compelling behavioral alterations employed chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations to modify astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. However, there is considerable contrast between these findings and the comparatively modest effects of inhibiting endogenous sources of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this review, we describe the underlying mechanisms of various forms of astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling as well as the functional consequences of their inhibition. We then discuss how the effects of exogenous astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modification combined with our knowledge of physiological mechanisms of astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activation could guide further refinement of behavioral paradigms that will help elucidate the natural Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent function of astroglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The glial cells astrocytes have long been recognized as important neuron-supporting elements in brain development, homeostasis, and metabolism. After the discovery that the reciprocal communication between astrocytes and neurons is a fundamental mechanism in the modulation of neuronal synaptic communication, over the last two decades astrocytes became a hot topic in neuroscience research. Crucial to their functional interactions with neurons are the cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations that mediate gliotransmission. Large attention has been posed to the so-called Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;microdomains, dynamic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; changes spatially restricted to fine astrocytic processes including perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs). With presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic neuronal membranes, PAPs compose the tripartite synapse. The distinct spatial-temporal features and functional roles of astrocyte microdomain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity remain poorly defined. However, thanks to the development of genetically encoded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicators (GECIs), advanced microscopy techniques, and innovative analytical approaches, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in astrocyte microdomains were recently studied in unprecedented detail. These events have been observed to occur much more frequently (∼50–100-fold) and dynamically than somatic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations with mechanisms that likely involve both IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent and -independent pathways. Further progress aimed to clarify the complex, dynamic machinery responsible for astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity at microdomains is a crucial step in our understanding of the astrocyte role in brain function and may also reveal astrocytes as novel therapeutic targets for different brain diseases. Here, we review the most recent studies that improve our mechanistic understanding of the essential features of astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomains.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Intraventricular penetration is rare in glioblastoma (GBM). Whether the ependymal region including the ependyma and subventricular zone (SVZ) can prevent GBM invasion remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and haematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining were performed to evaluate the size and anatomical locations of GBM. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between tumor-ependyma contact, ventricle penetration and clinical characteristics. Cell migration and invasion were assessed via Transwell assays and an orthotopic transplantation model.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Among 357 patients with GBM, the majority (66%) showed ependymal region contact, and 34 patients (10%) showed ventricle penetration of GBM. GBM cells were spread along the ependyma in the orthotopic transplantation model. The longest tumor diameter was an independent risk factor for GBM-ependymal region contact, as demonstrated by univariate (OR = 1.706, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and multivariate logistic regression analyses (OR = 1.767, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), but was not associated with ventricle penetration. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could significantly induce tumor cell migration (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and GBM could grow in CSF. Compared with those from the cortex, cells from the ependymal region attenuated the invasion of C6 whether cocultured with C6 or mixed with Matrigel (p = 0.0054 and p = 0.0488). Immunofluorescence analysis shows a thin gap with GFAP expression delimiting the tumor and ependymal region.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The ependymal region might restrict GBM cells from entering the ventricle via a non-mechanical force. Further studies in this area may reveal mechanisms that occur in GBM patients and may enable the design of new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) continue to be the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability in the U.S., Europe, and in endemic areas, such as the Western Cape region of South Africa. Arithmetic is highly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to play a critical role in number processing. In this study, we investigate whether smaller IPS volumes play a role in the number-processing deficits observed in children with PAE. Participants were 52 9- to 14-year-old children from a historically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, who are participating in our ongoing studies on the effects of PAE on the brain. The IPS was manually parcellated into its medial (MIPS) and lateral (LIPS) walls on magnetic resonance images. The study aimed to examine: (1) the effects of PAE on IPS regional volumes and asymmetry, (2) whether IPS regional volumes are related to number processing performance and, if so, whether these relations are moderated by PAE and (3) potential mediation by regional IPS volumes of the relation between PAE and number processing performance. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was associated with volumes in all regions except the right LIPS. Both left MIPS and left LIPS volumes were significantly smaller in children in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (PFAS) group compared to controls. The finding in the left LIPS remained significant after controlling for potential confounders and after adjustment for the smaller overall brain size of the children in the FAS/PFAS group. Smaller left LIPS volumes in the FAS/PFAS group may account for the absence of left-right asymmetry in the LIPS in children with FAS/PFAS compared to controls and nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) children. Bilaterally, larger MIPS volumes were associated with better WISC IQ Arithmetic scores. These effects, however, were not moderated by the degree of PAE, and regional IPS volumes did not mediate the effect of PAE on WISC Arithmetic scores. Although we found that certain regions of the IPS were smaller in children with FAS and PFAS, these PAE-induced changes in IPS volume did not mediate the alcohol-related deficits in arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Acute medical illnesses, surgical interventions, or admissions to hospital in older individuals are frequently associated with a delirium. In this cohort study, we investigated the impact of specific cognitive domains and depression before the occurrence of delirium symptoms in an 8-year observation of older non-hospitalized individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In total, we included 807 participants (48–83 years). Deficits in specific cognitive domains were measured using the CERAD test battery, and depressive symptoms were measured using Beck Depression Inventory and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) before the onset of a delirium. Delirium symptoms were retrospectively assessed by a questionnaire based on the established Nursing Delirium Screening Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Fifty-eight of eight hundred seven participants (7.2%) reported delirium symptoms over the 8-year course of the study. Sixty-nine percent (n = 40) of reported delirium symptoms were related to surgeries. In multivariate regression analysis, impaired executive function was an independent risk factor (p = 0.034) for the occurrence of delirium symptoms. Furthermore, age (p = 0.014), comorbidities [captured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)] (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and depression (p = 0.012) were significantly associated with reported delirium symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Especially prior to elective surgery or medical interventions, screening for impaired executive function and depression could be helpful to identify patients who are at risk to develop delirium symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) frequently occurs in the elderly as a severe postoperative complication and is characterized by a decline in cognitive function that impairs memory, attention, and other cognitive domains. Currently, the exact pathogenic mechanism of PND is multifaceted and remains unclear. The glymphatic system is a newly discovered glial-dependent perivascular network that subserves a pseudo-lymphatic function in the brain. Recent studies have highlighted the significant role of the glymphatic system in the removal of harmful metabolites in the brain. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system can reduce metabolic waste removal, leading to neuroinflammation and neurological disorders. We speculate that there is a causal relationship between the glymphatic system and symptomatic progression in PND. This paper reviews the current literature on the glymphatic system and some perioperative factors to discuss the role of the glymphatic system in PND.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in geriatric population. At present, no effective treatments exist to reverse the progress of AD, however, early diagnosis and intervention might delay its progression. The search for biomarkers with good safety, repeatable detection, reliable sensitivity and community application is necessary for AD screening and early diagnosis and timely intervention. Electroencephalogram (EEG) examination is a non-invasive, quantitative, reproducible, and cost-effective technique which is suitable for screening large population for possible AD. The power spectrum, complexity and synchronization characteristics of EEG waveforms in AD patients have distinct deviation from normal elderly, indicating these EEG features can be a promising candidate biomarker of AD. However, current reported deviation results are inconsistent, possibly due to multiple factors such as diagnostic criteria, sample sizes and the use of different computational measures. In this study, we collected two neurological tests scores (MMSE and MoCA) and the resting-state EEG of 30 normal control elderly subjects (NC group) and 30 probable AD patients confirmed by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) inspection (AD group). We calculated the power spectrum, spectral entropy and phase synchronization index features of these two groups’ EEG at left/right frontal, temporal, central and occipital brain regions in 4 frequency bands: δ oscillation (1–4 Hz), θ oscillation (4–8 Hz), α oscillation (8–13 Hz), and β oscillation (13–30 Hz). In most brain areas, we found that the AD group had significant differences compared to NC group: (1) decreased α oscillation power and increased θ oscillation power; (2) decreased spectral entropy in α oscillation and elevated spectral entropy in β oscillation; and (3) decrease phase synchronization index in δ, θ, and β oscillation. We also found that α oscillation spectral power and β oscillation phase synchronization index correlated well with the MMSE/MoCA test scores in AD groups. Our study suggests that these two EEG features might be useful metrics for population screening of probable AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to be an early biomarker in human cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between BBB breakdown and brain pathology, most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease, is still poorly understood. The present study measured human BBB function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients on 2 molecular scales, specifically BBB's permeability to water and albumin molecules.


Methods
Fifty‐five elderly participants were enrolled, including 33 MCI patients and 22 controls. BBB permeability to water was measured with a new magnetic resonance imaging technique, water extraction with phase contrast arterial spin tagging. BBB permeability to albumin was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio. Cognitive performance was assessed by domain‐specific composite scores. AD pathology (including CSF Aβ and ptau) and vascular risk factors were examined.


Results
Compared to cognitively normal subjects, BBB in MCI patients manifested an increased permeability to small molecules such as water but was no more permeable to large molecules such as albumin. BBB permeability to water was found to be related to AD markers of CSF Aβ and ptau. On the other hand, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolemia, but was not related to AD pathology. BBB permeability to small molecules, but not to large molecules, was found to be predictive of cognitive function.


Interpretation
These findings provide early evidence that BBB breakdown is related to both AD and vascular risks, but their effects can be differentiated by spatial scales. BBB permeability to small molecules has a greater impact on cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Postmortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Abstract
The wide variety of cell types and their biophysical complexities pose a challenge in our ability to understand oscillatory activities produced by cellular‐based computational network models. This challenge stems from their high‐dimensional and multiparametric natures. To overcome this, we implement a solution by linking minimal and detailed models of CA1 microcircuits that generate intrahippocampal (3–12 Hz) theta rhythms. We leverage insights from minimal models to guide explorations of more detailed models and obtain a cellular perspective of theta generation. Our findings distinguish the pyramidal cells as the theta rhythm initiators and reveal that their activity is regularized by the inhibitory cell populations, supporting a proposed hypothesis of an “inhibition‐based tuning” mechanism. We find a strong correlation between input current to the pyramidal cells and the resulting local field potential theta frequency, indicating that intrinsic pyramidal cell properties underpin network frequency characteristics. This work provides a cellular‐based foundation from which in vivo theta activities can be explored.</content>

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical regulators of cellular function acting via heterotrimeric G proteins as their primary transducers with individual GPCRs capable of pleiotropic coupling to multiple G proteins. Structural features governing G protein selectivity and promiscuity are currently unclear. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of the cholecystokinin (CCK) type 1 receptor (CCK1R) bound to the CCK peptide agonist, CCK-8 and 2 distinct transducer proteins, its primary transducer Gq, and the more weakly coupled Gs. As seen with other Gq/11–GPCR complexes, the Gq–α5 helix (αH5) bound to a relatively narrow pocket in the CCK1R core. Surprisingly, the backbone of the CCK1R and volume of the G protein binding pocket were essentially equivalent when Gs was bound, with the Gs αH5 displaying a conformation that arises from “unwinding” of the far carboxyl-terminal residues, compared to canonically Gs coupled receptors. Thus, integrated changes in the conformations of both the receptor and G protein are likely to play critical roles in the promiscuous coupling of individual GPCRs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pYiyanK0KHY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) complex are heterogeneous and vary in dendritic morphology, cell shape, spine and axon presence, soma size, and orientation to surrounding fibers. An example of 7, Golgi‐stained neurons with five primary dendrites and their location (inset) in this composite sagittal section illustrates a spectrum of dendritic arbors and these other features. Arrows point to the direction of fibers in the TRN. Greatest soma length (L) is indicated. Neurons in the inset, enlarged views of neurons, and enclosed boxes are coded with similar colors.







Abstract
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical structure influencing information transfer to the forebrain. In crocodilians, the TRN shares many features with its mammalian counterpart. One area that has not been explored is how individual neurons in the crocodilian TRN compare with those found in mammals. In mammals, TRN neurons are aligned parallel to the external border of the dorsal thalamus, have their dendrites oriented perpendicular to the fibers in the internal capsule, have fine, filamentous dendritic appendages, are either bipolar or multipolar, and are commonly considered to be a homogeneous morphological population of cells. To investigate the cellular morphology of the TRN complex, a Golgi analysis was undertaken in Alligator mississippiensis. This study examined features that have been used in mammals. In Alligator, the four TRN divisions are the dorsal peduncular nucleus, the perireticular nucleus, the interstitial nucleus, and the neurons in the medial forebrain bundle associated with the interstitial nucleus. In crocodilians, the dorsal peduncular nucleus is homologous to the TRN of mammals. From the 1787 drawn neuron profiles in the traditional three planes of section, the following were concluded. First, neurons in each part of the TRN complex in Alligator were similar in morphology. Second, each part of the TRN complex of Alligator contained a heterogenous population of cells. These variations between the cellular morphology of the dorsal peduncular nucleus of crocodilians and the TRN of mammals are speculated to partly result from differences in forebrain organization.</content>

 Abstract
Research innovation that leads to discovery in the battle against neurological disease and disorders requires diverse ideas. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National Institutes of Health's 27 institutes and centers, strives to reduce the burden of neurological disease and disorders. The National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke is very interested in increasing the diversity of researchers by addressing the existing barriers responsible for the low numbers of underrepresented populations from traditionally minority‐serving institutions (MSIs) and non‐minority serving institutions (non‐MSIs). This commentary provides insight on the persistent underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities entering neuroscience research careers paths, focusing on multiples levels within the scientific academy and the supportive role that both MSIs and non‐MSIs play in increasing diversity in the biomedical research workforce.</content>

 Comparison of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial activity in neuronal membrane systems. In the last years, literature reports that the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) machinery is expressed not only on the inner mitochondrial membrane but also on other membranous structures. In order to highlight the similarities and differences between these two entities, in this work, we compared the activity of mitochondrial OxPhos with that expressed in isolated myelin and rod outer segments.

Abstract
The nervous system displays high energy consumption, apparently not fulfilled by mitochondria, which are underrepresented therein. The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity, a mitochondrial process that aerobically provides ATP, has also been reported also in the myelin sheath and the rod outer segment (OS) disks. Thus, commonalities and differences between the extra‐mitochondrial and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism were evaluated in bovine isolated myelin (IM), rod OS, and mitochondria‐enriched fractions (MIT). The subcellular fraction quality and the absence of contamination fractions have been estimated by western blot analysis. Oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were stimulated by conventional (pyruvate + malate or succinate) and unconventional (NADH) substrates, observing that oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis by IM and rod OS are more efficient than by MIT, in the presence of both kinds of respiratory substrates. Mitochondria did not utilize NADH as a respiring substrate. When ATP synthesis by either sample was assayed in the presence of 10–100 µM ATP in the assay medium, only in IM and OS it was not inhibited, suggesting that the ATP exportation by the mitochondria is limited by extravesicular ATP concentration. Interestingly, IM and OS but not mitochondria appear able to synthesize ATP at a later time with respect to exposure to respiratory substrates, supporting the hypothesis that the proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain is buffered by membrane phospholipids. The putative transfer mode of the OxPhos molecular machinery from mitochondria to the extra‐mitochondrial structures is also discussed, opening new perspectives in the field of neurophysiology.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Most neural networks need to predefine the network architecture empirically, which may cause over-fitting or under-fitting. Besides, a large number of parameters in a fully connected network leads to the prohibitively expensive computational cost and storage overhead, which makes the model hard to be deployed on mobile devices. Dynamically optimizing the network architecture by pruning unused synapses is a promising technique for solving this problem. Most existing pruning methods focus on reducing the redundancy of deep convolutional neural networks by pruning unimportant filters or weights, at the cost of accuracy drop. In this paper, we propose an effective brain-inspired synaptic pruning method to dynamically modulate the network architecture and simultaneously improve network performance. The proposed model is biologically inspired as it dynamically eliminates redundant connections based on the synaptic pruning rules used during the brain's development. Connections are pruned if they are not activated or less activated multiple times consecutively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on classification tasks of different complexity with the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Experimental results reveal that even for a compact network, the proposed method can also remove up to 59–90% of the connections, with relative improvement in learning speed and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Use of chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin is associated with painful peripheral neuropathy that is exacerbated by cold. Remodeling of ion channels including TRP channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contribute to the sensory hypersensitivity following oxaliplatin treatment in animal models. However, it has not been studied if TRP channels and membrane depolarization of DRG neurons serve as the initial ionic/membrane drives (such as within an hour) that contribute to the development of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the current study, we studied in mice (1) in vitro acute effects of oxaliplatin on the membrane excitability of IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations of DRG neurons using a perforated patch clamping, (2) the preventative effects of a membrane-hyperpolarizing drug retigabine on oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, and (3) the preventative effects of TRP channel antagonists on the oxaliplatin-induced membrane hyperexcitability and sensory hypersensitivity. We found (1) IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations of small DRG neurons displayed previously undiscovered, substantially different membrane excitability, (2) oxaliplatin selectively depolarized IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons, (3) pretreatment of retigabine largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, (4) antagonists of TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels prevented oxaliplatin-induced membrane depolarization, and (5) the antagonist of TRPM8 largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity. These results suggest that oxaliplatin depolarizes IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons through TRPM8 channels to drive the development of neuropathic pain and targeting the initial drives of TRPM8 and/or membrane depolarization may prevent oxaliplatin-induce neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In most mammals, retinal ganglion cell axons from each retina project to both sides of the brain. The segregation of ipsi and contralateral projections into eye-specific territories in their main brain targets—the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus—is critical for the processing of visual information. The investigation of the developmental mechanisms contributing to the wiring of this binocular map in mammals identified competitive mechanisms between axons from each retina while interactions between axons from the same eye were challenging to explore. Studies in vertebrates lacking ipsilateral retinal projections demonstrated that competitive mechanisms also exist between axons from the same eye. The development of a genetic approach enabling the differential manipulation and labeling of neighboring retinal ganglion cells in a single mouse retina revealed that binocular map development does not only rely on axon competition but also involves a cooperative interplay between axons to stabilize their terminal branches. These recent insights into the developmental mechanisms shaping retinal axon connectivity in the brain will be discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study explored the effects of septal glutamatergic transmission on septal-hippocampal theta activity via intraseptal microinjection of antagonist at AMPA receptors (AMPAR). The current results showed that microinjection of AMPAR antagonist, NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione, 20 μg/μl, 0.5 μl), evoked a decrease in the frequency of theta activity evoked by various means in anesthetized and behaving rat. Theta wave activity was induced on: (a) intraseptal microinjection of carbachol, an agonist at cholinergic receptors, (b) reticular stimulation, (c) exploration in novel open field (OF), and (d) hind paw (HP) injection of the algogen, formalin. The effect on frequency in the formalin test was observed in an early period on injection of formalin, which was novel to the animal, but not in the later more sustained phase of the formalin test. The effect of NBQX, being seen in both anesthetized and behaving animals, suggests that the modulation of theta wave frequency, including in novelty, is a function of AMPAR in MS. The effect of the antagonist on theta power was less apparent, being observed only in anesthetized animals. In addition to theta power and frequency, intraseptal NBQX also attenuated suppression of CA1 population spike (PS) induced by intraseptal carbachol, thus suggesting that septal glutamate neurotransmission is involved in the spectrum of MS-mediated network responses. Indeed, in the context of behavior, formalin injection induced an increase in the level of septal glutamate, while NBQX attenuated nociceptive behaviors. Notably, MS is involved in the modulation of formalin nociception. These findings suggest that AMPA receptors are a key modulator of septal physiological function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The fine processes of single astrocytes can contact many thousands of synapses whose function they can modulate through bi-directional signaling. The spatial arrangement of astrocytic processes and neuronal structures is relevant for such interactions and for the support of neuronal signaling by astrocytes. At the same time, the geometry of perisynaptic astrocyte processes is variable and dynamically regulated. Studying these fine astrocyte processes represents a technical challenge, because many of them cannot be fully resolved by diffraction-limited microscopy. Therefore, we have established two indirect parameters of astrocyte morphology, which, while not fully resolving local geometry by design, provide statistical measures of astrocyte morphology: the fraction of tissue volume that astrocytes occupy and the density of resolvable astrocytic processes. Both are straightforward to obtain using widely available microscopy techniques. We here present the approach and demonstrate its robustness across various experimental conditions using mainly two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy in acute slices and in vivo as well as modeling. Using these indirect measures allowed us to analyze the morphology of relatively large populations of astrocytes. Doing so we captured the heterogeneity of astrocytes within and between the layers of the hippocampal CA1 region and the developmental profile of astrocyte morphology. This demonstrates that volume fraction (VF) and segment density are useful parameters for describing the structure of astrocytes. They are also suitable for online monitoring of astrocyte morphology with widely available microscopy techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of choline alfoscerate (CA) on hearing amplification in patients with age related hearing loss, we performed a prospective case-control observational study from March 2016 to September 2020. We assessed patients with bilateral word recognition score (WRS) &amp;lt;50% using monosyllabic words. The patients were 65–85 years old, without any history of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, parkinsonism, or depression. After enrollment, all patients started using hearing aids (HA). The CA group received a daily dose of 800 mg CA for 11 months. We performed between-group comparisons of audiological data, including pure tone audiometry, WRS, HA fitting data obtained using real-ear measurement (REM), and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid benefit scores after treatment. After CA administration, the WRS improved significantly in the CA group (4.2 ± 8.3%), but deteriorated in the control group (−0.6 ± 8.1%, p = 0.035). However, there was no significant between-group difference in the change in pure tone thresholds and aided speech intelligibility index calculated from REM. These findings suggest that the difference in WRS was relevant to central speech understanding rather than peripheral audibility. Therefore, administering oral CA could effectively enrich listening comprehension in older HA users.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Balance and gait impairments, and consequently, mobility restrictions and falls are common in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Various cognitive deficits are also common in PD and are associated with increased fall risk. These mobility and cognitive deficits are limiting factors in a person’s health, ability to perform activities of daily living, and overall quality of life. Community ambulation involves many dual-task (DT) conditions that require processing of several cognitive tasks while managing or reacting to sudden or unexpected balance challenges. DT training programs that can simultaneously target balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive functions are important to consider in rehabilitation and promotion of healthy active lives. In the proposed multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT), novel behavioral positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging methods are used to evaluate the molecular basis and neural underpinnings of: (a) the decline of mobility function in PD, specifically, balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive function, and (b) the effects of an engaging, game-based DT treadmill walking program on mobility and cognitive functions. Both the interactive cognitive game tasks and treadmill walking require continuous visual attention, and share spatial processing functions, notably to minimize any balance disturbance or gait deviation/stumble. The ability to “walk and talk” normally includes activation of specific regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basal ganglia (site of degeneration in PD). The PET imaging analysis and comparison with healthy age-matched controls will allow us to identify areas of abnormal, reduced activity levels, as well as areas of excessive activity (increased attentional resources) during DT-walking. We will then be able to identify areas of brain plasticity associated with improvements in mobility functions (balance, gait, and cognition) after intervention. We expect the gait-cognitive training effect to involve re-organization of PFC activity among other, yet to be identified brain regions. The DT mobility-training platform and behavioral PET brain imaging methods are directly applicable to other diseases that affect gait and cognition, e.g., cognitive vascular impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Hypertension is a risk factor for AD, but the effects of hypertension on Aβ deposition are not fully determined. Considering peripheral Aβ closely relates to Aβ deposition in the brain, we investigated the relationships between blood pressure (BP) level and plasma Aβ concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-thousand and sixty-nine participants (age above 45) from a village in the suburbs of Xi’an, China were enrolled. Questionnaires and validated Chinese versions of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to collect information about vascular risk factors and assess cognition function. The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was detected using PCR and sequencing. Plasma Aβ levels were measured using ELISA. The associations between BP and plasma Aβ levels were analyzed by using multivariate linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; level was higher in high BP group than that in normal BP group (53.34 ± 8.50 pg/ml vs. 51.98 ± 8.96 pg/ml, P = 0.013), in high SBP group than that in normal SBP group (53.68 ± 8.69 pg/ml vs. 51.88 ± 8.80 pg/ml, P = 0.001) and in high MABP group than that in normal MABP group (54.05 ± 8.78 pg/ml vs. 52.04 ± 8.75 pg/ml, P = 0.001). After controlling for the confounding factors, SBP (b = 0.078, P &amp;lt; 0.001), DBP (b = 0.090, P = 0.008) and MABP (b = 0.104, P &amp;lt; 0.001) correlated with plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; level positively in ApoE ε4 non-carriers, but not ApoE ε4 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Elevated BP levels were associated with increased plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; levels in middle-aged and elderly ApoE ε4 non-carriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Classic reinforcement learning (RL) theories cannot explain human behavior in the absence of external reward or when the environment changes. Here, we employ a deep sequential decision-making paradigm with sparse reward and abrupt environmental changes. To explain the behavior of human participants in these environments, we show that RL theories need to include surprise and novelty, each with a distinct role. While novelty drives exploration before the first encounter of a reward, surprise increases the rate of learning of a world-model as well as of model-free action-values. Even though the world-model is available for model-based RL, we find that human decisions are dominated by model-free action choices. The world-model is only marginally used for planning, but it is important to detect surprising events. Our theory predicts human action choices with high probability and allows us to dissociate surprise, novelty, and reward in EEG signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XynWQ8GORzc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Recently, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in human diseases, indicating that miRNAs might be a potential pathogenic factor for various diseases. Therefore, figuring out the relationship between miRNAs and diseases plays a critical role in not only the development of new drugs, but also the formulation of individualized diagnosis and treatment. As the prediction of miRNA-disease association via biological experiments is expensive and time-consuming, computational methods have a positive effect on revealing the association. In this study, a novel prediction model integrating GCN, CNN and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (GCSENet) was constructed for the identification of miRNA-disease association. The model first captured features by GCN based on a heterogeneous graph including diseases, genes and miRNAs. Then, considering the different effects of genes on each type of miRNA and disease, as well as the different effects of the miRNA-gene and disease-gene relationships on miRNA-disease association, a feature weight was set and a combination of miRNA-gene and disease-gene associations was added as feature input for the convolution operation in CNN. Furthermore, the squeeze and excitation blocks of SENet were applied to determine the importance of each feature channel and enhance useful features by means of the attention mechanism, thus achieving a satisfactory prediction of miRNA-disease association. The proposed method was compared against other state-of-the-art methods. It achieved an AUROC score of 95.02% and an AUPR score of 95.55% in a 10-fold cross-validation, which led to the finding that the proposed method is superior to these popular methods on most of the performance evaluation indexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bSi9U-j4N0Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genomic DNA is packaged in chromatin, a dynamic fiber variable in size and compaction. In chromatin, repeating nucleosome units wrap 145–147 DNA basepairs around histone proteins. Genetic and epigenetic regulation of genes relies on structural transitions in chromatin which are driven by intra- and inter-nucleosome dynamics and modulated by chemical modifications of the unstructured terminal tails of histones. Here we demonstrate how the interplay between histone H3 and H2A tails control ample nucleosome breathing motions. We monitored large openings of two genomic nucleosomes, and only moderate breathing of an engineered nucleosome in atomistic molecular simulations amounting to 24 μs. Transitions between open and closed nucleosome conformations were mediated by the displacement and changes in compaction of the two histone tails. These motions involved changes in the DNA interaction profiles of clusters of epigenetic regulatory aminoacids in the tails. Removing the histone tails resulted in a large increase of the amplitude of nucleosome breathing but did not change the sequence dependent pattern of the motions. Histone tail modulated nucleosome breathing is a key mechanism of chromatin dynamics with important implications for epigenetic regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rBnNLN6ARqA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Beef is the most resource intensive of all commonly used food items. Disproportionate synthetic fertilizer use during beef production propels a vigorous one-way factory-to-ocean nutrient flux, which alternative agriculture models strive to rectify by enhancing in-farm biogeochemical cycling. Livestock, especially cattle, are central to these models, which advocates describe as the context most likely to overcome beef’s environmental liabilities. Yet the dietary potential of such models is currently poorly known. Here, I thus ask whether nitrogen-sparing agriculture (NSA) can offer a viable alternative to the current US food system. Focusing on the most common eutrophication-causing element, N, I devise a specific model of mixed-use NSA comprising numerous small farms producing human plant-based food and forage, the latter feeding a core intensive beef operation that forgoes synthetic fertilizer and relies only on locally produced manure and N fixers. Assuming the model is deployed throughout the high-quality, precipitation-rich US cropland (delimiting approximately 100 million ha, less than half of today’s agricultural land use) and neglecting potential macroeconomic obstacles to wide deployment, I find that NSA could produce a diverse, high-quality nationwide diet distinctly better than today’s mean US diet. The model also permits 70%–80% of today’s beef consumption, raises today’s protein delivery by 5%–40%, and averts approximately 60% of today’s fertilizer use and approximately 10% of today’s total greenhouse gas emissions. As defined here, NSA is thus potentially a viable, scalable environmentally superior alternative to the current US food system, but only when combined with the commitment to substantially enhance our reliance on plant food.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YBfN0hYrX1E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke with cancer.


Methods
We conducted a prospective cross‐sectional study from 2016 to 2020 at 2 hospitals. We enrolled 3 groups of 50 adult participants each. The main group included patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. The control groups included patients with acute ischemic stroke only or active cancer only. The patients with stroke‐only and patients with cancer‐only were matched to the patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke by age, sex, and cancer type, if applicable. The outcomes were prespecified hematological biomarkers and transcranial Doppler microemboli detection. Hematological biomarkers included markers of coagulation (D‐dimer and thrombin‐antithrombin), platelet function (P‐selectin), and endothelial integrity (thrombomodulin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 [sICAM‐1], and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 [sVCAM‐1]). Hematological biomarkers were compared between groups using the Kruskal‐Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum tests. In multivariable linear regression models, we adjusted for race, number of stroke risk factors, smoking, stroke severity, and antithrombotic use. Transcranial Doppler microemboli presence was compared between groups using chi‐square tests.


Results
Levels of all study biomarkers were different between groups. In univariate between‐group comparisons, patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke had higher levels of D‐dimer, sICAM‐1, sVCAM‐1, and thrombomodulin than both control groups; higher levels of thrombin‐antithrombin than patients with cancer‐only; and higher levels of P‐selectin than patients with stroke‐only. Findings were similar in multivariable analyses. Transcranial Doppler microemboli were detected in 32% of patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke, 16% of patients with stroke‐only, and 6% of patients with cancer‐only (p = 0.005).


Interpretation
Patients with cancer‐related stroke have higher markers of coagulation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction, and more circulating microemboli, than matched controls. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus (HIPP) are two key brain regions associated with pain and pain-related affective processing. However, whether and how pelvic pain alters the neural activity and connectivity of the ACC and HIPP under baseline and during social pain, and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with electrophysiology and biochemistry, we show that pelvic pain, particularly, primary dysmenorrhea (PDM), causes an increase in the functional connectivity between ACC and HIPP in resting-state fMRI, and a smaller reduction in connectivity during social exclusion in PDM females with periovulatory phase. Similarly, model rats demonstrate significantly increased ACC-HIPP synchronization in the gamma band, associating with reduced modulation by ACC-theta on HIPP-gamma and increased levels of receptor proteins and excitation. This study brings together human fMRI and animal research and enables improved therapeutic strategies for ameliorating pain and pain-related affective processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synapse degeneration in the striatum has been associated with the early stages of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases (PD and HD). However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger synaptic dysfunction and loss are not fully understood. Increasing evidence suggests that deficiency in Wnt signaling triggers synapse degeneration in the adult brain and that this pathway is affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous Wnt signaling is essential for the integrity of a subset of inhibitory synapses on striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We found that inducible expression of the specific Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) in the adult striatum leads to the loss of inhibitory synapses on MSNs and affects the synaptic transmission of D2-MSNs. We also discovered that re-activation of the Wnt pathway by turning off Dkk1 expression after substantial loss of synapses resulted in the complete recovery of GABAergic and dopamine synapse number. Our results also show that re-activation of the Wnt pathway leads to a recovery of amphetamine response and motor function. Our studies identify the Wnt signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for restoring neuronal circuits after synapse degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of synaptic plasticity differ in distinct local circuits. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) at apical dendrites in stratum radiatum and basal dendrites in stratum oriens involve different molecular cascades. For instance, participation of nitric oxide in LTP induction was shown to be necessary only for apical dendrites. This phenomenon may play a key role in information processing in CA1, and one of the reasons for this difference may be differing synaptic characteristics in these regions. Here, we compared the synaptic responses to stimulation of apical and basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons and found a difference in the current–voltage characteristics of these inputs, which is presumably due to a distinct contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors to synaptic transmission. In addition, we obtained data that indicate the presence of these receptors in pyramidal dendrites in both stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. We also demonstrated that inhibition of NO synthase reduced the contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors at apical but not basal dendrites, and inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase did not affect this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodevelopment in humans is a long, elaborate, and highly coordinated process involving three trimesters of prenatal development followed by decades of postnatal development and maturation. Throughout this period, the brain is highly sensitive and responsive to the external environment, which may provide a range of inputs leading to positive or negative outcomes. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Although the molecular mechanisms of FASD are not fully characterized, they involve alterations to the regulation of gene expression via epigenetic marks. As in the prenatal stages, the postnatal period of neurodevelopment is also sensitive to environmental inputs. Often this sensitivity is reflected in children facing adverse conditions, such as maternal separation. This exposure to early life stress (ELS) is implicated in the manifestation of various behavioral abnormalities. Most FASD research has focused exclusively on the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure in isolation. Here, we review the research into the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure and ELS, with a focus on the continuum of epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations. Interestingly, a select few experiments have assessed the cumulative effect of prenatal alcohol and postnatal maternal separation stress. Regulatory regions of different sets of genes are affected by both treatments independently, and a unique set of genes are affected by the combination of treatments. Notably, epigenetic and gene expression changes converge at the clustered protocadherin locus and oxidative stress pathway. Functional studies using epigenetic editing may elucidate individual contributions of regulatory regions for hub genes and further profiling efforts may lead to the development of non-invasive methods to identify children at risk. Taken together, the results favor the potential to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes by epigenetic management of children born with FASD using favorable postnatal conditions with or without therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;It is well established that CNS axons fail to regenerate, undergo retrograde dieback, and form dystrophic growth cones due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We sought to investigate the role of axonal mitochondria in the axonal response to injury. A viral vector (AAV) containing a mitochondrially targeted fluorescent protein (mitoDsRed) as well as fluorescently tagged LC3 (GFP-LC3), an autophagosomal marker, was injected into the primary motor cortex, to label the corticospinal tract (CST), of adult rats. The axons of the CST were then injured by dorsal column lesion at C4-C5. We found that mitochondria in injured CST axons near the injury site are fragmented and fragmentation of mitochondria persists for 2 weeks before returning to pre-injury lengths. Fragmented mitochondria have consistently been shown to be dysfunctional and detrimental to cellular health. Inhibition of Drp1, the GTPase responsible for mitochondrial fission, using a specific pharmacological inhibitor (mDivi-1) blocked fragmentation. Additionally, it was determined that there is increased mitophagy in CST axons following Spinal cord injury (SCI) based on increased colocalization of mitochondria and LC3. In vitro models revealed that mitochondrial divalent ion uptake is necessary for injury-induced mitochondrial fission, as inhibiting the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) using RU360 prevented injury-induced fission. This phenomenon was also observed in vivo. These studies indicate that following the injury, both in vivo and in vitro, axonal mitochondria undergo increased fission, which may contribute to the lack of regeneration seen in CNS neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurite atrophy with loss of neuronal polarity is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. While there is substantial agreement that disruption of intracellular vesicle trafficking is associated with axonal pathology in AD, comparatively less is known regarding its role in dendritic atrophy. This is a significant gap of knowledge because, unlike axons, dendrites are endowed with the complete endomembrane system comprising endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi apparatus, post-Golgi vesicles, and a recycling-degradative route. In this study, using live-imaging of pGOLT-expressing vesicles, indicative of Golgi outposts and satellites, we investigate how amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers affect the trafficking of Golgi-like organelles in the different dendritic compartments of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We found that short-term (4 h) treatment with Aβ led to a decrease in anterograde trafficking of Golgi vesicles in dendrites of both resting and stimulated (with 50 mM KCl) neurons. We also characterized the ability of mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic tetracyclic antidepressant (NaSSA), to rescue Golgi dynamics in dendrites. Mirtazapine treatment (10 μM) increased the number and both anterograde and retrograde motility, reducing the percentage of static Golgi vesicles. Finally, mirtazapine reverted the neurite atrophy induced by 24 h treatment with Aβ oligomers, suggesting that this drug is able to counteract the effects of Aβ by improving the dendritic trafficking of Golgi-related vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;SK, HCN, and M channels are medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP)-mediating ion channels. The three channels co-express in various brain regions, and their collective action strongly influences cellular excitability. However, significant diversity exists in the expression of channel isoforms in distinct brain regions and various subcellular compartments, which contributes to an equally diverse set of specific neuronal functions. The current review emphasizes the collective behavior of the three classes of mAHP channels and discusses how these channels function together although they play specialized roles. We discuss the biophysical properties of these channels, signaling pathways that influence the activity of the three mAHP channels, various chemical modulators that alter channel activity and their therapeutic potential in treating various neurological anomalies. Additionally, we discuss the role of mAHP channels in the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases and how their modulation can alleviate some of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the formation of multifocal demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulation of innate receptors has been shown to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS-like disease in mice. Specifically, targeting Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and NOD-like receptor 2 (NOD2) significantly reduced disease severity. In the present work we have developed a novel focal EAE model to further study the effect of innate signaling on demyelinating pathology. Focal lesions were induced by stereotactic needle insertion into the corpus callosum (CC) of mice previously immunized for EAE. This resulted in focal pathology characterized by infiltration and demyelination in the CC. We find that intrathecal delivery of MIS416, a TLR9 and NOD2 bispecific innate ligand, into the cerebrospinal fluid reduced focal lesions in the CC. This was associated with upregulation of type I and II interferons, interleukin-10, arginase-1, CCL-2 and CXCL-10. Analysis of draining cervical lymph nodes showed upregulation of type II interferons and interleukin 10. Moreover, intrathecal MIS416 altered the composition of early CNS infiltrates, increasing proportions of myeloid and NK cells and reducing T cells at the lesion site. This study contributes to an increased understanding of how innate immune responses can play a protective role, which in turn may lead to additional therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of demyelinating pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;At present, lots of studies have tried to apply machine learning to different electroencephalography (EEG) measures for diagnosing schizophrenia (SZ) patients. However, most EEG measures previously used are either a univariate measure or a single type of brain connectivity, which may not fully capture the abnormal brain changes of SZ patients. In this paper, event-related potentials were collected from 45 SZ patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) during a learning task, and then a combination of partial directed coherence (PDC) effective and phase lag index (PLI) functional connectivity were used as features to train a support vector machine classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation for classification of SZ from HCs. Our results indicated that an excellent classification performance (accuracy = 95.16%, specificity = 94.44%, and sensitivity = 96.15%) was obtained when the combination of functional and effective connectivity features was used, and the corresponding optimal feature number was 15, which included 12 PDC and three PLI connectivity features. The selected effective connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal/central and visual/parietal lobes, and the selected functional connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal and visual cortexes of the right hemisphere. In addition, most of the selected effective connectivity abnormally enhanced in SZ patients compared with HCs, whereas all the selected functional connectivity features decreased in SZ patients. The above results showed that our proposed method has great potential to become a tool for the auxiliary diagnosis of SZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;To extract texture features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of patients with brain tumors and use them to train a classification model for supporting an early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Two groups of regions (control and tumor) were selected from MRI scans of 40 patients with meningioma or glioma. These regions were analyzed to obtain texture features. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 20.0), including the Shapiro–Wilk test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which were used to test significant differences in each feature between the tumor and healthy regions. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was used to visualize the data distribution so as to avoid tumor selection bias. The Gini impurity index in random forests (RFs) was used to select the top five out of all features. Based on the five features, three classification models were built respectively with three machine learning classifiers: RF, support vector machine (SVM), and back propagation (BP) neural network.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Sixteen of the 25 features were significantly different between the tumor and healthy areas. Through the Gini impurity index in RFs, standard deviation, first-order moment, variance, third-order absolute moment, and third-order central moment were selected to build the classification model. The classification model trained using the SVM classifier achieved the best performance, with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of 94.04%, 92.3%, and 0.932, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Texture analysis with an SVM classifier can help differentiate between brain tumor and healthy areas with high speed and accuracy, which would facilitate its clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accurate neuron morphologies are paramount for computational model simulations of realistic neural responses. Over the last decade, the online repository NeuroMorpho.Org has collected over 140,000 available neuron morphologies to understand brain function and promote interaction between experimental and computational research. Neuron morphologies describe spatial aspects of neural structure; however, many of the available morphologies do not contain accurate diameters that are essential for computational simulations of electrical activity. To best utilize available neuron morphologies, we present a set of equations that predict dendritic diameter from other morphological features. To derive the equations, we used a set of NeuroMorpho.org archives with realistic neuron diameters, representing hippocampal pyramidal, cerebellar Purkinje, and striatal spiny projection neurons. Each morphology is separated into initial, branching children, and continuing nodes. Our analysis reveals that the diameter of preceding nodes, Parent Diameter, is correlated to diameter of subsequent nodes for all cell types. Branching children and initial nodes each required additional morphological features to predict diameter, such as path length to soma, total dendritic length, and longest path to terminal end. Model simulations reveal that membrane potential response with predicted diameters is similar to the original response for several tested morphologies. We provide our open source software to extend the utility of available NeuroMorpho.org morphologies, and suggest predictive equations may supplement morphologies that lack dendritic diameter and improve model simulations with realistic dendritic diameter.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This article extends a recent methodological workflow for creating realistic and computationally efficient neuron models whilst capturing essential aspects of single-neuron dynamics. We overcome the intrinsic limitations of the extant optimization methods by proposing an alternative optimization component based on multimodal algorithms. This approach can natively explore a diverse population of neuron model configurations. In contrast to methods that focus on a single global optimum, the multimodal method allows directly obtaining a set of promising solutions for a single but complex multi-feature objective function. The final sparse population of candidate solutions has to be analyzed and evaluated according to the biological plausibility and their objective to the target features by the expert. In order to illustrate the value of this approach, we base our proposal on the optimization of cerebellar granule cell (GrC) models that replicate the essential properties of the biological cell. Our results show the emerging variability of plausible sets of values that this type of neuron can adopt underlying complex spiking characteristics. Also, the set of selected cerebellar GrC models captured spiking dynamics closer to the reference model than the single model obtained with off-the-shelf parameter optimization algorithms used in our previous article. The method hereby proposed represents a valuable strategy for adjusting a varied population of realistic and simplified neuron models. It can be applied to other kinds of neuron models and biological contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Holometabolic organisms undergo extensive remodelling of their neuromuscular system during metamorphosis. Relatively, little is known whether or not the embryonic guidance of molecules and axonal growth mechanisms are re-activated for the innervation of a very different set of adult muscles. Here, we show that the axonal attractant Sidestep (Side) is re-expressed during Drosophila metamorphosis and is indispensable for neuromuscular wiring. Mutations in side cause severe innervation defects in all legs. Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) show a reduced density or are completely absent at multi-fibre muscles. Misinnervation strongly impedes, but does not completely abolish motor behaviours, including walking, flying, or grooming. Overexpression of Side in developing muscles induces similar innervation defects; for example, at indirect flight muscles, it causes flightlessness. Since muscle-specific overexpression of Side is unlikely to affect the central circuits, the resulting phenotypes seem to correlate with faulty muscle wiring. We further show that mutations in beaten path Ia (beat), a receptor for Side, results in similar weaker adult innervation and locomotion phenotypes, indicating that embryonic guidance pathways seem to be reactivated during metamorphosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Bacterial meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges which covers and protects the brain and the spinal cord. Such inflammation is mostly caused by blood-borne bacteria that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and finally invade the brain parenchyma. Pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae are the main etiological causes of bacterial meningitis. After trafficking across the BBB, bacterial pathogens in the brain interact with neurons, the fundamental units of Central Nervous System, and other types of glial cells. Although the specific molecular mechanism behind the interaction between such pathogens with neurons is still under investigation, it is clear that bacterial interaction with neurons and neuroinflammatory responses within the brain leads to neuronal cell death. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown indications of meningitis-caused dementia; and a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease are characterized by the loss of neurons, which, unlike many other eukaryotic cells, once dead or damaged, they are seldom replaced. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the knowledge on how bacterial pathogens in the brain damage neurons through direct and indirect interactions, and how the neuronal damage caused by bacterial pathogen can, in the long-term, influence the onset of neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Altered structure, expression, and regulation of the presynaptic serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) have been associated with multiple neurobehavioral disorders, including mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Opportunities to investigate mechanistic links supporting these associations were spurred with the identification of multiple, rare human SERT coding variants in a study that established a male-specific linkage of ASD to a linkage marker on chromosome 17 which encompassed the location of the SERT gene (SLC6A4). We have explored the most common of these variants, SERT Ala56, in vitro and in vivo. Results support a tonic elevation of 5-HT transport activity in transfected cells and human lymphoblasts by the variant in vitro that leads to an increased 5-HT clearance rate in vivo when studied in the SERT Ala56 mouse model, along with altered sensitivity to SERT regulatory signaling pathways. Importantly, hyperserotonemia, or an elevated whole blood 5-HT, level, was found in SERT Ala56 mice, reproducing a well-replicated trait observed in a significant fraction of ASD subjects. Additionally, we found multiple biochemical, physiological, and behavioral alterations in the SERT Ala56 mice that can be analogized to those observed in ASD and its medical comorbidities. The similarity of the functional impact of the SERT Ala56 variant to the consequences of p38α MAPK activation, ascribed to the induction of a biased conformation of the transporter toward an outward-facing conformation, has resulted in successful efforts to restore normal behavioral and bowel function via pharmacological and genetic p38α MAPK targeting. Moreover, the ability of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β to enhance SERT activity via a p38α MAPK-dependent pathway suggests that the SERT Ala56 conformation mimics that of a chronic inflammatory state, supporting findings in ASD of elevated inflammatory cytokine levels. In this report, we review studies of the SERT Ala56 variant, discussing opportunities for continued insight into how chronically altered synaptic 5-HT homeostasis can drive reversible, functional perturbations in 5-HT sensitive pathways in the brain and periphery, and how targeting the SERT regulome, particularly through activating pathways such as those involving IL-1β/p38α MAPK, may be of benefit for neurobehavioral disorders, including ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Administration of 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA) has been demonstrated to alleviate infarction following ischemic stroke. Reportedly, the main effect of AUDA is exerting anti-inflammation and neovascularization via the inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase. However, the major contribution of this anti-inflammation and neovascularization effect in the acute phase of stroke is not completely elucidated. To investigate the neuroprotective effects of AUDA in acute ischemic stroke, we combined laser speckle contrast imaging and optical intrinsic signal imaging techniques with the implantation of a lab-designed cranial window. Forepaw stimulation was applied to assess the functional changes via measuring cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that accompany neural activity. The rats that received AUDA in the acute phase of photothrombotic ischemia stroke showed a 30.5 ± 8.1% reduction in the ischemic core, 42.3 ± 15.1% reduction in the ischemic penumbra (p &amp;lt; 0.05), and 42.1 ± 4.6% increase of CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in response to forepaw stimulation at post-stroke day 1 (p &amp;lt; 0.05) compared with the control group (N = 10 for each group). Moreover, at post-stroke day 3, increased functional vascular density was observed in AUDA-treated rats (35.9 ± 1.9% higher than that in the control group, p &amp;lt; 0.05). At post-stroke day 7, a 105.4% ± 16.4% increase of astrocytes (p &amp;lt; 0.01), 30.0 ± 10.9% increase of neurons (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and 65.5 ± 15.0% decrease of microglia (p &amp;lt; 0.01) were observed in the penumbra region in AUDA-treated rats (N = 5 for each group). These results suggested that AUDA affects the anti-inflammation at the beginning of ischemic injury and restores neuronal metabolic rate of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and tissue viability. The neovascularization triggered by AUDA restored CBF and may contribute to ischemic infarction reduction at post-stroke day 3. Moreover, for long-term neuroprotection, astrocytes in the penumbra region may play an important role in protecting neurons from apoptotic injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a unique regulated cell death defined by the intracellular iron overload and distinct biological features compared with other well-known programmed cell death. Ferroptosis can be triggered by many causes including decreased expression of glutathione (GSH), inhibition of the function of glutathione-dependent peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and system x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;, all of which finally lead to the over-accumulation of lipid peroxides in the cell. Ferroptosis has been reported to play an important role in the pathophysiological process of various cancers. In recent years, much evidence also proved that ferroptosis is involved in the progress of cerebral stroke. In this review, we summarized the characteristics of ferroptosis and the potential relationship between ferroptosis and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, to provide new targets and ideas for the therapy of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, and it is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as well as the presence of intracellular inclusions with α-synuclein as the main component in surviving DA neurons. Emerging evidence suggests that the imbalance of proteostasis is a key pathogenic factor for PD. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, two major pathways for maintaining proteostasis, play important roles in PD pathology and are considered as attractive therapeutic targets for PD treatment. However, although ER stress/UPR and autophagy appear to be independent cellular processes, they are closely related to each other. In this review, we focused on the roles and molecular cross-links between ER stress/UPR and autophagy in PD pathology. We systematically reviewed and summarized the most recent advances in regulation of ER stress/UPR and autophagy, and their cross-linking mechanisms. We also reviewed and discussed the mechanisms of the coexisting ER stress/UPR activation and dysregulated autophagy in the lesion regions of PD patients, and the underlying roles and molecular crosslinks between ER stress/UPR activation and the dysregulated autophagy in DA neurodegeneration induced by PD-associated genetic factors and PD-related neurotoxins. Finally, we indicate that the combined regulation of ER stress/UPR and autophagy would be a more effective treatment for PD rather than regulating one of these conditions alone.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;It has previously been demonstrated that short-term foreign language learning can lead to structural brain changes in younger adults. Experience-dependent brain plasticity is known to be possible also in older age, but the specific effect of foreign language learning on brain structure in language-and memory-relevant regions in the old brain remains unknown. In the present study, 160 older Swedish adults (65–75 years) were randomized to complete either an entry-level Italian course or a relaxation course, both with a total duration of 11 weeks. Structural MRI scans were conducted before and after the intervention in a subset of participants to test for differential change in gray matter in the two groups in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the hippocampus, and in white matter microstructure in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the hippocampal (HC) section of the cingulum. The study found no evidence for differential structural change following language training, independent of achieved vocabulary proficiency. However, hippocampal volume and associative memory ability before the intervention were found to be robust predictors of vocabulary proficiency at the end of the language course. The results suggest that having greater hippocampal volume and better associative memory ability benefits vocabulary learning in old age but that the very initial stage of foreign language learning does not trigger detectable changes in brain morphometry in old age.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The spectrum of health complications instigated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been diverse and complex. Besides the evident pulmonary and cardiovascular threats, accumulating clinical data points to several neurological complications, which are more common in elderly COVID-19 patients. Recent pieces of evidence have marked events of neuro infection and neuroinvasion, producing several neurological complications in COVID-19 patients; however, a systematic understanding of neuro-pathophysiology and manifested neurological complications, more specifically in elderly COVID-19 patients is largely elusive. Since the elderly population gradually develops neurological disorders with aging, COVID-19 inevitably poses a higher risk of neurological manifestations to the aged patients. In this report, we reviewed SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in neurological manifestations with an emphasis on the elderly population. We reviewed neuropathological events including neuroinfection, neuroinvasion, and their underlying mechanisms affecting neuromuscular, central- and peripheral- nervous systems. We further assessed the imminent neurological challenges in the COVID-19 exposed population, post-SARS-CoV-2-infection. Given the present state of clinical preparedness, the emerging role of AI and machine learning was also discussed concerning COVID-19 diagnostics and its management. Taken together, the present review summarizes neurological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated complications, specifically in elderly patients, and underlines the need for their clinical management in advance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intracellular amyloid β (Aβ) injection suppresses the large-conductance calcium-dependent potassium (BK) channel in cortical pyramidal cells from wild-type (WT) mice. In 3xTg Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model mice, intraneuronal Aβ is genetically programed to accumulate, which suppresses the BK channel. However, the mode of BK channel suppression remained unclarified. The present report revealed that only one (11A1) of the three anti-Aβ-oligomer antibodies that we examined, but not anti-monomer-Aβ-antibodies, was effective in recovering BK channel activity in 3xTg neurons. Antibodies against amyloid precursor protein (APP) were also found to be effective, suggesting that APP plays an essential part in this Aβ-oligomer-induced BK channel suppression in 3xTg neurons. In WT neurons, by contrast, APP suppressed BK channels by itself, which suggests that either APP or Aβ is sufficient to block BK channels, thus pointing to a different co-operativity of Aβ and APP in WT and 3xTg neurons. To clarify this difference, we relied on our previous finding that the scaffold protein Homer1a reverses the BK channel blockade in both WT and 3xTg neurons. In cortical neurons from 3xTg mice that bear Homer1a knockout (4xTg mice), neither anti-APP antibodies nor 11A1, but only the 6E10 antibody that binds both APP and Aβ, rescued the BK channel suppression. Given that Homer1a expression is activity dependent and 3xTg neurons are hyperexcitable, Homer1a is likely to be expressed sufficiently in 3xTg neurons, thereby alleviating the suppressive influence of APP and Aβ on BK channel. A unique way that APP modifies Aβ toxicity is thus proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Other than its direct impact on cardiopulmonary health, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection affects additional body systems, especially in older adults. Several studies have reported acute neurological symptoms that present at onset or develop during hospitalisation, with associated neural injuries. Whilst the acute neurological phase is widely documented, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on neurocognitive functioning remain unknown. Although an evidence-based framework describing the disease chronic phase is premature, it is important to lay the foundations for future data-driven models. This systematic review aimed at summarising the literature on neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older over-60 patients with COVID-19 following a cognitive neuroscientific perspective, to clarify the most vulnerable brain areas and speculate on the possible cognitive consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant manuscripts published between 1st March 2020 and 31th December 2020. Outputs were screened and selected by two assessors. Relevant studies not detected by literature search were added manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ninety studies, mainly single cases and case series, were included. Several neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older patients with COVID-19 emerged from these studies, with cerebrovascular damage having a prominent role. Abnormalities (hyperintensities, hypoperfusion, inflammation, and cellular damage) were reported in most brain areas. The most consistent cross-aetiology findings were in white matter, brainstem and fronto-temporal areas. Viral DNA was detected mainly in olfactory, orbitofrontal and brainstem areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Studies on COVID-19 related neural damage are rich and diverse, but limited to description of hospitalised patients with fatal outcome (i.e., in neuropathological studies) or severe symptoms (i.e., in neuroimaging studies). The damage seen in this population indicates acute and largely irreversible dysfunction to neural regions involved in major functional networks that support normal cognitive and behavioural functioning. It is still unknown whether the long-term impact of the virus will be limited to chronic evolution of acute events, whether sub-clinical pathological processes will be exacerbated or whether novel mechanisms will emerge. Based on current literature, future theoretical frameworks describing the long-term impact of COVID-19 infection on mental abilities will have to factor in major trends of aetiological and topographic heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As a severe neurological deficit, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with overwhelming mortality. Subsequent oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction are likely to cause secondary brain injury. Therefore, this study sought to define the role of Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) and underlying mechanism in oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction following ICH. An in vivo model of ICH was established in rats by injection of autologous blood, and an in vitro ICH cell model was developed in hippocampal neurons by oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) exposure. Next, gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed in vivo and in vitro to clarify the effect of KLF6 on neurological dysfunction and oxidative stress in ICH rats and neuronal apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in OxyHb-induced hippocampal neurons. KLF6, nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were highly expressed in hippocampal tissues of ICH rats, whereas sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) presented a poor expression. Mechanistically, KLF6 bound to the SIRT5 promoter and transcriptionally repressed SIRT5 to activate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. KLF6 silencing alleviated neurological dysfunction and oxidative stress in ICH rats and diminished oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in OxyHb-induced neurons, whereas SIRT5 overexpression negated its effect. To sum up, KLF6 silencing elevated SIRT5 expression to inactivate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thus attenuating oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) manifests differently in males and females. However, the neuro-mechanism and influence factors are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To explore sex differences in brain network topology during AD disease progression and its association with cognition and possible influencing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and cognitive scores were collected from 82 AD patients (50 females), 56 amnestic mildly cognitive impaired patients (29 females), and 63 healthy controls (38 females). Global and regional topological network metrics and modular architecture were calculated. Two-way ANOVA was performed to explore group and sex interactions and their main effects. Mediation analysis was used to explore the relationship among education, inter/intra-network connectivity, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Lower levels of education, lower MMSE scores, and a positive correlation between the level of education and MMSE scores were found in female AD patients (p = 0.024, r = 0.319). Significantly lower connectivity strength within the sensorimotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention network (VAN), and between the sensorimotor and VAN were observed in male AD patients (p = 0.006, 0.028, 0.046, and 0.013, respectively). Group and sex interactions were also found in nodal properties, mainly in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, middle cingulum, precuneus, and postcentral gyrus. Several of the altered brain network properties were associated with cognitive behavior in male AD patients. Education regulated the MMSE score through the mediation of connection strength between the default mode and limbic networks (LN) in the patient group (aMCI and AD combined).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that sex differences exist at the brain network level in AD. Sex differences in network topology and education are correlated with sex differences in cognition during AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Impairment in spatial navigation (SN) and structural network topology is not limited to patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia and can be detected earlier in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We recruited 32 MCI patients (65.91 ± 11.33 years old) and 28 normal cognition patients (NC; 69.68 ± 10.79 years old), all of whom underwent a computer-based battery of SN tests evaluating egocentric, allocentric, and mixed SN strategies and diffusion-weighted and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). To evaluate the topological features of the structural connectivity network, we calculated its measures such as the global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, and shortest path length with GRETNA. We determined the correlation between SN accuracy and network topological properties. Compared to NC, MCI subjects demonstrated a lower egocentric navigation accuracy. Compared with NC, MCI subjects showed significantly decreased clustering coefficients in the left middle frontal gyrus, right rectus, right superior parietal gyrus, and right inferior parietal gyrus and decreased shortest path length in the left paracentral lobule. We observed significant positive correlations of the shortest path length in the left paracentral lobule with both the mixed allocentric–egocentric and the allocentric accuracy measured by the average total errors. A decreased clustering coefficient in the right inferior parietal gyrus was associated with a larger allocentric navigation error. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) did not affect the correlation between network properties and SN accuracy. This study demonstrated that structural connectivity network abnormalities, especially in the frontal and parietal gyri, are associated with a lower SN accuracy, independently of WMH, providing a new insight into the brain mechanisms associated with SN impairment in MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Technological advances have enabled us to profile multiple molecular layers at unprecedented single-cell resolution and the available datasets from multiple samples or domains are growing. These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient. The software is available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC_plus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D-UMax9lHC8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Modern analytical techniques enable researchers to collect data about cellular states, before and after perturbations. These states can be characterized using analytical techniques, but the inference of regulatory interactions that explain and predict changes in these states remains a challenge. Here we present a generalizable, unsupervised approach to generate parameter-free, logic-based models of cellular processes, described by multiple discrete states. Our algorithm employs a Hamming-distance based approach to formulate, test, and identify optimized logic rules that link two states. Our approach comprises two steps. First, a model with no prior knowledge except for the mapping between initial and attractor states is built. We then employ biological constraints to improve model fidelity. Our algorithm automatically recovers the relevant dynamics for the explored models and recapitulates key aspects of the biochemical species concentration dynamics in the original model. We present the advantages and limitations of our work and discuss how our approach could be used to infer logic-based mechanisms of signaling, gene-regulatory, or other input-output processes describable by the Boolean formalism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e0809wjDpgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Nutrient-responsive protein kinases control the balance between anabolic growth and catabolic processes such as autophagy. Aberrant regulation of these kinases is a major cause of human disease. We report here that the vertebrate nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src-related kinase lacking C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristylation sites (SRMS) inhibits autophagy and promotes growth in a nutrient-responsive manner. Under nutrient-replete conditions, SRMS phosphorylates the PHLPP scaffold FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), disrupts the FKBP51-PHLPP complex, and promotes FKBP51 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This prevents PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of AKT, causing sustained AKT activation that promotes growth and inhibits autophagy. SRMS is amplified and overexpressed in human cancers where it drives unrestrained AKT signaling in a kinase-dependent manner. SRMS kinase inhibition activates autophagy, inhibits cancer growth, and can be accomplished using the FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. This illuminates SRMS as a targetable vulnerability in human cancers and as a new target for pharmacological induction of autophagy in vertebrates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yxuJNnTVFxE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Episodic memory depends on interactions between the hippocampus and interconnected neocortical regions. Here, using data-driven analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we identified the networks that interact with the hippocampus—the default mode network (DMN) and a “medial temporal network” (MTN) that included regions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and precuneus. We observed that the MTN plays a critical role in connecting the visual network to the DMN and hippocampus. The DMN could be further divided into 3 subnetworks: a “posterior medial” (PM) subnetwork comprised of posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortices; an “anterior temporal” (AT) subnetwork comprised of regions in the temporopolar and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; and a “medial prefrontal” (MP) subnetwork comprised of regions primarily in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These networks vary in their functional connectivity (FC) along the hippocampal long axis and represent different kinds of information during memory-guided decision-making. Finally, a Neurosynth meta-analysis of fMRI studies suggests new hypotheses regarding the functions of the MTN and DMN subnetworks, providing a framework to guide future research on the neural architecture of episodic memory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KfoHmH-TZZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multi‐access problem‐solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high‐solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased non‐neuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin‐based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular (FI) cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the hippocampus dentate gyrus where high‐solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.

 Abstract
The present review asks whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are able to define neural correlates of episodic memory within the hippocampus in Parkinson's disease (PD). Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE using search terms related to structural and functional MRI (fMRI), the hippocampus, episodic memory, and PD. Risk of bias was assessed for each study using the Newtown–Ottawa Scale. Thirty‐nine studies met inclusion criteria; eight fMRI, seven diffusion MRI (dMRI), and 24 structural MRI (14 exploring whole hippocampus and 10 exploring hippocampal subfields). Critical analysis of the literature revealed mixed evidence from functional and dMRI, but stronger evidence from sMRI of the hippocampus as a biomarker for episodic memory impairment in PD. Hippocampal subfield studies most often implicated CA1, CA3/4, and subiculum volume in episodic memory and cognitive decline in PD. Despite differences in imaging methodology, study design, and sample characteristics, MRI studies have helped elucidate an important neural correlate of episodic memory impairment in PD with both clinical and theoretical implications. Natural progression of this work encourages future research on hippocampal subfield function as a potential biomarker of, or therapeutic target for, episodic memory dysfunction in PD.</content>

 Spinal A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) activation by MRS5698 transiently restores morphine antinociception in opioid‐tolerant rats. Intrathecal injection of MRS5698 (“on”) on days 8, 9, 12, and 13 reinstates morphine antinociception. This response is blocked by A3AR antagonist MRS1523 and absent when intrathecal vehicle (“off”) is administered on days 10 and 11.

Abstract
Opioids are potent analgesics, but their pain‐relieving effects diminish with repeated use. The reduction in analgesic potency is a hallmark of opioid analgesic tolerance, which hampers opioid pain therapy. In the central nervous system, opioid analgesia is critically modulated by adenosine, a purine nucleoside implicated in the beneficial and detrimental actions of opioid medications. Here, we focus on the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) in opioid analgesic tolerance. Intrathecal administration of the A3AR agonist MRS5698 with daily systemic morphine in male rats attenuated the reduction in morphine antinociception over 7 days. In rats with established morphine tolerance, intrathecal MRS5698 partially restored the antinociceptive effects of morphine. However, when MRS5698 was discontinued, these animals displayed a reduced antinociceptive response to morphine. Our results suggest that MRS5698 acutely and transiently potentiates morphine antinociception in tolerant rats. By contrast, in morphine‐naïve rats MRS5698 treatment did not impact thermal nociceptive threshold or affect antinociceptive response to a single injection of morphine. Furthermore, we found that morphine‐induced adenosine release in cerebrospinal fluid was blunted in tolerant animals, but total spinal A3AR expression was not affected. Collectively, our findings indicate that spinal A3AR activation acutely potentiates morphine antinociception in the opioid tolerant state.</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;The brainstem is an important component in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although neuroimaging studies have shown multiple structural changes in ALS patients, few studies have investigated structural alterations in the brainstem. Herein, we compared the brainstem structure between patients with ALS and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 33 patients with ALS and 33 healthy controls were recruited in this study. T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were acquired on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) scanner. Volumetric and vertex-wised approaches were implemented to assess the differences in the brainstem’s morphological features between the two groups. An atlas-based region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed to compare the white matter integrity of the brainstem between the two groups. Additionally, a correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between ALS clinical characteristics and structural features.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Volumetric analyses showed no significant difference in the subregion volume of the brainstem between ALS patients and healthy controls. In the shape analyses, ALS patients had a local abnormal surface contraction in the ventral medulla oblongata and ventral pons. Compared with healthy controls, ALS patients showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left corticospinal tract (CST) and bilateral frontopontine tracts (FPT) at the brainstem level, and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in bilateral CST and left FPT at the brainstem level by ROI analysis in DTI. Correlation analysis showed that disease severity was positively associated with FA in left CST and left FPT.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the brainstem in ALS suffers atrophy, and degenerative processes in the brainstem may reflect disease severity in ALS. These findings may be helpful for further understanding of potential neural mechanisms in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Scaling down technology demotes the parameters of AC-coupled neural amplifiers, such as increasing the low-cutoff frequency due to the short-channel effects. To improve the low-cutoff frequency, one solution is to increase the feedback capacitors' value. This solution is not desirable, as the input capacitors have to be increased to maintain the same gain, which increases the area and decreases the input impedance of the neural amplifier. We analytically analyze the small-signal behavior of the neural amplifier and prove that the main reason for the increase of the low-cutoff frequency in advanced CMOS technologies is the reduction of the input resistance of the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). We also show that the reduction of the input resistance of the OTA is due to the increase in the gate oxide leakage in the input transistors. In this paper, we explore this fact and propose two solutions to reduce the low-cutoff frequency without increasing the value of the feedback capacitor. The first solution is performed by only simulation and is called cross-coupled positive feedback that uses pseudoresistors to provide a negative resistance to increase the input resistance of the OTA. As an advantage, only standard CMOS transistors are used in this method. Simulation results show that a low-cutoff frequency of 1.5 Hz is achieved while the midband gain is 30.4 dB at 1 V. In addition, the power consumption is 0.6 μW. In the second method, we utilize thick-oxide MOS transistors in the input differential pair of the OTA. We designed and fabricated the second method in the 65 nm TSMC CMOS process. Measured results are obtained by in vitro recordings on slices of mouse brainstem. The measurement results show that the bandwidth is between 2 Hz and 5.6 kHz. The neural amplifier has 34.3 dB voltage gain in midband and consumes 3.63 μW at 1 V power supply. The measurement results show an input-referred noise of 6.1 μV&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; and occupy 0.04 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; silicon area.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This article proposes a multimode medical image fusion with CNN and supervised learning, in order to solve the problem of practical medical diagnosis. It can implement different types of multimodal medical image fusion problems in batch processing mode and can effectively overcome the problem that traditional fusion problems that can only be solved by single and single image fusion. To a certain extent, it greatly improves the fusion effect, image detail clarity, and time efficiency in a new method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art fusion performance in terms of visual quality and a variety of quantitative evaluation criteria.

 &lt;p&gt;Each neuron in the central nervous system has many dendrites, which provide input information through impulses. Assuming that a neuron's decision to continue or stop firing is made by rules applied to the dendrites' inputs, we associate neuron activity with a quantum like-cellular automaton (QLCA) concepts. Following a previous study that related the CA description with entangled states, we provide a quantum-like description of neuron activity. After reviewing and presenting the entanglement concept expressed by QLCA terminology, we propose a model that relates quantum-like measurement to consciousness. Then, we present a toy model that reviews the QLCA theory, which is adapted to our terminology. The study also focuses on implementing QLCA formalism to describe a single neuron activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A distinctive feature of the hippocampal structure is the diversity of inhibitory interneurons. These complex inhibitory interconnections largely contribute to the tight modulation of hippocampal circuitry, as well as to the formation and coordination of neuronal assemblies underlying learning and memory. Inhibitory interneurons provide more than a simple transitory inhibition of hippocampal principal cells (PCs). The synaptic plasticity of inhibitory neurons provides long-lasting changes in the hippocampal network and is a key component of memory formation. The dendrite targeting interneurons expressing the peptide somatostatin (SOM) are particularly interesting in this regard because they display unique long-lasting synaptic changes leading to metaplastic regulation of hippocampal networks. In this article, we examine the actions of the neuropeptide SOM on hippocampal cells, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. We address the different subtypes of hippocampal SOM interneurons. We describe the long-term synaptic plasticity that takes place at the excitatory synapses of SOM interneurons, its singular induction and expression mechanisms, as well as the consequences of these changes on the hippocampal network, learning, and memory. We also review evidence that astrocytes provide cell-specific dynamic regulation of inhibition of PC dendrites by SOM interneurons. Finally, we cover how, in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dysfunction of plasticity of SOM interneuron excitatory synapses may also contribute to cognitive impairments in brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are small secreted proteins that support the development, maturation and survival of neurons. NTFs injected into the brain rescue and regenerate certain neuronal populations lost in neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating the potential of NTFs to cure the diseases rather than simply alleviating the symptoms. NTFs (as the vast majority of molecules) do not pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and therefore, are delivered directly into the brain of patients using costly and risky intracranial surgery. The delivery efficacy and poor diffusion of some NTFs inside the brain are considered the major problems behind their modest effects in clinical trials. Thus, there is a great need for NTFs to be delivered systemically thereby avoiding intracranial surgery. Nanoparticles (NPs), particles with the size dimensions of 1-100 nm, can be used to stabilize NTFs and facilitate their transport through the BBB. Several studies have shown that NTFs can be loaded into or attached onto NPs, administered systemically and transported to the brain. To improve the NP-mediated NTF delivery through the BBB, the surface of NPs can be functionalized with specific ligands such as transferrin, insulin, lactoferrin, apolipoproteins, antibodies or short peptides that will be recognized and internalized by the respective receptors on brain endothelial cells. In this review, we elaborate on the most suitable NTF delivery methods and envision “ideal” NTF for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and clinical trial thereof. We shortly summarize clinical trials of four NTFs, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), that were tested in PD patients, focusing mainly on GDNF and CDNF. We summarize current possibilities of NP-mediated delivery of NTFs to the brain and discuss whether NPs have impact in improving the properties of NTFs and delivery across the BBB. Emerging delivery approaches and future directions of NTF-based nanomedicine are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant form of primary brain tumor with a median survival time of 14–16 months in GBM patients. Surgical treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may help increase survival by removing GBM from the brain. However, complete surgical resection to eliminate GBM is almost impossible due to its high invasiveness. When GBM cells migrate to the brain, they interact with various cells, including astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). They can also make their cell body shrink to infiltrate into narrow spaces in the brain; thereby, they can invade regions of the brain and escape from surgery. Brain tumor cells create an appropriate microenvironment for migration and invasion by modifying and degrading the ECM. During those processes, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling pathway and other signaling cascades mediated by various ion channels contribute mainly to gene expression, motility, and invasion of GBM cells. Furthermore, GBM cells release glutamate, affecting migration via activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors in an autocrine manner. This review focuses on the cellular mechanisms of glioblastoma invasion and motility related to ECM, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, and glutamate. Finally, we discuss possible therapeutic interventions to inhibit invasion by GBM cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective
Brain‐injured patients who are unresponsive at the bedside (ie, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome – VS/UWS) may present brain activity similar to patients in minimally conscious state (MCS). This peculiar condition has been termed “non‐behavioural MCS” or “MCS*”. In the present study we aimed to investigate the proportion and underlying brain characteristics of patients in MCS*.


Methods
Brain 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG‐PET) was acquired on 135 brain‐injured patients diagnosed in prolonged VS/UWS (n = 48) or MCS (n = 87). From an existing database, relative metabolic preservation in the fronto‐parietal network (measured with standardized uptake value) was visually inspected by three experts. Patients with hypometabolism of the fronto‐parietal network were labelled “VS/UWS”, while its (partial) preservation either confirmed the behavioural diagnosis of “MCS” or, in absence of behavioural signs of consciousness, suggested a diagnosis of “MCS*”. Clinical outcome at 1‐year follow‐up, functional connectivity, grey matter atrophy, and regional brain metabolic patterns were investigated in the three groups (VS/UWS, MCS* and MCS).


Results
67% of behavioural VS/UWS presented a partial preservation of brain metabolism (ie, MCS*). Compared to VS/UWS patients, MCS* patients demonstrated a better outcome, global functional connectivity and grey matter preservation more compatible with the diagnosis of MCS. MCS* patients presented lower brain metabolism mostly in the posterior brain regions compared to MCS patients.


Interpretation
MCS* is a frequent phenomenon that is associated with better outcome and better brain preservation than the diagnosis of VS/UWS. Complementary exams should be provided to all unresponsive patients before taking medical decisions. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

The aim of this study is to uncover the network dynamics of the human visual cortex by driving it with a broadband random visual flicker. We here applied a broadband flicker (1–720 Hz) while measuring the MEG and then estimated the temporal response function (TRF) between the visual input and the MEG response. This TRF revealed an early response in the 40–60 Hz gamma range as well as in the 8–12 Hz alpha band. While the gamma band response is novel, the latter has been termed the alpha band perceptual echo. The gamma echo preceded the alpha perceptual echo. The dominant frequency of the gamma echo was subject-specific thereby reflecting the individual dynamical properties of the early visual cortex. To understand the neuronal mechanisms generating the gamma echo, we implemented a pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) model that produces gamma oscillations in the presence of constant input currents. Applying a broadband input current mimicking the visual stimulation allowed us to estimate TRF between the input current and the population response (akin to the local field potentials). The TRF revealed a gamma echo that was similar to the one we observed in the MEG data. Our results suggest that the visual gamma echo can be explained by the dynamics of the PING model even in the absence of sustained gamma oscillations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/88rEjoc00IA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Existing studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) is involved in the initiation and progression of cancer. Many efforts have been devoted to identify microRNAs as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic targets. With the rapid development of miRNA sequencing technology, a vast amount of miRNA expression data for multiple cancers has been collected. These invaluable data repositories provide new paradigms to explore the relationship between miRNAs and cancer. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore the complex cancer-related miRNA-gene patterns by integrating multi-omics data in a pan-cancer paradigm. In this study, we present a tensor sparse canonical correlation analysis (TSCCA) method for identifying cancer-related miRNA-gene modules across multiple cancers. TSCCA is able to overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions and capture both the cancer-shared and specific miRNA-gene co-expressed modules with better biological interpretations. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of TSCCA using a set of simulated data and matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from the TCGA database. We uncover several dysfunctional miRNA-gene modules with important biological functions and statistical significance. These modules can advance our understanding of miRNA regulatory mechanisms of cancer and provide insights into miRNA-based treatments for cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KF6Pqt_AyoU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Increasing interest has emerged in new mathematical approaches that simplify the study of complex differentiation processes by formalizing Waddington’s landscape metaphor. However, a rational method to build these landscape models remains an open problem. Here we study vulval development in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; by developing a framework based on Catastrophe Theory (CT) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to build data-fitted landscape models. We first identify the candidate qualitative landscapes, and then use CT to build the simplest model consistent with the data, which we quantitatively fit using ABC. The resulting model suggests that the underlying mechanism is a quantifiable two-step decision controlled by EGF and Notch-Delta signals, where a non-vulval/vulval decision is followed by a bistable transition to the two vulval states. This new model fits a broad set of data and makes several novel predictions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UhG6hhJfAHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Several homeostatic mechanisms enable the brain to maintain desired levels of neuronal activity. One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model of peripheral lesioning and accurately reproduced the characteristics of network repair after deafferentation that are reported in experiments to study the activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we model deafferentation in a biologically realistic balanced network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed structural plasticity growth rules and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network both contribute to the restoration of the network to pre-deafferentation stable activity levels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yR-Sq_AD2TE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;i&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; is a human fungal pathogen that can cause devastating pulmonary infections, termed “aspergilloses,” in individuals suffering immune imbalances or underlying lung conditions. As rapid adaptation to stress is crucial for the outcome of the host–pathogen interplay, here we investigated the role of the versatile posttranslational modification (PTM) persulfidation for both fungal virulence and antifungal host defense. We show that an &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; mutant with low persulfidation levels is more susceptible to host-mediated killing and displays reduced virulence in murine models of infection. Additionally, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human gene encoding cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) causes a reduction in cellular persulfidation and correlates with a predisposition of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), as correct levels of persulfidation are required for optimal antifungal activity of recipients’ lung resident host cells. Importantly, the levels of host persulfidation determine the levels of fungal persulfidation, ultimately reflecting a host–pathogen functional correlation and highlighting a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of aspergillosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OZifpfaWVlg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The glymphatic system plays an important role in clearing the amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins that are closely linked to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Glymphatic clearance, as well as Aβ accumulation, is highly dependent on sleep, but the sleep-dependent driving forces behind cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movements essential to the glymphatic flux remain largely unclear. Recent studies have reported that widespread, high-amplitude spontaneous brain activations in the drowsy state and during sleep, which are shown as large global signal peaks in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), are coupled with CSF movements, suggesting their potential link to glymphatic flux and metabolite clearance. By analyzing multimodal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project, here we showed that the coupling between the global fMRI signal and CSF influx is correlated with AD-related pathology, including various risk factors for AD, the severity of AD-related diseases, the cortical Aβ level, and cognitive decline over a 2-year follow-up. These results provide critical initial evidence for involvement of sleep-dependent global brain activity, as well as the associated physiological modulations, in the clearance of AD-related brain waste.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lySWRRRKryk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Global biodiversity loss is a profound consequence of human activity. Disturbingly, biodiversity loss is greater than realized because of the unknown number of undocumented species. Conservation fundamentally relies on taxonomic recognition of species, but only a fraction of biodiversity is described. Here, we provide a new quantitative approach for prioritizing rigorous taxonomic research for conservation. We implement this approach in a highly diverse vertebrate group—Australian lizards and snakes. Of 870 species assessed, we identified 282 (32.4%) with taxonomic uncertainty, of which 17.6% likely comprise undescribed species of conservation concern. We identify 24 species in need of immediate taxonomic attention to facilitate conservation. Using a broadly applicable return-on-investment framework, we demonstrate the importance of prioritizing the fundamental work of identifying species before they are lost.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y9QlVuTXNHI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Tumor heterogeneity is a primary cause of treatment failure and acquired resistance in cancer patients. Even in cancers driven by a single mutated oncogene, variability in response to targeted therapies is well known. The existence of additional genomic alterations among tumor cells can only partially explain this variability. As such, nongenetic factors are increasingly seen as critical contributors to tumor relapse and acquired resistance in cancer. Here, we show that both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to targeted drug response variability in an experimental model of tumor heterogeneity. We observe significant variability to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition among and within multiple versions and clonal sublines of PC9, a commonly used EGFR mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. We resolve genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic components of this variability using a theoretical framework in which distinct genetic states give rise to multiple epigenetic “basins of attraction,” across which cells can transition driven by stochastic noise. Using mutational impact analysis, single-cell differential gene expression, and correlations among Gene Ontology (GO) terms to connect genomics to transcriptomics, we establish a baseline for genetic differences driving drug response variability among PC9 cell line versions. Applying the same approach to clonal sublines, we conclude that drug response variability in all but one of the sublines is due to epigenetic differences; in the other, it is due to genetic alterations. Finally, using a clonal drug response assay together with stochastic simulations, we attribute subclonal drug response variability within sublines to stochastic cell fate decisions and confirm that one subline likely contains genetic resistance mutations that emerged in the absence of drug treatment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-3GnOPaF4YY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Portacaval anastomosis (PCA) promoted spongiform degeneration at the cerebellar molecular layer. There was loss of Purkinje cells, microglia activation and increase expression of NLRP3 and aquaporin‐4. By NMR spectroscopy, there was reduction in osmolytes that can be cause the cellular edema. PCA rats showed a motor deficiency in rotarod test.

Abstract
The episodes of cerebral dysfunction, known as encephalopathy, are usually coincident with liver failure. The primary metabolic marker of liver diseases is the increase in blood ammonium, which promotes neuronal damage. In the present project, we used an experimental model of hepatic encephalopathy in male rats by portacaval anastomosis (PCA) surgery. Sham rats had a false operation. After 13 weeks of surgery, the most distinctive finding was vacuolar/spongiform neurodegeneration exclusively in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. This cerebellar damage was further characterized by metabolic, histopathological, and behavioral approaches. The results were as follows: (a) Cellular alterations, namely loss of Purkinje cells, morphological changes, such as swelling of astrocytes and Bergmann glia, and activation of microglia; (b) Cytotoxic edema, shown by an increase in aquaporin‐4 and N‐acetylaspartate and a reduction in taurine and choline‐derivate osmolytes; (c) Metabolic adjustments, noted by the elevation of circulating ammonium, enhanced presence of glutamine synthetase, and increase in glutamine and creatine/phosphocreatine; (d) Inflammasome activation, detected by the elevation of the marker NLRP3 and microglial activation; (e) Locomotor deficits in PCA rats as assessed by the Rotarod and open field tests. These results lead us to suggest that metabolic disturbances associated with PCA can generate the cerebellar damage that is similar to morphophysiological modifications observed in amyloidogenic disorders. In conclusion, we have characterized a distinctive cerebellar multi‐disruption accompanied by high levels of ammonium and associated with spongiform neurodegeneration in a model of hepatic hypofunctioning.</content>

 Glial cells of the cerebellum are still insufficiently classified. In this study we describe the subclassification of GLAST+ precursors in the prospective white matter using immunophenotyping, transcriptomics, and transplantation assays. A subclass of GLAST+ cells, which co‐express astrocyte cell surface antigen‐2 (ACSA‐2), generates only parenchymal astrocytes—as revealed by protein expression, their genetic signature and transplantation. The absence of the astrocyte marker (ACSA‐2) reveals GLAST+ cells to maintain a multipotent potential, giving rise to interneurons, glia, and Bergmann glia.

Abstract
The formation of the cerebellum is highly coordinated to obtain its characteristic morphology and all cerebellar cell types. During mouse postnatal development, cerebellar progenitors with astroglial‐like characteristics generate mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, a subset of astroglial‐like progenitors found in the prospective white matter (PWM) produces astroglia and interneurons. Characterizing these cerebellar astroglia‐like progenitors and distinguishing their developmental fates is still elusive. Here, we reveal that astrocyte cell surface antigen‐2 (ACSA‐2), lately identified as ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 2 polypeptide, is expressed by glial precursors throughout postnatal cerebellar development. In contrast to common astrocyte markers, ACSA‐2 appears on PWM cells but is absent on Bergmann glia (BG) precursors. In the adult cerebellum, ACSA‐2 is broadly expressed extending to velate astrocytes in the granular layer, white matter astrocytes, and to a lesser extent to BG. Cell transplantation and transcriptomic analysis revealed that marker staining discriminates two postnatal progenitor pools. One subset is defined by the co‐expression of ACSA‐2 and GLAST and the expression of markers typical of parenchymal astrocytes. These are PWM precursors that are exclusively gliogenic. They produce predominantly white matter and granular layer astrocytes. Another subset is constituted by GLAST positive/ACSA‐2 negative precursors that express neurogenic and BG‐like progenitor genes. This population displays multipotency and gives rise to interneurons besides all glial types, including BG. In conclusion, this work reports about ACSA‐2, a marker that in combination with GLAST enables for the discrimination and isolation of multipotent and glia‐committed progenitors, which generate different types of cerebellar astrocytes.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Golgi defects including Golgi fragmentation are pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). As a pathogenic factor in AD, amyloid precursor protein (APP) induces Golgi fragmentation in the soma. However, how APP regulates Golgi outposts (GOs) in dendrites remains unclear. Given that APP resides in and affects the movements of GOs, and in particular, reverses the distribution of multi-compartment GOs (mcGOs), we investigated the regulatory mechanism of mcGO movements in the Drosophila larvae. Knockdown experiments showed that the bidirectional mcGO movements were cooperatively controlled by the dynein heavy chain (Dhc) and kinesin heavy chain subunits. Notably, only Dhc mediated APP’s regulation of mcGO movements. Furthermore, by loss-of-function screening, the adaptor protein Sunday driver (Syd) was identified to mediate the APP-induced alteration of the direction of mcGO movements and dendritic defects. Collectively, by elucidating a model of bidirectional mcGO movements, we revealed the mechanism by which APP regulates the direction of mcGO movements. Our study therefore provides new insights into AD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative disease caused by degeneration of motor neurons (MNs). ALS pathogenic features include accumulation of misfolded proteins, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction at distal axon terminals, and neuronal cytoskeleton changes. Synergies between loss of C9orf72 functions and gain of function by toxic effects of repeat expansions also contribute to C9orf72-mediated pathogenesis. However, the impact of haploinsufficiency of C9orf72 on neurons and in synaptic functions requires further examination. As the motor neurons degenerate, the disease symptoms will lead to neurotransmission deficiencies in the brain, spinal cord, and neuromuscular junction. Altered neuronal excitability, synaptic morphological changes, and C9orf72 protein and DPR localization at the synapses, suggest a potential involvement of C9orf72 at synapses. In this review article, we provide a conceptual framework for assessing the putative involvement of C9orf72 as a synaptopathy, and we explore the underlying and common disease mechanisms with other neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we reflect on the major challenges of understanding C9orf72-ALS as a synaptopathy focusing on integrating mitochondrial and neuronal cytoskeleton degeneration as biomarkers and potential targets to treat ALS neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Noise exposure is the most important external factor causing acquired hearing loss in humans, and it is strongly associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cochlea. Several studies reported that the administration of various compounds with antioxidant effects can treat oxidative stress-induced hearing loss. However, traditional systemic drug administration to the human inner ear is problematic and has not been successful in a clinical setting. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop rescue treatment for patients with acute acoustic injuries. Hydrogen gas has antioxidant effects, rapid distribution, and distributes systemically after inhalation.The purpose of this study was to determine the protective efficacy of a single dose of molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on cochlear structures. Guinea pigs were divided into six groups and sacrificed immediately after or at 1 or 2 weeks. The animals were exposed to broadband noise for 2 h directly followed by 1-h inhalation of 2% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or room air. Electrophysiological hearing thresholds using frequency-specific auditory brainstem response (ABR) were measured prior to noise exposure and before sacrifice. ABR thresholds were significantly lower in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-treated animals at 2 weeks after exposure, with significant preservation of outer hair cells in the entire cochlea. Quantification of synaptophysin immunoreactivity revealed that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation protected the cochlear inner hair cell synaptic structures containing synaptophysin. The inflammatory response was greater in the stria vascularis, showing increased Iba1 due to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation.Repeated administration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation may further improve the therapeutic effect. This animal model does not reproduce conditions in humans, highlighting the need for additional real-life studies in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
