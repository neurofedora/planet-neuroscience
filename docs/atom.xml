 &lt;p&gt;How do we decide the fair value of individual classifiers in an ensemble
model? We introduce a new class of transferable utility cooperative games to
answer this question. The players in ensemble games are pre-trained binary
classifiers that collaborate in an ensemble to correctly label points from a
dataset. We design Troupe a scalable algorithm that designates payoffs to
individual models based on the Shapley value of those in the ensemble game. We
show that the approximate Shapley value of classifiers in these games is an
adequate measure for selecting a subgroup of highly predictive models. In
addition, we introduce the Shapley entropy a new metric to quantify the
heterogeneity of machine learning ensembles when it comes to model quality. We
analytically prove that our Shapley value approximation algorithm is accurate
and scales to large ensembles and big data. Experimental results on graph
classification tasks establish that Troupe gives precise estimates of the
Shapley value in ensemble games. We demonstrate that the Shapley value can be
used for pruning large ensembles, show that complex classifiers have a prime
role in correct and incorrect classification decisions, and provide evidence
that adversarial models receive a low valuation.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This paper introduces neuroevolution for solving differential equations. The
solution is obtained through optimizing a deep neural network whose loss
function is defined by the residual terms from the differential equations.
Recent studies have focused on learning such physics-informed neural networks
through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variants, yet they face the
difficulty of obtaining an accurate solution due to optimization challenges. In
the context of solving differential equations, we are faced with the problem of
finding globally optimum parameters of the network, instead of being concerned
with out-of-sample generalization. SGD, which searches along a single gradient
direction, is prone to become trapped in local optima, so it may not be the
best approach here. In contrast, neuroevolution carries out a parallel
exploration of diverse solutions with the goal of circumventing local optima.
It could potentially find more accurate solutions with better optimized neural
networks. However, neuroevolution can be slow, raising tractability issues in
practice. With that in mind, a novel and computationally efficient transfer
neuroevolution algorithm is proposed in this paper. Our method is capable of
exploiting relevant experiential priors when solving a new problem, with
adaptation to protect against the risk of negative transfer. The algorithm is
applied on a variety of differential equations to empirically demonstrate that
transfer neuroevolution can indeed achieve better accuracy and faster
convergence than SGD. The experimental outcomes thus establish transfer
neuroevolution as a noteworthy approach for solving differential equations, one
that has never been studied in the past. Our work expands the resource of
available algorithms for optimizing physics-informed neural networks.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: Functional connectivity triggered by naturalistic stimulus (e.g.,
movies) and machine learning techniques provide a great insight in exploring
the brain functions such as fluid intelligence. However, functional
connectivity are considered to be multi-layered, while traditional machine
learning based on individual models not only are limited in performance, but
also fail to extract multi-dimensional and multi-layered information from brain
network. Methods: In this study, inspired by multi-layer brain network
structure, we propose a new method namely Weighted Ensemble-model and Network
Analysis, which combines the machine learning and graph theory for improved
fluid intelligence prediction. Firstly, functional connectivity analysis and
graphical theory were jointly employed. The functional connectivity and
graphical indices computed using the preprocessed fMRI data were then all fed
into auto-encoder parallelly for feature extraction to predict the fluid
intelligence. In order to improve the performance, tree regression and ridge
regression model were automatically stacked and fused with weighted values.
Finally, layers of auto-encoder were visualized to better illustrate the
connectome patterns, followed by the evaluation of the performance to justify
the mechanism of brain functions. Results: Our proposed methods achieved best
performance with 3.85 mean absolute deviation, 0.66 correlation coefficient and
0.42 R-squared coefficient, outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. It is
also worth noting that, the optimization of the biological pattern extraction
was automated though the auto-encoder algorithm. Conclusion: The proposed
method not only outperforming the state-of-the-art reports, but also able to
effectively capturing the biological patterns from functional connectivity
during naturalistic movies state for potential clinical explorations.

 &lt;p&gt;It has been shown classically that combining two chaotic random walks can
yield an ordered(periodic) walk. Our aim in this paper is to find a quantum
analog for this rather counter-intuitive result. We study chaotic and periodic
nature of cyclic quantum walks and focus on an unique situation wherein a
periodic quantum walk on $3-$cycle graph is generated via a deterministic
combination of two chaotic quantum walks on the same graph. Our results will be
relevant in quantum cryptography and quantum chaos control.

 &lt;p&gt;Reservoir computing is a popular approach to design recurrent neural
networks, due to its training simplicity and its approximation performance. The
recurrent part of these networks is not trained (e.g. via gradient descent),
making them appealing for analytical studies, raising the interest of a vast
community of researcher spanning from dynamical systems to neuroscience. It
emerges that, even in the simple linear case, the working principle of these
networks is not fully understood and the applied research is usually driven by
heuristics. A novel analysis of the dynamics of such networks is proposed,
which allows one to express the state evolution using the controllability
matrix. Such a matrix encodes salient characteristics of the network dynamics:
in particular, its rank can be used as an input-indepedent measure of the
memory of the network. Using the proposed approach, it is possible to compare
different architectures and explain why a cyclic topology achieves favourable
results.

 &lt;p&gt;We explore the phase diagram of approximation rates for deep neural networks
and prove several new theoretical results. In particular, we generalize the
existing result on the existence of deep discontinuous phase in ReLU networks
to functional classes of arbitrary positive smoothness, and identify the
boundary between the feasible and infeasible rates. Moreover, we show that all
networks with a piecewise polynomial activation function have the same phase
diagram. Next, we demonstrate that standard fully-connected architectures with
a fixed width independent of smoothness can adapt to smoothness and achieve
almost optimal rates. Finally, we consider deep networks with periodic
activations (&quot;deep Fourier expansion&quot;) and prove that they have very fast,
nearly exponential approximation rates, thanks to the emerging capability of
the network to implement efficient lookup operations.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Rhythms of the brain are generated by neural oscillations across multiple frequencies. These oscillations can be decomposed into distinct frequency intervals associated with specific physiological processes. In practice, the number and ranges of decodable frequency intervals are determined by sampling parameters, often ignored by researchers. To improve the situation, we report on an open toolbox with a graphical user interface for decoding rhythms of the brain system (DREAM). We provide worked examples of DREAM to investigate frequency-specific performance of both neural (spontaneous brain activity) and neurobehavioral (in-scanner head motion) oscillations. DREAM decoded the head motion oscillations and uncovered that younger children moved their heads more than older children across all five frequency intervals whereas boys moved more than girls in the age of 7 to 9 years. It is interesting that the higher frequency bands contain more head movements, and showed stronger age-motion associations but weaker sex-motion interactions. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, DREAM mapped the amplitude of these neural oscillations into multiple frequency bands and evaluated their test-retest reliability. The resting-state brain ranks its spontaneous oscillation’s amplitudes spatially from high in ventral-temporal areas to low in ventral-occipital areas when the frequency band increased from low to high, while those in part of parietal and ventral frontal regions are reversed. The higher frequency bands exhibited more reliable amplitude measurements, implying more inter-individual variability of the amplitudes for the higher frequency bands. In summary, DREAM adds a reliable and valid tool to mapping human brain function from a multiple-frequency window into brain waves.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute neuropsychological disturbance after surgery, whose prevalence is related with advancing age. Neuroinflammation and abnormal tau phosphorylation that commonly presenting in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may contribute to the progression and duration of POD. To study the acute influence of surgery on cognitive function, wild type male C57BL/6 N mice were randomly divided into three groups: Control (CON), Laparotomy at 4 h and 24 h (LAP-4 h, LAP-24 h), then subjected to laparotomy under sevoflurane anaesthesia. The cognitive performance, peripheral and central inflammatory responses and tau phosphorylation levels were evaluated at 4 h and 24 h postoperatively. When LAP4-hrs displayed anxiety behaviors with high mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and MCP-1 in the liver, and IL-8 in the hippocampus, results at 24 h were different. In the liver, only IL-10 protein was obviously elevated, but in the hippocampus, both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased whilst the elimination of anxiety. The activity of major related kinases and phosphatases was remarkably changed which may contribute to the dephosphorylated tau protein. With tremendous neuropathological changes and significant numbers of activated microglias and astrocytes observed in the sub-regions of hippocampus, the memory impairment existed at both 4 h and 24 h. Since the association of dephosphorylated tau with POD, these findings may supply novel implications for the understanding of tauopathies and as a theoretical basis for preventions from the postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the most common causes of death and disability worldwide. Neuroinflammation is a major pathological event involved in the process of ischemic injury and repair. In particular, microglia play a dual role in neuroinflammation. During the acute phase of stroke onset, M2 microglia are the dominant phenotype and exert protective effects on neuronal cells, whereas permanent M1 microglia contribute to prolonged inflammation and are detrimental to brain tissue. Emerging evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) may have regulatory effects on microglia-associated inflammation. Thus, we briefly reviewed the dynamic response of microglia after a stroke and assessed how specific miRNAs affect the behavior of reactive microglia. We concluded that miRNAs may be useful novel therapeutic targets to improve stroke outcomes and modulate neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Epilepsies are chronic neurological diseases that affect approximately 2% of the world population. In addition to being one of the most frequent neurological disorders, treatment for patients with epilepsy remains a challenge, because a proportion of patients do not respond to the antiseizure medications that are currently available. This results in a severe economic and social burden for patients, families, and the healthcare system. A characteristic common to all forms of epilepsy is the occurrence of epileptic seizures that are caused by abnormal neuronal discharges, leading to a clinical manifestation that is dependent on the affected brain region. It is generally accepted that an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition generates the synchronic electrical activity leading to seizures. However, it is still unclear how a normal neural circuit becomes susceptible to the generation of seizures or how epileptogenesis is induced. Herein, we review the results of recent proteomic studies applied to investigate the underlying mechanisms leading to epilepsies and how these findings may impact research and treatment for these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Aβo) start to accumulate in the human brain one to two decades before any clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are implicated in synapse loss, one of the best predictors of memory decline that characterize the illness. Cognitive impairment in AD was traditionally thought to result from a reduction in synaptic activity which ultimately induces neurodegeneration. More recent evidence indicates that in the early stages of AD synaptic failure is, at least partly, induced by neuronal hyperactivity rather than hypoactivity. Here, we review the growing body of evidence supporting the implication of soluble Aβo on the induction of neuronal hyperactivity in AD animal models, in vitro, and in humans. We then discuss the impact of Aβo-induced hyperactivity on memory performance, cell death, epileptiform activity, gamma oscillations, and slow wave activity. We provide an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are emerging to explain how Aβo induce neuronal hyperactivity. We conclude by providing an outlook on the impact of hyperactivity for the development of disease-modifying interventions at the onset of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hearing impairment is the most common sensory disorder in humans. So far, rehabilitation of profoundly deaf subjects relies on direct stimulation of the auditory nerve through cochlear implants. However, in some forms of genetic hearing impairment, the organ of Corti is structurally intact and therapeutic replacement of the mutated gene could potentially restore near natural hearing. In the case of defects of the otoferlin gene (OTOF), such gene therapy is hindered by the size of the coding sequence (~6 kb) exceeding the cargo capacity (&amp;lt;5 kb) of the preferred viral vector, adeno-associated virus (AAV). Recently, a dual-AAV approach was used to partially restore hearing in deaf otoferlin knock-out (Otof-KO) mice. Here, we employed in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the gene-therapeutic potential of naturally-occurring and newly-developed synthetic AAVs overloaded with the full-length Otof coding sequence. Upon early postnatal injection into the cochlea of Otof-KO mice, overloaded AAVs drove specific expression of otoferlin in ~30% of all IHCs, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence labeling and polymerase chain reaction. Recordings of auditory brainstem responses and a behavioral assay demonstrated partial restoration of hearing. Together, our results suggest that viral gene therapy of DFNB9—using a single overloaded AAV vector—is indeed feasible, reducing the complexity of gene transfer compared to dual-AAV approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) are prevalent worldwide. mTBIs can impair hippocampal-based functions such as memory and cause network hyperexcitability of the dentate gyrus (DG), a key entry point to hippocampal circuitry. One candidate for mediating mTBI-induced hippocampal cognitive and physiological dysfunction is injury-induced changes in the process of DG neurogenesis. There are conflicting results on how TBI impacts the process of DG neurogenesis; this is not surprising given that both the neurogenesis process and the post-injury period are dynamic, and that the quantification of neurogenesis varies widely in the literature. Even within the minority of TBI studies focusing specifically on mild injuries, there is disagreement about if and how mTBI changes the process of DG neurogenesis. Here we utilized a clinically relevant rodent model of mTBI (lateral fluid percussion injury, LFPI), gold-standard markers and quantification of the neurogenesis process, and three time points post-injury to generate a comprehensive picture of how mTBI affects adult hippocampal DG neurogenesis. Male C57BL/6J mice (6-8 weeks old) received either sham surgery or mTBI via LFPI. Proliferating cells, neuroblasts/immature neurons, and surviving cells were quantified via stereology in DG subregions (subgranular zone [SGZ], outer granule cell layer [oGCL], molecular layer, and hilus) at short-term (3 days post-injury, dpi), intermediate (7 dpi), and long-term (31 dpi) time points. The data show this model of mTBI induces transient, sequential increases in ipsilateral SGZ/GCL proliferating cells, neuroblasts/immature neurons, and surviving cells which is suggestive of mTBI-induced neurogenesis. In contrast to these ipsilateral hemisphere findings, measures in the contralateral hemisphere were not increased in key neurogenic DG subregions after LFPI. Our work in this mTBI model is in line with most literature on other and more severe models of TBI in showing TBI stimulates the process of DG neurogenesis. However, as our DG data in mTBI provide temporal, subregional, and neurogenesis-stage resolution, these data are important to consider in regard to the functional importance of TBI-induction of the neurogenesis process and future work assessing the potential of replacing and/or repairing DG neurons in the brain after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Epigenetic clocks are among the most promising biomarkers of aging. It is particularly important to establish biomarkers of brain aging to better understand neurodegenerative diseases. To advance application of epigenetic clocks—which were largely created with DNA methylation levels in blood samples—for use in brain, we need clearer evaluation of epigenetic clock behavior in brain, including direct comparisons of brain specimens with blood, a more accessible tissue for research. We leveraged data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine three established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge clocks) and a newer clock, trained in cortical tissue. We calculated each clock in three different specimens: (1) antemortem CD4+ cells derived from blood (n = 41); (2) postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, n = 730); and (3) postmortem posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, n = 186), among older women and men, age 66–108 years at death. Across all clocks, epigenetic age calculated from blood and brain specimens was generally lower than chronologic age, although differences were smallest for the Cortical clock when calculated in the brain specimens. Nonetheless, we found that Pearson correlations of epigenetic to chronologic ages in brain specimens were generally reasonable for all clocks; correlations for the Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge clocks largely ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 (all p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The Cortical clock outperformed the other clocks, reaching a correlation of 0.83 in the DLFPC (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) for epigenetic vs. chronologic age. Nonetheless, epigenetic age was quite modestly correlated across blood and DLPFC in 41 participants with paired samples [Pearson r from 0.21 (p = 0.2) to 0.32 (p = 0.05)], indicating that broader research in neurodegeneration may benefit from clocks using CpG sites better conserved across blood and brain. Finally, in analyses stratified by sex, by pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, and by clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia, correlations of epigenetic to chronologic age remained consistently high across all groups. Future research in brain aging will benefit from epigenetic clocks constructed in brain specimens, including exploration of any advantages of focusing on CpG sites conserved across brain and other tissue types.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dance has traditionally been viewed from a Eurocentric perspective as a mode of self-expression that involves the human body moving through space, performed for the purposes of art, and viewed by an audience. In this Hypothesis and Theory article, we synthesize findings from anthropology, sociology, psychology, dance pedagogy, and neuroscience to propose The Synchronicity Hypothesis of Dance, which states that humans dance to enhance both intra- and inter-brain synchrony. We outline a neurocentric definition of dance, which suggests that dance involves neurobehavioral processes in seven distinct areas including sensory, motor, cognitive, social, emotional, rhythmic, and creative. We explore The Synchronicity Hypothesis of Dance through several avenues. First, we examine evolutionary theories of dance, which suggest that dance drives interpersonal coordination. Second, we examine fundamental movement patterns, which emerge throughout development and are omnipresent across cultures of the world. Third, we examine how each of the seven neurobehaviors increases intra- and inter-brain synchrony. Fourth, we examine the neuroimaging literature on dance to identify the brain regions most involved in and affected by dance. The findings presented here support our hypothesis that we engage in dance for the purpose of intrinsic reward, which as a result of dance-induced increases in neural synchrony, leads to enhanced interpersonal coordination. This hypothesis suggests that dance may be helpful to repattern oscillatory activity, leading to clinical improvements in autism spectrum disorder and other disorders with oscillatory activity impairments. Finally, we offer suggestions for future directions and discuss the idea that our consciousness can be redefined not just as an individual process but as a shared experience that we can positively influence by dancing together.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There is a relationship between reading and math skills, as well as comorbidity between reading and math disorders. A mutual foundation for this comorbidity could be that the quality of phonological representations is important for both early reading and arithmetic. In this study, we examine this hypothesis in a sample traced longitudinally from preschool to first grade (N = 259). The results show that phonological awareness does not explain development in arithmetic, but that there is an indirect effect between phoneme awareness in preschool and arithmetic in first grade via phoneme awareness in first grade. This effect is, however, weak and restricted to verbal arithmetic and not arithmetic fluency. This finding is only partly in line with other studies, and a reason could be that this study more strongly controls for confounders and previous skills than other studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The last 15 years have seen an explosion of new findings on the role of complement, a major arm of the immune system, in the central nervous system (CNS) compartment including contributions to cell migration, elimination of synapse during development, aberrant synapse pruning in neurologic disorders, damage to nerve cells in autoimmune diseases, and traumatic injury. Activation of the complement system in multiple sclerosis (MS) is typically thought to occur as part of a primary (auto)immune response from the periphery (the outside) against CNS antigens (the inside). However, evidence of local complement production from CNS-resident cells, intracellular complement functions, and the more recently discovered role of early complement components in shaping synaptic circuits in the absence of inflammation opens up the possibility that complement-related sequelae may start and finish within the brain itself. In this review, the complement system will be introduced, followed by evidence that implicates complement in shaping the developing, adult, and normal aging CNS as well as its contribution to pathology in neurodegenerative conditions. Discussion of data supporting “outside-in” vs. “inside-out” roles of complement in MS will be presented, concluded by thoughts on potential approaches to therapies targeting specific elements of the complement system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: Dementia is increasing in prevalence in aging populations. Current questionnaire-based cognitive assessments may not comprehensively assess cognitive function and real-time task-performance. Virtual reality (VR) technology has been used in cognitive assessments but existing systems have limited scope in evaluating all cognitive domains. We have developed a novel, fully-immersive VR system (CAVIRE: Cognitive Assessment by VIrtual REality), which incorporates automated audio-visual instructions. An automated scoring matrix to assess the six cognitive domains—perceptual-motor function, executive function, complex attention, social cognition, learning and memory, and language—is embedded in the CAVIRE system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aims: The primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of using the CAVIRE system to assess cognitive function of participants across different age groups from 35 to 84 years old. The secondary aims are to determine the CAVIRE performance-indices (completion time and scores) of the participants and to assess their acceptability toward the use of CAVIRE as a modality for cognitive assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One hundred and seventy-five participants will be assessed by CAVIRE at a primary care clinic in Singapore. They will be first assessed using questionnaires: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADLs), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). Those aged 65–84 years will be grouped into cognitively intact (n = 50, MoCA score ≥ 26) and cognitively impaired (n = 50, MoCA &amp;lt; 26). The CAVIRE performance-indices of cognitively healthy younger participants aged 35–64 years (n = 75) will serve as benchmark references. CAVIRE auto-computes the participant's performance-indices in 13 different segments. The tasks include domestic chores, memory, shopping, and social interactions. The proportion of participants who complete the entire VR assessment in each age group will be evaluated as feasibility indicators. The CAVIRE performance-indices will be compared across the different age groups. Feedback on the acceptability of the CAVIRE system will be collated and compared among the participants across the age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: CAVIRE is designed to assess the six domains of cognitive function using VR. The results of this feasibility study will provide insights for the implementation of the CAVIRE system as an alternative modality of cognitive assessment in the community.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Pannexin 1 (Panx1) is a membrane channel implicated in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes via its ability to support release of ATP and other cellular metabolites for local intercellular signaling. However, to date, there has been no direct demonstration of large molecule permeation via the Panx1 channel itself, and thus the permselectivity of Panx1 for different molecules remains unknown. To address this, we expressed, purified and reconstituted Panx1 into proteoliposomes and demonstrated that channel activation by caspase cleavage yields a dye-permeable pore that favors flux of anionic, large-molecule permeants (up to ~1 kDa). Large cationic molecules can also permeate the channel, albeit at a much lower rate. We further show that Panx1 channels provide a molecular pathway for flux of ATP and other anionic (glutamate) and cationic signaling metabolites (spermidine). These results verify large molecule permeation directly through activated Panx1 channels that can support their many physiological roles.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The NLRP1 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that is a potent activator of inflammation. Mouse NLRP1B can be activated through proteolytic cleavage by the bacterial Lethal Toxin (LeTx) protease, resulting in degradation of the N-terminal domains of NLRP1B and liberation of the bioactive C-terminal domain, which includes the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). However, natural pathogen-derived effectors that can activate human NLRP1 have remained unknown. Here, we use an evolutionary model to identify several proteases from diverse picornaviruses that cleave human NLRP1 within a rapidly evolving region of the protein, leading to host-specific and virus-specific activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome. Our work demonstrates that NLRP1 acts as a “tripwire” to recognize the enzymatic function of a wide range of viral proteases, and suggests that host mimicry of viral polyprotein cleavage sites can be an evolutionary strategy to activate a robust inflammatory immune response.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The DNA-binding protein H-NS is a pleiotropic gene regulator in gram-negative bacteria. Through its capacity to sense temperature and other environmental factors, H-NS allows pathogens like Salmonella to adapt their gene expression to their presence inside or outside warm-blooded hosts. To investigate how this sensing mechanism may have evolved to fit different bacterial lifestyles, we compared H-NS orthologs from bacteria that infect humans, plants, and insects, and from bacteria that live on a deep-sea hypothermal vent. The combination of biophysical characterization, high-resolution proton-less NMR spectroscopy and molecular simulations revealed, at an atomistic level, how the same general mechanism was adapted to specific habitats and lifestyles. In particular, we demonstrate how environment-sensing characteristics arise from specifically positioned intra- or intermolecular electrostatic interactions. Our integrative approach clarified the exact modus operandi for H-NS–mediated environmental sensing and suggests that this sensing mechanism resulted from the exaptation of an ancestral protein feature.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The midbrain dorsal raphe (DR) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) contain two of the brain's main ascending neuromodulatory transmitters: serotonin and dopamine. We studied the pathway from DR to VTA using single-cell RNA sequencing, anatomical tracing, and electrophysiology and behavior in mice. Single-cell sequencing confirmed a differential distribution of dopamine cell types between medial and lateral aspects of the VTA. This molecular diversity included differential expression of a subset of glutamatergic and serotonergic receptors. Anatomical data showed that distinct serotonergic and glutamatergic populations of DR neurons project to distinct medial-lateral locations in VTA. Physiological data showed that serotonergic neurons are positioned to excite putative dopaminergic neurons in lateral VTA on short timescales (within trial), and inhibit them on long timescales (on the next trial). Our results reveal precise anatomical specificity of DR projections to VTA, and suggest a functional role for serotonergic modulation of dopaminergic function across multiple timescales.</content>

 The ability to detect and respond to linguistic errors is critical for successful reading comprehension, but these skills can vary considerably across readers. In the current study, healthy adults (age 18-35) read short discourse scenarios for comprehension while monitoring for the presence of semantic anomalies. Using a factor analytic approach, we examined if performance in non-linguistic conflict monitoring tasks (Stroop, AX-CPT) would predict individual differences in neural and behavioral measures of linguistic error processing. Consistent with our hypothesis, domain-general conflict monitoring predicted both readers' end-of-trial acceptability judgments and the amplitude of a late neural response (the P600) evoked by linguistic anomalies. Interestingly, the influence on the P600 was non-linear, suggesting that online neural responses to linguistic errors are influenced by both the effectiveness and efficiency of domain-general conflict monitoring. These relationships were also highly specific and remained after controlling for variability in working memory capacity and verbal knowledge. Finally, we found that domain-general conflict monitoring also predicted individual variability in measures of reading comprehension, and that this relationship was partially mediated by behavioral measures of linguistic error detection. These findings inform our understanding of the role of domain-general executive functions in reading comprehension, with potential implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language impairments.</content>

 Introduction. The last decade has seen a surge in well powered genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of complex behavioural traits, disorders, and more recently, of brain structural and functional neuroimaging features. However, the extreme polygenicity of these complex traits makes it difficult to translate the GWAS signal into mechanistic biological insights. We postulate that the covariance of SNP-effects across many brain features, as be captured by latent genomic components of SNP effect sizes. These may partly reflect the concerted multi-locus genomic effects through known molecular pathways and protein-protein interactions. Here, we test the feasibility of a new data-driven method to derive such latent components of genome-wide effects on more than thousand neuroimaging derived traits, and investigate their utility in interpreting the complex biological processes that shape the GWAS signal. Methods. We downloaded the GWAS summary statistics of 3,143 brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from the UK Biobank, provided by the Oxford Brain Imaging Genetics (BIG) Server (Elliott et al. 2018). Probabilistic independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract two hundred independent genomic components from the matrix of SNP-effect sizes. We qualitatively describe the distribution of the latent component's loadings in the neuroimaging and the genomic dimensions. Gene-wide statistics were calculated for each genomic component. We tested the genomic component's enrichment for molecular pathways using MSigDB, and for single-cell RNA-sequencing of adult and foetal brain cells. Results. 200 components explained 80% of the variance in SNP-effects sizes. Each MRI modality and data processing method projected the imaging data into a clearly distinct cluster in the genomic component embedded space. Among the 200 genomic components, 157 were clearly driven by a single locus, while 39 were highly polygenic. Together, these 39 components were significantly enriched for 2,274 MSigDB gene sets (fully corrected for multiple testing across gene-sets and components). Several components were sensitive to molecular pathways, single cell expression profiles, and brain traits in patterns consistent with knowledge across these biological levels. To illustrate this, we highlight a component that implicated axonal regeneration pathways, which was specifically enriched for gene expression in oligodendrocyte precursors, microglia and astrocytes, and loaded highly on white matter neuroimaging traits. We highlight a second component that implicated synaptic function and neuron projection organization pathways that was specifically enriched for neuronal cell transcriptomes. Conclusion. We propose genomic ICA as a new method to identify latent genetic factors influencing brain structure and function by multimodal MRI. The derived latent genomic dimensions are highly sensitive to known molecular pathways and cell-specific gene expression profiles. Genomic ICA may help to disentangle the many different biological routes by which the genome defines the inter-individual variation of the brain. Future research is aimed at using this method to profile individual subjects' genomic data along the new latent dimensions and evaluating the utility of these dimensions in stratifying heterogeneous patient populations.</content>

 Cisplatin is a mainstay of systemic therapy for a variety of cancers, such as lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and ovarian cancer. However, resistance to cisplatin represents one of the most significant barriers for patient outcome improvement.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroplasticity in N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptor signaling in subregions of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla following sedentary versus physically active conditions&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/151bfa20-c8e3-43b3-9e6e-1d596bd57109/cne25094-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which the brain undergoes neuroplasticity during sedentary versus active conditions are important in understanding how a sedentary lifestyle has become the leading cause of death due to modifiable risk factors. Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate ongoing sympathetic vasoconstriction and cardiac function under normal conditions, and their activity appears heightened in models of cardiovascular disease associated with sympathetic overactivity. The current study provides evidence of activity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM via increased glutamate levels and increased expression of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐aspartic acid receptors in the RVLM of sedentary compared to active rats. These mechanisms produce a complex framework by which RVLM neurons increase their influence on sympathoexcitation in sedentary compared to physically active conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brain region involved in normal regulation of the cardiovascular system and heightened sympathoexcitatory states of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among major risk factors for CVD, sedentary lifestyles contribute to higher mortality than other modifiable risk factors. Previous studies suggest excessive glutamatergic excitation of presympathetic neurons in the RVLM occurs in sedentary animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine neuroplasticity in the glutamatergic system in the RVLM of sedentary and physically active rats. We hypothesized that relative to active rats, sedentary rats would exhibit higher expression of glutamate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐aspartic acid receptor subunits (GluN), phosphoGluN1, and the excitatory scaffold protein postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), while achieving higher glutamate levels. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (4 weeks old) were divided into sedentary and active (running wheel) conditions for 10–12 weeks. We used retrograde tracing/triple‐labeling techniques, western blotting, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report in sedentary versus physically active rats: 1) fewer bulbospinal non‐C1 neurons positive for GluN1, 2) significantly higher expression of GluN1 and GluN2B but lower levels of phosphoGluN1 (pSer896) and PSD95, and 3) higher levels of glutamate in the RVLM. Higher GluN expression is consistent with enhanced sympathoexcitation in sedentary animals; however, a more complex neuroplasticity occurs within subregions of the ventrolateral medulla. Our results in rodents may also indicate that alterations in glutamatergic excitation of the RVLM contribute to the increased incidence of CVD in humans who lead sedentary lifestyles. Thus, there is a strong need to further pursue mechanisms of inactivity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The chi-square periodogram (CSP), developed over 40 years ago, continues to be one of the most popular methods to estimate the period of circadian (circa 24-h) rhythms. Previous work has indicated the CSP is sometimes less accurate than other methods, but understanding of why and under what conditions remains incomplete. Using simulated rhythmic time-courses, we found that the CSP is prone to underestimating the period in a manner that depends on the true period and the length of the time-course. This underestimation bias is most severe in short time-courses (e.g., 3 days), but is also visible in longer simulated time-courses (e.g., 12 days) and in experimental time-courses of mouse wheel-running and ex vivo bioluminescence. We traced the source of the bias to discontinuities in the periodogram that are related to the number of time-points the CSP uses to calculate the observed variance for a given test period. By revising the calculation to avoid discontinuities, we developed a new version, the greedy CSP, that shows reduced bias and improved accuracy. Nonetheless, even the greedy CSP tended to be less accurate on our simulated time-courses than an alternative method, namely the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Thus, although our study describes a major improvement to a classic method, it also suggests that users should generally avoid the CSP when estimating the period of biological rhythms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GLnerg7E1a8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Phylogeographic inference allows reconstruction of past geographical spread of pathogens or living organisms by integrating genetic and geographic data. A popular model in continuous phylogeography—with location data provided in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates—describes spread as a Brownian motion (Brownian Motion Phylogeography, BMP) in continuous space and time, akin to similar models of continuous trait evolution. Here, we show that reconstructions using this model can be strongly affected by sampling biases, such as the lack of sampling from certain areas. As an attempt to reduce the effects of sampling bias on BMP, we consider the addition of sequence-free samples from under-sampled areas. While this approach alleviates the effects of sampling bias, in most scenarios this will not be a viable option due to the need for prior knowledge of an outbreak’s spatial distribution. We therefore consider an alternative model, the spatial Λ-Fleming-Viot process (ΛFV), which has recently gained popularity in population genetics. Despite the ΛFV’s robustness to sampling biases, we find that the different assumptions of the ΛFV and BMP models result in different applicabilities, with the ΛFV being more appropriate for scenarios of endemic spread, and BMP being more appropriate for recent outbreaks or colonizations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A4faYaa8IVQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Investigating metabolic functional capability of a human gut microbiome enables the quantification of microbiome changes, which can cause a phenotypic change of host physiology and disease. One possible way to estimate the functional capability of a microbial community is through inferring metagenomic content from 16S rRNA gene sequences. Genome-scale models (GEMs) can be used as scaffold for functional estimation analysis at a systematic level, however up to date, there is no integrative toolbox based on GEMs for uncovering metabolic functions. Here, we developed the MetGEMs (metagenome-scale models) toolbox, an open-source application for inferring metabolic functions from 16S rRNA gene sequences to facilitate the study of the human gut microbiome by the wider scientific community. The developed toolbox was validated using shotgun metagenomic data and shown to be superior in predicting functional composition in human clinical samples compared to existing state-of-the-art tools. Therefore, the MetGEMs toolbox was subsequently applied for annotating putative enzyme functions and metabolic routes related in human disease using atopic dermatitis as a case study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cvRxw_0L_cQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are prevalent in the eukaryotic proteome. Common functional roles of IDRs include forming flexible linkers or undergoing allosteric folding-upon-binding. Recent studies have suggested an additional functional role for IDRs: generating steric pressure on the plasma membrane during endocytosis, via molecular crowding. However, in order to accomplish useful functions, such crowding needs to be regulated in space (e.g., endocytic hotspots) and time (e.g., during vesicle formation). In this work, we explore binding-induced regulation of IDR steric volume. We simulate the IDRs of two proteins from Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) to see if their conformational spaces are regulated via binding-induced expansion. Using Monte-Carlo computational modeling of excluded volumes, we generate large conformational ensembles (3 million) for the IDRs of Epsin and Eps15 and dock the conformers to the alpha subunit of Adaptor Protein 2 (AP2α), their CME binding partner. Our results show that as more molecules of AP2α are bound, the Epsin-derived ensemble shows a significant increase in global dimensions, measured as the radius of Gyration (R&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) and the end-to-end distance (EED). Unlike Epsin, Eps15-derived conformers that permit AP2α binding at one motif were found to be more likely to accommodate binding of AP2α at other motifs, suggesting a tendency toward co-accessibility of binding motifs. Co-accessibility was not observed for any pair of binding motifs in Epsin. Thus, we speculate that the disordered regions of Epsin and Eps15 perform different roles during CME, with accessibility in Eps15 allowing it to act as a recruiter of AP2α molecules, while binding-induced expansion of the Epsin disordered region could impose steric pressure and remodel the plasma membrane during vesicle formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O_Mks-JSRUk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

With an estimated $10.4 billion in medical costs and 31.4 million outpatient visits each year, influenza poses a serious burden of disease in the United States. To provide insights and advance warning into the spread of influenza, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs a challenge for forecasting weighted influenza-like illness (wILI) at the national and regional level. Many models produce independent forecasts for each geographical unit, ignoring the constraint that the national wILI is a weighted sum of regional wILI, where the weights correspond to the population size of the region. We propose a novel algorithm that transforms a set of independent forecast distributions to obey this constraint, which we refer to as probabilistically coherent. Enforcing probabilistic coherence led to an increase in forecast skill for 79% of the models we tested over multiple flu seasons, highlighting the importance of respecting the forecasting system’s geographical hierarchy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4BkC14wLJxg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

To ensure genome stability, sexually reproducing organisms require that mating brings together exactly 2 haploid gametes and that meiosis occurs only in diploid zygotes. In the fission yeast &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt;, fertilization triggers the Mei3-Pat1-Mei2 signaling cascade, which represses subsequent mating and initiates meiosis. Here, we establish a degron system to specifically degrade proteins postfusion and demonstrate that mating blocks not only safeguard zygote ploidy but also prevent lysis caused by aberrant fusion attempts. Using long-term imaging and flow-cytometry approaches, we identify previously unrecognized and independent roles for Mei3 and Mei2 in zygotes. We show that Mei3 promotes premeiotic S-phase independently of Mei2 and that cell cycle progression is both necessary and sufficient to reduce zygotic mating behaviors. Mei2 not only imposes the meiotic program and promotes the meiotic cycle, but also blocks mating behaviors independently of Mei3 and cell cycle progression. Thus, we find that fungi preserve zygote ploidy and survival by at least 2 mechanisms where the zygotic fate imposed by Mei2 and the cell cycle reentry triggered by Mei3 synergize to prevent zygotic mating.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kthJfvLIOcg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Collective migration of cohesive tissues is a fundamental process in morphogenesis and is particularly well illustrated during gastrulation by the rapid and massive internalization of the mesoderm, which contrasts with the much more modest movements of the ectoderm. In the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; embryo, the differences in morphogenetic capabilities of ectoderm and mesoderm can be connected to the intrinsic motility of individual cells, very low for ectoderm, highly for mesoderm. Surprisingly, we find that these seemingly deep differences can be accounted for simply by differences in Rho-kinases (Rock)-dependent actomyosin contractility. We show that Rock inhibition is sufficient to rapidly unleash motility in the ectoderm and confer it with mesoderm-like properties. In the mesoderm, this motility is dependent on 2 negative regulators of RhoA, the small GTPase Rnd1 and the RhoGAP Shirin/Dlc2/ArhGAP37. Both are absolutely essential for gastrulation. At the cellular and tissue level, the 2 regulators show overlapping yet distinct functions. They both contribute to decrease cortical tension and confer motility, but Shirin tends to increase tissue fluidity and stimulate dispersion, while Rnd1 tends to favor more compact collective migration. Thus, each is able to contribute to a specific property of the migratory behavior of the mesoderm. We propose that the “ectoderm to mesoderm transition” is a prototypic case of collective migration driven by a down-regulation of cellular tension, without the need for the complex changes traditionally associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/T_ck0PJhOhs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor increases matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 14 expression in microglia and promotes microglia‐mediated glioma progression&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c07dfb8c-7e6d-4932-9a36-cd1f24bb6d1a/jnr24768-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor derived from glioma cells upregulate matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 14 expression on microglia, which in turn promote glioma progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is released by glioma cells and promotes tumor growth. We have previously found that GDNF released from the tumor cells is a chemoattractant for microglial cells, the immune cells of the central nervous system. Here we show that GDNF increases matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP14 expression in cultured microglial cells from mixed sexes of neonatal mice. The GDNF‐induced microglial MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation is mediated by GDNF family receptor alpha 1 receptors and dependent on p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling. In organotypic brain slices, GDNF promotes the growth of glioma and this effect depends on the presence of microglia. We also previously found that MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation can be mediated by Toll‐like receptor (TLR) 2 signaling and here we demonstrate that GDNF increases the expression of TLR1 and TLR2. In conclusion, GDNF promotes the pro‐tumorigenic phenotype of microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Gamma‐protocadherin localization at the synapse is associated with parameters of synaptic maturation&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d4dec52-fa7a-4524-86ef-fdb42363748e/cne25102-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serial section immuno‐electron microscopy of gamma protocadherins (Pcdh‐γs), a subset of clustered protocadherins, at synapses in CA1. We characterized synaptic diameter and perforation status for synapses labeled with antibodies to Pcdh‐γs and found that they were larger with more frequent perforations. Results were confirmed by light level imaging of immunolabeled synapses. The results suggest that clustered protocadherins may mediate a late event in synaptic development. Bar = 500 nm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a family of ~60 cadherin‐like proteins (divided into subclasses α, β, and γ) that regulate dendrite morphology and neural connectivity. Their expression is controlled through epigenetic regulation at a gene cluster encoding the molecules. During neural development, Pcdhs mediate dendrite self‐avoidance in some neuronal types through an uncharacterized anti‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs are also important for dendritic complexity in cortical neurons likely through a pro‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs have also been postulated to participate in synaptogenesis and connectivity. Some synaptic defects were noted in knockout animals, including synaptic number and physiology, but the role of these molecules in synaptic development is not understood. The effect of Pcdh knockout on dendritic patterning may present a confound to studying synaptogenesis. We showed previously that Pcdh‐γs are highly enriched in intracellular compartments in dendrites and spines with localization at only a few synaptic clefts. To gain insight into how Pcdh‐γs might affect synapses, we compared synapses that harbored Pcdh‐γs versus those that did not for parameters of synaptic maturation including pre‐ and postsynaptic size, postsynaptic perforations, and spine morphology by light microscopy in cultured hippocampal neurons and by serial section immuno‐electron microscopy in hippocampal CA1. In mature neurons, synapses immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs were larger in diameter with more frequent perforations. Analysis of spines in cultured neurons revealed that mushroom spines were more frequently immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs at their tips than thin spines. These results suggest that Pcdh‐γ function at the synapse may be related to promotion of synaptic maturation and stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Gamma frequency oscillations (25-140 Hz), observed in the neural activities
within many brain regions, have long been regarded as a physiological basis
underlying many brain functions, such as memory and attention. Among numerous
theoretical and computational modeling studies, gamma oscillations have been
found in biologically realistic spiking network models of the primary visual
cortex. However, due to its high dimensionality and strong nonlinearity, it is
generally difficult to perform detailed theoretical analysis of the emergent
gamma dynamics. Here we propose a suite of Markovian model reduction methods
with varying levels of complexity and applied it to spiking network models
exhibiting heterogeneous dynamical regimes, ranging from homogeneous firing to
strong synchrony in the gamma band. The reduced models not only successfully
reproduce gamma band oscillations in the full model, but also exhibit the same
dynamical features as we vary parameters. Most remarkably, the invariant
measure of the coarse-grained Markov process reveals a two-dimensional surface
in state space upon which the gamma dynamics mainly resides. Our results
suggest that the statistical features of gamma oscillations strongly depend on
the subthreshold neuronal distributions. Because of the generality of the
Markovian assumptions, our dimensional reduction methods offer a powerful
toolbox for theoretical examinations of many other complex cortical
spatio-temporal behaviors observed in both neurophysiological experiments and
numerical simulations.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In the past few years, the interest towards the implementation of
design-for-demise measures has increased steadily. Most mid-sized satellites
currently launched and already in orbit fail to comply with the casualty risk
threshold of 0.0001. Therefore, satellites manufacturers and mission operators
need to perform a disposal through a controlled re-entry, which has a higher
cost and increased complexity. Through the design-for-demise paradigm, this
additional cost and complexity can be removed as the spacecraft is directly
compliant with the casualty risk regulations. However, building a spacecraft
such that most of its parts will demise may lead to designs that are more
vulnerable to space debris impacts, thus compromising the reliability of the
mission. In fact, the requirements connected to the demisability and the
survivability are in general competing. Given this competing nature, trade-off
solutions can be found, which favour the implementation of design-for-demise
measures while still maintaining the spacecraft resilient to space debris
impacts. A multi-objective optimisation framework has been developed by the
authors in previous works. The framework's objective is to find preliminary
design solutions considering the competing nature of the demisability and the
survivability of a spacecraft since the early stages of the mission design. In
this way, a more integrated design can be achieved. The present work focuses on
the improvement of the multi-objective optimisation framework by including
constraints. The paper shows the application of the constrained optimisation to
two relevant examples: the optimisation of a tank assembly and the optimisation
of a typical satellite configuration.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The study of attentional processing in vision has a long and deep history.
Recently, several papers have presented insightful perspectives into how the
coordination of multiple attentional functions in the brain might occur. These
begin with experimental observations and the authors propose structures,
processes, and computations that might explain those observations. Here, we
consider a perspective that past works have not, as a complementary approach to
the experimentally-grounded ones. We approach the same problem as past authors
but from the other end of the computational spectrum, from the problem nature,
as Marr's Computational Level would prescribe. What problem must the brain
solve when orchestrating attentional processes in order to successfully
complete one of the myriad possible visuospatial tasks at which we as humans
excel? The hope, of course, is for the approaches to eventually meet and thus
form a complete theory, but this is likely not soon. We make the first steps
towards this by addressing the necessity of attentional control, examining the
breadth and computational difficulty of the visuospatial and attentional tasks
seen in human behavior, and suggesting a sketch of how attentional control
might arise in the brain. The key conclusions of this paper are that an
executive controller is necessary for human attentional function in vision, and
that there is a 'first principles' computational approach to its understanding
that is complementary to the previous approaches that focus on modelling or
learning from experimental observations directly.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Superficial siderosis describes haemosiderin deposition on the surface of the brain. When present on infratentorial structures, it can cause ataxia, sensorineural hearing loss and pyramidal signs. There is no proven treatment and patients experience slow progression of symptoms. Iron-chelating agents have been suggested as a therapeutic option and deferiprone is suited as it crosses the blood-brain barrier. However, deferiprone is reported to have a 1–2% risk of agranulocytosis. We performed a systematic review on treatment of infratentorial superficial siderosis with deferiprone based on PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if in English or an English language translation was available, were about human subjects and referred to patients with ataxia. Studies were excluded if they did not possess an English translation, included animal studies or did not have ataxia. Studies were excluded if they discussed cerebral amyloid angiopathy or siderosis of other regions. Eleven papers were included. We identified 69 patients. Seventeen patients (25%) discontinued the drug. The most encountered adverse effect was anaemia (21.7%). Neutropaenia was observed in 8.7% and agranulocytosis in 5.8% of patients. Clinically, response varied, and stability or improvement was seen across neurological domains in 6 studies while 5 showed a mixed response. On imaging, 13 (28.9%) patients improved, 24 (53.3%) stabilised and 8 (17.8%) deteriorated. A prospective international centralised register of patients should be developed to inform the design and conduct of a multicentre, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of deferiprone. The evidence from this systematic review is that deferiprone is a promising intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The existence of Gram-negative bacteria in the brain, regardless of underlying immune status has been demonstrated by recent studies. The colocalization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1-40/42&lt;/sub&gt; in amyloid plaques supports the hypothesis that brain microbes may be the cause, triggering chronic neuroinflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate the behavioral changes induced by infectious neuroinflammation, we chose the third ventricle as the site of a single LPS injection (20 μg or 80 μg) in male Wistar rats to avoid mechanical injury to forebrain structures while inducing widespread inflammation throughout the brain. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by LPS resulted in depressive-like behaviors and the impairment of spatial learning; however, there was no evidence of the development of pathological hallmarks (e.g., the phosphorylation of tau) for 10 months following LPS injection. The acceleration of cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 and the retardation of cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR were observed in the hippocampus of rats treated with either low-dose or high-dose LPS. The rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol metabolism (CYP46A1) in SH-SY5Y cells and synthesis (HMGCR) in U251 cells were altered by inflammation stimulators, including LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The data suggest that chronic neuroinflammation provoked by the administration of LPS into the third ventricle may induce depressive-like symptoms and that the loss of cholesterol might be a biomarker of chronic neuroinflammation. The lack of pathological hallmarks of AD in our model indicates that Gram-negative bacteria infection might not be a single cause of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;At present, the standard practices for home-based assessments of abnormal movements in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are based either on subjective tools or on objective measures that often fail to capture day-to-day fluctuations and long-term information in real-life conditions in a way that patient’s compliance and privacy are secured. The employment of wearable technologies in PD represents a great paradigm shift in healthcare remote diagnostics and therapeutics monitoring. However, their applicability in everyday clinical practice seems to be still limited. We carried out a systematic search across the Medline Database. In total, 246 publications, published until 1 June 2020, were identified. Among them, 26 reports met the inclusion criteria and were included in the present review. We focused more on clinically relevant aspects of wearables’ application including feasibility and efficacy of the assessment, the number, type and body position of the wearable devices, type of PD motor symptom, environment and duration of assessments and validation methodology. The aim of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the current knowledge and state-of-the-art of the home-based assessment of motor symptoms and fluctuations in PD patients using wearable technology, highlighting current problems and laying foundations for future works.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interoception and impulsivity are two multi-dimensional constructs and although the role of interoception in impulsiveness has been previously reported, it is not clear whether their different facets are related to each other. In the present study, we aimed at bridging this gap by investigating the relationships between interoception and impulsivity in the light of their multi-dimensional nature. To this aim, we conducted a cross-task comparison and assessed in the same sample of healthy participants, interoceptive accuracy, by the heartbeat perception task, interoceptive sensibility, by a self-reported measure, “hot” impulsivity, by a behavioural task of risk taking, and “cool” impulsivity, by a go/no-go task. Also, we assessed trait impulsivity by a self-report measure. We found that interoceptive sensibility contributed to “hot” impulsivity, while interoceptive accuracy was related to non-planning trait impulsivity. These findings underscore the need to investigate at a finer grain the relationships between these two complex, multi-dimensional constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;How timing behavior is altered in different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders is a contemporary research question. Genetic murine models (GMM) that offer high construct validity also serve as useful tools to investigate this question. But the literature on timing behavior of different GMMs largely remains to be consolidated. The current paper addresses this gap by reviewing studies that have been conducted with GMMs of neurodevelopmental (e.g. ADHD, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder), neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease) as well as circadian and other mutant lines. The review focuses on those studies that specifically utilized the peak interval procedure to improve the comparability of findings both within and between different disease models. The reviewed studies revealed timing deficits that are characteristic of different disorders. Specifically, Huntington’s disease models had weaker temporal control over the termination of their anticipatory responses, Alzheimer’s disease models had earlier timed responses, schizophrenia models had weaker temporal control, circadian mutants had shifted timed responses consistent with shifts in the circadian periods. The differences in timing behavior were less consistent for other conditions such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and mutations related to intellectual disability. We discuss the implications of these findings for the neural basis of an internal stopwatch. Finally, we make methodological recommendations for future research for improving the comparability of the timing behavior across different murine models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Preterm infants exposed to supraphysiological oxygen (hyperoxia) during the neonatal period have hippocampal atrophy and cognitive dysfunction later in childhood and as adolescents. Previously, we reported that 14-week-old adult mice exposed to hyperoxia as newborns had spatial memory deficits and hippocampal shrinkage, findings that mirror those of human adolescents who were born preterm. The area CA1 region of the hippocampus that is crucial for spatial learning and memory is highly vulnerable to oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of neonatal hyperoxia exposure on hippocampal CA3–CA1 synaptic function. Male and female C57BL/6J mouse pups were continuously exposed to either 85% normobaric oxygen or air between postnatal days 2–14. Hippocampal slice electrophysiology at CA3–CA1 synapses was then performed at 14 weeks of age. We observed that hyperoxia exposed mice have heightened strength of basal synaptic transmission measured in input-output curves, increased fiber volley amplitude indicating increased axonal excitability, and heightened LTP magnitude at CA3–CA1 synapses, likely a consequence of increased postsynaptic depolarization during tetanus. These data demonstrate that supraphysiological oxygen exposure during the critical neonatal developmental period leads to pathologically heightened CA3–CA1 synaptic function during early adulthood which may contribute to hippocampal shrinkage and learning and memory deficits we previously reported. Furthermore, these results will help shed light on the consequences of hyperoxia exposure on the development of hippocampal synaptic circuit abnormalities that could be contributing to cognitive deficits in children born preterm.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the effect of resolution on iron content using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM); to verify the consistency of QSM across field strengths and manufacturers in evaluating the iron content of deep gray matter (DGM) of the human brain using subjects from multiple sites; and to establish a susceptibility baseline as a function of age for each DGM structure using both a global and regional iron analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Data from 623 healthy adults, ranging from 20 to 90 years old, were collected across 3 sites using gradient echo imaging on one 1.5 Tesla and two 3.0 Tesla MR scanners. Eight subcortical gray matter nuclei were semi-automatically segmented using a full-width half maximum threshold-based analysis of the QSM data. Mean susceptibility, volume and total iron content with age correlations were evaluated for each measured structure for both the whole-region and RII (high iron content regions) analysis. For the purpose of studying the effect of resolution on QSM, a digitized model of the brain was applied.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean susceptibilities of the caudate nucleus (CN), globus pallidus (GP) and putamen (PUT) were not significantly affected by changing the slice thickness from 0.5 to 3 mm. But for small structures, the susceptibility was reduced by 10% for 2 mm thick slices. For global analysis, the mean susceptibility correlated positively with age for the CN, PUT, red nucleus (RN), substantia nigra (SN), and dentate nucleus (DN). There was a negative correlation with age in the thalamus (THA). The volumes of most nuclei were negatively correlated with age. Apart from the GP, THA, and pulvinar thalamus (PT), all the other structures showed an increasing total iron content despite the reductions in volume with age. For the RII regional high iron content analysis, mean susceptibility in most of the structures was moderately to strongly correlated with age. Similar to the global analysis, apart from the GP, THA, and PT, all structures showed an increasing total iron content.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A reasonable estimate for age-related iron behavior can be obtained from a large cross site, cross manufacturer set of data when high enough resolutions are used. These estimates can be used for correcting for age related iron changes when studying diseases like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and other iron related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical thickness (CTh) via surface-based morphometry analysis is a popular method to characterize brain morphometry. Many studies have been performed to investigate CTh abnormalities in migraine. However, the results from these studies were not consistent and even conflicting. These divergent results hinder us to obtain a clear picture of brain morphometry regarding CTh alterations in migraine. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) is a promising technique to quantitatively pool individual neuroimaging studies to identify consistent brain areas involved. Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and SinoMed) and other sources (bioRxiv and reference lists of relevant articles and reviews) were systematically searched for studies that compared regional CTh differences between patients with migraine and healthy controls (HCs) up to May 15, 2020. A CBMA was performed using the Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images approach. In total, we identified 16 studies with 17 datasets reported that were eligible for the CBMA. The 17 datasets included 872 patients with migraine (average sample size 51.3, mean age 39.6 years, 721 females) and 949 HCs (average sample size 59.3, mean age 44.2 years, 680 females). The CBMA detected no statistically significant consistency of CTh alterations in patients with migraine relative to HCs. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis verified this result to be robust. Metaregression analyses revealed that this CBMA result was not confounded by age, gender, aura, attack frequency per month, and illness duration. Our CBMA adds to the evidence of the replication crisis in neuroimaging research that is increasingly recognized. Many potential confounders, such as underpowered sample size, heterogeneous patient selection criteria, and differences in imaging collection and methodology, may contribute to the inconsistencies of CTh alterations in migraine, which merit attention before planning future research on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;RXFP3 (relaxin-family peptide 3 receptor) is the cognate G-protein-coupled receptor for the neuropeptide, relaxin-3. RXFP3 is expressed widely throughout the brain, including the hypothalamus, where it has been shown to modulate feeding behavior and neuroendocrine activity in rodents. In order to better characterize its potential mechanisms of action, this study determined whether RXFP3 is expressed by dopaminergic neurons within the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), in addition to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neurons that express RXFP3 were visualized in coronal brain sections from RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato mice, which express the tdTomato fluorophore within RXFP3-positive cells, and dopaminergic neurons in these areas were visualized by simultaneous immunohistochemical detection of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity (TH-IR). Approximately 20% of ARC neurons containing TH-IR coexpressed tdTomato fluorescence, suggesting that RXFP3 can influence the dopamine pathway from the ARC to the pituitary gland that controls prolactin release. The ability of prolactin to reduce leptin sensitivity and increase food consumption therefore represents a potential mechanism by which RXFP3 activation influences feeding. A similar proportion of DMH neurons containing TH-IR expressed RXFP3-related tdTomato fluorescence, consistent with a possible RXFP3-mediated regulation of stress and neuroendocrine circuits. In contrast, RXFP3 was barely detected within the VTA. TdTomato signal was absent from the ARC and DMH in sections from Rosa26-tdTomato mice, suggesting that the cells identified in RXFP3-Cre/tdTomato mice expressed authentic RXFP3-related tdTomato fluorescence. Together, these findings identify potential hypothalamic mechanisms through which RXFP3 influences neuroendocrine control of metabolism, and further highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting RXFP3 in feeding-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;This study decodes consumers' preference levels using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in neuromarketing. The classification accuracy in neuromarketing is a critical factor in evaluating the intentions of the consumers. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is utilized as a neuroimaging modality to measure the cerebral hemodynamic responses. In this study, a specific decoding structure, called CNN-based fNIRS-data analysis, was designed to achieve a high classification accuracy. Compared to other methods, the automated characteristics, constant training of the dataset, and learning efficiency of the proposed method are the main advantages. The experimental procedure required eight healthy participants (four female and four male) to view commercial advertisement videos of different durations (15, 30, and 60 s). The cerebral hemodynamic responses of the participants were measured. To compare the preference classification performances, CNN was utilized to extract the most common features, including the mean, peak, variance, kurtosis, and skewness. Considering three video durations, the average classification accuracies of 15, 30, and 60 s videos were 84.3, 87.9, and 86.4%, respectively. Among them, the classification accuracy of 87.9% for 30 s videos was the highest. The average classification accuracies of three preferences in females and males were 86.2 and 86.3%, respectively, showing no difference in each group. By comparing the classification performances in three different combinations (like vs. so-so, like vs. dislike, and so-so vs. dislike) between two groups, male participants were observed to have targeted preferences for commercial advertising, and the classification performance 88.4% between “like” vs. “dislike” out of three categories was the highest. Finally, pairwise classification performance are shown as follows: For female, 86.1% (like vs. so-so), 87.4% (like vs. dislike), 85.2% (so-so vs. dislike), and for male 85.7, 88.4, 85.1%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) is a neurodegenerative language disorder primarily characterized by impaired phonological processing. Sentence repetition and comprehension deficits are observed in lvPPA and linked to impaired phonological working memory, but recent evidence also implicates impaired speech perception. Currently, neural encoding of the speech envelope, which forms the scaffolding for perception, is not clearly understood in lvPPA. We leveraged recent analytical advances in electrophysiology to examine speech envelope encoding in lvPPA. We assessed cortical tracking of the speech envelope and in-task comprehension of two spoken narratives in individuals with lvPPA (n = 10) and age-matched (n = 10) controls. Despite markedly reduced narrative comprehension relative to controls, individuals with lvPPA had increased cortical tracking of the speech envelope in theta oscillations, which track low-level features (e.g., syllables), but not delta oscillations, which track speech units that unfold across a longer time scale (e.g., words, phrases, prosody). This neural signature was highly correlated across narratives. Results indicate an increased reliance on acoustic cues during speech encoding. This may reflect inefficient encoding of bottom-up speech cues, likely as a consequence of dysfunctional temporoparietal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a degenerative disease affecting language while leaving other cognitive facilities relatively unscathed. The agrammatic subtype of PPA (PPA-G) is characterized by agrammatic language production with impaired comprehension of noncanonical filler-gap syntactic structures, such as object-relatives [e.g., The sandwich that the girl ate (gap) was tasty], in which the filler (the sandwich) is displaced from the object position within the relative clause to a position preceding both the verb and the agent (the girl) and is replaced by a gap linked with the filler. One hypothesis suggests that the observed deficits of these structures reflect impaired thematic integration, including impaired prediction of the thematic role of the filler and impaired thematic integration at the gap, but spared structure building (i.e., creation of the gap). In the current study, we examined the on-line comprehension of object-relative and subject-relative clauses in healthy controls and individuals with agrammatic and logopenic PPA using eye-tracking. Eye-movement patterns in canonical subject-relative clause structures were essentially spared in both PPA groups. In contrast, eye-movement patterns in noncanonical object-relative clauses revealed delayed thematic prediction in both agrammatic and logopenic PPA, on-time structure building (i.e., gap-filling) in both groups, and abnormal thematic integration in agrammatic, but not logopenic, PPA. We argue that these results are consistent with the hypothesis that agrammatic comprehension deficits reflect impaired thematic integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional microcircuits are useful for studying interactions among neural dynamics of neighboring neurons during cognition and emotion. A functional microcircuit is a group of neurons that are spatially close, and that exhibit synchronized neural activities. For computational analysis, functional microcircuits are represented by graphs, which pose special challenges when applied as input to machine learning algorithms. Graph embedding, which involves the conversion of graph data into low dimensional vector spaces, is a general method for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we discuss limitations of conventional graph embedding methods that make them ill-suited to the study of functional microcircuits. We then develop a novel graph embedding framework, called Weighted Graph Embedding with Vertex Identity Awareness (WGEVIA), that overcomes these limitations. Additionally, we introduce a dataset, called the five vertices dataset, that helps in assessing how well graph embedding methods are suited to functional microcircuit analysis. We demonstrate the utility of WGEVIA through extensive experiments involving real and simulated microcircuit data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The imaging of neuronal activity using calcium indicators has become a staple of modern neuroscience. However, without ground truths, there is a real risk of missing a significant portion of the real responses. Here, we show that a common assumption, the non-negativity of the neuronal responses as detected by calcium indicators, biases all levels of the frequently used analytical methods for these data. From the extraction of meaningful fluorescence changes to spike inference and the analysis of inferred spikes, each step risks missing real responses because of the assumption of non-negativity. We first show that negative deviations from baseline can exist in calcium imaging of neuronal activity. Then, we use simulated data to test three popular algorithms for image analysis, CaImAn, suite2p, and CellSort, finding that suite2p may be the best suited to large datasets. We also tested the spike inference algorithms included in CaImAn, suite2p, and Cellsort, as well as the dedicated inference algorithms MLspike and CASCADE, and found each to have limitations in dealing with inhibited neurons. Among these spike inference algorithms, FOOPSI, from CaImAn, performed the best on inhibited neurons, but even this algorithm inferred spurious spikes upon the return of the fluorescence signal to baseline. As such, new approaches will be needed before spikes can be sensitively and accurately inferred from calcium data in inhibited neurons. We further suggest avoiding data analysis approaches that, by assuming non-negativity, ignore inhibited responses. Instead, we suggest a first exploratory step, using k-means or PCA for example, to detect whether meaningful negative deviations are present. Taking these steps will ensure that inhibition, as well as excitation, is detected in calcium imaging datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common in the elderly population. Obstructive sleep apnea that may cause significant changes in the cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid and T-tau and/or P-tau protein levels is often identified as a risk factor for development of AD. Although the underlying mechanisms of AD are still not fully understood, a hypothesis associating OSA with AD has been already proposed. In this systematic mini-review, we first discuss the recent findings supporting the association of OSA with an increased risk of AD and then provide evidence suggesting the positive effect of OSA treatment on a reduced risk of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Skeletal muscles are composed of gigantic cells called muscle fibers, packed with force-producing myofibrils. During development the size of individual muscle fibers must dramatically enlarge to match with skeletal growth. How muscle growth is coordinated with growth of the contractile apparatus is not understood. Here, we use the large &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; flight muscles to mechanistically decipher how muscle fiber growth is controlled. We find that regulated activity of core members of the Hippo pathway is required to support flight muscle growth. Interestingly, we identify Dlg5 and Slmap as regulators of the STRIPAK phosphatase, which negatively regulates Hippo to enable post-mitotic muscle growth. Mechanistically, we show that the Hippo pathway controls timing and levels of sarcomeric gene expression during development and thus regulates the key components that physically mediate muscle growth. Since Dlg5, STRIPAK and the Hippo pathway are conserved a similar mechanism may contribute to muscle or cardiomyocyte growth in humans.</content>

 A fundamental question in biology is how morphogenesis integrates the multitude of processes that act at different scales, ranging from the molecular control of gene expression to cellular coordination in a tissue. Using machine-learning-based digital image analysis, we generated a three-dimensional atlas of ovule development in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, enabling the quantitative spatio-temporal analysis of cellular and gene expression patterns with cell and tissue resolution. We discovered novel morphological manifestations of ovule polarity, a new mode of cell layer formation, and previously unrecognized subepidermal cell populations that initiate ovule curvature. The data suggest an irregular cellular build-up of &lt;i&gt;WUSCHEL&lt;/i&gt; expression in the primordium and new functions for &lt;i&gt;INNER NO OUTER&lt;/i&gt; in restricting nucellar cell proliferation and the organization of the interior chalaza. Our work demonstrates the analytical power of a three-dimensional digital representation when studying the morphogenesis of an organ of complex architecture that eventually consists of 1900 cells.</content>

 Although mRNAs are localized in the processes of excitatory neurons, it is still unclear whether interneurons also localize a large population of mRNAs. In addition, the variability in the localized mRNA population within and between cell-types is unknown. Here we describe the unbiased transcriptomic characterization of the subcellular compartments of hundreds of single neurons. We separately profiled the dendritic and somatic transcriptomes of individual rat hippocampal neurons and investigated mRNA abundances in the soma and dendrites of single glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. We found that, like their excitatory counterparts, interneurons contain a rich repertoire of ~4000 mRNAs. We observed more cell type-specific features among somatic transcriptomes than their associated dendritic transcriptomes. Finally, using cell-type specific metabolic labelling of isolated neurites, we demonstrated that the processes of Glutamatergic and, notably, GABAergic neurons were capable of local translation, suggesting mRNA localization and local translation is a general property of neurons.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) is an aggressive cancer whose mutational origins are poorly understood. An early study reported high-frequency somatic mutations affecting UPF1, a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factor, in PASC, but subsequent studies did not observe these lesions. The corresponding controversy about whether &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are important contributors to PASC has been exacerbated by a paucity of functional studies. Here, we modeled two &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; mutations in human and mouse cells to find no significant effects on pancreatic cancer growth, acquisition of adenosquamous features, &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; splicing, UPF1 protein, or NMD efficiency. We subsequently discovered that 45% of &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; mutations reportedly present in PASCs are identical to standing genetic variants in the human population, suggesting that they may be non-pathogenic inherited variants rather than pathogenic mutations. Our data suggest that &lt;i&gt;UPF1&lt;/i&gt; is not a common functional driver of PASC and motivate further attempts to understand the genetic origins of these malignancies.</content>

 Cancer extracellular vesicles (EVs) shuttle at distance and fertilize pre-metastatic niches facilitating subsequent seeding by tumor cells. However, the link between EV secretion mechanisms and their capacity to form pre-metastatic niches remains obscure. Using mouse models, we show that GTPases of the Ral family control, through the phospholipase D1, multi-vesicular bodies homeostasis and tune the biogenesis and secretion of pro-metastatic EVs. Importantly, EVs from RalA or RalB depleted cells have limited organotropic capacities &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and are less efficient in promoting metastasis. RalA and RalB reduce the EV levels of the adhesion molecule MCAM/CD146, which favors EV-mediated metastasis by allowing EVs targeting to the lungs. Finally, RalA, RalB and MCAM/CD146, are factors of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Altogether, our study identifies RalGTPases as central molecules linking the mechanisms of EVs secretion and cargo loading to their capacity to disseminate and induce pre-metastatic niches in a CD146 dependent manner.</content>

 The hydrothermal vent tubeworm &lt;i&gt;Riftia pachyptila&lt;/i&gt; hosts a single 16S rRNA phylotype of intracellular sulfur-oxidizing symbionts, which vary considerably in cell morphology and exhibit a remarkable degree of physiological diversity and redundancy, even in the same host. To elucidate whether multiple metabolic routes are employed in the same cells or rather in distinct symbiont subpopulations, we enriched symbionts according to cell size by density gradient centrifugation. Metaproteomic analysis, microscopy, and flow cytometry strongly suggest that &lt;i&gt;Riftia&lt;/i&gt; symbiont cells of different sizes represent metabolically dissimilar stages of a physiological differentiation process: While small symbionts actively divide and may establish cellular symbiont-host interaction, large symbionts apparently do not divide, but still replicate DNA, leading to DNA endoreduplication. Moreover, in large symbionts, carbon fixation and biomass production seem to be metabolic priorities. We propose that this division of labor between smaller and larger symbionts benefits the productivity of the symbiosis as a whole.</content>

 Localizing and identifying sensory objects during active navigation are fundamental brain functions. However, how individual objects are neuronally represented during self-motion is mostly unexplored. Here we show that active localization during unrestricted navigation promotes previously unreported spatial representations in primary auditory cortex. Spatial tuning differs between sources with distinct behavioral outcome associations, revealing a simultaneous population coding of egocentric source locations and angle-independent identification of individual sources during active sensing.</content>

 Prion diseases are transmissible, neurodegenerative disorders to which there are no cures. Previous studies show that reduction of microglia accelerates prion disease and increases the accumulation of prions in the brain, suggesting that microglia provide neuroprotection by phagocytosing and destroying prions. In Csf1r{Delta}FIRE mice, the deletion of an enhancer within Csf1r specifically blocks microglia development, however, their brains develop normally with none of the deficits reported in other microglia-deficient models. Csf1r{Delta}FIRE mice were used as a refined model to study the impact of microglia-deficiency on CNS prion disease. Although Csf1r{Delta}FIRE mice succumbed to prion disease much earlier than wild-type mice, the accumulation of prions in their brains was reduced. Instead, astrocytes displayed earlier, non-polarized reactive activation with enhanced synaptic pruning and unfolded protein responses. Our data suggest that rather than engulfing and degrading prions, the microglia instead provide neuroprotection and restrict the harmful activities of reactive astrocytes.</content>

 Decline in episodic memory is one of the hallmarks of aging and represents one of the most important health problems facing western societies. A key structure in episodic memory is the hippocampal formation and the dentate gyrus in particular, as the continuous production of new dentate granule neurons in this brain region was found to play a crucial role in memory and in age-related decline in memory. As such, understanding the molecular processes that regulate the relationship between adult neurogenesis and aging of memory function holds great therapeutic potential. Recently, we found that Vang-gogh like 2 (Vangl2), a core component of the planar cell polarity signaling pathway, is enriched in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. In this context, we sought to evaluate the involvement of this effector of the Wnt/PCP pathway in both adult neurogenesis and memory abilities in adult and middle-aged mice. Using a heterozygous mouse model carrying a dominant negative mutation in Vangl2 gene, we show that alteration in Vangl2 expression decreases the survival of adult-born granule cells and advances the onset of decrease in cognitive flexibility. Inability of mutant mice to erase old irrelevant information to the benefit of new relevant ones highlights a key role of Vangl2 in interference-based forgetting. Taken together, our findings show for the first that Vangl2 activity may constitute an interesting target to prevent age-related decline in hippocampal plasticity and memory.</content>

 People can learn new sensory skills that augment their perception, such as human echolocation. However, it is not clear to what extent these can become an integral part of the perceptual repertoire. Can they show automatic use, integrated with the other senses, or do they remain cognitively-demanding, cumbersome, and separate? Here, participants learned to judge distance using an echo-like auditory cue. We show that use of this new skill met three key criteria for automaticity and sensory integration: (1) enhancing the speed of perceptual decisions; (2) processing through a non-verbal route and (3) integration with vision in an efficient, Bayes-like manner. We also show some limits following short training: integration was less-than-optimal, and there was no mandatory fusion of signals. These results demonstrate key ways in which new sensory skills can become automatic and integrated, and suggest that sensory augmentation systems may have benefits beyond current applications for sensory loss.</content>

 Stereovision is the ability to perceive fine depth variations from small differences in the two eyes' images. Using adaptive optics, we show that even minute optical aberrations that are not clinically correctable, and go unnoticed in everyday vision, can affect stereo acuity. Hence, the human binocular system is capable of using unnaturally fine details that are not encountered in everyday vision. More importantly, stereoacuity was still considerably variable even with perfect optics. This variability can be attributed to neural adaptation. Our visual system tries to compensate for these aberrations through neural adaptation that optimizes stereovision when viewing stimuli through one's habitual optics. However, the same adaptation becomes ineffective when the optics are changed, even if improved. Beyond optical imperfections, we show that stereovision is limited by neural adaptation to one's own optics.</content>

 The primate visual system is comprised of multiple visual areas. Despite their foundational relevance, there are no normative accounts for why there are multiple areas nor why they have their signature &quot;mirrored map&quot; topography. Here I show that the stereotyped cortical organization of multiple mirrored areas naturally emerges in simulated cortex, in which self-organizing processes are used to map a multi-scale representation of visual space smoothly onto a two-dimensional cortical sheet. Predominant accounts of multiple areas emphasize hierarchical processing, where each area extends and elaborates on the previous areas' representation. Here, no explicit hierarchical relationships were required to manifest this multi-areal organization, suggesting that feature hierarchies may be the derived rather than the driving force of this organization. This modeling work thus provides a simple computational explanation for the hallmark features of early visual topography, and the presence of multiple areas, as emergent from a single functional goal--to smoothly represent the visual field at multiple spatial scales.</content>

 Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent psychedelic drug, which has seen a revival in clinical and pharmacological research within recent years. Human neuroimaging studies have shown fundamental changes in brain-wide functional connectivity and an expansion of dynamical brain states, thus raising the question about a mechanistic explanation of the dynamics underlying these alterations. Here, we applied a novel perturbational approach based on a whole-brain computational model, which opens up the possibility to externally perturb different brain regions in silico and investigate differences in dynamical stability of different brain states, i.e. the dynamical response of a certain brain region to an external perturbation. After adjusting the whole-brain model parameters to reflect the dynamics of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD signals recorded under the influence of LSD or placebo, perturbations of different brain areas were simulated by either promoting or disrupting synchronization in the regarding brain region. After perturbation offset, we quantified the recovery characteristics of the brain area to its basal dynamical state with the Perturbational Integration Latency Index (PILI) and used this measure to distinguish between the two brain states. We found significant changes in dynamical complexity with consistently higher PILI values after LSD intake on a global level, which indicates a shift of the brain's global working point further away from a stable equilibrium as compared to normal conditions. On a local level, we found that the largest differences were measured within the limbic network, the visual network and the default mode network. Additionally, we found a higher variability of PILI values across different brain regions after LSD intake, indicating higher response diversity under LSD after an external perturbation. Our results provide important new insights into the brain-wide dynamical changes underlying the psychedelic state - here provoked by LSD intake - and underline possible future clinical applications of psychedelic drugs in particular psychiatric disorders.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The basal ganglia (BG) are crucial for a variety of motor and cognitive functions. Changes induced by persistent low-dopamine (e.g. in Parkinson's disease), result in aberrant changes in steady-state population activity (beta-band oscillations) and transient response of the BG. Typically, brief cortical stimulation results in a triphasic response in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr, output of the BG). The properties of the triphasic responses are shaped by dopamine levels. While it is relatively well understood how changes in BG result in aberrant steady state activity, it is not clear which BG interactions are crucial for the aberrant transient responses in the BG. Moreover, it is also not clear whether the same or different mechanisms underlie the aberrant changes in steady-state activity and aberrant transient response. Here we used numerical simulations of a network model of BG to identify the key factors that determine the shape of the transient responses. We show that an aberrant transient response of the SNr in low-dopamine state, involves changes in both, the direct pathway and the recurrent interactions within the globus pallidus externa (GPe) and between GPe and sub-thalamic nucleus. We found that the connections from D2-type spiny projection neurons to GPe are most crucial in shaping the transient response and by restoring them to their healthy level, we could restore the shape of transient response even in low-dopamine state. Finally, we show that the changes in BG that result in aberrant transient response are also sufficient to generate pathological oscillatory activity.</content>

 We demonstrate an approach based on adaptive optics to improve the spatial resolution of STED microscopy inside thick biological tissue by a priori correction of spherical aberrations as a function of imaging depth. We first measured the aberrations in a phantom sample of gold and fluorescent nanoparticles suspended in an agarose gel with a refractive index closely matching living brain tissue. Using a spatial light modulator to apply corrective phase shifts, we imaged neurons in living brain slices and show that the corrections can substantially increase image quality. Specifically, we could measure structures as small as 80 nanometer at a depth of 90 micrometer inside the biological tissue, and obtain a 60% signal increase after correction.</content>

Chemical graph generators are software packages to generate computer representations of chemical structures adhering to certain boundary conditions. Their development is a research topic of cheminformatics. Chemical graph generators are used in areas such as virtual library generation in drug design, in molecular design with specified properties, called inverse QSAR/QSPR, as well as in organic synthesis design, retrosynthesis or in systems for computer-assisted structure elucidation (CASE). CASE systems again have regained interest for the structure elucidation of unknowns in computational metabolomics, a current area of computational biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lsVjWfKyaMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Acute Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol prompts rapid changes in cannabinoid CB1 receptor immunolabeling and subcellular structure in CA1 hippocampus of young adult male mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fbcf6e6d-8902-428e-9ea0-aa94ae67d23e/cne25098-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute exposure to Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) significantly decreases cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor density at inhibitory terminals and mitochondria. Besides, dendrites are significantly larger, have more spines and contain more mitochondria. CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (arrows), inhibitory terminals (ter, red shading), mitochondria (m, purple shading), dendrites (blue shading), dendritic spines (sp, blue shading). Scale bars = 500 nm.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use and abuse of cannabis can be associated with significant pathophysiology, however, it remains unclear whether (1) acute administration of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during early adulthood alters the cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor localization and expression in cells of the brain, and (2) THC produces structural brain changes. Here we use electron microscopy and a highly sensitive pre‐embedding immunogold method to examine CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the hippocampus cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) 30 min after male mice were exposed to a single THC injection (5 mg/kg). The findings show that acute exposure to THC can significantly decrease the percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor immunopositive terminals making symmetric synapses, mitochondria, and astrocytes. The percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses was unaffected. Lastly, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression was significantly lower at terminals of symmetric and asymmetric synapses as well as in mitochondria. Structurally, CA1 dendrites were significantly larger, and contained more spines and mitochondria following acute THC administration. The area of the dendritic spines, synaptic terminals, mitochondria, and astrocytes decreased significantly following acute THC exposure. Altogether, these results indicate that even a single THC exposure can have a significant impact on CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression, and can alter CA1 ultrastructure, within 30 min of drug exposure. These changes may contribute to the behavioral alterations experienced by young individuals shortly after cannabis intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Forebrain projection neurons target functionally diverse respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/942dd782-5e14-4e9b-afcd-0d151e8193c9/cne25091-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory motor activity can be modulated by higher brain inputs. We hypothesized that forebrain regions send descending inputs to the respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Our data imply that (a) volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the midbrain periaqueductal gray; (b) commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, whisking, swallowing) target the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, predominantly; and (c) limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream brainstem respiratory networks, including the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, and caudal raphé nuclei. We provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eupnea is generated by neural circuits located in the ponto‐medullary brainstem, but can be modulated by higher brain inputs which contribute to volitional control of breathing and the expression of orofacial behaviors, such as vocalization, sniffing, coughing, and swallowing. Surprisingly, the anatomical organization of descending inputs that connect the forebrain with the brainstem respiratory network remains poorly defined. We hypothesized that descending forebrain projections target multiple distributed respiratory control nuclei across the neuroaxis. To test our hypothesis, we made discrete unilateral microinjections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus (KFn), the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, or caudal midline raphé nuclei. We quantified the regional distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the forebrain 12–14 days postinjection. Overall, our data reveal that descending inputs from cortical areas predominantly target the PAG and KFn. Differential forebrain regions innervating the PAG (prefrontal, cingulate cortices, and lateral septum) and KFn (rhinal, piriform, and somatosensory cortices) imply that volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the PAG, while the KFn may receive commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, swallowing). Additionally, we observed that the limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream bulbar respiratory networks. Collectively, these data provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Complex networks have complete subgraphs such as nodes, edges, triangles,
etc., referred to as cliques of different orders. Notably, cavities consisting
of higher-order cliques have been found playing an important role in brain
functions. Since searching for the maximum clique in a large network is an
NP-complete problem, we propose using k-core decomposition to determine the
computability of a given network subject to limited computing resources. For a
computable network, we design a search algorithm for finding cliques of
different orders, which also provides the Euler characteristic number. Then, we
compute the Betti number by using the ranks of the boundary matrices of
adjacent cliques. Furthermore, we design an optimized algorithm for finding
cavities of different orders. Finally, we apply the algorithm to the neuronal
network of C. elegans in one dataset, and find its all cliques and some
cavities of different orders therein, providing a basis for further
mathematical analysis and computation of the structure and function of the C.
elegans neuronal network.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The early and robust detection of anomalies occurring in discrete
manufacturing processes allows operators to prevent harm, e.g. defects in
production machinery or products. While current approaches for data-driven
anomaly detection provide good results on the exact processes they were trained
on, they often lack the ability to flexibly adapt to changes, e.g. in products.
Continual learning promises such flexibility, allowing for an automatic
adaption of previously learnt knowledge to new tasks. Therefore, this article
discusses different continual learning approaches from the group of
regularization strategies, which are implemented, evaluated and compared based
on a real industrial metal forming dataset.

 &lt;p&gt;An expression for the group delay of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model in response to
low amplitude input is obtained by linearisation of the cubic term of the
voltage equation around its stable fixed-point. It is found that a negative
group delay exists for low frequencies, indicating that the evolution of slowly
fluctuating signals are anticipated by the voltage dynamics. The effects of the
group delay for different types of signals are shown numerically for the
non-linearised FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and some observations on the signal
aspects that are anticipated are stated.

 &lt;p&gt;Bayesian learning is a powerful learning framework which combines the
external information of the data (background information) with the internal
information (training data) in a logically consistent way in inference and
prediction. By Bayes rule, the external information (prior distribution) and
the internal information (training data likelihood) are combined coherently,
and the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive (marginal)
distribution obtained by Bayes rule summarize the total information needed in
the inference and prediction, respectively. In this paper, we study the
Bayesian framework of the Tensor Network from two perspective. First, we
introduce the prior distribution to the weights in the Tensor Network and
predict the labels of the new observations by the posterior predictive
(marginal) distribution. Since the intractability of the parameter integral in
the normalization constant computation, we approximate the posterior predictive
distribution by Laplace approximation and obtain the out-product approximation
of the hessian matrix of the posterior distribution of the Tensor Network
model. Second, to estimate the parameters of the stationary mode, we propose a
stable initialization trick to accelerate the inference process by which the
Tensor Network can converge to the stationary path more efficiently and stably
with gradient descent method. We verify our work on the MNIST, Phishing Website
and Breast Cancer data set. We study the Bayesian properties of the Bayesian
Tensor Network by visualizing the parameters of the model and the decision
boundaries in the two dimensional synthetic data set. For a application
purpose, our work can reduce the overfitting and improve the performance of
normal Tensor Network model.

 &lt;p&gt;Stress and driving are a dangerous combination which can lead to crashes, as
evidenced by the large number of road traffic crashes that involve stress.
Motivated by the need to address the significant costs of driver stress, it is
essential to build a practical system that can classify driver stress level
with high accuracy. However, the performance of an accurate driving stress
levels classification system depends on hyperparameter optimization choices
such as data segmentation (windowing hyperparameters). The configuration
setting of hyperparameters, which has an enormous impact on the system
performance, are typically hand-tuned while evaluating the algorithm. This
tuning process is time consuming and often depends on personal experience.
There are also no generic optimal values for hyperparameters values. In this
work, we propose a meta-heuristic approach to support automated hyperparameter
optimization and provide a real-time driver stress detection system. This is
the first systematic study of optimizing windowing hyperparameters based on
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal in the domain of driving safety. Our approach is
to propose a framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) to
select an optimal/near optimal windowing hyperparameters values. The
performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on two datasets: a public
dataset (DRIVEDB dataset) and our collected dataset using an advanced
simulator. DRIVEDB dataset was collected in a real time driving scenario, and
our dataset was collected using an advanced driving simulator in the control
environment. We demonstrate that optimising the windowing hyperparameters
yields significant improvement in terms of accuracy. The most accurate built
model applied to the public dataset and our dataset, based on the selected
windowing hyperparameters, achieved 92.12% and 77.78% accuracy, respectively.

 &lt;p&gt;Probing the developing neural circuitry in Caenorhabditis elegans has
enhanced our understanding of nervous systems. The C. elegans connectome, like
those of other species, is characterized by a rich club of densely connected
neurons embedded within a small-world architecture. This organization of
neuronal connections, captured by quantitative network statistics, provides
insight into the system's capacity to perform integrative computations. Yet
these network measures are limited in their ability to detect weakly connected
motifs, such as topological cavities, that may support the systems capacity to
perform segregated computations. We address this limitation by using persistent
homology to track the evolution of topological cavities in the growing C.
elegans connectome throughout neural development, and assess the degree to
which the growing connectomes topology is resistant to biological noise. We
show that the developing connectome topology is both relatively robust to
changes in neuron birth times and not captured by similar growth models.
Additionally, we quantify the consequence of a neurons specific birth time and
ask if this metric tracks other biological properties of neurons. Our results
suggest that the connectomes growing topology is a robust feature of the
developing connectome that is distinct from other network properties, and that
the growing topology is particularly sensitive to the exact birth times of a
small set of predominantly motor neurons. By utilizing novel measurements that
track biological features, we anticipate that our study will be helpful in the
construction of more accurate models of neuronal development in C. elegans

 &lt;p&gt;A conventional brain-computer interface (BCI) requires a complete data
gathering, training, and calibration phase for each user before it can be used.
This preliminary phase is time-consuming and should be done under the
supervision of technical experts commonly in laboratories for the BCI to
function properly. In recent years, a number of subject-independent (SI) BCIs
have been developed. However, there are many problems preventing them from
being used in real-world BCI applications. A lower accuracy than the
subject-dependent (SD) approach and a relatively high run-time of models with a
large number of model parameters are the most important ones. Therefore, a
real-world BCI application would greatly benefit from a compact
subject-independent BCI framework, ready to use immediately after the user puts
it on, and suitable for low-power edge-computing and applications in the
emerging area of internet of things (IoT). We propose a novel
subject-independent BCI framework named CCSPNet (Convolutional Common Spatial
Pattern Network) that is trained on the motor imagery (MI) paradigm of a
large-scale EEG signals database consisting of 400 trials for every 54 subjects
performing two-class hand-movement MI tasks. The proposed framework applies a
wavelet kernel convolutional neural network (WKCNN) and a temporal
convolutional neural network (TCNN) in order to represent and extract the
diverse frequency behavior and spectral patterns of EEG signals. The
convolutional layers outputs go through a CSP algorithm for class
discrimination and spatial feature extraction. The number of CSP features is
reduced by a dense neural network, and the final class label is determined by
an LDA. The final SD and SI classification accuracies of the proposed framework
match the best results obtained on the largest motor-imagery dataset present in
the BCI literature, with 99.993 percent fewer model parameters.

 &lt;p&gt;Deciphering the workings of a brain (and its alterations due to pathologies
and disorders) requires real-time mapping of the activity of all neurons.
Recently, this formidable task has been brought into reach by the
implementation of light sheet fluorescence (LSF) microscopy on the transparent
zebrafish larva, a simple yet representative model of the vertebrate brain.
This application is however hindered by the use of visible light for
fluorescence excitation, inducing unwanted visual stimulation that can only be
partially overcome resorting to complex excitation geometries. On the other
hand, two-photon (2P) LSF microscopy, owing to the use of invisible infra-red
illumination, enables volumetric imaging of neuronal activity avoiding
undesirable visual stimulation. However, due to the low efficiency of the 2P
absorption process, the imaging speed of this technique is typically limited (~
1 Hz) by the signal to noise ratio achievable without sample photodamage. Here
we describe a custom-made 2P LSF microscope that overcomes this limit, being
specifically designed to perform whole-brain cellular-resolution calcium
imaging in zebrafish larvae quintuplicating previous volumetric acquisition
frequency (5 Hz). [...] We employed this system to investigate, in real-time on
a brain-wide scale, the onset and propagation of acute seizures, as induced by
the convulsant drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), avoiding detrimental visual
stimulation on a highly susceptible system such as an epileptic brain. [...] In
conclusion, the presented 2P LSF microscope design affords high spatio-temporal
resolution while avoiding visual stimuli and allows unprecedented access to
whole zebrafish brain epileptic dynamics.

 &lt;p&gt;There is a longstanding debate whether the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation
theorem can explain the use of more than one hidden layer in neural networks.
The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation decomposes a multivariate function into an
interior and an outer function and therefore has indeed a similar structure as
a neural network with two hidden layers. But there are distinctive differences.
One of the main obstacles is that the outer function depends on the represented
function and can be wildly varying even if the represented function is smooth.
We derive modifications of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation that transfer
smoothness properties of the represented function to the outer function and can
be well approximated by ReLU networks. It appears that instead of two hidden
layers, a more natural interpretation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation
is that of a deep neural network where most of the layers are required to
approximate the interior function.

 &lt;p&gt;Mobile devices are becoming an important carrier for deep learning tasks, as
they are being equipped with powerful, high-end mobile CPUs and GPUs. However,
it is still a challenging task to execute 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) targeting for real-time performance, besides high inference accuracy.
The reason is more complex model structure and higher model dimensionality
overwhelm the available computation/storage resources on mobile devices. A
natural way may be turning to deep learning weight pruning techniques. However,
the direct generalization of existing 2D CNN weight pruning methods to 3D CNNs
is not ideal for fully exploiting mobile parallelism while achieving high
inference accuracy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes RT3D, a model compression and mobile acceleration
framework for 3D CNNs, seamlessly integrating neural network weight pruning and
compiler code generation techniques. We propose and investigate two structured
sparsity schemes i.e., the vanilla structured sparsity and kernel group
structured (KGS) sparsity that are mobile acceleration friendly. The vanilla
sparsity removes whole kernel groups, while KGS sparsity is a more fine-grained
structured sparsity that enjoys higher flexibility while exploiting full
on-device parallelism. We propose a reweighted regularization pruning algorithm
to achieve the proposed sparsity schemes. The inference time speedup due to
sparsity is approaching the pruning rate of the whole model FLOPs (floating
point operations). RT3D demonstrates up to 29.1$\times$ speedup in end-to-end
inference time comparing with current mobile frameworks supporting 3D CNNs,
with moderate 1%-1.5% accuracy loss. The end-to-end inference time for 16 video
frames could be within 150 ms, when executing representative C3D and R(2+1)D
models on a cellphone. For the first time, real-time execution of 3D CNNs is
achieved on off-the-shelf mobiles.

 &lt;p&gt;We discuss relations between Residual Networks (ResNet), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) and the primate visual cortex. We begin with the observation
that a special type of shallow RNN is exactly equivalent to a very deep ResNet
with weight sharing among the layers. A direct implementation of such a RNN,
although having orders of magnitude fewer parameters, leads to a performance
similar to the corresponding ResNet. We propose 1) a generalization of both RNN
and ResNet architectures and 2) the conjecture that a class of moderately deep
RNNs is a biologically-plausible model of the ventral stream in visual cortex.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the architectures by testing them on the
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet dataset.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Upper limb function for people with Friedreich ataxia determines capacity to participate in daily activities. Current upper limb measures available do not fully capture impairments related to Friedreich ataxia. We have developed an objective measure, the Ataxia Instrumented Measure–Spoon (AIM-S), which consists of a spoon equipped with a BioKin wireless motion capture device, and algorithms that analyse these signals, to measure ataxia of the upper limb during the pre-oral phase of eating. The aim of this study was to evaluate the AIM-S as a sensitive and functionally relevant clinical outcome for use in clinical trials. A prospective longitudinal study evaluated the capacity of the AIM-S to detect change in upper limb function over 48 weeks. Friedreich ataxia clinical severity, performance on the Nine-Hole Peg Test and Box and Block Test and responses to a purpose-designed questionnaire regarding acceptability of AIM-S were recorded. Forty individuals with Friedreich ataxia and 20 control participants completed the baseline assessment. Thirty individuals with Friedreich ataxia completed the second assessment. The sensitivity of the AIM-S to detect deterioration in upper limb function was greater than other measures. Patient-reported outcomes indicated the AIM-S reflected a daily activity and was more enjoyable to complete than other assessments. The AIM-S is a more accurate, less variable measure of upper limb function in Friedreich ataxia than existing measures. The AIM-S is perceived by individuals with Friedreich ataxia to be related to everyday life and will permit individuals who are non-ambulant to be included in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is one of the most prevalent pathological types of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and it significantly affects patient prognoses. The methylation of DNA plays an important role in the development of epilepsy. However, few studies have focused on HS subtypes to determine DNA methylation profiles in TLE. This study aimed to determine the pathogenesis of TLE from an epigenetic perspective in patients with TLE-HS type I (TLE-HSTI) and TLE without HS (TLE-nHS) using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). We defined 1171 hypermethylated and 2537 hypomethylated regions and found 632 differentially methylated genes (DMG) in the promoter region that were primarily involved in the regulation of various aspects of epilepsy development. Twelve DMG overlapped with differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the promoter region, and RT-qPCR findings revealed significant overexpression of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SBNO2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CBX3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RASAL3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TMBIM4&lt;/em&gt; genes in TLE-HSTI. We present the first systematic analysis of methylation profiles of TLE-HSTI and TLE-nHS from an epigenetic perspective using WGBS. Overall, our preliminary data highlight the underlying mechanism of TLE-HSTI, providing a new perspective for guiding treatment of TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2,5-Dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC) is a close structural analog of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib that lacks COX-2-inhibitory function. Thus, DMC is a promising drug for anti-tumor. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and the molecular basis of DMC in the treatment of human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). DMC inhibited the growth and proliferation of GBM cell lines (LN229, A172, U251, and U87MG) in a dose-dependent manner (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In GBM cells treated with DMC, detection by flow cytometry showed cell cycle arrest, and proteins involved in cell cycle such as P21 were increased. Compared with control group, Annexin-V/PI-staining in DMC-treatment group was increased, indicating that DMC could induce apoptosis in GBM cells. Also, associated proteins including cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP-1 were increased. It was further explored whether DMC blocked cell cycle and induced apoptosis in GBM cells through CIP2A/PP2A/AKT signaling pathway. After treatment of DMC, the phosphorylation of Akt was reduced while the total Akt level was not affected. DMC suppressed the expression of CIP2A in a time-dependent manner, while the CIP2A overexpression group reversed cell cycle and apoptotic protein expression led by DMC. Finally, in a xenograft model in nude mice using LN229 cells, DMC suppressed tumor growth. These findings proved that DMC could block cell cycle and induce apoptosis in GBM cells by suppressing CIP2A/PP2A/Akt signaling axis, which indicated that DMC could be an effective option for GBM treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a decisive role in the development of the central nervous system and modulation, differentiation, and function of neurons. Thus, any abnormal pattern of expression of these transcripts might alter normal development leading to neuropsychiatric disorders. In this regard, transcripts of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt;) and four BDNF-associated lncRNAs (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF-AS&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MIR137HG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MIAT&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PNKY&lt;/em&gt;) were evaluated in the peripheral blood of schizophrenia (SCZ) patients as well as normal subjects. The results indicated that the relative expression (RE) of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PNKY&lt;/em&gt; was higher in SCZ patients as compared with controls (posterior beta of RE = 2.605, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.006) and in female patients compared with female controls (posterior beta of RE = 2.831, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; expression was also higher in SCZ patients when compared with controls (posterior beta of RE = 0.64, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.036). Finally, a correlation was detected between the disease status and gender in terms of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF-AS&lt;/em&gt; expression (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.026). An inverse correlation was also found between levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PNKY&lt;/em&gt; and age in the control group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = − 0.30, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001). Expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; and all lncRNAs were correlated with each other in both patients and controls. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PNKY&lt;/em&gt; had the best diagnostic power among all assessed genes in the identification of disease status (area under curve = 0.78). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF-AS&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MIR137HG&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MIAT&lt;/em&gt; genes could discriminate SCZ patients from normal subjects with diagnostic power of 71%, 72%, 67%, and 68%, respectively. The current investigation suggests the possibility of the application of transcript levels of lncRNAs as an SCZ diagnostic marker. However, it warrants further studies in larger sample sizes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Baihui-penetrating-Qubin acupuncture is frequently used to treat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in China. Acupuncture affects multiple microRNAs in diseases. MicroRNA-23a-3p (miR-23a-3p) has been demonstrated to be up-regulated in ICH patients. Herein, the effect of Baihui-penetrating-Qubin acupuncture on miR-23a-3p expression after ICH and the role of miR-23a-3p in ICH were discussed. A rat model of ICH was induced by infusing autologous blood into caudate nucleus. Acupuncture was performed after ICH once a day for 30 min. After 3 consecutive days of acupuncture, the neurobehavioral function, brain edema, neuronal cell death, inflammation, ferroptosis, nuclear factor E2-like 2 (NFE2L2) signaling and miR-23a-3p levels in brain tissues were analyzed. Additionally, antagomiR-23a-3p was injected into rats 3 days prior to ICH modeling to analyze the function of miR-23a-3p in neuronal cell death, inflammation, ferroptosis, and NFE2L2 signaling. Acupuncture relieved the ICH-induced neurological function deficits, increases in brain water content and Fluoro-Jade B (FJB)-positive cells and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Acupuncture also alleviated ferroptosis and decreased miR-23a-3p expression, as evidenced by the increased NFE2L2 nuclear translocation and expressions of heme oxygenase-1 and glutathione peroxidase 4 and the decreased iron and malondialdehyde contents and reactive oxygen species accumulation. Additionally, antagomiR-23a-3p inhibited the ICH-induced increases in FJB-positive cells, release of proinflammatory cytokines, ferroptosis, and promoted NFE2L2 activation. Notably, the binding site of miR-23a-3p existed in NFE2L2. Taken together, acupuncture may alleviate the neuronal cell death, inflammation, and ferroptosis after ICH by down-regulating miR-23a-3p. This study provides a potential mechanism underlying the Baihui-penetrating-Qubin acupuncture improving the early injury after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a peptide involved in physio-pathological processes of the eye. It exerts multiple effects directly through activation of its related receptors and indirectly through increases in the synthesis of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP). To study the role of ADNP and protect against ADNP deficiencies, a small peptide called NAP was synthetized. It includes an eight amino acid active site sequence of ADNP. In this review, we summarize the knowledge regarding the neuroprotective function played by PACAP and NAP in retinal tissue and provide an overview of the correlation between PACAP and ADNP in the context of diabetic retinopathy. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The association of apolipoprotein AIV (APOA4) with depression or plasma levels of lipids and glucose has been inconsistently reported. However, interplays between APOA4 and depression on the levels have not been explored yet. The present study aimed to investigate plasma levels of APOA4, lipids, and glucose in adolescents with different genotypes of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;APOA4&lt;/em&gt; rs5104 and with or without depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed in 631 adolescents by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). A total score of 14 was defined as the cutoff point for depression. Plasma levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose, and insulin were measured by routine methods, and APOA4 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses and verified by DNA sequencing. Female adolescents had higher prevalence of depression than male subjects only in G allele carriers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.015), but not in AA homozygotes. Risk factors of depression and predictors of depression severity were different between G allele carriers and AA homozygotes. Lower levels of glucose (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003) were observed in male G allele carriers than those in male AA homozygotes and increased TG levels (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.008) in female G allele carriers when compared with those in female AA homozygotes. When both &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;APOA4&lt;/em&gt; rs5104 and depression were taken into account, subjects with depression had higher levels of plasma APOA4 than adolescents without depression only in female G allele carriers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.043), but no significant changes of plasma lipids and glucose. Depression augments plasma APOA4 levels without changes of plasma lipids and glucose in female adolescents carrying G allele of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;APOA4&lt;/em&gt; rs5104. These results may provide a novel explanation for the inconsistent relationship between depression, APOA4, and plasma levels of lipids and glucose in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dysregulation of the serotonergic system has been reported to have a significant role in several neurological disorders including depression, autism and substance abuse disorders. Changes in the expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT) through polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the SERT gene have been associated, but not yet been conclusively linked to, neuropsychiatric disorders. In turn, dendritic spine structure and function are critical for neuronal function and the disruption of dendritic spine formation at glutamatergic synapses is a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric disorders. To understand the effect of SERT depletion on dendritic spine formation, neuronal cultures were established from the cortex of postnatal day 0–1 SERT knockout (KO) rats. Cortical neurons were subsequently allowed to mature to 21 days in vitro, and dendritic spine density was assessed using immunocytochemical co-labelling of drebrin and microtubule associated protein 2. Genetic knockout of the SERT had a gene-dose effect on dendritic spine densities of cortical neurons. The results of this paper implicate SERT function with the formation of dendritic spines at glutamatergic synapses, thereby offering insight into the aetiology of several neuropathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T-006, a small-molecule compound derived from tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), has potential for the treatment of neurological diseases. In order to investigate the effect of T-006 prophylactic treatment on an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model and identify the target of T-006, we intragastrically administered T-006 (3 mg/kg) to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) transgenic mice (APP/PS1-2xTg and APP/PS1/Tau-3xTg) for 6 and 8 months, respectively. T-006 improved cognitive ability after long-term administration in two AD mouse models and targeted mitochondrial-related protein alpha-F1-ATP synthase (ATP5A). T-006 significantly reduced the expression of phosphorylated-tau, total tau, and APP while increasing the expression of synapse-associated proteins in 3xTg mice. In addition, T-006 modulated the JNK and mTOR-ULK1 pathways to reduce both p-tau and total tau levels. Our data suggested that T-006 mitigated cognitive decline primarily by reducing the p-tau and total tau levels in 3xTg mice, supporting further investigation into its development as a candidate drug for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) couple vascular reactivity and metabolism with ischemic protection which makes them potential targets for prevention and management of ischemic stroke (IS). This study investigates the potential association between KATP polymorphisms and hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and consequently ischemic stroke (IS). Nine hundred and fourteen (914) patients genotyped for KATP polymorphisms (rs2285676, rs1799858, rs4148671, rs61928479, and rs141294036) were analyzed. KATP rs141294036 (CC, adjusted OR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.17–2.14, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003) was related to higher HTN risk. Meanwhile, rs2285676 (AA + GA, adjusted OR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.08–2.19, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.018) was associated with increased triglyceride level (≥ 1.7 mmol/L). rs2285676 (AA + GA, adjusted OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.24–2.61, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002), rs1799858 (TT + CT, adjusted OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.17–2.42, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005), and rs141294036 (TT + CT, adjusted OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.30–2.78, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) were related to increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (≥ 1.8 mmol/L). rs2285676 (AA + GA, adjusted OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.74–3.82, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and rs141294036 (TT + CT, adjusted OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.27–2.93, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002) were related to increased apolipoprotein B (≥ 65 mg/dL). In addition, the 5 KATP polymorphisms were non-correlated with three types of dyslipidemia (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein AI). After median 50.6 month of follow-up, participants carrying CC genotype of rs141294036 showed correlation with elevated risk of new onset IS (adjusted HR = 2.55, 95% CI: 1.23–5.27, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). These novel findings suggest that KATP rs141294036 is associated with increased risk of HTN, dyslipidemia, and IS. Based on these correlations, KATP rs141294036 could be a promising target for early and personalized therapeutics as well as prevention strategies for the aforementioned clinical pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous evidence has shown a link between neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and melatonin. The data in the literature about the impact of the hormone under different experimental PD conditions are quite controversial, and its effect on memory impairment in the disease is very poorly explored. The current research was aimed at investigating the role of melatonin pretreatment on memory and motor behavior in healthy rats and those with the partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD. All rodents were pretreated with melatonin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for 5 days. At 24 h and 7 days after the first treatment for healthy rats, and at the second and third week post-lesion for those with PD, the animals were tested behaviorally (apomorphine-induced rotations, rotarod, and passive avoidance tests). The neurochemical levels of dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin (Sero) in the brain were also determined. The results showed that in healthy animals, melatonin pretreatment had amnestic and motor-suppressive effects and did not change the levels of measured brain neurotransmitters. In animals with PD, melatonin pretreatment exerted a neuroprotective effect, manifested as a significantly decreased number of apomorphine-induced rotations, reduced number of falls in the rotarod test, and improved memory performance. The brain DA and ACh concentrations in the same animals were restored to the control levels, and those of NA and Sero did not change. Our results demonstrate a beneficial effect of melatonin on memory and motor disturbance in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Inflammation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) alleviates mitochondrial apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells, and to further explore the mechanism involved. Prepared PC-12 cells were treated with IGF-1, Mdivi-1 (DRP1 blocker), LY294002 (PI3K blocker), betulinic acid (NF-κB activator) or their combinations. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation were then measured to assess mitochondrial function. The rate of apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The expression of several apoptosis proteins (i.e. Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and signaling proteins (i.e. p-GSK3β, NF-κB and NLRP3) was measured using western blotting. Compared with the control cells, the LPS-treated cells showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased apoptosis and upregulation of apoptosis proteins, which were significantly alleviated by Mdivi-1. These findings indicate that neuronal apoptosis was activated partly through the mitochondrial pathway. IGF-1 treatment inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-treated cells. The reagent also increased the expression of p-GSK3β and decreased the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. Both LY294002 and betulinic acid reversed the protective effect of IGF-1. In addition, LY294002 affected the expression of the three signaling proteins, while betulinic acid only affected the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. These findings indicated a GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway was existed and was involved in the protective mechanism of IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 alleviated mitochondrial apoptosis through GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We study multifrequency Hebbian plasticity by analyzing phenomenological models of weakly connected neural networks. We start with an analysis of a model for single-frequency networks previously shown to learn and memorize phase differences between component oscillators. We then study a model for gradient frequency neural networks (GrFNNs) which extends the single-frequency model by introducing frequency detuning and nonlinear coupling terms for multifrequency interactions. Our analysis focuses on models of two coupled oscillators and examines the dynamics of steady-state behaviors in multiple parameter regimes available to the models. We find that the model for two distinct frequencies shares essential dynamical properties with the single-frequency model and that Hebbian learning results in stronger connections for simple frequency ratios than for complex ratios. We then compare the analysis of the two-frequency model with numerical simulations of the GrFNN model and show that Hebbian plasticity in the latter is locally dominated by a nonlinear resonance captured by the two-frequency model.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The majority of imaging studies in ALS infer group-level imaging signatures from group comparisons, as opposed to estimating disease burden in individual patients. In a condition with considerable clinical heterogeneity, the characterisation of individual patterns of pathology is hugely relevant. In this study, we evaluate a strategy to track progressive cortical involvement in single patients by using subject-specific reference cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We have interrogated a multi-timepoint longitudinal dataset of 61 ALS patients to demonstrate the utility of estimating cortical disease burden and the expansion of cerebral atrophy over time. We contrast our strategy to the gold-standard approach to gauge the advantages and drawbacks of our method. We modelled the evolution of cortical integrity in a conditional growth model, in which we accounted for age, gender, disability, symptom duration, education and handedness. We hypothesised that the variance associated with demographic variables will be successfully eliminated in our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In our model, the only covariate which modulated the expansion of atrophy was motor disability as measured by the ALSFRS-r (t(153) = − 2.533, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0123). Using the standard approach, age also significantly influenced progression of CT change (t(153) = − 2.151, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.033) demonstrating the validity and potential clinical utility of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our strategy of estimating the extent of cortical atrophy in individual patients with ALS successfully corrects for demographic factors and captures relevant cortical changes associated with clinical disability. Our approach provides a framework to interpret single T1-weighted images in ALS and offers an opportunity to track cortical propagation patterns both at individual subject level and at cohort level.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cognitive impairment is an important and diverse symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Sex is a purported risk variable for cognitive decline in PD, but has not been comprehensively investigated.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This cross-sectional and longitudinal study examined sex differences in global and domain-specific cognitive performance in a large PD cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cognitive function was evaluated using the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination in 392 people with PD (PwP) from the Australian Parkinson’s Disease Registry. The influence of sex on domain-specific cognitive performance was investigated using covariate-corrected generalised linear models. In a repeated measures longitudinal subset of 127 PwP, linear mixed models were used to assess the impact of sex on cognition over time, while accounting for covariates.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cross-sectional-corrected modelling revealed that sex was significantly predictive of cognitive performance, with males performing worse than females on global cognition, and memory and fluency domains. Longitudinally, sex was significantly predictive of cognitive decline, with males exhibiting a greater reduction in global cognition and language, whereas females showed a greater decline in attention/orientation, memory and visuospatial domains, despite starting with higher baseline scores. At follow-up, a significantly higher proportion of males than females fulfilled criteria for mild cognitive impairment or PD dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sex was revealed as a significant determinant of overall cognitive performance as well as specific cognitive domains, with a differential pattern of decline in male and female participants. Such sex-specific findings appear to explain some of the heterogeneity observed in PD, warranting further investigation of mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The col-cap concept encouraged neurologists to inject a large group of muscles in the treatment of cervical dystonia. This includes deep muscles such as the obliquus capitis inferior or the semispinalis capitis, and muscles close to vascular or neurological structures such as scalene muscles. Our aim was to determine the accuracy of injections in cervical muscles using ultrasonography (US) or palpation of anatomical landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A mix of paint, gelatin and iodized contrast agent was injected in nine pairs of cervical muscles of human cadavers, according to two injection techniques: US-guided and non-guided. The dye was localized on 1 cm-thick, frozen slices.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A total of 102 muscles was injected in the US-guided group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 8). The global accuracy was 88.2%. The lowest accuracy was in the OCI (41.7%); trying to avoid the vertebral artery, injections were too medial. A total of 54 muscles was injected in the non-guided group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 3). The global accuracy was 48.0%; moreover, some dye was found in four blood vessels. The embalming process produced texture changes, making difficult the palpation of bony landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our results indicate that US-guided injections are more accurate than non-guided injections in most cervical muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in profound neurologic impairment with widespread deficits in sensorimotor and autonomic systems. Voluntary and autonomic control of bladder function is disrupted resulting in possible detrusor overactivity, low compliance, and uncoordinated bladder and external urethral sphincter contractions impairing storage and/or voiding. Conservative treatments managing neurogenic bladder post-injury, such as oral pharmacotherapy and catheterization, are important components of urological surveillance and clinical care. However, as urinary complications continue to impact long-term morbidity in this population, additional therapeutic and rehabilitative approaches are needed that aim to improve function by targeting the recovery of underlying impairments. Several human and animal studies, including our previously published reports, have documented gains in bladder function due to activity-based recovery strategies, such as locomotor training. Furthermore, epidural stimulation of the spinal cord (scES) combined with intense activity-based recovery training has been shown to produce volitional lower extremity movement, standing, as well as improve the regulation of cardiovascular function. In our center, several participants anecdotally reported improvements in bladder function as a result of training with epidural stimulation configured for motor systems. Thus, in this study, the effects of activity-based recovery training in combination with scES were tested on bladder function, resulting in improvements in overall bladder storage parameters relative to a control cohort (no intervention). However, elevated blood pressure elicited during bladder distention, characteristic of autonomic dysreflexia, was not attenuated with training. We then examined, in a separate, large cross-sectional cohort, the interaction between detrusor pressure and blood pressure at maximum capacity, and found that the functional relationship between urinary bladder distention and blood pressure regulation is disrupted. Regardless of one’s bladder emptying method (indwelling suprapubic catheter vs. intermittent catheterization), autonomic instability can play a critical role in the ability to improve bladder storage, with SCI enhancing the vesico-vascular reflex. These results support the role of intersystem stimulation, integrating scES for both bladder and cardiovascular function to further improve bladder storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A key challenge in developmental neuroscience is identifying the local regulatory mechanisms that control neurite and synaptic refinement over large brain volumes. Innovative molecular techniques and high-resolution imaging tools are beginning to reshape our view of how local protein translation in subcellular compartments drives axonal, dendritic, and synaptic development and plasticity. Here we review recent progress in three areas of neurite and synaptic study in situ—compartment-specific transcriptomics/translatomics, targeted proteomics, and super-resolution imaging analysis of synaptic organization and development. We discuss synergies between sequencing and imaging techniques for the discovery and validation of local molecular signaling mechanisms regulating synaptic development, plasticity, and maintenance in circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There are growing indications for the involvement of calcium stores in the plastic properties of neurons and particularly in dendritic spines of central neurons. The store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels are assumed to be activated by the calcium sensor stromal interaction molecule (STIM)which leads to activation of its associated Orai channel. There are two STIM species, and the differential role of the two in SOCE is not entirely clear. In the present study, we were able to distinguish between transfected STIM1, which is more mobile primarily in young neurons, and STIM2 which is less mobile and more prominent in older neurons in culture. STIM1 mobility is associated with spontaneous calcium sparks, local transient rise in cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and in the formation and elongation of dendritic filopodia/spines. In contrast, STIM2 is associated with older neurons, where it is mobile and moves into dendritic spines primarily when cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; levels are reduced, apparently to activate resident Orai channels. These results highlight a role for STIM1 in the regulation of [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; fluctuations associated with the formation of dendritic spines or filopodia in the developing neuron, whereas STIM2 is associated with the maintenance of calcium entry into stores in the adult neuron.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Nedd4 family interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1) is an adaptor of Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligases. Experimental results showed that Ndfip1 had a potential neuroprotective effect in neurology diseases. However, the neuroprotective effect and the underlying mechanisms of Ndfip1 in Parkinson's disease (PD) have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we explored the neuroprotective effect of Ndfip1 against mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone in a human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line and further elucidated its possible underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that rotenone could induce the up-regulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in both mRNA and protein levels. The expression of Ndfip1 decreased at 24 h after rotenone treatment. Further study showed that high expression of Ndfip1 could protect SH-SY5Y cells against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity and antagonize the rotenone-induced increase in α-syn protein levels. In addition, high expression of Ndfip1 inhibited rotenone-induced increase in the protein levels of caspase-3 and decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Further study showed that Ndfip1 did not affect the protein expression of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), while antagonized the increase in protein levels of P62 and ferritin L caused by rotenone. Our findings provide specific identification of Ndfip1 proteins to inhibit the increase of α-syn in rotenone-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Ndfip1 might be a new theoretical drug target for the prevention and treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Due to its rarity, coupled to a multifactorial and very heterogeneous nature, the molecular etiology of Arnold-Chiari (AC) syndrome remains almost totally unknown. Its relationship with other neuropsychiatric disorders such as Tourette syndrome (TS) is also undetermined. The rare comorbid status between both disorders (ACTS) complicates the framework of diagnosis and negatively affects the patients' quality of life. In this exploratory study, we aimed to identify serum microRNA expression profiles as molecular fingerprints for AC, TS, and ACTS, by using a high-throughput approach. For this aim, 10 AC patients, 11 ACTS patients, 6 TS patients, and 8 unaffected controls (NC) were recruited. Nine miRNAs resulted significantly differentially expressed (DE): let-7b-5p (upregulated in ACTS vs. TS); miR-21-5p (upregulated in ACTS vs. AC; downregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-23a-3p (upregulated in TS vs. NCs; downregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-25-3p (upregulated in AC vs. TS and NCs; downregulated in ACTS vs. AC); miR-93-5p (upregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-130a-3p (downregulated in ACTS and TS vs. NCs); miR-144-3p (downregulated in ACTS vs. AC; upregulated in AC vs. TS); miR-222-3p (upregulated in ACTS vs. NCs); miR-451a (upregulated in AC vs. TS and NCs; in ACTS vs. NCs). Altered expression of miRNAs was statistically correlated to neuroimaging and neuropsychological anomalies. Furthermore, computational analyses indicated that DE miRNAs are involved in AC and TS pathomechanisms. Finally, we propose the dysregulation of the miRNA set as a potential molecular tool for supporting the current diagnosis of AC, TS, and ACTS by using liquid biopsies, in an unbiased and non-invasive way.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of small fibres is gaining attention in the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies, such as diabetes mellitus, and pain research. However, it is still challenging to characterise the electrical characteristics of axons in small fibres (Aδ and C fibres). In particular, in vitro measurement for human Aδ-fibre is difficult due to the presence of myelin and ethical reason. In this study, we investigate the in vivo electrical characteristics of the human Aδ-fibre to derive strength–duration (S–D) curves from the measurement. The Aδ-fibres are stimulated using coaxial planar electrodes with intraepidermal needle tip. For human volunteer experiments, the S–D curve of Aδ-fibre is obtained in terms of injected electrical current. With the computational analysis, the standard deviation of the S–D curve is mostly attributed to the thickness of the stratum corneum and depth of the needle tip, in addition to the fibre thickness. Then, we derive electrical parameters of the axon in the Aδ-fibre based on a conventional fibre model. The parameters derived here would be important in exploring the optimal stimulation condition of Aδ-fibres.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Neurofeedback training (NFT) has recently been proposed as a valuable technique for cognitive enhancement and psychiatric amelioration. However, effect of NFT of alpha activity on memory is controversial. The current study analyzed previous works in terms of randomized and blinded analyses, training paradigms, and participant characteristics to validate the efficacy of alpha NFT on memory in a healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: A systematic meta-analysis of studies with randomized controlled trials was performed to explore the effect of alpha NFT on working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM) in a healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from January 1, 1999, to November 30, 2019. Previous studies were evaluated with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB). A meta-analysis calculating absolute weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) using random-effects models was employed. Heterogeneity was estimated using I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistics. Funnel plots and Egger's test were performed to evaluate the quality of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Sixteen studies with 217 healthy participants in the control group and 210 participants in the alpha group met the eligibility criteria. Alpha NFT studies with WM measures presented little publication bias (P = 0.116), and 5 of 7 domains in the Cochrane RoB exhibited a low risk of bias. The overall effect size from 14 WM studies was 0.56 (95% CI 0.31–0.81, P &amp;lt; 0.0001; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 28%). Six EM studies exhibited an effect size of 0.77 (95% CI 0.06–1.49, P = 0.03; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 77%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Meta-analysis results suggest that alpha NFT seems to have a positive effect on the WM and EM of healthy participants. Future efforts should focus on the neurophysiological mechanisms of alpha NFT in memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems enable an alternative communication channel for severely-motor disabled patients to interact with their environment using no muscular movements. In recent years, the importance of research into non-gaze dependent brain-computer interface paradigms has been increasing, in contrast to the most frequently studied BCI-based speller paradigm (i.e., row-column presentation, RCP). Several visual modifications that have already been validated under the RCP paradigm for communication purposes have not been validated under the most extended non-gaze dependent rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. Thus, in the present study, three different sets of stimuli were assessed under RSVP, with the following communication features: white letters (WL), famous faces (FF), neutral pictures (NP). Eleven healthy subjects participated in this experiment, in which the subjects had to go through a calibration phase, an online phase and, finally, a subjective questionnaire completion phase. The results showed that the FF and NP stimuli promoted better performance in the calibration and online phases, being slightly better in the FF paradigm. Regarding the subjective questionnaires, again both FF and NP were preferred by the participants in contrast to the WL stimuli, but this time the NP stimuli scored slightly higher. These findings suggest that the use of FF and NP for RSVP-based spellers could be beneficial to increase information transfer rate in comparison to the most frequently used letter-based stimuli and could represent a promising communication system for individuals with altered ocular-motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Modeling the dynamics of neural masses is a common approach in the study of neural populations. Various models have been proven useful to describe a plenitude of empirical observations including self-sustained local oscillations and patterns of distant synchronization. We discuss the extent to which mass models really resemble the mean dynamics of a neural population. In particular, we question the validity of neural mass models if the population under study comprises a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are densely (inter-)connected. Starting from a network of noisy leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, we formulated two different population dynamics that both fall into the category of seminal Freeman neural mass models. The derivations contained several mean-field assumptions and time scale separation(s) between membrane and synapse dynamics. Our comparison of these neural mass models with the averaged dynamics of the population reveals bounds in the fraction of excitatory/inhibitory neuron as well as overall network degree for a mass model to provide adequate estimates. For substantial parameter ranges, our models fail to mimic the neural network's dynamics proper, be that in de-synchronized or in (high-frequency) synchronized states. Only around the onset of low-frequency synchronization our models provide proper estimates of the mean potential dynamics. While this shows their potential for, e.g., studying resting state dynamics obtained by encephalography with focus on the transition region, we must accept that predicting the more general dynamic outcome of a neural network via its mass dynamics requires great care.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death today. The current identification method of the diseases is analyzing the Electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a medical monitoring technology recording cardiac activity. Unfortunately, looking for experts to analyze a large amount of ECG data consumes too many medical resources. Therefore, the method of identifying ECG characteristics based on machine learning has gradually become prevalent. However, there are some drawbacks to these typical methods, requiring manual feature recognition, complex models, and long training time. This paper proposes a robust and efficient 12-layer deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network on classifying the five micro-classes of heartbeat types in the MIT- BIH Arrhythmia database. The five types of heartbeat features are classified, and wavelet self-adaptive threshold denoising method is used in the experiments. Compared with BP neural network, random forest, and other CNN networks, the results show that the model proposed in this paper has better performance in accuracy, sensitivity, robustness, and anti-noise capability. Its accurate classification effectively saves medical resources, which has a positive effect on clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Until recently, the visualization of cerebral microvessels was hampered by the fact that only short segments of vessels could be evaluated in brain sections by histochemistry. These limitations have been overcome by light sheet microscopy, which allows the 3D analysis of microvasculature in cleared brains. A major limitation of light sheet microscopy is that antibodies do not sufficiently penetrate cleared brains. We herein describe a technique of reverse clearing and rehydration, which after microvascular network analysis allows brain sectioning and immunohistochemistry employing a broad set of antibodies. Performing light sheet microscopy on brains of mice exposed to intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we show that in the early phase of microvascular remodeling branching point density was markedly reduced, more strongly than microvascular length. Brain infarcts in light sheet microscopy were sharply demarcated by their autofluorescence signal, closely corresponding to brain infarcts revealed by Nissl staining. Neuronal survival, leukocyte infiltration, and astrocytic reactivity could be evaluated by immunohistochemistry in rehydrated brains, as shown in direct comparisons with non-cleared brains. Immunohistochemistry revealed microthrombi in ischemic microvessels that were likely responsible for the marked branching point loss. The balance between microvascular thrombosis and remodeling warrants further studies at later time-points after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The topological organization of human brain networks can be mathematically characterized by the connectivity degree distribution of network nodes. However, there is no clear consensus on whether the topological structure of brain networks follows a power law or other probability distributions, and whether it is altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we employed resting-state functional MRI and graph theory approaches to investigate the fitting of degree distributions of the whole-brain functional networks and seven subnetworks in healthy subjects and individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), i.e., the prodromal stage of AD, and whether they are altered and correlated with cognitive performance in patients. Forty-one elderly cognitively healthy controls and 30 aMCI subjects were included. We constructed functional connectivity matrices among brain voxels and examined nodal degree distributions that were fitted by maximum likelihood estimation. In the whole-brain networks and all functional subnetworks, the connectivity degree distributions were fitted better by the Weibull distribution [f(x)~x&lt;sup&gt;(β−1)&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;(−λx&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;] than power law or power law with exponential cutoff. Compared with the healthy control group, the aMCI group showed lower Weibull β parameters (shape factor) in both the whole-brain networks and all seven subnetworks (false-discovery rate-corrected, p &amp;lt; 0.05). These decreases of the Weibull β parameters in the whole-brain networks and all subnetworks except for ventral attention were associated with reduced cognitive performance in individuals with aMCI. Thus, we provided a short-tailed model to capture intrinsic connectivity structure of the human brain functional networks in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) generate pacemaker activity responsible for phasic contractions in colonic segmentation and peristalsis. ICC along the submucosal border (ICC-SM) contribute to mixing and more complex patterns of colonic motility. We show the complex patterns of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in ICC-SM and the relationship between ICC-SM Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients and activation of SMCs using optogenetic tools. ICC-SM displayed rhythmic firing of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients ~15 cpm and paced adjacent SMCs. The majority of spontaneous activity occurred in regular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients clusters (CTCs) that propagated through the network. CTCs were organized and dependent upon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry through voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances, L- and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Removal of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from the external solution abolished CTCs. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release mechanisms reduced the duration and amplitude of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients but did not block CTCs. These data reveal how colonic pacemaker ICC-SM exhibit complex Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; firing patterns and drive smooth muscle activity and overall colonic contractions.</content>

 Checkpoints maintain the order of cell cycle events during DNA damage or incomplete replication. How the checkpoint response is tailored to different phases of the cell cycle remains poorly understood. The S-phase checkpoint for example results in the slowing of replication, which in budding yeast occurs by Rad53-dependent inhibition of the initiation factors Sld3 and Dbf4. Despite this, we show here that Rad53 phosphorylates both of these substrates throughout the cell cycle at the same sites as in S-phase, suggesting roles for this pathway beyond S-phase. Indeed, we show that Rad53-dependent inhibition of Sld3 and Dbf4 limits re-replication in G2/M, preventing gene amplification. In addition, we show that inhibition of Sld3 and Dbf4 in G1 prevents premature initiation at all origins at the G1/S transition. This study redefines the scope of the 'S-phase checkpoint' with implications for understanding checkpoint function in cancers that lack cell cycle controls.</content>

 COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. T cells play a key role in the adaptive antiviral immune response by killing infected cells and facilitating the selection of virus-specific antibodies. However neither the dynamics and cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response nor the diversity of resulting immune memory are well understood. In this study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to track changes in the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19. In both donors we identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones with transient clonal expansion after infection. The antigen specificity of CD8+ TCR sequences to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes was confirmed by both MHC tetramer binding and presence in large database of SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCRs. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential occurence of these motifs in publicly available large dataset of repertoires from COVID-19 patients. We show that in both donors the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes. Certain T cell clones were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection timepoint, suggesting participation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</content>

 In response to physiological demand, the pituitary gland generates new hormone-secreting cells from committed progenitor cells throughout life. It remains unclear to what extent pituitary stem cells (PSCs), which uniquely express SOX2, contribute to pituitary growth and renewal. Moreover, neither the signals that drive proliferation nor their sources have been elucidated. We have used genetic approaches in the mouse, showing that the WNT pathway is essential for proliferation of all lineages in the gland. We reveal that SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;stem cells are a key source of WNT ligands. By blocking secretion of WNTs from SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;PSCs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we demonstrate that proliferation of neighbouring committed progenitor cells declines, demonstrating that progenitor multiplication depends on the paracrine WNT secretion from SOX2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PSCs. Our results indicate that stem cells can hold additional roles in tissue expansion and homeostasis, acting as paracrine signalling centres to coordinate the proliferation of neighbouring cells.</content>

 The extracellular space (ECS) plays a central role for brain physiology, shaping the time course and spread of neurochemicals, ions and nutrients that ensure proper brain homeostasis and neuronal communication. Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glia cell in the brain, whose processes densely infiltrate the brain's parenchyma. As astrocytes are highly sensitive to changes in osmotic pressure, they are capable of exerting a potent physiological influence on the ECS. However, little is known about the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of the ECS that surrounds astrocytes, owing mostly to a lack of appropriate techniques to visualize the ECS in live brain tissue. Mitigating this technical limitation, we applied the recent SUper-resolution SHadow Imaging technique (SUSHI) to astrocyte-labeled organotypic hippocampal brain slices, which allowed us to concurrently image the complex morphology of astrocytes and the ECS with nanoscale resolution in a live experimental setting. Focusing on ring-like astrocytic microstructures in the spongiform domain, we found them to enclose sizable pools of interstitial fluid and cellular structures like dendritic spines. Upon an experimental osmotic challenge, these microstructures remodeled and swelled up at the expense of the pools, effectively increasing the physical contact between astrocytic and cellular structures. Our study reveals novel facets of the dynamic microanatomical relationships between astrocytes, neuropil and the ECS in living brain tissue, which could be of functional relevance for neuron-glia communication in a variety of (patho)physiological settings, e.g. LTP induction, epileptic seizures or acute ischemic stroke, where osmotic disturbances are known to occur.</content>

 Neural activity from animals is often used as a proxy for the human brain. However, due to distinct environmental pressures, the relevance of perceptual systems described in animal models can be unclear. This problem is accentuated when animal physiology and human behaviour are not in complete agreement, as is the case for binaural hearing-in-noise. As a means to bridge this gap we reverse-engineered artificial neural networks from binaural psychophysics. By comparing in silico  physiology in neural networks with in vivo animal data, we were able to make inferences as to the basis of binaural perception in humans. We observed the emergence of highly specialized solutions to account for low frequency sound detection. Artificial neurons developed a sensitivity to temporal delays that increased hierarchically and were widely distributed in preference. Network dynamics were consistent with a cross-correlator, comparable to the type reported in animal physiology. Our results attest to the likely prominence of this neural mechanism in human biology. Moreover, this is a primary demonstration that deep learning can infer tangible neural mechanisms underlying auditory perception.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Behavioral studies have shown that humans account for inertial acceleration in their decisions of hand choice when reaching during body motion. Physiologically, it is unclear at what stage of movement preparation information about body motion is integrated in the process of hand selection. Here, we addressed this question by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation over motor cortex (M1) of human participants who performed a preferential reach task while they were sinusoidally translated on a linear motion platform. If M1 only represents a read-out of the final hand choice, we expect the body motion not to affect the MEP amplitude. If body motion biases the hand selection process prior to target onset, we expect corticospinal excitability to modulate with the phase of the motion, with larger MEP amplitudes for phases that show a bias to using the right hand. Behavioral results replicate our earlier findings of a sinusoidal modulation of hand choice bias with motion phase. MEP amplitudes also show a sinusoidal modulation with motion phase, suggesting that body motion influences corticospinal excitability which may ultimately reflect changes of hand preference. The modulation being present prior to target onset suggests that competition between hands is represented throughout the corticospinal tract. Its phase relationship with the motion profile suggests that other processes after target onset take up time until the hand selection process has been completely resolved, and the reach is initiated. We conclude that the corticospinal correlates of hand preference are modulated by body motion.</content>

 Theories of perception based on discrete sampling posit that visual consciousness is reconstructed based on snapshot-like perceptual moments, as opposed to being updated continuously. According to a model proposed by Schneider (2018), discrete sampling can explain both the flash-lag and the Frohlich illusion, whereby a lag in the conscious updating of a moving stimulus alters its perceived spatial location in comparison to a stationary stimulus. The alpha-band frequency, which is associated with phasic modulation of stimulus detection and the temporal resolution of perception, has been proposed to reflect the duration of perceptual moments. The goal of this study was to determine whether a single oscillator (e.g., alpha) is underlying the duration of perceptual moments, which would predict that the point of subjective equality (PSE) in the flash-lag and Frohlich illusions are positively correlated across individuals. Although our displays induced robust flash-lag and Frohlich effects, virtually zero correlation was seen between the PSE in the two illusions, indicating that the illusion magnitudes are unrelated across observers. These findings suggest that, if discrete sampling theory is true, these illusory percepts either rely on different oscillatory frequencies or not on oscillations at all. Alternatively, discrete sampling may not be the mechanism underlying these two motion illusions or our methods were ill-suited to test the theory.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Importance: Structural brain maturation and sleep are complex processes that exhibit significant changes over adolescence and are linked to healthy physical and mental development. The precise timing and magnitude of these changes influence function throughout the lifespan. However, the relationships between gray matter structure and sleep patterns during adolescence are not fully understood. A detailed characterization of brain-sleep associations during this sensitive period is crucial for understanding factors contributing to optimal neurodevelopmental trajectories in adolescence. Objective: To investigate whether sleep-gray matter relationships are developmentally-invariant (i.e., stable across age) or developmentally-specific (i.e., only present during discrete time windows) from late childhood through young adulthood. Setting: The Neuroimaging and Pediatric Sleep Databank was constructed from 8 research studies conducted at the University of Pittsburgh between 2009 and 2020. Participants: The final sample consisted of 240 participants without current psychiatric diagnoses (9-25 years), and with good quality sleep tracking and structural MRI (sMRI) data. Design: Participants completed a sMRI scan and 5-7 days of wrist actigraphy to assess naturalistic sleep. We examined cross-sectional associations between sMRI measures and sleep patterns, as well as the effects of age, sex, and their interaction with sMRI measures on sleep. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Using Freesurfer software, we extracted cortical thickness and subcortical volumes from T1-weighted MRI. Sleep patterns (duration, timing, continuity, regularity) were estimated from wrist actigraphy. Results. Shorter sleep duration, later sleep timing, and poorer sleep continuity were associated with a stable pattern of thinner cortex and altered subcortical volumes in diverse brain regions across adolescence. In a discrete subset of regions (e.g., posterior cingulate), thinner cortex was associated with these sleep patterns from late childhood through early-to-mid adolescence, but not in late adolescence and young adulthood. Conclusions and Relevance: In childhood and adolescence, developmentally-invariant and developmentally-specific associations exist between sleep patterns and gray matter structure, in a wide array of brain regions linked to many sensory, cognitive, and emotional processes. Sleep intervention during specific developmental periods could potentially promote healthier neurodevelopmental outcomes.</content>

 Our ability to develop the cognitive strategies required to deal with daily-life stress is regulated by region-specific neuronal networks. Experimental evidences suggest that prolonged stress in mice induces depressive-like behaviors via morphological, functional and molecular changes affecting the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic pathways. Yet, the molecular interactions underlying these changes are still poorly understood and whether they affect males and females similarly is unknown. Here, we used chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) to induce depressive-like behaviors in male and female mice. Density of the mesolimbic and cortical projections was assessed via immuno-histochemistry combined with Sholl analysis along with the staining of the activity-dependent markers pERK and c-Fos in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We showed that social stress decreases the density of dopaminergic axonal projections to the mPFC but not to the NAc in susceptible and resilient mice. This was accompanied by sex-specific alterations of pERK and c-Fos expression in the VTA of susceptible but not resilient mice. Our results indicate that social defeat stress impacts the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways by altering the molecular interactions regulating somatic and axonal plasticity differently in males and females.</content>

 Skillful and accurate object manipulation requires the object's dynamics to be represented within a motor memory. Despite extensive research, how the motor system represents novel dynamics is still an open question. This representation is normally examined by testing the spatial generalization of the learned forces. However, previous studies have not been able to provide a consistent view of this representation in the motor system, with each study providing evidence favoring an extrinsic coordinate system, an intrinsic coordinate system, an object-based representation, or mixtures of these coordinate systems, but no study could definitively exclude other possibilities. Most previous studies used a skew viscous force field, but these force fields limit the use of channel trials and can therefore prevent us from distinguishing between different coordinate systems. Here we propose a novel method to overcome these disadvantages, by developing a new force field in which a curl force field is scaled by a trigonometric function of movement direction allowing precise assessment of the learned generalization. In a series of four experiments we show that the representation of ambiguous external dynamics is formed by a mixture of extrinsic, intrinsic and object-based coordinate systems with a slightly higher weighting for the object-based representation compared with Cartesian or joint representations. These results highlight the existence of multiple representations in the motor system but more importantly it shows that for certain dynamics the motor system prefers representation using a mixture of representations over single frame based representation.</content>

 The concept of TRR indexes the repeatability or consistency of a measurement across time. High TRR of measures is critical for any scientific study, specifically for the study of individual differences. Evidence of poor TRR of commonly used behavioral and functional neuroimaging tasks is mounting (e.g., Hedge et al., 2018; Elliot et al., 2020). These reports have called into question the adequacy of using even the most common, well-characterized cognitive tasks with robust population-level task effects, to measure individual differences. Here, we demonstrate the limitations of the ICC, the classical metric that captures TRR as a proportional variance ratio. Specifically, the ICC metric is limited when characterizing TRR of cognitive tasks that rely on many individual trials to repeatedly evoke a psychological state or behavior. We first examine when and why conventional ICCs underestimate TRR. Further, based on recent foundational work (Rouder and Haaf, 2019; Haines et al., 2020), we lay out a hierarchical framework that takes into account the data structure down to the trial level and estimates TRR as a correlation divorced from trial-level variability. As part of this process, we examine several modeling issues associated with the conventional ICC formulation and assess how different factors (e.g., trial and subject sample sizes, relative magnitude of cross-trial variability) impact TRR. We reference the tools of TRR and 3dLMEr for the community to apply these models to behavior and neuroimaging data.</content>

 Cold temperatures can be fatal to insects, but many species have evolved the ability to cold acclimate, thereby increasing their cold tolerance. While there is a growing body of knowledge concerning the mechanisms underlying cold tolerance, relatively little is known concerning how insects sense noxious cold (cold nociception), or how cold nociception might function in cold tolerance. It has been previously shown that Drosophila melanogaster larvae perform highly stereotyped, cold-evoked behaviors under the control of noxious cold-sensing neurons (nociceptors) innervating the barrier epidermis. In the present study, we first sought to describe cold-nociceptive behavior among 11 drosophilid species with differing cold tolerances and from differing climates. Behavioral analyses revealed that the predominant cold-evoked response among drosophilid larvae is a head-to-tail contraction (CT) behavior, which is likely inherited from a common ancestor. However, despite lack of phylogenetic signal (suggesting trait lability), the CT behavior was transient and there was no clear evidence that cold sensitivity was related to thermal environment; collectively this suggests that the behavior might not be adaptive. We therefore sought to uncover an alternative way that cold nociception might be protective. Using a combination of cold-shock assays, optogenetics, electrophysiology, and methods to genetically disrupt neural transmission, we demonstrate that cold sensing neurons in Drosophila melanogaster (Class III nociceptors) are sensitized by and critical to cold acclimation. Moreover, we demonstrate that cold acclimation can be optogenetically-evoked, sans cold. Collectively, these findings reveal that cold nociception constitutes a peripheral neural basis for Drosophila larval cold acclimation.

Significance StatementMany insects adapt to cold in response to developmental exposure to cool temperatures. While there is a growing body of knowledge concerning the mechanisms underlying cold tolerance, it is unknown how sensory neurons might contribute. Here, we show that noxious cold sensing (cold nociception) is widely present among drosophilid larvae, and that cold-sensing neurons (Class III cold nociceptors) are necessary and sufficient drivers of cold acclimation. This suggests that cold acclimation has, at least in part, a neural basis.</content>

 Trance processes are a form of altered states of consciousness (ASC) widely reported across cultures. Entering these states is often linked to auditory stimuli such as singing, chanting, or rhythmic drumming. While scientific research into this phenomenon is relatively nascent, there is emerging interest in investigating the neural correlates of altered states of consciousness such as trance. This report aims to add to this field of ASC through exploring how the perception of an experienced Sangoma--traditional South African healer--entering a trance process correlates to BOLD signal modulation with auditory stimuli. Functional MRI data were analyzed using a General Linear model comparing music versus no music condition multiplied by the percept of experiencing trance (High or Low). Positive BOLD activation was shown in auditory cortex in both hemispheres during a trance process. Other brain regions tightly correlated to trance perception were right parietal, right frontal, and area prostriata (P&amp;lt;0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Orbitofrontal cortex (part of the Default Mode Network) was negatively activated and most correlated with music when trance was high, showing the largest differential between high and low trance perception. This is the first study to directly correlate BOLD signal variations in an expert subjects percept of trance onset and intensity, providing insight into the neural signature and dynamics of this unique form of ASC. Future studies should examine in greater detail perception of trance processes in expert subjects, adding other neuroimaging modalities to further investigate how these brain regions are modulated by trance expertise.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The regulation of synaptic connectivity in the brain is vital to proper functioning and development of the central nervous system (CNS). Formation of neural networks in the CNS has been shown to be heavily influenced by astrocytes, which secrete factors, including thrombospondin (TSP) family proteins, that promote synaptogenesis. However, whether this process is different between males and females has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we found that cortical neurons purified from newborn male rats showed a significantly more robust synaptogenic response compared to female-derived cells when exposed to factors secreted from astrocytes. This difference was driven largely by the neuronal response to TSP2, which increased synapses in male neurons while showing no effect on female neurons. Blockade of endogenous 17{beta}-estradiol production with letrozole normalized the TSP response between male and female cells, indicating a level of regulation by estrogen signaling. Our results suggest that TSP-induced synaptogenesis is critical for the development of male but not female cortical synapses, contributing to sex differences in astrocyte-mediated synaptic connectivity.</content>

		<content type="html">
 During retrieval, aversive memories become labile during a period known as the reconsolidation window. When an extinction procedure is performed within the reconsolidation window, the original aversive memory can be replaced by one that is less traumatic. Our recent studies revealed that acidosis via inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO2) during retrieval enhances memory lability. However, the effects of CO2 inhalation on the central nervous system can be extensive, and there is a lack of prior evidence suggesting that the effects of CO2 are selective to a reactivated memory. The specific effects of CO2 depend on acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), proton receptors that are involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the amygdala. Our previous patch-clamping data suggests that CO2 inhalation during retrieval increases activities of neurons in the amygdala that involve in the memory trace. In addition, CO2 inhalation during retrieval increases exchanges from Ca2+-impermeable to Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors. Thus, we hypothesize that CO2 selectively potentiates memory lability in mice when inhaled during retrieval of aversive memory. In addition, CO2 inhalation alters memory lability via synaptic plasticity at selectively targeted synapses. Alterations in spine morphology after CO2 and retrieval with a specific stimulus indicates that CO2 selectively enhances synaptic plasticity. Overall, our results suggest that inhaling CO2 during the retrieval event increases the lability of an aversive memory through a synapse-specific reconsolidation process.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Whether a novel stimulus is expected or unexpected may have implications for the kind of ensuing encoding and the type of subsequent memory. Pupil response was used in the present study to explore the way expected and unexpected stimuli are encoded and whether encoding-linked pupil response is modulated by expectation. Participants first established a contingency relationship between a series of symbols and the type of stimulus (man-made or natural) that followed each one. At encoding, some of the target stimuli violated the previously established relationship (i.e., unexpected), while the majority conformed to this relationship (i.e., expected). Expectation at encoding had opposite effects on familiarity and recollection, the two types of memory that support recognition, and modulated differently the way pupil responses predicted subsequent memory. Encoding of unexpected novel stimuli was associated with increased pupil dilation as a predictor of subsequent memory type and strength. In contrast, encoding of expected novel stimuli was associated with decreased pupil response (constriction), which was predictive of subsequent memory type and strength. The findings support the close link between pupil response and memory formation, but critically indicate that this is modulated by the type of novelty as defined by expectation. These novel findings have important implications for the encoding mechanisms involved when different types of novelty are detected and is proposed to indicate the operation of different neurotransmitters in memory formation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 We introduce an extension of independent component analysis (ICA), called multiscale ICA (msICA), and design an approach to capture dynamic functional source interactions within and between multiple spatial scales. msICA estimates functional sources at multiple spatial scales without imposing direct constraints on the size of functional sources, overcomes the limitation of using fixed anatomical locations, and eliminates the need for model-order selection in ICA analysis. We leveraged this approach to study sex-specific and -common connectivity patterns in schizophrenia. Results show dynamic reconfiguration and interaction within and between multi-spatial scales. Sex-specific differences occur (1) within the subcortical domain, (2) between the somatomotor and cerebellum domains, and (3) between the temporal domain and several others, including the subcortical, visual, and default mode domains. Most of the sex-specific differences belong to between-spatial scale functional interactions and are associated with a dynamic state with strong functional interactions between the visual, somatomotor, and temporal domains and their anticorrelation patterns with the rest of the brain. We observed significant correlations between multi-spatial-scale functional interactions and symptom scores, highlighting the importance of multiscale analyses to identify potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. As such, we recommend such analyses as an important option for future functional connectivity studies.</content>

 Members of the SH3- and ankyrin-rich repeat (SHANK) protein family are considered as master scaffolds of the post-synaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. Several missense mutations within the canonical SHANK3 isoform have been proposed as causative for the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, there is a surprising paucity of data linking missense mutation-induced changes in protein structure and dynamics to the occurrence of ASD-related synaptic phenotypes. In this work, we focus on two ASD-associated point mutations, both located within the same domain of SHANK3. In a proof-of-principle study we demonstrate that both mutant proteins show indeed distinct changes in secondary and tertiary structure as well as higher conformational fluctuations. Local and surprisingly also distal structural disturbances of protein folding result in altered synaptic targeting and changes of protein turnover at synaptic sites.</content>

 The recent observation of superconductivity in Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 has raised fundamental questions about the hierarchy of the underlying electronic structure. Calculations suggest that this system falls in the Mott–Hubbard regime, rather than the charge-transfer configuration of other nickel oxides and the superconducting cuprates.

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus and parahippocampal region are essential for representing episodic memories involving various spatial locations and objects, and for using those memories for future adaptive behavior. The “dual‐stream model” was initially formulated based on anatomical characteristics of the medial temporal lobe, dividing the parahippocampal region into two streams that separately process and relay spatial and nonspatial information to the hippocampus. Despite its significance, the dual‐stream model in its original form cannot explain recent experimental results, and many researchers have recognized the need for a modification of the model. Here, we argue that dividing the parahippocampal region into spatial and nonspatial streams a priori may be too simplistic, particularly in light of ambiguous situations in which a sensory cue alone (e.g., visual scene) may not allow such a definitive categorization. Upon reviewing evidence, including our own, that reveals the importance of goal‐directed behavioral responses in determining the relative involvement of the parahippocampal processing streams, we propose the Goal‐directed Interaction of Stimulus and Task‐demand (GIST) model. In the GIST model, input stimuli such as visual scenes and objects are first processed by both the postrhinal and perirhinal cortices—the postrhinal cortex more heavily involved with visual scenes and perirhinal cortex with objects—with relatively little dependence on behavioral task demand. However, once perceptual ambiguities are resolved and the scenes and objects are identified and recognized, the information is then processed through the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, depending on whether it is used to fulfill navigational or non‐navigational goals, respectively. As complex sensory stimuli are utilized for both navigational and non‐navigational purposes in an intermixed fashion in naturalistic settings, the hippocampus may be required to then put together these experiences into a coherent map to allow flexible cognitive operations for adaptive behavior to occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Satyajit D Rao, Oleg A Igoshin&lt;/p&gt;

Bacteria use two-component systems (TCSs) to sense environmental conditions and change gene expression in response to those conditions. To amplify cellular responses, many bacterial TCSs are under positive feedback control, i.e. increase their expression when activated. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; -sensing TCS, PhoPQ, in addition to the positive feedback, includes a negative feedback loop via the upregulation of the MgrB protein that inhibits PhoQ. How the interplay of these feedback loops shapes steady-state and dynamical responses of PhoPQ TCS to change in Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; remains poorly understood. In particular, how the presence of MgrB feedback affects the robustness of PhoPQ response to overexpression of TCS is unclear. It is also unclear why the steady-state response to decreasing Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is biphasic, i.e. plateaus over a range of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations, and then increases again at growth-limiting Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to identify potential mechanisms behind these experimentally observed dynamical properties. The results make experimentally testable predictions for the regime with response robustness and propose a novel explanation of biphasic response constraining the mechanisms for modulation of PhoQ activity by Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and MgrB. Finally, we show how the interplay of positive and negative feedback loops affects the network’s steady-state sensitivity and response dynamics. In the absence of MgrB feedback, the model predicts oscillations thereby suggesting a general mechanism of oscillatory or pulsatile dynamics in autoregulated TCSs. These results improve the understanding of TCS signaling and other networks with overlaid positive and negative feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6fQ4zBAtcQo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Lyme carditis is an extracutaneous manifestation of Lyme disease characterized by episodes of atrioventricular block of varying degrees and additional, less reported cardiomyopathies. The molecular changes associated with the response to &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; over the course of infection are poorly understood. Here, we identify broad transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the heart during infection that reveal a profound down-regulation of mitochondrial components. We also describe the long-term functional modulation of macrophages exposed to live bacteria, characterized by an augmented glycolytic output, increased spirochetal binding and internalization, and reduced inflammatory responses. In vitro, glycolysis inhibition reduces the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by memory macrophages, whereas in vivo, it produces the reversion of the memory phenotype, the recovery of tissue mitochondrial components, and decreased inflammation and spirochetal burdens. These results show that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; induces long-term, memory-like responses in macrophages with tissue-wide consequences that are amenable to be manipulated in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PAFlA8PjHxs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Endosomal trafficking of receptors and associated proteins plays a critical role in signal processing. Until recently, it was thought that trafficking was shut down during cell division. Thus, remarkably, the regulation of trafficking during division remains poorly characterized. Here we delineate the role of mitotic kinases in receptor trafficking during asymmetric division. Targeted perturbations reveal that Cyclin-dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1) and Aurora Kinase promote storage of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFRs) by suppressing endosomal degradation and recycling pathways. As cells progress through metaphase, loss of CDK1 activity permits differential degradation and targeted recycling of stored receptors, leading to asymmetric induction. Mitotic receptor storage, as delineated in this study, may facilitate rapid reestablishment of signaling competence in nascent daughter cells. However, mutations that limit or enhance the release of stored signaling components could alter daughter cell fate or behavior thereby promoting oncogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GhkGFUKR_xU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Much of their biology thus remains elusive, because the organisms have not yet been isolated and grown in the lab. Katayama et al. lift the curtain on some intriguing biology by cultivating and studying bacteria from the elusive OP9 phylum (Atribacterota).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/C9pcEYlI2VE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Malaria parasites use the RhopH complex for erythrocyte invasion and channel-mediated nutrient uptake. As the member proteins are unique to &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium &lt;/i&gt;spp., how they interact and traffic through subcellular sites to serve these essential functions is unknown. We show that RhopH is synthesized as a soluble complex of CLAG3, RhopH2, and RhopH3 with 1:1:1 stoichiometry. After transfer to a new host cell, the complex crosses a vacuolar membrane surrounding the intracellular parasite and becomes integral to the erythrocyte membrane through a PTEX translocon-dependent process. We present a 2.9 Å single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of the trafficking complex, revealing that CLAG3 interacts with the other subunits over large surface areas. This soluble complex is tightly assembled with extensive disulfide bonding and predicted transmembrane helices shielded. We propose a large protein complex stabilized for trafficking but poised for host membrane insertion through large-scale rearrangements, paralleling smaller two-state pore-forming proteins in other organisms.</content>

 In adult mammals, hematopoiesis, the production of blood cells from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), is tightly regulated by extrinsic signals from the microenvironment called ‘niche’. Bone marrow HSPCs are heterogeneous and controlled by both endosteal and vascular niches. The Drosophila hematopoietic lymph gland is located along the cardiac tube which corresponds to the vascular system. In the lymph gland, the niche called Posterior Signaling Center controls only a subset of the heterogeneous hematopoietic progenitor population indicating that additional signals are necessary. Here we report that the vascular system acts as a second niche to control lymph gland homeostasis. The FGF ligand Branchless produced by vascular cells activates the FGF pathway in hematopoietic progenitors. By regulating intracellular calcium levels, FGF signaling maintains progenitor pools and prevents blood cell differentiation. This study reveals that two niches contribute to the control &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt;Drosophila blood cell homeostasis through their differential regulation of progenitors.</content>

 Coronavirus entry is mediated by the spike protein which binds the receptor and mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. The proteases that mediate entry differ between cell lines and it is currently unclear which proteases are relevant &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS), which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS increases infectivity on human airway organoids (hAOs). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into Calu-3 cells, and more frequently formed syncytia in hAOs. Moreover, the MBCS increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to cathepsin-mediated endosomal entry. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in hAOs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells using serine proteases, and suggest that the MBCS is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy.</content>

 Retinal structure and function have been studied in many vertebrate orders, but molecular characterization has been largely confined to mammals. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a cell atlas of the chick retina. We identified 136 cell types plus 14 positional or developmental intermediates distributed among the six classes conserved across vertebrates – photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and glial cells. To assess morphology of molecularly defined types, we adapted a method for CRISPR-based integration of reporters into selectively expressed genes. For Müller glia, we found that transcriptionally distinct cells were regionally localized along the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and central-peripheral retinal axes. We also identified immature photoreceptor, horizontal cell and oligodendrocyte types that persist into late embryonic stages. Finally, we analyzed relationships among chick, mouse and primate retinal cell classes and types. Our results provide a foundation for anatomical, physiological, evolutionary, and developmental studies of the avian visual system.</content>

 During embryonic development, radial glial cells give rise to neurons, then to astrocytes following the gliogenic switch. Timely regulation of the switch, operated by several transcription factors, is fundamental for allowing coordinated interactions between neurons and glia. We deleted the gene for one such factor, SOX9&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; early during mouse brain development and observed a significantly compromised dentate gyrus (DG). We dissected the origin of the defect, targeting embryonic &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt; deletion to either the DG neuronal progenitor domain or the adjacent cortical hem (CH). We identified in the latter previously uncharacterized ALDH1L1+ astrocytic progenitors, which form a fimbrial-specific glial scaffold necessary for neuronal progenitor migration towards the developing DG. Our results highlight an early crucial role of SOX9 for DG development through regulation of astroglial potential acquisition in the CH. Moreover, we illustrate how formation of a local network, amidst astrocytic and neuronal progenitors originating from adjacent domains, underlays brain morphogenesis.</content>

 Humans have undergone large migrations over the past hundreds to thousands of years, exposing ourselves to new environments and selective pressures. Yet, evidence of ongoing or recent selection in humans is difficult to detect. Many of these migrations also resulted in gene flow between previously separated populations. These recently admixed populations provide unique opportunities to study rapid evolution in humans. Developing methods based on distributions of local ancestry, we demonstrate that this sort of genetic exchange has facilitated detectable adaptation to a malaria parasite in the admixed population of Cabo Verde within the last ~20 generations. We estimate the selection coefficient is approximately 0.08, one of the highest inferred in humans. Notably, we show that this strong selection at a single locus has likely affected patterns of ancestry genome-wide, potentially biasing demographic inference. Our study provides evidence of adaptation in a human population on historical timescales.</content>

 Human oral soft tissues provide the first barrier of defence against chronic inflammatory disease and hold a remarkable scarless wounding phenotype. Tissue homeostasis requires coordinated actions of epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. However, the extent of heterogeneity within the human oral mucosa and how tissue cell types are affected during the course of disease progression is unknown. Using single-cell transcriptome profiling we reveal a striking remodelling of the epithelial and mesenchymal niches with a decrease in functional populations that are linked to the aetiology of the disease. Analysis of ligand–receptor interaction pairs identify potential intercellular hubs driving the inflammatory component of the disease. Our work establishes a reference map of the human oral mucosa in health and disease, and a framework for the development of new therapeutic strategies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The question of whether single cells can learn led to much debate in the early 20th century. The view prevailed that they were capable of non-associative learning but not of associative learning, such as Pavlovian conditioning. Experiments indicating the contrary were considered either non-reproducible or subject to more acceptable interpretations. Recent developments suggest that the time is right to reconsider this consensus. We exhume the experiments of Beatrice Gelber on Pavlovian conditioning in the ciliate &lt;i&gt;Paramecium aurelia&lt;/i&gt;, and suggest that criticisms of her findings can now be reinterpreted. Gelber was a remarkable scientist whose absence from the historical record testifies to the prevailing orthodoxy that single cells cannot learn. Her work, and more recent studies, suggest that such learning may be evolutionarily more widespread and fundamental to life than previously thought and we discuss the implications for different aspects of biology.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The LINC complex mechanically couples cytoskeletal and nuclear components across the nuclear envelope to fulfil a myriad of cellular functions, including nuclear shape and positioning, hearing and meiotic chromosome movements. The canonical model is that 3:3 interactions between SUN and KASH proteins underlie the nucleocytoskeletal linkages provided by the LINC complex. Here, we provide crystallographic and biophysical evidence that SUN-KASH is a constitutive 6:6 complex in which two constituent 3:3 complexes interact head-to-head. A common SUN-KASH topology is achieved through structurally diverse 6:6 interaction mechanisms by distinct KASH proteins, including zinc-coordination by Nesprin-4. The SUN-KASH 6:6 interface provides a molecular mechanism for the establishment of integrative and distributive connections between 3:3 structures within a branched LINC complex network. In this model, SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes act as nodes for force distribution and integration between adjacent SUN and KASH molecules, enabling the coordinated transduction of large forces across the nuclear envelope.</content>

 An exploration-exploitation trade-off, the arbitration between sampling a lesser-known against a known rich option, is thought to be solved using computationally demanding exploration algorithms. Given known limitations in human cognitive resources, we hypothesised the presence of additional cheaper strategies. We examined for such heuristics in choice behaviour where we show this involves a value-free random exploration, that ignores all prior knowledge, and a novelty exploration that targets novel options alone. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled drug study, assessing contributions of dopamine (400mg amisulpride) and noradrenaline (40mg propranolol), we show that value-free random exploration is attenuated under the influence of propranolol, but not under amisulpride. Our findings demonstrate that humans deploy distinct computationally cheap exploration strategies and where value-free random exploration is under noradrenergic control.</content>

 Epithelial tissues of the developing embryos elongate by different mechanisms, such as neighbor exchange, cell elongation, and oriented cell division. Since autonomous tissue self-organization is influenced by external cues such as morphogen gradients or neighboring tissues, it is difficult to distinguish intrinsic from directed tissue behavior. The mesoscopic processes leading to the different mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we study the spontaneous elongation behavior of spreading circular epithelial colonies in vitro. By quantifying deformation kinematics at multiple scales, we report that global elongation happens primarily due to cell elongations, and its direction correlates with the anisotropy of the average cell elongation. By imposing an external time-periodic stretch, the axis of this global symmetry breaking can be modified and elongation occurs primarily due to orientated neighbor exchange. These different behaviors are confirmed using a vertex model for collective cell behavior, providing a framework for understanding autonomous tissue elongation and its origins.</content>

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease. Although rigorous efforts identified the presence of 'cancer stem cells (CSCs)' in PDAC and molecular markers for them, stem cell dynamics &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; have not been clearly demonstrated. Here we focused on Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1), known as a CSC marker of PDAC. Using genetic lineage tracing with a dual-recombinase system and live imaging, we showed that Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tumor cells continuously provided progeny cells within pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, primary and metastatic PDAC and PDAC-derived spheroids &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, genes associated with CSC and epithelial mesenchymal transition were enriched in mouse Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and human DCLK1-high PDAC cells. Thus, we provided direct functional evidence for the stem cell activity of Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, revealing the essential roles of Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in expansion of pancreatic neoplasia in all progressive stages.</content>

 Skin epithelium can accumulate a high burden of oncogenic mutations without morphological or functional consequences. To investigate the mechanism of oncogenic tolerance, we induced Hras&lt;sup&gt;G12V&lt;/sup&gt; in single murine epidermal cells and followed them long-term. We observed that Hras&lt;sup&gt;G12V&lt;/sup&gt; promotes an early and transient clonal expansion driven by increased progenitor renewal that is replaced with an increase in progenitor differentiation leading to reduced growth. We attribute this dynamic effect to emergence of two populations within oncogenic clones: renewing progenitors along the edge and differentiating ones within the central core. As clone expansion is accompanied by progressive enlargement of the core and diminishment of the edge compartment, the intra-clonal competition between the two populations results in stabilized oncogenic growth. To identify the molecular mechanism of Hras&lt;sup&gt;G12V&lt;/sup&gt;-driven differentiation, we screened known Ras-effector &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and identified Rassf5 as a novel regulator of progenitor fate choice that is necessary and sufficient for oncogene-specific differentiation.</content>

		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425327v1?rss=1"/>

		<updated>2021-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 BackgroundAducanumab is an anti-amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) antibody that achieved reduced amyloid pathology in Alzheimers disease (AD) trials, but it is controversial whether it also improved cognition. It has been claimed that this would require a sufficiently high cumulative dose of the antibody in the brain. Therapeutic ultrasound, in contrast, has only begun to be investigated in human AD clinical trials. We have previously shown that scanning ultrasound in combination with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS), that temporarily and safely opens the blood-brain barrier (BBB), removes amyloid and restores cognition in APP23 mice. It has not been directly tested how the effects of SUS compare to immunotherapy or whether a combination therapy is more effective.

MethodsIn a study comprising four treatment arms, we tested the efficacy of an Aducanumab analogue, Adu, in comparison to SUS, as well as a combination therapy in APP23 mice, using sham as a control (aged 13-22 months). The active place avoidance (APA) test was used to test spatial memory, and histology and ELISA were used to measure amyloid. Brain antibody levels were also determined.

ResultsWe found that both Adu and SUS reduced the total plaque area in the hippocampus to a similar degree, with no additive effect in the combination treatment (SUS+Adu). Whereas there was only a trend towards a reduction for both Adu and SUS in the cortex, the combination trial yielded a statistically significant reduction compared to sham. Only the SUS and SUS+Adu groups included animals that had their plaque load reduced to below 1% from above 10%. There was a robust improvement in spatial memory for SUS+Adu only. In this group, when measured three days post-treatment, Adu levels were still 5-fold increased in the combination therapy compared to delivery of Adu on its own.

Together, these findings suggest that SUS should be seriously considered as a treatment option for AD. Alternatively, a combination trial using Aducanumab together with ultrasound to increase brain levels of Aducanumab may be warranted, as the two approaches may engage different (albeit shared) clearance mechanisms.</content>

		<link href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425303v1?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 Specific classes of GABAergic neurons are thought to play specific roles in regulating information processing in the brain. In the hippocampus, two major classes - parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) and somatostatin-expressing (SST+) neurons - differentially regulate endogenous firing patterns and target different subcellular compartments of principal cells, but how these classes regulate the flow of information throughout the hippocampus is poorly understood. We hypothesized that PV+ and SST+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 might differentially modulate CA3 patterns of output, thereby altering the influence of CA3 on CA1. We found that while suppressing either interneuron type increased DG and CA3 output, the effects on CA1 were very different. Suppressing PV+ interneurons increased local field potential signatures of coupling from CA3 to CA1 and decreased signatures of coupling from entorhinal cortex to CA1; suppressing SST+ interneurons had the opposite effect. Thus, DG and CA3 PV+ and SST+ interneurons bidirectionally modulate the flow of information through the hippocampal circuit.</content>

 Associating a novel situation with a specific outcome involves a cascade of cognitive processes, including selecting relevant stimuli, forming predictions regarding expected outcomes, and updating memorized predictions based on experience. The present manuscript uses computational modeling and machine learning to test the hypothesis that alpha-band (8-12 Hz) neural oscillations are involved in the updating of expectations based on experience. Participants learned that a visual cue predicted an aversive loud noise with a probability of 50 percent. The Rescorla-Wagner model of associative learning explained trial-wise changes in self-reported noise expectancy as well as alpha power changes. Both experience in the past trial and self-reported expectancy for the subsequent trial were accurately decoded based on the topographical distribution of alpha power. Decodable information during initial association formation and contingency report recurred when viewing the conditioned cue. Findings support the idea that alpha oscillations have multiple, simultaneous, and unique roles in association formation.</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare inherited prion disease characterized by sleep, autonomic and motor disturbances. Neuro‐ophthalmological abnormalities have been reported at the onset of disease, though not further characterized. We analyzed video recordings of eye movements of six FFI patients from three unrelated kindreds, seen within six months from the onset of illness. Excessive saccadic intrusions was the most prominent finding. In patients with severe insomnia, striking saccadic intrusions are an early diagnostic clue for FFI. The fact that the thalamus is the first structure affected in FFI also suggests its role in the control of steady fixation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of &lt;i&gt;Survival of Motor Neuron&lt;/i&gt; gene (&lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt;) in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unclear, with several conflicting reports. A decisive result on this topic is needed, given that treatment options are available now for &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this largest multicentre case control study to evaluate the effect of &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy numbers in ALS, we used whole genome sequencing data from Project MinE data freeze 2. &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; copy numbers of 6375 ALS patients and 2412 controls were called from whole genome sequencing data, and the reliability of the calls was tested with multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy number distribution of &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; between cases and controls did not show any statistical differences (binomial multivariate logistic regression &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; p=0.54; &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; p=0.49). In addition, the copy number of &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; did not associate with patient survival (Royston‐Parmar; &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; p=0.78; &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; p=0.23) or age at onset (Royston‐Parmar; &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; p=0.75; &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; p=0.63).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our well‐powered study there was no association of SMN1 or SMN2 copy numbers with the risk of ALS or ALS disease severity. This suggests that changing SMN protein levels in the physiological range may not modify ALS disease course. This is an important finding in the light of emerging therapies targeted at SMN deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;A novel telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic morphogenetic domain coexpressing Foxg1 and Otp produces most of the glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/eee1a997-56b9-4f36-b252-3f7d7bc9b790/cne25103-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows that most glutamatergic neurons of the mouse medial extended amygdala originate in a novel telencephalo‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of these neurons in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deficits in social cognition and behavior are a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders. The medial extended amygdala, including the medial amygdala and the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, is a key component of functional networks involved in sociality. However, this nuclear complex is highly heterogeneous and contains numerous GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron subpopulations. Deciphering the connections of different neurons is essential in order to understand how this structure regulates different aspects of sociality, and it is necessary to evaluate their differential implication in distinct mental disorders. Developmental studies in different vertebrates are offering new venues to understand neuronal diversity of the medial extended amygdala, and are helping to establish a relation between the embryonic origin and molecular signature of distinct neurons with the functional subcircuits in which they are engaged. These studies have provided many details on the distinct GABAergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala, but information on the glutamatergic neurons is still scarce. Using an Otp‐eGFP transgenic mouse and multiple fluorescent labeling, we show that most glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala originate in a distinct telencephalo‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), located at the transition between telencephalon and hypothalamus, which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 but not Nkx2.1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons of the medial amygdala, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of this neuron subtype in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Location and arrangement of campaniform sensilla in Drosophila melanogaster&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/62305b4c-43c6-484a-a354-c765938336be/cne24987-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaniform sensilla are a sensory system in insects that detect deformations of the exoskeleton. The comparison of front, middle, and hindleg sensilla reveals robust locations with a small amount of interindividual variability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems provide input to motor networks on the state of the body and environment. One such sensory system in insects is the campaniform sensilla (CS), which detect deformations of the exoskeleton arising from resisted movements or external perturbations. When physical strain is applied to the cuticle, CS external structures are compressed, leading to transduction in an internal sensory neuron. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, the distribution of CS on the exoskeleton has not been comprehensively described. To investigate CS number, location, spatial arrangement, and potential differences between individuals, we compared the front, middle, and hind legs of multiple flies using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we imaged the entire body surface to confirm known CS locations. On the legs, the number and relative arrangement of CS varied between individuals, and single CS of corresponding segments showed characteristic differences between legs. This knowledge is fundamental for studying the relevance of cuticular strain information within the complex neuromuscular networks controlling posture and movement. This comprehensive account of all &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; CS helps set the stage for experimental investigations into their responsivity, sensitivity, and roles in sensory acquisition and motor control in a light‐weight model organism.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution and overlap of entorhinal, premotor, and amygdalar connections in the monkey anterior cingulate cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/35da6c1e-84a7-40b4-ad93-039b676bf174/cne24986-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional tracer injections in macaque monkey entorhinal cortex (EC), amygdala (AMY), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMC) reveal distinct distributions across the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We show that EC and PMC connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) ACC, while AMY connections are evenly distributed. These distinct ACC networks are likely important for temporal integration and affective, contextual, and motor processing in flexible goal‐directed behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for decision‐making as it integrates motor plans with affective and contextual limbic information. Disruptions in these networks have been observed in depression, bipolar disorder, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. Yet, overlap of limbic and motor connections within subdivisions of the ACC is not well understood. Hence, we administered a combination of retrograde and anterograde tracers into structures important for contextual memories (entorhinal cortex), affective processing (amygdala), and motor planning (dorsal premotor cortex) to assess overlap of labeled projection neurons from (outputs) and axon terminals to (inputs) the ACC of adult rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;). Our data show that entorhinal and dorsal premotor cortical (dPMC) connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) subregions of the ACC, while amygdalar connections are more evenly distributed across subregions. Among all areas, the rostral ACC (A32) had the lowest relative density of connections with all three regions. In the ventral ACC, entorhinal and amygdalar connections strongly overlap across all layers, especially in A25. In the dorsal ACC, outputs to dPMC and the amygdala strongly overlap in deep layers. However, dPMC input to the dorsal ACC was densest in deep layers, while amygdalar inputs predominantly localized in upper layers. These connection patterns are consistent with diverse roles of the dorsal ACC in motor evaluation and the ventral ACC in affective and contextual memory. Further, distinct laminar circuits suggest unique interactions within specific ACC compartments that are likely important for the temporal integration of motor and limbic information during flexible goal‐directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Mapping of the excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory afferent projections to the anatomically defined active expiratory oscillator in adult male rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b21f262f-0dde-44da-870c-615d508a8032/cne24984-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified the afferent projections to the brainstem expiratory oscillator located in the lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). We combined retrograde viruses with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of neurons. pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs that contribute to the modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; which encompasses the parafacial respiratory group, pFRG) is a conditional oscillator that drives active expiration during periods of high respiratory demand, and increases ventilation through the recruitment of expiratory muscles. The pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; activity is highly modulated, and systematic analysis of its afferent projections is required to understand its connectivity and modulatory control. We combined a viral retrograde tracing approach to map direct brainstem projections to the putative location of pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of the projecting neurons. Within the medulla, retrogradely‐labeled, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic neurons were found in the ventral respiratory column (Bötzinger and preBötzinger Complex [preBötC], ventral respiratory group, ventral parafacial region [pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;] and pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), reticular formation (RF), pontine and midbrain vestibular nuclei, and medullary raphe. In the pons and midbrain, retrogradely‐labeled neurons of the same phenotypes were found in the Kölliker‐Fuse and parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal gray, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). We also identified somatostatin‐expressing neurons in the preBötC and PHOX2B immunopositive cells in the pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, NTS, and part of the RF. Surprisingly, we found no catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS, A5 or &lt;i&gt;Locus Coeruleus&lt;/i&gt;, no serotoninergic raphe neurons nor any cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT that projected to the pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results indicate that pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several respiratory and nonrespiratory related brainstem regions that could contribute to the complex modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator for active expiration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: VI. Organization of projections from the hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a8f761f2-bc08-40a6-a0f1-46eb3c45c154/cne24983-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized. Projections from the presubiculum preferentially distribute to the caudal half of the entorhinal cortex and thus provides a potential indicator for a primate homologue of the medial entorhinal cortex as defined in rodents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in Layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of Layers III and II. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in Layer III with sparser termination in Layers I, II, and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in Layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: (a) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in nonprimate species; (b) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Distribution of polysialic acid (polySia) immunoreactivity in the adult rat brainstem (a) and thoracolumbar spinal cord (b–e). Discrete neural regions express the glycan, including the nucleus of solitary tract, Sp5C, A1 region (a) and dorsal horn and lateral horn (b) where choline acetyltransferase positive sympathetic preganglionic neurons are often coated with polySia (c–e).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a posttranslational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labeling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labeling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, rostral ventral medulla, A1, and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn [DH]). Ultrastructural examination showed labeling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes. Labeling throughout the brainstem and spinal cord were very similar for the two antibodies and was eliminated by the polySia‐specific sialidase, Endo‐NF. Similar patterns of distribution were found in rat and mouse brainstem with differences evident in DH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Modeling human‐specific interlaminar astrocytes in the mouse cerebral cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d94a590-6892-441f-9a10-131a53eaaa50/cne24979-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We engrafted RFP‐expressing astrocytes differentiated from hiPSCs into the cortex of immunodeficient mice neonatally. Nine months post engraftment, the human astrocytes in the superficial cortex developed into interlaminar astrocytes that mimicked the interlaminar astrocytes architecture of the adult human cortex. This chimeric mouse model will enable the study of human‐specific interlaminar astrocytes in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes, a highly heterogeneous population of glial cells, serve as essential regulators of brain development and homeostasis. The heterogeneity of astrocyte populations underlies the diversity in their functions. In addition to the typical mammalian astrocyte architecture, the cerebral cortex of humans exhibits a radial distribution of interlaminar astrocytes in the supragranular layers. These primate‐specific interlaminar astrocytes are located in the superficial layer and project long processes traversing multiple layers of the cerebral cortex. However, due to the lack of accessible experimental models, their functional properties and their role in regulating neuronal circuits remain unclear. Here we modeled human interlaminar astrocytes in humanized glial chimeric mice by engrafting astrocytes differentiated from human‐induced pluripotent stem cells into the mouse cortex. This model provides a novel platform for understanding neuron‐glial interaction and its alterations in neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Rat striatal regions express nuclear estrogen receptor α and GPER‐1 early in development, while aromatase expression increases with age. (a–f) Caudate–putamen micrographs depicting ERα positive cells or lack thereof females P3 (a), P20 (b), and adult (c); males P3 (d), P20 (e), and adult (f). Examples of ERα positive cells are marked by small white arrows.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex steroid hormones such as 17β‐estradiol (estradiol) regulate neuronal function by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs), including ERα and GPER1, and through differential production via the enzyme aromatase. ERs and aromatase are expressed across the nervous system, including in the striatal brain regions. These regions, comprising the nucleus accumbens core, shell, and caudate–putamen, are instrumental for a wide‐range of functions and disorders that show sex differences in phenotype and/or incidence. Sex‐specific estrogen action is an integral component for generating these sex differences. A distinctive feature of the striatal regions is that in adulthood neurons exclusively express membrane but not nuclear ERs. This long‐standing finding dominates models of estrogen action in striatal regions. However, the developmental etiology of ER and aromatase cellular expression in female and male striatum is unknown. This omission in knowledge is important to address, as developmental stage influences cellular estrogenic mechanisms. Thus, ERα, GPER1, and aromatase cellular immunoreactivity was assessed in perinatal, prepubertal, and adult female and male rats. We tested the hypothesis that ERα, GPER1, and aromatase exhibits sex, region, and age‐specific differences, including nuclear expression. ERα exhibits nuclear expression in all three striatal regions before adulthood and disappears in a region‐ and sex‐specific time‐course. Cellular GPER1 expression decreases during development in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course, resulting in extranuclear expression by adulthood. Somatic aromatase expression presents at prepuberty and increases by adulthood in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course. These data indicate that developmental period exerts critical sex‐specific influences on striatal cellular estrogenic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Light sheet microscopy of the gerbil cochlea&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/04c97804-9e20-4bf7-9cce-0c113bd8df54/cne24977-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light sheet microcopy is used to map frequency along the basilar membrane within intact cochleae, retaining spatial orientation and relationships with internal and external structural landmarks. Three‐dimensional measures of how frequency domains relate to one another gives insight into how the geometric organization of the cochlea may influence its physiology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) provides a rapid and complete three‐dimensional image of the cochlea. The method retains anatomical relationships—on a micrometer scale—between internal structures such as hair cells, basilar membrane (BM), and modiolus with external surface structures such as the round and oval windows. Immunolabeled hair cells were used to visualize the spiraling BM in the intact cochlea without time intensive dissections or additional histological processing; yet material prepared for LSFM could be rehydrated, the BM dissected out and reimaged at higher resolution with the confocal microscope. In immersion‐fixed material, details of the cochlear vasculature were seen throughout the cochlea. Hair cell counts (both inner and outer) as well as frequency maps of the BM were comparable to those obtained by other methods, but with the added dimension of depth. The material provided measures of angular, linear, and vector distance between characteristic frequency regions along the BM. Thus, LSFM provides a unique ability to rapidly image the entire cochlea in a manner applicable to model and interpret physiological results. Furthermore, the three‐dimensional organization of the cochlea can be studied at the organ and cellular level with LSFM, and this same material can be taken to the confocal microscope for detailed analysis at the subcellular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Basic quantitative morphological methods applied to the central nervous system&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3d61166f-5118-457e-87f0-de4ebaba0bd3/cne24976-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design‐based stereological methods allow the estimation of basic morphological parameters in representative samples of the sectioned central nervous system. Point probes can be used to estimate volume (illustrated for the Area Fraction Fractionator), line probes can be used to estimate surface area (illustrated for a vertical sections design), area probes can be used to estimate length (illustrated for the Spaceball probe), and volume probes must be used to estimate number (illustrated for the Disector). This review provides an introduction to how these methods solve problems associated with other quantitative approaches, how they are applied to histological material, how a sampling scheme can be designed and evaluated, and which practical problems need to be solved to generate the numbers that we will need to come to an understanding of central nervous system function.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating numbers has become an almost inevitable task associated with studies of the morphology of the nervous system. Numbers serve a desire for clarity and objectivity in the presentation of results and are a prerequisite for the statistical evaluation of experimental outcomes. Clarity, objectivity, and statistics make demands on the quality of the numbers that are not met by many methods. This review provides a refresher of problems associated with generating numbers that describe the nervous system in terms of the volumes, surfaces, lengths, and numbers of its components. An important aim is to provide comprehensible descriptions of the methods that address these problems. Collectively known as design‐based stereology, these methods share two features critical to their application. First, they are firmly based in mathematics and its proofs. Second and critically underemphasized, an understanding of their mathematical background is not necessary for their informed and productive application. Understanding and applying estimators of volume, surface, length or number does not require more of an organizational mastermind than an immunohistochemical protocol. And when it comes to calculations, square roots are the gravest challenges to overcome. Sampling strategies that are combined with stereological probes are efficient and allow a rational assessment if the numbers that have been generated are “good enough.” Much may be unfamiliar, but very little is difficult. These methods can no longer be scapegoats for discrepant results but faithfully produce numbers on the material that is assessed. They also faithfully reflect problems that associated with the histological material and the anatomically informed decisions needed to generate numbers that are not only valid in theory. It is within reach to generate practically useful numbers that must integrate with qualitative knowledge to understand the function of neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Efferent projections of Vglut2, Foxp2, and Pdyn parabrachial neurons in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f50ff309-a0bd-40e7-8da2-46842a732335/cne24975-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parabrachial nucleus surrounds the superior cerebellar peduncle at the midbrain‐hindbrain junction. Its glutamatergic neurons form subpopulations with distinct genetic identities, two of which express &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we detail the location of &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt;‐ and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing neurons within the larger &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing population. We then use Cre‐conditional expression of synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of each population. Salient findings include the identification of glutamatergic output from the parabrachial nucleus to the rostral entorhinal cortex and lateral superior colliculus, plus an absence of &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; output to the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, and amygdala.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is a complex structure located at the junction of the midbrain and hindbrain. Its neurons have diverse genetic profiles and influence a variety of homeostatic functions. While its cytoarchitecture and overall efferent projections are known, we lack comprehensive information on the projection patterns of specific neuronal subtypes in the PB. In this study, we compared the projection patterns of glutamatergic neurons here with a subpopulation expressing the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and a further subpopulation expressing the neuropeptide &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;. To do this, we injected an AAV into the PB region to deliver a Cre‐dependent anterograde tracer (synaptophysin‐mCherry) in three different strains of Cre‐driver mice. We then analyzed 147 neuroanatomical regions for labeled boutons in every brain (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11). Overall, glutamatergic neurons in the PB region project to a wide variety of sites in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, diencephalon, and brainstem. &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; subpopulations project heavily to the hypothalamus, but not to the cortex, basal forebrain, or amygdala. Among the few differences between &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; cases was a notable lack of &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; projections to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Our results indicate that genetic identity determines connectivity (and therefore, function), providing a framework for mapping all PB output projections based on the genetic identity of its neurons. Using genetic markers to systematically classify PB neurons and their efferent projections will enhance the translation of research findings from experimental animals to humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Better modulation for risk decision‐making after optimized magnetic stimulation&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/729b88f4-c3b2-4f80-adbb-f2a6688bb5a4/jnr24772-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iTBS has a stronger decision promoting effect than 20 Hz, which can be used as an effective way to alter choice and presents an improvement on standard rTMS protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can only produce a significant but weak effect on the cortex while theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned accelerated form of stimulation, can produce a stronger poststimulation effect, which may improve decision‐making abilities. We designed a comparative assessment of the effect of intermittent TBS (iTBS), 20 Hz, in two risk decision‐making tasks on healthy controls. Participants were randomized and assigned to the iTBS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29), 20 Hz (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29), or sham (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29) groups. The effects of the different methods of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation on risk decision‐making functions were compared based on subjects’ performance in the Game of Dice Task (GDT) and Risky Gains Task (RGT). The main indicators were positive and negative feedback utilization rates of GDT and RGT. Both iTBS and 20 Hz stimulation resulted in significant improvements upon negative feedback in the GDT, with increases in safe options and reductions in risky options; iTBS stimulation increased subjects’ use of positive feedback in the GDT and RGT (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the iTBS group had a stronger feedback risk reduction effect than the 20 Hz or sham group following RGT negative feedback (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Individuals would integrate positive and negative information more efficiently, leading to them making rational choices after excitatory transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, iTBS has a stronger risk reduction effect following negative feedback than the 20Hz stimulation did. In summary, iTBS might have clinical value in decision promotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In order to understand the complex cognitive functions of the human brain, it
is essential to study the structural connectome, i.e., the wiring of different
brain regions to each other through axonal pathways. However, the high degree
of plasticity and cross-population variability in human brains makes it
difficult to relate structure to function, motivating a search for invariant
patterns in the connectivity. At the same time, variability within a population
can provide information about generative mechanisms. In this paper we analyze
the connection topology and link-weight distribution of human structural
connectomes obtained from a database comprising 196 subjects. By demonstrating
a correspondence between the occurrence frequency of individual links and their
average weight across the population, we show that the process by which the
brain is wired is not independent of the process by which the link weights of
the connectome are determined. Furthermore, using the specific distribution of
the weights associated with each link over the entire population, we show that
a single parameter that is specific to a link can account for its frequency of
occurrence, as well as, the variation in its weight across different subjects.
This parameter provides a basis for ``rescaling'' the link weights in each
connectome, allowing us to obtain a generic network representative of the human
brain, distinct from a simple average over the connectomes. We obtain
functional connectomes by implementing a neural mass model on each of the
vertices of the corresponding structural connectomes. By comparing with the
empirical functional brain networks, we demonstrate that the rescaling
procedure yields a closer structure-function correspondence. Finally, we show
that the representative network can be decomposed into a basal component that
is stable across the population and a highly variable superstructure.

 &lt;p&gt;We develop an analytic model of the mammalian cochlea. We use a mixed
physical-phenomenological approach by utilizing existing work on the physics of
classical box-representations of the cochlea, and behavior of recent
data-derived wavenumber estimates. Spatial variation is incorporated through a
single independent variable that combines space and frequency. We arrive at
closed-form expressions for the organ of Corti velocity, its impedance, the
pressure difference across the organ of Corti, and its wavenumber. We perform
model tests using real and imaginary parts of chinchilla data from multiple
locations and for multiple variables. The model also predicts impedances that
are qualitatively consistent with current literature. For implementation, the
model can leverage existing efforts for both filter bank and filter cascade
models that target improved algorithmic or analog circuit efficiencies. The
simplicity of the cochlear model, its small number of model constants, its
ability to capture the variation of tuning, its closed-form expressions for
physically-interrelated variables, and the form of these expressions that
allows for easily determining one variable from another make the model
appropriate for analytic and digital auditory filter implementations as
discussed here, as well as for extracting macromechanical insights regarding
how the cochlea works.

 &lt;p&gt;A freely walking fly visits roughly 100 stereotyped states in a strongly
non-Markovian sequence. To explore these dynamics, we develop a generalization
of the information bottleneck method, compressing the large number of
behavioral states into a more compact description that maximally preserves the
correlations between successive states. Surprisingly, preserving these short
time correlations with a compression into just two states captures the long
ranged correlations seen in the raw data. Having reduced the behavior to a
binary sequence, we describe the distribution of these sequences by an Ising
model with pairwise interactions, which is the maximum entropy model that
matches the two-point correlations. Matching the correlation function at longer
and longer times drives the resulting model toward the Ising model with inverse
square interactions and near zero magnetic field. The emergence of this
statistical physics problem from the analysis real data on animal behavior is
unexpected.

 &lt;p&gt;With large quantities of data typically available nowadays, forecasting
models that are trained across sets of time series, known as Global Forecasting
Models (GFM), are regularly outperforming traditional univariate forecasting
models that work on isolated series. As GFMs usually share the same set of
parameters across all time series, they often have the problem of not being
localised enough to a particular series, especially in situations where
datasets are heterogeneous. We study how ensembling techniques can be used with
generic GFMs and univariate models to solve this issue. Our work systematises
and compares relevant current approaches, namely clustering series and training
separate submodels per cluster, the so-called ensemble of specialists approach,
and building heterogeneous ensembles of global and local models. We fill some
gaps in the approaches and generalise them to different underlying GFM model
types. We then propose a new methodology of clustered ensembles where we train
multiple GFMs on different clusters of series, obtained by changing the number
of clusters and cluster seeds. Using Feed-forward Neural Networks, Recurrent
Neural Networks, and Pooled Regression models as the underlying GFMs, in our
evaluation on six publicly available datasets, the proposed models are able to
achieve significantly higher accuracy than baseline GFM models and univariate
forecasting methods.

 &lt;p&gt;Many concepts have been proposed for meta learning with neural networks
(NNs), e.g., NNs that learn to control fast weights, hyper networks, learned
learning rules, and meta recurrent neural networks (Meta RNNs). Our Variable
Shared Meta Learning (VS-ML) unifies the above and demonstrates that simple
weight-sharing and sparsity in an NN is sufficient to express powerful learning
algorithms. A simple implementation of VS-ML called Variable Shared Meta RNN
allows for implementing the backpropagation learning algorithm solely by
running an RNN in forward-mode. It can even meta-learn new learning algorithms
that improve upon backpropagation, generalizing to different datasets without
explicit gradient calculation.

 &lt;p&gt;A key aspect of human intelligence is the ability to infer abstract rules
directly from high-dimensional sensory data, and to do so given only a limited
amount of training experience. Deep neural network algorithms have proven to be
a powerful tool for learning directly from high-dimensional data, but currently
lack this capacity for data-efficient induction of abstract rules, leading some
to argue that symbol-processing mechanisms will be necessary to account for
this capacity. In this work, we take a step toward bridging this gap by
introducing the Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN), a recurrent network
augmented with an external memory that enables a form of variable-binding and
indirection. This binding mechanism allows symbol-like representations to
emerge through the learning process without the need to explicitly incorporate
symbol-processing machinery, enabling the ESBN to learn rules in a manner that
is abstracted away from the particular entities to which those rules apply.
Across a series of tasks, we show that this architecture displays nearly
perfect generalization of learned rules to novel entities given only a limited
number of training examples, and outperforms a number of other competitive
neural network architectures.

 &lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is often attributed to episodic memory formation and storage
in the mammalian brain; in particular, Alme et al. showed that hippocampal area
CA3 forms statistically independent representations across a large number of
environments, even if the environments share highly similar features. This lack
of overlap between spatial maps indicates the large capacity of the CA3
circuitry. In this paper, we support the argument for the large capacity of the
CA3 network. To do so, we replicate the key findings of Alme et al. and extend
the results by perturbing the neural activity encodings with noise and
conducting representation similarity analysis (RSA). We find that the
correlations between firing rates are partially resistant to noise, and that
the spatial representations across cells show similar patterns, even across
different environments. Finally, we discuss some theoretical and practical
implications of our results.

 &lt;p&gt;Artificial spiking neural networks have found applications in areas where the
temporal nature of activation offers an advantage, such as time series
prediction and signal processing. To improve their efficiency, spiking
architectures often run on custom-designed neuromorphic hardware, but, despite
their attractive properties, these implementations have been limited to digital
systems. We describe an artificial quantum spiking neuron that relies on the
dynamical evolution of two easy to implement Hamiltonians and subsequent local
measurements. The architecture allows exploiting complex amplitudes and
back-action from measurements to influence the input. This approach to learning
protocols is advantageous in the case where the input and output of the system
are both quantum states. We demonstrate this through the classification of Bell
pairs which can be seen as a certification protocol. Stacking the introduced
elementary building blocks into larger networks combines the spatiotemporal
features of a spiking neural network with the non-local quantum correlations
across the graph.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study used childhood cancer survivors as a novel model to study whether children who experience central nervous system (CNS) injury are at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment associated with subsequent late onset chronic health conditions (CHCs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult survivors of childhood cancer (n = 2,859, ≥10 years from diagnosis, ≥18 years old) completed a comprehensive neurocognitive battery and clinical examination. Neurocognitive impairment was defined as age‐adjusted &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; score &amp;lt; 10th percentile. Participants impaired on ≥3 tests had global impairment. CHCs were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.3 (grade 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe/disabling; 4, life‐threatening) and were combined into a severity/burden score by frequency and grade (none/low, medium, high, and very high). A total of 1,598 survivors received CNS‐directed therapy including cranial radiation, intrathecal methotrexate, or neurosurgery. Logistic regression estimated the odds of neurocognitive impairment associated with severity/burden score and grade 2 to 4 conditions, stratified by CNS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNS‐treated survivors performed worse than non–CNS‐treated survivors on all neurocognitive tests and were more likely to have global neurocognitive impairment (46.9% vs 35.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). After adjusting for demographic and treatment factors, there was a dose–response association between severity/burden score and global neurocognitive impairment, but only among CNS‐treated survivors (high odds ratio [OR] = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42–3.53; very high OR = 4.07, 95% CI = 2.30–7.17). Cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions were associated with processing speed, executive function, and memory impairments in CNS‐treated but not non–CNS‐treated survivors who were impacted by neurologic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced cognitive/brain reserve associated with CNS‐directed therapy during childhood may make survivors vulnerable to adverse cognitive effects of cardiopulmonary conditions during adulthood. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus poses serious threats to the global public health and leads to worldwide crisis. No effective drug or vaccine is readily available. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising therapeutic target. A hybrid drug screening procedure was proposed and applied to identify potential drug candidates targeting RdRp from 1906 approved drugs. Among the four selected market available drug candidates, Pralatrexate and Azithromycin were confirmed to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.008μM and 9.453 μM, respectively. For the first time, our study discovered that Pralatrexate is able to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication with a stronger inhibitory activity than Remdesivir within the same experimental conditions. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of fast and accurate anti-viral drug screening for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 and provides potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FAnRCMxpaFQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The distribution of scholarly content today happens in the context of an immense deluge of information found on the internet. As a result, researchers face serious challenges when archiving and finding information that relates to their work. Library science principles provide a framework for navigating information ecosystems in order to help researchers improve findability of their professional output. Here, we describe the information ecosystem which consists of users, context, and content, all 3 of which must be addressed to make information findable and usable. We provide a set of tips that can help researchers evaluate who their users are, how to archive their research outputs to encourage findability, and how to leverage structural elements of software to make it easier to find information within and beyond their publications. As scholars evaluate their research communication strategies, they can use these steps to improve how their research is discovered and reused.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ocC72s4QDbc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Chimpanzees (&lt;i&gt;Pan troglodytes&lt;/i&gt;) are, along with bonobos, humans’ closest living relatives. The advent of diffusion MRI tractography in recent years has allowed a resurgence of comparative neuroanatomical studies in humans and other primate species. Here we offer, in comparative perspective, the first chimpanzee white matter atlas, constructed from in vivo chimpanzee diffusion-weighted scans. Comparative white matter atlases provide a useful tool for identifying neuroanatomical differences and similarities between humans and other primate species. Until now, comprehensive fascicular atlases have been created for humans (&lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;), rhesus macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta)&lt;/i&gt;, and several other nonhuman primate species, but never in a nonhuman ape. Information on chimpanzee neuroanatomy is essential for understanding the anatomical specializations of white matter organization that are unique to the human lineage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EVgDQ5MfDv4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Correlative light, electron, and ion microscopy (CLEIM) offers huge potential to track the intracellular fate of antibiotics, with organelle-level resolution. However, a correlative approach that enables subcellular antibiotic visualisation in pathogen-infected tissue is lacking. Here, we developed correlative light, electron, and ion microscopy in tissue (CLEIMiT) and used it to identify the cell type–specific accumulation of an antibiotic in lung lesions of mice infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. Using CLEIMiT, we found that the anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug bedaquiline (BDQ) is localised not only in foamy macrophages in the lungs during infection but also accumulate in polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/C4fV-xZSuXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 The spatiotemporal proteome of the intervertebral disc (IVD) underpins its integrity and function. We present DIPPER, a deep and comprehensive IVD proteomic resource comprising 94 genome-wide profiles from 17 individuals. To begin with, protein modules defining key directional trends spanning the lateral and anteroposterior axes were derived from high-resolution spatial proteomes of intact young cadaveric lumbar IVDs. They revealed novel region-specific profiles of regulatory activities, and displayed potential paths of deconstruction in the level- and location-matched aged cadaveric discs. Machine learning methods predicted a 'hydration matrisome' that connects extracellular matrix with MRI intensity. Importantly, the static proteome used as point-references can be integrated with dynamic proteome (SILAC/degradome) and transcriptome data from multiple clinical samples, enhancing robustness and clinical relevance. The data, findings and methodology, available on a web interface (www.sbms.hku.hk/dclab/DIPPER), will be valuable references in the field of IVD biology and proteomic analytics.</content>

 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the commonest cause of congenital infection (cCMVi) and particularly so among infants born to HIV-infected women. Studies of cCMVi pathogenesis are complicated by the presence of multiple infecting maternal CMV strains, especially in HIV-positive women, and the large, recombinant CMV genome. Using newly developed tools to reconstruct CMV haplotypes, we demonstrate anatomic CMV compartmentalization in five HIV-infected mothers and identify the possibility of congenitally transmitted genotypes in three of their infants. A single CMV strain was transmitted in each congenitally infected case, and all were closely related to those that predominate in the cognate maternal cervix. Compared to non-transmitted strains, these congenitally transmitted CMV strains showed statistically significant similarities in 19 genes associated with tissue-tropism and immunomodulation. In all infants, incident superinfections with distinct strains from breast milk were captured during follow-up. The results represent potentially important new insights into the virologic determinants of early CMV infection.</content>

 The relationship between AD pathology and cognitive decline is an important topic in the aging research field. Recent studies suggest that memory deficits are more susceptible to phosphorylated tau (Ptau), than amyloid-beta. However, little is known regarding the neurocognitive mechanisms linking Ptau and memory related decline. Here, we extracted data from ADNI participants with CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) Ptau collected at baseline, diffusion tensor imaging measure twice, two-year apart, and longitudinal memory data over five years. We defined three age- and education-matched groups: Ptau negative cognitively unimpaired, Ptau positive cognitively unimpaired, and Ptau positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment. We found the presence of CSF Ptau at baseline was related to a loss of structural stability in medial temporal lobe connectivity in a way that matched proposed disease progression, and this loss of stability in connections known to be important for memory moderated the relationship between Ptau accumulation and memory decline.</content>

 Eutherian mammals have characteristic lengths of gestation that are key for reproductive success, but relatively little is known about the processes that determine the timing of parturition, the process of birth, and how they are coordinated with fetal developmental programs. This issue remains one of biology's great unsolved mysteries and has significant clinical relevance because preterm birth is the leading cause of infant and under 5 year old child mortality worldwide. Here, we consider the evolutionary influences and potential signaling mechanisms that maintain or end pregnancy in eutherian mammals and use this knowledge to formulate general theoretical evolutionary models. These models can be tested through evolutionary species comparisons, studies of experimental manipulation of gestation period and birth timing, and human clinical studies. Understanding how gestation time and parturition are determined will shed light on this fundamental biological process and improve human health through the development of therapies to prevent preterm birth.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long‐term potentiation (LTP) is a synaptic plasticity mechanism critical to long‐term memory. LTP induced in vivo is characterized by altered transcriptional activity, including a period of upregulation of gene expression which is followed by a later dominant downregulation. This temporal shift to downregulated gene expression is predicted to be partly mediated by epigenetic inhibitors of gene expression, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Further, pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC activity have previously been shown to enhance LTP persistence in vitro. To explore the contribution of HDACs to the persistence of LTP in vivo, we examined HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity over a 24 hr period following unilateral LTP induction in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats. Surprisingly, we found significant changes in HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity in both the stimulated as well as the unstimulated hemispheres, with the largest increase in activity occurring bilaterally, 20 min after LTP stimulation. During this time point of heightened activity, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that both HDAC1 and HDAC2 were enriched at distinct sets of genes within each hemispheres. Further, the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A enhanced an intermediate phase of LTP lasting days, which has not previously been associated with altered transcription. The inhibitor had no effect on the persistence of LTP lasting weeks. Together, these data suggest that HDAC activity early after the induction of LTP may negatively regulate plasticity‐related gene expression that is involved in the initial stabilization of LTP, but not its long‐term maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Computational methods that predict protein stability changes induced by missense mutations have made a lot of progress over the past decades. Most of the available methods however have very limited accuracy in predicting stabilizing mutations because existing experimental sets are dominated by mutations reducing protein stability. Moreover, few approaches could consistently perform well across different test cases. To address these issues, we developed a new computational method PremPS to more accurately evaluate the effects of missense mutations on protein stability. The PremPS method is composed of only ten evolutionary- and structure-based features and parameterized on a balanced dataset with an equal number of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. A comprehensive comparison of the predictive performance of PremPS with other available methods on nine benchmark datasets confirms that our approach consistently outperforms other methods and shows considerable improvement in estimating the impacts of stabilizing mutations. A protein could have multiple structures available, and if another structure of the same protein is used, the predicted change in stability for structure-based methods might be different. Thus, we further estimated the impact of using different structures on prediction accuracy, and demonstrate that our method performs well across different types of structures except for low-resolution structures and models built based on templates with low sequence identity. PremPS can be used for finding functionally important variants, revealing the molecular mechanisms of functional influences and protein design. PremPS is freely available at https://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPS/, which allows to do large-scale mutational scanning and takes about four minutes to perform calculations for a single mutation per protein with ~ 300 residues and requires ~ 0.4 seconds for each additional mutation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/viIv2OJ1OX8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has multiple applications in molecular biology, including developing new targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels. We present NGS-PrimerPlex, an efficient and versatile command-line application that designs primers for different refined types of amplicon-based genome target enrichment. It supports nested and anchored multiplex PCR, redistribution among multiplex reactions of primers constructed earlier, and extension of existing NGS-panels. The primer design process takes into consideration the formation of secondary structures, non-target amplicons between all primers of a pool, primers and high-frequent genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) overlapping. Moreover, users of NGS-PrimerPlex are free from manually defining input genome regions, because it can be done automatically from a list of genes or their parts like exon or codon numbers. Using the program, the NGS-panel for sequencing the &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; gene coding regions was created, and 354 DNA samples were studied successfully with a median coverage of 97.4% of target regions by at least 30 reads. To show that NGS-PrimerPlex can also be applied for bacterial genomes, we designed primers to detect foodborne pathogens &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7, &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; considering variable positions of the genomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bkjkub_e2Oc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The Golgi cells are the main inhibitory interneurons of the cerebellar granular layer. Although recent works have highlighted the complexity of their dendritic organization and synaptic inputs, the mechanisms through which these neurons integrate complex input patterns remained unknown. Here we have used 8 detailed morphological reconstructions to develop multicompartmental models of Golgi cells, in which Na, Ca, and K channels were distributed along dendrites, soma, axonal initial segment and axon. The models faithfully reproduced a rich pattern of electrophysiological and pharmacological properties and predicted the operating mechanisms of these neurons. Basal dendrites turned out to be more tightly electrically coupled to the axon initial segment than apical dendrites. During synaptic transmission, parallel fibers caused slow Ca-dependent depolarizations in apical dendrites that boosted the axon initial segment encoder and Na-spike backpropagation into basal dendrites, while inhibitory synapses effectively shunted backpropagating currents. This oriented dendritic processing set up a coincidence detector controlling voltage-dependent NMDA receptor unblock in basal dendrites, which, by regulating local calcium influx, may provide the basis for spike-timing dependent plasticity anticipated by theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iSwcVllqU1A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) platform-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has tremendously changed biological researches, while there are still many questions that cannot be addressed by them due to their short read lengths. We developed a novel scRNA-seq technology based on third-generation sequencing (TGS) platform (single-cell amplification and sequencing of full-length RNAs by Nanopore platform, SCAN-seq). SCAN-seq exhibited high sensitivity and accuracy comparable to NGS platform-based scRNA-seq methods. Moreover, we captured thousands of unannotated transcripts of diverse types, with high verification rate by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)–coupled Sanger sequencing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Then, we used SCAN-seq to analyze the mouse preimplantation embryos. We could clearly distinguish cells at different developmental stages, and a total of 27,250 unannotated transcripts from 9,338 genes were identified, with many of which showed developmental stage-specific expression patterns. Finally, we showed that SCAN-seq exhibited high accuracy on determining allele-specific gene expression patterns within an individual cell. SCAN-seq makes a major breakthrough for single-cell transcriptome analysis field.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/V_5xMmYS08U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Clustering of the enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) type III secretion system (T3SS) effector translocated intimin receptor (Tir) by intimin leads to actin polymerisation and pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. The effect of Tir clustering on the viability of EPEC-infected intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is unknown. We show that EPEC induces pyroptosis in IECs in a Tir-dependent but actin polymerisation-independent manner, which was enhanced by priming with interferon gamma (IFNγ). Mechanistically, Tir clustering triggers rapid Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, which induces lipopolysaccharide (LPS) internalisation, followed by activation of caspase-4 and pyroptosis. Knockdown of caspase-4 or gasdermin D (GSDMD), translocation of NleF, which blocks caspase-4 or chelation of extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, inhibited EPEC-induced cell death. IEC lines with low endogenous abundance of GSDMD were resistant to Tir-induced cell death. Conversely, ATP-induced extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx enhanced cell death, which confirmed the key regulatory role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in EPEC-induced pyroptosis. We reveal a novel mechanism through which infection with an extracellular pathogen leads to pyroptosis in IECs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZvVuJydp7VI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of circulating micro RNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively recruited 3 independent cohorts of patients with RCVS and age‐matched and sex‐matched controls in a single medical center. Next‐generation small RNA sequencing followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify and validate differentially expressed miRNAs, which was cross‐validated in migraine patients in ictal stage or interictal stage. Computational analysis was used to predict the target genes of miRNAs, followed by in vitro functional analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a panel of miRNAs including miR‐130a‐3p, miR‐130b‐3p, let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p, and let‐7f‐5p that well differentiated patients with RCVS from controls (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] was 0.906, 0.890, and 0.867 in the 3 cohorts, respectively). The abundance of let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p, and let‐7f‐5p, but not miR‐130a‐3p nor miR‐130b‐3p, was significantly higher in patients with ictal migraine compared with that of controls and patients with interictal migraine. Target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the transforming growth factor‐β signaling pathway and endothelin‐1 responsible for vasomotor control might link these miRNAs to RCVS pathogenesis, which was confirmed in vitro by transfecting miRNAs mimics or incubating the patients’ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 3 different vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, miR‐130a‐3p was associated with imaging‐proven disruption of the blood‐brain barrier (BBB) in patients with RCVS and its overexpression led to reduced transendothelial electrical resistance (ie, increased permeability) in in vitro human BBB model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified the circulating miRNA signatures associated with RCVS, which may be functionally linked to its headache, BBB integrity, and vasomotor function. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Visual opsin expression and morphological characterization of retinal photoreceptors in the pouched lamprey (Geotria australis, Gray)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ef2ff567-6595-4cd4-977b-afa960f6c2a5/cne25092-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multidisciplinary approach was applied to assign the expression of different visual opsin classes to specific photoreceptor subtypes in &lt;i&gt;Geotria australis&lt;/i&gt;. Five discrete photoreceptor subtypes were identified in the retina, each containing one of five classes of visual opsin. This suggests that &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; has the potential for complex color vision.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lampreys are extant members of the agnathan (jawless) vertebrates that diverged ~500 million years ago, during a critical stage of vertebrate evolution when image‐forming eyes first emerged. Among lamprey species assessed thus far, the retina of the southern hemisphere pouched lamprey, &lt;i&gt;Geotria australis&lt;/i&gt;, is unique, in that it possesses morphologically distinct photoreceptors and expresses five visual photopigments. This study focused on determining the number of different photoreceptors present in the retina of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; and whether each cell type expresses a single opsin class. Five photoreceptor subtypes were identified based on ultrastructure and differential expression of one of each of the five different visual opsin classes (&lt;i&gt;lws&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sws1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sws2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;rh1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;rh2&lt;/i&gt;) known to be expressed in the retina. This suggests, therefore, that the retina of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; possesses five spectrally and morphologically distinct photoreceptors, with the potential for complex color vision. Each photoreceptor subtype was shown to have a specific spatial distribution in the retina, which is potentially associated with changes in spectral radiance across different lines of sight. These results suggest that there have been strong selection pressures for &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; to maintain broad spectral sensitivity for the brightly lit surface waters that this species inhabits during its marine phase. These findings provide important insights into the functional anatomy of the early vertebrate retina and the selection pressures that may have led to the evolution of complex color vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Functional, molecular and morphological heterogeneity of superficial interneurons in the larval zebrafish tectum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b44deb2-e868-46a8-b8e4-0fd1421d4068/cne25082-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Superficial Interneurons (SINs) of the zebrafish tectum comprise a diverse population. Here we demonstrate that despite their wide range of reported tuning properties and morphology, most SINs respond to light offset and possess large receptive fields. SINs were previously thought to be solely inhibitory, yet we report that a subset express glutamatergic markers. Finally, these cells are unlikely to be intrinsically photosensitive as removal of retinal input, eliminated nearly all light on and off responses in SINs.  (Image: Eva Laurell)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superficial interneurons, SINs, of the zebrafish tectum, have been implicated in a range of visual functions, including size discrimination, directional selectivity, and looming‐evoked escape. This raises the question if SIN subpopulations, despite their morphological similarities and shared anatomical position in the retinotectal processing stream, carry out diverse, task‐specific functions in visual processing, or if they have simple tuning properties in common. Here we have further characterized the SINs through functional imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and neurotransmitter typing in two transgenic lines, the widely used Gal4s1156t and the recently reported LCRRH2‐RH2‐2:GFP. We found that about a third of the SINs strongly responded to changes in whole‐field light levels, with a strong preference for OFF over ON stimuli. Interestingly, individual SINs were selectively tuned to a diverse range of narrow luminance decrements. Overall responses to whole‐field luminance steps did not vary with the position of the SIN cell body along the depth of the tectal neuropil or with the orientation of its neurites. We ruled out the possibility that intrinsic photosensitivity of Gal4s1156t+ SINs contribute to the measured visual responses. We found that, while most SINs express GABAergic markers, a substantial minority express an excitatory neuronal marker, the vesicular glutamate transporter, expanding the possible roles of SIN function in the tectal circuitry. In conclusion, SINs represent a molecularly, morphologically, and functionally heterogeneous class of interneurons, with subpopulations that detect a range of specific visual features, to which we have now added narrow luminance decrements.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There is emerging evidence for multifarious neurological manifestations of COVID‐19, while little is known whether they reflect structural damage to the nervous system. Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a specific biomarker of neuronal injury. We measured sNfL concentrations of 29 critically ill COVID‐19 patients, 10 critically ill non‐COVID‐19 patients, and 259 healthy controls. After adjusting for neurological comorbidities and age, sNfL were higher in patients with COVID‐19 versus both comparator groups. Higher sNfL levels were associated with unfavorable short‐term outcome indicating that neuronal injury is common and pronounced in critically ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean visual system is a product of selection pressures favoring underwater vision, yet relatively little is known about it across taxa. Previous studies report several mutations in the opsin genetic sequence in cetaceans, suggesting the evolutionary complete or partial loss of retinal cone photoreceptor function in mysticete and odontocete lineages, respectively. Despite this, limited anatomical evidence suggests cone structures are partially maintained but with absent outer and inner segments in the bowhead retina. The functional consequence and anatomical distributions associated with these unique cone morphologies remain unclear. The current study further investigates the morphology and distribution of cone photoreceptors in the bowhead whale and beluga retina and evaluates the potential functional capacity of these cells’ alternative to photoreception. Refined histological and advanced microscopic techniques revealed two additional cone morphologies in the bowhead and beluga retina that have not been previously described. Two proteins involved in magnetosensation were present in these cone structures suggesting the possibility for an alternative functional role in responding to changes in geomagnetic fields. These findings highlight a revised understanding of the unique evolution of cone and gross retinal anatomy in cetaceans, and provide prefatory evidence of potential functional re‐assignment of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if stopping treatment with dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant (NOAC), induces a paradoxical rebound prothrombotic state. We investigated if short‐term (1–3 days) dabigatran cessation is associated with a higher thrombus volume than expected from a simple reversal of the anticoagulant effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten‐week‐old C57Bl/6 mice (n = 338) received one of the following oral treatments: phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), dabigatran for 7 days with or without 1 to 4 day cessation, and aspirin in either a single dose or daily for 7 days. Some of the animals that ceased dabigatran for 1 to 3 days received single‐dose aspirin. Thereafter, we induced FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐mediated carotid thrombosis in 130 mice, after which we performed micro computed tomography thrombus imaging. The other 208 mice underwent coagulation assays or platelet function tests. As an explorative pilot study, we reviewed the medical records of 18 consecutive patients with NOAC cessation‐related cerebral infarction in a large acute stroke cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a ~ 40% higher volume of carotid thrombus after dabigatran cessation at 1 to 3 days than after vehicle treatment and showed that this effect could be prevented by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. Dabigatran cessation unduly increased platelet aggregability for 2 days after drug cessation, an effect mediated through thrombin or arachidonic acid, which effect was significantly attenuated by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. In patients, short‐term (≤ 3 days) cessation of NOAC therapy, compared with longer‐term (≥ 5 days) cessation, tended to be associated with relatively high stroke severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide the first preclinical evidence that a rebound prothrombotic state follows short‐term cessation of dabigatran therapy. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Reasoning about the factors underlying habitat connectivity and the inter-habitat movement of species is essential to many areas of biological inquiry. In order to better describe and understand the ways in which the landscape may support species movement, an increasing amount of research has focused on identification of paths or corridors that may be important in providing connectivity among habitat. The least-cost path problem has proven to be an instrumental analytical tool in this sense. A complicating aspect of such path identification methods is how to best reconcile and integrate the array of criteria or objectives that species may consider in traversal of a landscape. In cases where habitat connectivity is thought to be influenced or guided by multiple objectives, numerous solutions to least-cost path problems can exist, representing tradeoffs between the objectives. In practice though, identification of these solutions can be very challenging and as such, only a small proportion of them are typically examined leading to a weak characterization of habitat connectivity. To address this computational challenge, a multiobjective optimization framework is proposed. A generalizable multiobjective least-cost path model is first detailed. A non-inferior set estimation (MONISE) algorithm for identifying supported efficient solutions to the multiobjective least-cost path model is then described. However, it is well known that unsupported efficient solutions (which are equally important) can also exist, but are typically ignored given that they are more difficult to identify. Thus, to enable the identification of the full set of efficient solutions (supported and unsupported) to the multiobjective model, a multi-criteria labeling algorithm is then proposed. The developed framework is applied to assess different conceptualizations of habitat connectivity supporting amphibian movement in a wetland system. The results highlight the range of tradeoffs in characterizations of connectivity that can exist when multiple objectives are thought to contribute to movement decisions and that the number of unsupported efficient solutions (which are typically ignored) can vastly outweigh that of the supported efficient solutions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei-KBrK73DI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Combinatorial therapies are required to treat patients with advanced cancers that have become resistant to monotherapies through rewiring of redundant pathways. Due to a massive number of potential drug combinations, there is a need for systematic approaches to identify safe and effective combinations for each patient, using cost-effective methods. Here, we developed an exact multiobjective optimization method for identifying pairwise or higher-order combinations that show maximal cancer-selectivity. The prioritization of patient-specific combinations is based on Pareto-optimization in the search space spanned by the therapeutic and nonselective effects of combinations. We demonstrate the performance of the method in the context of BRAF-V600E melanoma treatment, where the optimal solutions predicted a number of co-inhibition partners for vemurafenib, a selective BRAF-V600E inhibitor, approved for advanced melanoma. We experimentally validated many of the predictions in BRAF-V600E melanoma cell line, and the results suggest that one can improve selective inhibition of BRAF-V600E melanoma cells by combinatorial targeting of MAPK/ERK and other compensatory pathways using pairwise and third-order drug combinations. Our mechanism-agnostic optimization method is widely applicable to various cancer types, and it takes as input only measurements of a subset of pairwise drug combinations, without requiring target information or genomic profiles. Such data-driven approaches may become useful for functional precision oncology applications that go beyond the cancer genetic dependency paradigm to optimize cancer-selective combinatorial treatments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQFi8d3CAl4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Characterizing the relation between weight structure and input/output statistics is fundamental for understanding the computational capabilities of neural circuits. In this work, I study the problem of storing associations between analog signals in the presence of correlations, using methods from statistical mechanics. I characterize the typical learning performance in terms of the power spectrum of random input and output processes. I show that optimal synaptic weight configurations reach a capacity of 0.5 for any fraction of excitatory to inhibitory weights and have a peculiar synaptic distribution with a finite fraction of silent synapses. I further provide a link between typical learning performance and principal components analysis in single cases. These results may shed light on the synaptic profile of brain circuits, such as cerebellar structures, that are thought to engage in processing time-dependent signals and performing on-line prediction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k5UZKwtwElo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Information transfer, measured by transfer entropy, is a key component of distributed computation. It is therefore important to understand the pattern of information transfer in order to unravel the distributed computational algorithms of a system. Since in many natural systems distributed computation is thought to rely on rhythmic processes a frequency resolved measure of information transfer is highly desirable. Here, we present a novel algorithm, and its efficient implementation, to identify separately frequencies sending and receiving information in a network. Our approach relies on the invertible maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) for the creation of surrogate data in the computation of transfer entropy and entirely avoids filtering of the original signals. The approach thereby avoids well-known problems due to phase shifts or the ineffectiveness of filtering in the information theoretic setting. We also show that measuring frequency-resolved information transfer is a partial information decomposition problem that cannot be fully resolved to date and discuss the implications of this issue. Last, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on simulated data and apply it to human magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and to local field potential recordings in the ferret. In human MEG we demonstrate top-down information flow in temporal cortex from very high frequencies (above 100Hz) to both similarly high frequencies and to frequencies around 20Hz, i.e. a complex spectral configuration of cortical information transmission that has not been described before. In the ferret we show that the prefrontal cortex sends information at low frequencies (4-8 Hz) to early visual cortex (V1), while V1 receives the information at high frequencies (&amp;gt; 125 Hz).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yvPcW6Al6VQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;) infection causes tuberculosis (TB), a disease characterized by development of granulomas. Granulomas consist of activated immune cells that cluster together to limit bacterial growth and restrict dissemination. Control of the TB epidemic has been limited by lengthy drug regimens, antibiotic resistance, and lack of a robustly efficacious vaccine. Fibrosis commonly occurs during treatment and is associated with both positive and negative disease outcomes in TB but little is known about the processes that initiate fibrosis in granulomas. Human and nonhuman primate granulomas undergoing fibrosis can have spindle-shaped macrophages with fibroblast-like morphologies suggesting a relationship between macrophages, fibroblasts, and granuloma fibrosis. This relationship has been difficult to investigate because of the limited availability of human pathology samples, the time scale involved in human TB, and overlap between fibroblast and myeloid cell markers in tissues. To better understand the origins of fibrosis in TB, we used a computational model of TB granuloma biology to identify factors that drive fibrosis over the course of local disease progression. We validated the model with granulomas from nonhuman primates to delineate myeloid cells and lung-resident fibroblasts. Our results suggest that peripheral granuloma fibrosis, which is commonly observed, can arise through macrophage-to-myofibroblast transformation (MMT). Further, we hypothesize that MMT is induced in M1 macrophages through a sequential combination of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling in granuloma macrophages. We predict that MMT may be a mechanism underlying granuloma-associated fibrosis and warrants further investigation into myeloid cells as drivers of fibrotic disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i4DJnTeQ8vU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Musculoskeletal simulations are used in many different applications, ranging from the design of wearable robots that interact with humans to the analysis of patients with impaired movement. Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves—which typically requires extensive technical expertise—and allows them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle a wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which enable modeling of kinematic loops (e.g., cycling models) and complex anatomy (e.g., patellar motion). To show the abilities of Moco, we first solved for muscle activity that produced an observed walking motion while minimizing squared muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Next, we predicted how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a normal walking motion. Lastly, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of an assistive device placed at the knee. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand the movement of humans and other animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MfhXqWduoys&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Protein turnover is vital to cellular homeostasis. Many proteins are degraded efficiently only after they have been post-translationally “tagged” with a polyubiquitin chain. Ubiquitylation is a form of Post-Translational Modification (PTM): addition of a ubiquitin to the chain is catalyzed by E3 ligases, and removal of ubiquitin is catalyzed by a De-UBiquitylating enzyme (DUB). Nearly four decades ago, Goldbeter and Koshland discovered that reversible PTM cycles function like on-off switches when the substrates are at saturating concentrations. Although this finding has had profound implications for the understanding of switch-like behavior in biochemical networks, the general behavior of PTM cycles subject to synthesis and degradation has not been studied. Using a mathematical modeling approach, we found that simply introducing protein turnover to a standard modification cycle has profound effects, including significantly reducing the switch-like nature of the response. Our findings suggest that many classic results on PTM cycles may not hold &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; where protein turnover is ubiquitous. We also found that proteins sharing an E3 ligase can have closely related changes in their expression levels. These results imply that it may be difficult to interpret experimental results obtained from either overexpressing or knocking down protein levels, since changes in protein expression can be coupled via E3 ligase crosstalk. Understanding crosstalk and competition for E3 ligases will be key in ultimately developing a global picture of protein homeostasis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RCq5WNuC9-M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

NF-Y is a trimeric Transcription Factor -TF- which binds with high selectivity to the conserved CCAAT element. Individual ChIP-seq analysis as well as ENCODE have progressively identified locations shared by other TFs. Here, we have analyzed data introduced by ENCODE over the last five years in K562, HeLa-S3 and GM12878, including several chromatin features, as well RNA-seq profiling of HeLa-S3 cells after NF-Y inactivation. We double the number of sequence-specific TFs and co-factors reported. We catalogue them in 4 classes based on co-association criteria, infer target genes categorizations, identify positional bias of binding sites and gene expression changes. Larger and novel co-associations emerge, specifically concerning subunits of repressive complexes as well as RNA-binding proteins. On the one hand, these data better define NF-Y association with single members of major classes of TFs, on the other, they suggest that it might have a wider role in the control of mRNA production.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N0A940Gb8G4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In January 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak was detected in Sichuan Province of China. Six weeks later, the outbreak was successfully contained. The aim of this work is to characterize the epidemiology of the Sichuan outbreak and estimate the impact of interventions in limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We analyzed patient records for all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020. To estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers, we used a Bayesian framework. In addition, we estimate the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies. The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. We estimated R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6–3.7). The epidemic was self-sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by Sichuan authorities. Our findings indicate that, were the control measures be adopted four weeks later, the epidemic could have lasted 49 days longer (95% CI: 31–68 days), causing 9,216 more cases (95% CI: 1,317–25,545).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gLmm_TU9SSs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Which suggestions for behavioral modifications, based on mathematical models, are most likely to be followed in the real world? We address this question in the context of human circadian rhythms. Jet lag is a consequence of the misalignment of the body’s internal circadian (~24-hour) clock during an adjustment to a new schedule. Light is the clock’s primary synchronizer. Previous research has used mathematical models to compute light schedules that shift the circadian clock to a new time zone as quickly as possible. How users adjust their behavior when provided with these optimal schedules remains an open question. Here, we report data collected by wearables from more than 100 travelers as they cross time zones using a smartphone app, &lt;i&gt;Entrain&lt;/i&gt;. We find that people rarely follow the optimal schedules generated through mathematical modeling entirely, but travelers who better followed the optimal schedules reported more positive moods after their trips. Using the data collected, we improve the optimal schedule predictions to accommodate real-world constraints. We also develop a scheduling algorithm that allows for the computation of approximately optimal schedules &quot;on-the-fly&quot; in response to disruptions. User burnout may not be critically important as long as the first parts of a schedule are followed. These results represent a crucial improvement in making the theoretical results of past work viable for practical use and show how theoretical predictions based on known human physiology can be efficiently used in real-world settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZT_k6uA95ic&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing activity revealed that infected cells have a higher observed probability of dying after multiple contacts with CTLs. We developed a three-dimensional agent-based model to discriminate different hypotheses about how infected cells get killed based on quantitative 2-photon &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; observations. We compared a constant CTL killing probability with mechanisms of signal integration in CTL or infected cells. The most likely scenario implied increased susceptibility of infected cells with increasing number of CTL contacts where the total number of contacts was a critical factor. However, when allowing &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; T cells to initiate new interactions with apoptotic target cells (zombie contacts), a contact history independent killing mechanism was also in agreement with experimental datasets. The comparison of observed datasets to simulation results, revealed limitations in interpreting 2-photon data, and provided readouts to distinguish CTL killing models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9anFAnynf2o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;i&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/i&gt;, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium, causes anthrax. The external surface of the exosporium is coated with glycosylated proteins. The sugar additions are capped with the unique monosaccharide anthrose. The West African Group (WAG) &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; have mutations rendering them anthrose deficient. Through genome sequencing, we identified 2 different large chromosomal deletions within the anthrose biosynthetic operon of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; strains from Chile and Poland. In silico analysis identified an anthrose-deficient strain in the anthrax outbreak among European heroin users. Anthrose-deficient strains are no longer restricted to West Africa so the role of anthrose in physiology and pathogenesis was investigated in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; Sterne. Loss of anthrose delayed spore germination and enhanced sporulation. Spores without anthrose were phagocytized at higher rates than spores with anthrose, indicating that anthrose may serve an antiphagocytic function on the spore surface. The anthrose mutant had half the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and decreased time to death (TTD) of wild type and complement &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; Sterne in the A/J mouse model. Following infection, anthrose mutant bacteria were more abundant in the spleen, indicating enhanced dissemination of Sterne anthrose mutant. At low sample sizes in the A/J mouse model, the mortality of Δ&lt;i&gt;antC&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice challenged by intranasal or subcutaneous routes was 20% greater than wild type. Competitive index (CI) studies indicated that spores without anthrose disseminated to organs more extensively than a complemented mutant. Death process modeling using mouse mortality dynamics suggested that larger sample sizes would lead to significantly higher deaths in anthrose-negative infected animals. The model was tested by infecting &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt; with spores and confirmed the anthrose mutant was significantly more lethal. Vaccination studies in the A/J mouse model showed that the human vaccine protected against high-dose challenges of the nonencapsulated Sterne-based anthrose mutant. This work begins to identify the physiologic and pathogenic consequences of convergent anthrose mutations in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xLHjWAFmZzo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Coordination of cell growth is essential for the development of the brain, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of glial and neuronal size are poorly understood. To investigate the mechanisms involved in glial size regulation, we used &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; amphid sheath (AMsh) glia as a model and show that a conserved &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi membrane protein &lt;i&gt;eas-1/GOLT1B&lt;/i&gt; negatively regulates glial growth. We found that &lt;i&gt;eas-1&lt;/i&gt; inhibits a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase &lt;i&gt;rnf-145&lt;/i&gt;/RNF145, which, in turn, promotes nuclear activation of &lt;i&gt;sbp-1/&lt;/i&gt; SREBP, a key regulator of sterol and fatty acid synthesis, to restrict cell growth. At early developmental stages, &lt;i&gt;rnf-145&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi network inhibits &lt;i&gt;sbp-1&lt;/i&gt; activation to promote the growth of glia, and when animals reach the adult stage, this inhibition is released through an &lt;i&gt;eas-1-&lt;/i&gt;dependent shuttling of &lt;i&gt;rnf-145&lt;/i&gt; from the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi network to stop glial growth. Furthermore, we identified long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as downstream products of the &lt;i&gt;eas-1-rnf-145-sbp-1&lt;/i&gt; pathway that functions to prevent the overgrowth of glia. Together, our findings reveal a novel and potentially conserved mechanism underlying glial size control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lnZqLcygP-Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Host–pathogen conflicts leave genetic signatures in genes that are critical for host defense functions. Using these “molecular scars” as a guide to discover gene functions, we discovered a vertebrate-specific MItochondrial STress Response (MISTR) circuit. MISTR proteins are associated with electron transport chain (ETC) factors and activated by stress signals such as interferon gamma (IFNγ) and hypoxia. Upon stress, ultraconserved microRNAs (miRNAs) down-regulate MISTR1(NDUFA4) followed by replacement with paralogs MItochondrial STress Response AntiViral (MISTRAV) and/or MItochondrial STress Response Hypoxia (MISTRH). While cells lacking MISTR1(NDUFA4) are more sensitive to chemical and viral apoptotic triggers, cells lacking MISTRAV or expressing the squirrelpox virus-encoded vMISTRAV exhibit resistance to the same insults. Rapid evolution signatures across primate genomes for &lt;i&gt;MISTR1(NDUFA4)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MISTRAV&lt;/i&gt; indicate recent and ongoing conflicts with pathogens. MISTR homologs are also found in plants, yeasts, a fish virus, and an algal virus indicating ancient origins and suggesting diverse means of altering mitochondrial function under stress. The discovery of MISTR circuitry highlights the use of evolution-guided studies to reveal fundamental biological processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lko71xOFkvE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Cilia play critical roles during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Dysfunction of cilia leads to various human genetic diseases, including many caused by defects in transition zones (TZs), the “gates” of cilia. The evolutionarily conserved TZ component centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) is the most frequently mutated human ciliopathy gene, but its roles in ciliogenesis are not completely understood. Here, we report that CEP290 plays an essential role in the initiation of TZ assembly in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Mechanistically, the N-terminus of CEP290 directly recruits DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1 (DZIP1), which then recruits Chibby (CBY) and Rab8 to promote early ciliary membrane formation. Complete deletion of CEP290 blocks ciliogenesis at the initiation stage of TZ assembly, which can be mimicked by DZIP1 deletion mutants. Remarkably, expression of the N-terminus of CEP290 alone restores the TZ localization of DZIP1 and subsequently ameliorates the defects in TZ assembly initiation in &lt;i&gt;cep290&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Our results link CEP290 to DZIP1-CBY/Rab8 module and uncover a previously uncharacterized important function of CEP290 in the coordination of early ciliary membrane formation and TZ assembly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/aG3YmgUwtug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

When the J-domain of the heat shock protein DnaJB1 is fused to the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), replacing exon 1, this fusion protein, J-C subunit (J-C), becomes the driver of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC). Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize J-C bound to RIIβ, the major PKA regulatory (R) subunit in liver, thus reporting the first cryo-EM structure of any PKA holoenzyme. We report several differences in both structure and dynamics that could not be captured by the conventional crystallography approaches used to obtain prior structures. Most striking is the asymmetry caused by the absence of the second cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain and the J-domain in one of the RIIβ:J-C protomers. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we discovered that this asymmetry is already present in the wild-type (WT) RIIβ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but had been masked in the previous crystal structure. This asymmetry may link to the intrinsic allosteric regulation of all PKA holoenzymes and could also explain why most disease mutations in PKA regulatory subunits are dominant negative. The cryo-EM structure, combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), also allowed us to predict the general position of the Dimerization/Docking (D/D) domain, which is essential for localization and interacting with membrane-anchored A-Kinase-Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). This position provides a multivalent mechanism for interaction of the RIIβ holoenzyme with membranes and would be perturbed in the oncogenic fusion protein. The J-domain also alters several biochemical properties of the RIIβ holoenzyme: It is easier to activate with cAMP, and the cooperativity is reduced. These results provide new insights into how the finely tuned allosteric PKA signaling network is disrupted by the oncogenic J-C subunit, ultimately leading to the development of FL-HCC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SxEStF5xD4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

An often-returning question for not only HIV-1, but also other organisms, is how predictable evolutionary paths are. The environment, mutational history, and random processes can all impact the exact evolutionary paths, but to which extent these factors contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of a particular system is an open question. Especially in a virus like HIV-1, with a large mutation rate and large population sizes, evolution is expected to be highly predictable if the impact of environment and history is low, and evolution is not neutral. We investigated the effect of environment and mutational history by analyzing sequences from a long-term evolution experiment, in which HIV-1 was passaged on 2 different cell types in 8 independent evolutionary lines and 8 derived lines, 4 of which involved a switch of the environment. The experiments lasted for 240–300 passages, corresponding to approximately 400–600 generations or almost 3 years. The sequences show signs of extensive parallel evolution—the majority of mutations that are shared between independent lines appear in both cell types, but we also find that both environment and mutational history significantly impact the evolutionary paths. We conclude that HIV-1 evolution is robust to small changes in the environment, similar to a transmission event in the absence of an immune response or drug pressure. We also find that the fitness landscape of HIV-1 is largely smooth, although we find some evidence for both positive and negative epistatic interactions between mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4erFhbSb4yI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Cardiac levels of the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor-3 (STAT3) decline with age, and male but not female mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific STAT3 deficiency conditional knockout (CKO) display premature age-related heart failure associated with reduced cardiac capillary density. In the present study, isolated male and female CKO-cardiomyocytes exhibit increased prostaglandin (PG)-generating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. The PG-degrading hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase-15 (HPGD) expression is only reduced in male cardiomyocytes, which is associated with increased prostaglandin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) secretion from isolated male but not female CKO-cardiomyocytes. Reduced HPGD expression in male cardiomyocytes derive from impaired androgen receptor (AR)–signaling due to loss of its cofactor STAT3. Elevated PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; secretion in males is associated with increased white adipocyte accumulation in aged male but not female hearts. Adipocyte differentiation is enhanced in isolated stem cell antigen-1 (SCA-1)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) from young male CKO-mice compared with the adipocyte differentiation of male wild-type (WT)-CPC and CPC isolated from female mice. Epigenetic analysis in freshly isolated male CKO-CPC display hypermethylation in pro-angiogenic genes (&lt;i&gt;Fgfr2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Epas1&lt;/i&gt;) and hypomethylation in the white adipocyte differentiation gene &lt;i&gt;Zfp423&lt;/i&gt; associated with up-regulated ZFP423 expression and a shift from endothelial to white adipocyte differentiation compared with WT-CPC. The expression of the histone-methyltransferase EZH2 is reduced in male CKO-CPC compared with male WT-CPC, whereas no differences in the EZH2 expression in female CPC were observed. Clonally expanded CPC can differentiate into endothelial cells or into adipocytes depending on the differentiation conditions. ZFP423 overexpression is sufficient to induce white adipocyte differentiation of clonal CPC. In isolated WT-CPC, PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation reduces the expression of EZH2, thereby up-regulating ZFP423 expression and promoting white adipocyte differentiation. The treatment of young male CKO mice with the COX inhibitor Ibuprofen or the PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (DP)2 receptor antagonist BAY-u 3405 in vivo increased EZH2 expression and reduced ZFP423 expression and adipocyte differentiation in CKO-CPC. Thus, cardiomyocyte STAT3 deficiency leads to age-related and sex-specific cardiac remodeling and failure in part due to sex-specific alterations in PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; secretion and subsequent epigenetic impairment of the differentiation potential of CPC. Causally involved is the impaired AR signaling in absence of STAT3, which reduces the expression of the PG-degrading enzyme HPGD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bZIPnUYRK2w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Understanding species’ roles in food webs requires an accurate assessment of their trophic niche. However, it is challenging to delineate potential trophic interactions across an ecosystem, and a paucity of empirical information often leads to inconsistent definitions of trophic guilds based on expert opinion, especially when applied to hyperdiverse ecosystems. Using coral reef fishes as a model group, we show that experts disagree on the assignment of broad trophic guilds for more than 20% of species, which hampers comparability across studies. Here, we propose a quantitative, unbiased, and reproducible approach to define trophic guilds and apply recent advances in machine learning to predict probabilities of pairwise trophic interactions with high accuracy. We synthesize data from community-wide gut content analyses of tropical coral reef fishes worldwide, resulting in diet information from 13,961 individuals belonging to 615 reef fish. We then use network analysis to identify 8 trophic guilds and Bayesian phylogenetic modeling to show that trophic guilds can be predicted based on phylogeny and maximum body size. Finally, we use machine learning to test whether pairwise trophic interactions can be predicted with accuracy. Our models achieved a misclassification error of less than 5%, indicating that our approach results in a quantitative and reproducible trophic categorization scheme, as well as high-resolution probabilities of trophic interactions. By applying our framework to the most diverse vertebrate consumer group, we show that it can be applied to other organismal groups to advance reproducibility in trait-based ecology. Our work thus provides a viable approach to account for the complexity of predator–prey interactions in highly diverse ecosystems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gkLuvPEX4Ak&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We diagnosed 11 Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) cases among 71,904 COVID patients attended at 61 Spanish emergency departments (EDs) during the 2‐month pandemic peak. The relative frequency of GBS among ED patients was higher in COVID (0.15‰) than non‐COVID (0.02‰) patients (odds ratio [OR] = 6.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.18–12.5), as was the standardized incidence (9.44 and 0.69 cases/100,000 inhabitant‐years, respectively, OR = 13.5, 95% CI = 9.87–18.4). Regarding clinical characteristics, olfactory–gustatory disorders were more frequent in COVID‐GBS than non‐COVID–GBS (OR = 27.59, 95% CI = 1.296–587) and COVID–non‐GBS (OR = 7.875, 95% CI = 1.587–39.09) patients. Although COVID‐GBS patients were more frequently admitted to intensive care, mortality was not increased versus control groups. Our results suggest SARS‐CoV‐2 could be another viral infection causing GBS. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently gained attention as an alternative treatment of malignant gliomas. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent within tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Conventional treatments for this CNS tumor include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Surgery is still being considered as the treatment of choice. Even so, the poor prognosis and/or recurrence of the disease after applying any of these treatments highlight the urgency of exploring new therapies and/or improving existing ones to achieve the definitive eradication of tumor masses and remaining cells. PDT is a therapeutic modality that involves the destruction of tumor cells by reactive oxygen species induced by light, which were previously treated with a photosensitizing agent. However, in recent years, its experimental application has expanded to other effects that could improve overall performance against GBM. In the current review, we revisit the main advances of PDT for GBM management and also, the recent mechanistic insights about cellular and molecular aspects related to tumoral resistance to PDT of GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limbic encephalitis (LE) comprises a spectrum of inflammatory changes in affected brain structures including the presence of autoantibodies and lymphoid cells. Still, the potential of distinct lymphocyte subsets alone to elicit key clinico‐pathological sequelae of LE potentially inducing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with chronic spontaneous seizures and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we scrutinized pathogenic consequences emerging from CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells targeting hippocampal neurons by recombinant adeno‐associated virus‐mediated expression of the model‐autoantigen Ovalbumin (OVA) in CA1 neurons of OT‐I/RAG1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice (termed ‘OVA‐CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LE model’).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral‐mediated antigen transfer caused dense CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell infiltrates confined to the hippocampal formation starting on day five after virus transduction. Flow cytometry indicated priming of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells in brain‐draining lymph nodes to precede hippocampal invasion. At the acute model stage, the inflammatory process was accompanied by frequent seizure activity and impairment of hippocampal memory skills. MRI‐scans at day seven of the OVA‐CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LE model revealed hippocampal edema and blood‐brain‐barrier disruption that converted into atrophy until day 40. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells specifically targeted OVA‐expressing, SIINFEKL‐H‐2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; positive CA1 neurons and caused segmental apoptotic neurodegeneration, astrogliosis and microglial activation. At the chronic model stage, mice exhibited spontaneous recurrent seizures and persisting memory deficits, whilst the sclerotic hippocampus was populated with CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells escorted by NK‐cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that a CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell initiated attack of distinct hippocampal neurons is sufficient to induce LE converting into TLE‐HS. Intriguingly, the role of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells exceeds neurotoxic effects and points to their major pathogenic role in TLE following LE.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Structural basis for noradrenergic regulation of neural circuits in the mouse olfactory bulb&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/84d3ff4c-cb5f-4ca6-8a2f-b47b1299da28/cne25085-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We accomplished visualization and reconstruction of noradrenergic neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB) by infection of adeno‐associated viruses into the locus coeruleus of dopamine beta hydroxylase‐Cre mice. An individual noradrenergic axon traveled while forming several branches and was distributed in multiple glomeruli that were located in different areas of the glomerular layer in the OB.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olfactory input is processed in the glomerulus of the main olfactory bulb (OB) and relayed to higher centers in the brain by projection neurons. Conversely, centrifugal inputs from other brain regions project to the OB. We have previously analyzed centrifugal inputs into the OB from several brain regions using single‐neuron labeling. In this study, we analyzed the centrifugal noradrenergic (NA) fibers derived from the locus coeruleus (LC), because their projection pathways and synaptic connections in the OB have not been clarified in detail. We analyzed the NA centrifugal projections by single‐neuron labeling and immunoelectron microscopy. Individual NA neurons labeled by viral infection were three‐dimensionally traced using Neurolucida software to visualize the projection pathway from the LC to the OB. Also, centrifugal NA fibers were visualized using an antibody for noradrenaline transporter (NET). NET immunoreactive (‐ir) fibers contained many varicosities and synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, electron tomography demonstrated that NET‐ir fibers formed asymmetrical synapses of varied morphology. Although these synapses were present at varicosities, the density of synapses was relatively low throughout the OB. The maximal density of synapses was found in the external plexiform layer; about 17% of all observed varicosities contained synapses. These results strongly suggest that NA‐containing fibers in the OB release NA from both varicosities and synapses to influence the activities of OB neurons. The present study provides a morphological basis for olfactory modulation by centrifugal NA fibers derived from the LC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Social isolation is closely linked to a marked reduction in physical activity in male mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4de7253b-27df-4c6e-a816-72511f472bb4/jnr24777-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By observing the behavior of mice in their home cage environment, using the powerful PhenoTyper tracking system, we demonstrate that mice display dramatic reductions in movement and exploration when isolated from their cage mates, an instantaneous effect that escalates over the next 5 days, which is reversible upon re‐pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of social isolation on an individual's behavior is an important field of research, especially as public health officials encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of pandemic disease. In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel‐based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re‐paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Axonal mitochondria adjust in size depending on g‐ratio of surrounding myelin during homeostasis and advanced remyelination&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8e29653c-6822-4313-bd6d-9b8faae89700/jnr24767-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal mitochondrial size correlates with &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;‐ratio during homeostasis in multiple species and during advanced remyelination. But not during early remyelination. Oligodendrocyte mitochondria function influence myelin thickness which influence axonal mitochondria size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demyelinating pathology is common in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease and results in axonal energy deficiency, dysfunctional axonal propagation, and neurodegeneration. During myelin repair and also during myelin homeostasis, mutual regulative processes between axons and myelin sheaths are known to be essential. However, proficient tools are lacking to characterize axon‐myelin interdependence during (re)myelination. Thus, we herein investigated adaptions in myelin sheath &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;‐ratio as a proxy for myelin thickness and axon metabolic status during homeostasis and myelin repair, by using axonal mitochondrial size as a proxy for axonal metabolic status. We found that axons with thinner myelin sheaths had larger axonal mitochondria; this was true for across different central nervous system tracts as well as across species, including humans. The link between myelin sheath thickness and mitochondrial size was temporarily absent during demyelination but reestablished during advanced remyelination, as shown in two commonly used animal models of toxic demyelination. By further exploring this association in mice with either genetically induced mitochondrial or myelin dysfunction, we show that axonal mitochondrial size adjusts in response to the thickness of the myelin sheath but not &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt;. This pinpoints the relevance of mitochondrial adaptation upon myelin repair and might open a new therapeutic window for remyelinating therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Defining VDR expression in the brain using a novel VDRCre mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/615ae6fd-ceeb-40df-be7c-4f1ded9a7edd/cne25100-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generated a novel vitamin D receptor (VDR) VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; knockin mouse for the interrogation of VDR anatomy in the brain. In this paper, we demonstrate through immunohistochemistry that VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;‐driven reporter expression colocalizes with VDR mRNA throughout the brain. Additionally, we demonstrate that tdTomato (+) neurons respond rapidly to vitamin D, which does not occur in tdTomato (‐) neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D action has been linked to several diseases regulated by the brain including obesity, diabetes, autism, and Parkinson’s. However, the location of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the brain is not clear due to conflicting reports. We found that two antibodies previously published as specific in peripheral tissues are not specific in the brain. We thus created a new knockin mouse with cre recombinase expression under the control of the endogenous VDR promoter (VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;). We demonstrated that the cre activity in the VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mouse brain (as reported by a cre‐dependent tdTomato expression) is highly overlapping with endogenous VDR mRNAs. These VDR‐expressing cells were enriched in multiple brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, and hypothalamus among others. In the hypothalamus, VDR partially colocalized with vasopressin, oxytocin, estrogen receptor α, and β‐endorphin to various degrees. We further functionally validated our model by demonstrating that the endogenous VDR agonist 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D activated all tested tdTomato+ neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus but had no effect on neurons without tdTomato fluorescence. Thus, we have generated a new mouse tool that allows us to visualize VDR‐expressing cells and to characterize their functions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Identification and Localization of a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Related Neuropeptide in Biomphalaria, an Intermediate Host for Schistosomiasis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f3da04bd-e198-4f6b-81d2-c4d0155bc303/cne25099-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histological methods were used to localize a neuropeptide related to gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) in the central nervous system and periphery of &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria glabrata&lt;/i&gt;, an intermediate host for intestinal schistosomiasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshwater snails of the genus &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. mansoni&lt;/i&gt; larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as ‘parasitic castration’. As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria alexandrina&lt;/i&gt; that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (designated &lt;i&gt;Biom&lt;/i&gt;‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against &lt;i&gt;Biom&lt;/i&gt;‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of &lt;i&gt;B. glabrata&lt;/i&gt;. GnRH‐like immunoreactive (GnRHli) fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in the gene &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;, coding for the γ‐aminobutyric acid type A (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor subunit β2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited and systematically evaluated 25 individuals with variants in &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;, 17 of whom are newly described and 8 previously reported with additional clinical data. Functional analysis was performed using a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocyte model system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cohort of 25 individuals from 22 families with variants in &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated a range of epilepsy phenotypes from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fifty‐eight percent of individuals had pharmacoresistant epilepsy; response to medications targeting the GABAergic pathway was inconsistent. Developmental disability (present in 84%) ranged from mild intellectual disability to severe global disability; movement disorders (present in 44%) included choreoathetosis, dystonia, and ataxia. Disease‐associated variants cluster in the extracellular N‐terminus and transmembrane domains 1–3, with more severe phenotypes seen in association with variants in transmembrane domains 1 and 2 and the allosteric binding site between transmembrane domains 2 and 3. Functional analysis of 4 variants in transmembrane domains 1 or 2 (p.Ile246Thr, p.Pro252Leu, p.Ile288Ser, p.Val282Ala) revealed strongly reduced amplitudes of GABA‐evoked anionic currents.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;‐related epilepsy ranges broadly in severity from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Developmental disability and movement disorder are key features. The phenotypic spectrum is comparable to other GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding genes. Phenotypic severity varies by protein domain. Experimental evidence supports loss of GABAergic inhibition as the mechanism underlying &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;‐associated neurodevelopmental disorders. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with traumatic brain injury who fail to obey commands after sedation‐washout pose one of the most significant challenges for neurological prognostication. Reducing prognostic uncertainty will lead to more appropriate care decisions and ensure provision of limited rehabilitation resources to those most likely to benefit. Bedside‐markers of covert residual cognition, including speech comprehension, may reduce this uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 28 patients with acute traumatic brain injury who were 2‐7‐days sedation‐free and failed to obey commands. Patients heard streams of isochronous monosyllabic words that built meaningful phrases and sentences while their brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In healthy individuals, EEG activity only synchronises with the rhythm of phrases and sentences when listeners consciously comprehend the speech. This approach therefore provides a measure of residual speech comprehension in unresponsive patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17‐ and 16‐patients were available for assessment with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended at three‐ and six‐months, respectively. Outcome significantly correlated with the strength of patients’ acute cortical tracking of phrases and sentences (r&amp;gt;.6, p&amp;lt;.007), quantified by inter‐trial phase coherence. Linear regressions revealed that the strength of this comprehension response (beta=.603, p=.006) significantly improved the accuracy of prognoses relative to clinical characteristics alone (e.g. Glasgow Coma Scale, Computer Tomography (CT) grade).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple, passive, auditory EEG protocol improves prognostic accuracy in a critical period of clinical decision‐making. Unlike other approaches to probing covert cognition for prognostication, this approach is entirely passive and therefore less susceptible to cognitive deficits, increasing the number of patients who may benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

Within the tumor microenvironment, macrophages exist in an immunosuppressive state, preventing T cells from eliminating the tumor. Due to this, research is focusing on immunotherapies that specifically target macrophages in order to reduce their immunosuppressive capabilities and promote T cell function. In this study, we develop an agent-based model consisting of the interactions between macrophages, T cells, and tumor cells to determine how the immune response changes due to three macrophage-based immunotherapeutic strategies: macrophage depletion, recruitment inhibition, and macrophage reeducation. We find that reeducation, which converts the macrophages into an immune promoting phenotype, is the most effective strategy and that the macrophage recruitment rate and tumor proliferation rate (tumor-specific properties) have large impacts on therapy efficacy. We also employ a novel method of using a neural network to reduce the computational complexity of an intracellular signaling mechanistic model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/itGbDRPWJ0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Insulin resistance (IR) precedes the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and increases cardiovascular disease risk. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered new loci associated with T2D, their contribution to explain the mechanisms leading to decreased insulin sensitivity has been very limited. Thus, new approaches are necessary to explore the genetic architecture of insulin resistance. To that end, we generated an iPSC library across the spectrum of insulin sensitivity in humans. RNA-seq based analysis of 310 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones derived from 100 individuals allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes between insulin resistant and sensitive iPSC lines. Analysis of the co-expression architecture uncovered several insulin sensitivity-relevant gene sub-networks, and predictive network modeling identified a set of key driver genes that regulate these co-expression modules. Functional validation in human adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells (SKMCs) confirmed the relevance of the key driver candidate genes for insulin responsiveness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xm2yv54rgnU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The fate of scientific hypotheses often relies on the ability of a computational model to explain the data, quantified in modern statistical approaches by the likelihood function. The log-likelihood is the key element for parameter estimation and model evaluation. However, the log-likelihood of complex models in fields such as computational biology and neuroscience is often intractable to compute analytically or numerically. In those cases, researchers can often only estimate the log-likelihood by comparing observed data with synthetic observations generated by model simulations. Standard techniques to approximate the likelihood via simulation either use summary statistics of the data or are at risk of producing substantial biases in the estimate. Here, we explore another method, inverse binomial sampling (IBS), which can estimate the log-likelihood of an entire data set efficiently and without bias. For each observation, IBS draws samples from the simulator model until one matches the observation. The log-likelihood estimate is then a function of the number of samples drawn. The variance of this estimator is uniformly bounded, achieves the minimum variance for an unbiased estimator, and we can compute calibrated estimates of the variance. We provide theoretical arguments in favor of IBS and an empirical assessment of the method for maximum-likelihood estimation with simulation-based models. As case studies, we take three model-fitting problems of increasing complexity from computational and cognitive neuroscience. In all problems, IBS generally produces lower error in the estimated parameters and maximum log-likelihood values than alternative sampling methods with the same average number of samples. Our results demonstrate the potential of IBS as a practical, robust, and easy to implement method for log-likelihood evaluation when exact techniques are not available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OsIhzQozl6c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Fluorescence reconstruction microscopy (FRM) describes a class of techniques where transmitted light images are passed into a convolutional neural network that then outputs predicted epifluorescence images. This approach enables many benefits including reduced phototoxicity, freeing up of fluorescence channels, simplified sample preparation, and the ability to re-process legacy data for new insights. However, FRM can be complex to implement, and current FRM benchmarks are abstractions that are difficult to relate to how valuable or trustworthy a reconstruction is. Here, we relate the conventional benchmarks and demonstrations to practical and familiar cell biology analyses to demonstrate that FRM should be judged in context. We further demonstrate that it performs remarkably well even with lower-magnification microscopy data, as are often collected in screening and high content imaging. Specifically, we present promising results for nuclei, cell-cell junctions, and fine feature reconstruction; provide data-driven experimental design guidelines; and provide researcher-friendly code, complete sample data, and a researcher manual to enable more widespread adoption of FRM.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wf9Ho97_a2o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

By modifying and calibrating an active vertex model to experiments, we have simulated numerically a confluent cellular monolayer spreading on an empty space and the collision of two monolayers of different cells in an antagonistic migration assay. Cells are subject to inertial forces and to active forces that try to align their velocities with those of neighboring ones. In agreement with experiments in the literature, the spreading test exhibits formation of fingers in the moving interfaces, there appear swirls in the velocity field, and the polar order parameter and the correlation and swirl lengths increase with time. Numerical simulations show that cells inside the tissue have smaller area than those at the interface, which has been observed in recent experiments. In the antagonistic migration assay, a population of fluidlike Ras cells invades a population of wild type solidlike cells having shape parameters above and below the geometric critical value, respectively. Cell mixing or segregation depends on the junction tensions between different cells. We reproduce the experimentally observed antagonistic migration assays by assuming that a fraction of cells favor mixing, the others segregation, and that these cells are randomly distributed in space. To characterize and compare the structure of interfaces between cell types or of interfaces of spreading cellular monolayers in an automatic manner, we apply topological data analysis to experimental data and to results of our numerical simulations. We use time series of data generated by numerical simulations to automatically group, track and classify the advancing interfaces of cellular aggregates by means of bottleneck or Wasserstein distances of persistent homologies. These techniques of topological data analysis are scalable and could be used in studies involving large amounts of data. Besides applications to wound healing and metastatic cancer, these studies are relevant for tissue engineering, biological effects of materials, tissue and organ regeneration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FpOKxraLPNY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The enzymes of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily count more than 870 000 members through all kingdoms of life and share the same structural fold. GNAT enzymes transfer an acyl moiety from acyl coenzyme A to a wide range of substrates including aminoglycosides, serotonin, glucosamine-6-phosphate, protein N-termini and lysine residues of histones and other proteins. The GNAT subtype of protein N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) alone targets a majority of all eukaryotic proteins stressing the omnipresence of the GNAT enzymes. Despite the highly conserved GNAT fold, sequence similarity is quite low between members of this superfamily even when substrates are similar. Furthermore, this superfamily is phylogenetically not well characterized. Thus functional annotation based on sequence similarity is unreliable and strongly hampered for thousands of GNAT members that remain biochemically uncharacterized. Here we used sequence similarity networks to map the sequence space and propose a new classification for eukaryotic GNAT acetyltransferases. Using the new classification, we built a phylogenetic tree, representing the entire GNAT acetyltransferase superfamily. Our results show that protein NATs have evolved more than once on the GNAT acetylation scaffold. We use our classification to predict the function of uncharacterized sequences and verify by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; protein assays that two fungal genes encode NAT enzymes targeting specific protein N-terminal sequences, showing that even slight changes on the GNAT fold can lead to change in substrate specificity. In addition to providing a new map of the relationship between eukaryotic acetyltransferases the classification proposed constitutes a tool to improve functional annotation of GNAT acetyltransferases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PEKlfRJLvyY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Zoonotic avian influenza viruses pose severe health threats to humans. Of several viral subtypes reported, the low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus has since February 2013 caused more than 1,500 cases of human infection with an almost 40% case-fatality rate. Vaccination of poultry appears to reduce human infections. However, the emergence of highly pathogenic strains has increased concerns about H7N9 pandemics. To develop an efficacious H7N9 human vaccine, we designed vaccine viruses by changing the patterns of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked glycosylation (NLG) on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein based on evolutionary patterns of H7 HA NLG changes. Notably, a virus in which 2 NLG modifications were added to HA showed higher growth rates in cell culture and elicited more cross-reactive antibodies than did other vaccine viruses with no change in the viral antigenicity. Developed into an inactivated vaccine formulation, the vaccine virus with 2 HA NLG additions exhibited much better protective efficacy against lethal viral challenge in mice than did a vaccine candidate with wild-type (WT) HA by reducing viral replication in the lungs. In a ferret model, the 2 NLG-added vaccine viruses also induced hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies and significantly suppressed viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts compared with the WT HA vaccines. In a mode of action study, the HA NLG modification appeared to increase HA protein contents incorporated into viral particles, which would be successfully translated to improve vaccine efficacy. These results suggest the strong potential of HA NLG modifications in designing avian influenza vaccines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tD-eDoOH63s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as &lt;i&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/i&gt;-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Here, we identify a neuroprotective pathway of like-Sm protein 12 (&lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;) and exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP 1 (&lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt;) that sustains the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient and thereby suppresses NCT dysfunction by the &lt;i&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/i&gt;-derived poly(glycine-arginine) protein. LSM12 depletion in human neuroblastoma cells aggravated poly(GR)-induced impairment of NCT and nuclear integrity while promoting the nuclear accumulation of poly(GR) granules. In fact, &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt; posttranscriptionally up-regulated &lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt; expression, whereas EPAC1 overexpression rescued the RAN gradient and NCT defects in &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;-deleted cells. C9-ALS patient-derived neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (C9-ALS iPSNs) displayed low expression of &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt;. Lentiviral overexpression of LSM12 or EPAC1 indeed restored the RAN gradient, mitigated the pathogenic mislocalization of TDP-43, and suppressed caspase-3 activation for apoptosis in C9-ALS iPSNs. EPAC1 depletion biochemically dissociated RAN-importin β1 from the cytoplasmic nuclear pore complex, thereby dissipating the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient essential for NCT. These findings define the &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt; pathway as an important suppressor of the NCT-related pathologies in C9-ALS/FTD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PGYGt4CxIDM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Histone variants expand chromatin functions in eukaryote genomes. &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; genes are testis-expressed short histone H2A variants that arose in placental mammals. Their biological functions remain largely unknown. To investigate their function, we generated a knockout (KO) model that disrupts all 3 &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; genes in mice. We show that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; KO males have globally altered chromatin structure in postmeiotic germ cells. Yet, they do not show impaired spermatogenesis or testis function. Instead, we find that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; plays a crucial role postfertilization. Crosses between &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; KO males and females yield embryos with lower viability and reduced size. Using a series of genetic crosses that separate parental and zygotic contributions, we show that the &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; status of both the father and mother, but not of the zygote, affects embryonic viability and growth during gestation. We conclude that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; is a novel parental-effect gene, establishing a role for short H2A histone variants in mammalian development. We posit that parental antagonism over embryonic growth drove the origin and ongoing diversification of short histone H2A variants in placental mammals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/38O2OT1oGoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Detection of functional connectivity in the brain during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks: A functional near‐infrared spectroscopy study&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1d9b6dd9-0ddf-414a-a4d5-24450d96162a/jnr24769-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain activity of the four brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks were detected by functional near‐infrared spectroscopy. Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model were used to get a more comprehensive and accurate functional connectivity for precise grip force control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional connectivity (FC) between multiple brain regions during tasks is currently gradually being explored with functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, the FC present during grip force tracking tasks performed under visual feedback remains unclear. In the present study, we used fNIRS to measure brain activity during resting states and grip force tracking tasks at 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in 11 healthy subjects, and the activity was measured from four target brain regions: the left prefrontal cortex (lPFC), right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), left sensorimotor cortex (lSMC), and right sensorimotor cortex (rSMC). We determined the FC between these regions utilizing three different methods: Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM). The results showed that the FC of lSMC‐rSMC and lPFC‐rPFC (interhemispheric homologous pairs) were significantly stronger than those of other brain region pairs. Moreover, FC of lPFC‐rPFC was strengthened during the 75% MVC task compared to the other task states and the resting states. The FC of lSMC‐lPFC and rSMC‐rPFC (intrahemispheric region pairs) strengthened with a higher task load. The results provided new insights into the FC between brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;N‐cadherin localization in taste buds of mouse circumvallate papillae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/725af322-842c-4a8b-a5c9-885a4ee65dfa/cne25090-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N‐cadherin is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. It was mainly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in taste buds. Immunoelectron microscopy detected N‐cadherin symmetrically in the membranes of contact sites between afferent fibers (N) and type II cells (II), including synapses. Arrowheads: atypical mitochondria.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taste buds, the receptor organs for taste, contain 50–100 taste bud cells. Although these cells undergo continuous turnover, the structural and functional integrity of taste buds is maintained. The molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connectivity between taste buds and afferent fibers is formed and maintained remain ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the localization of N‐cadherin in the taste buds of the mouse circumvallate papillae because N‐cadherin, one of the classical cadherins, is important for the formation and maintenance of synapses. At the light microscopic level, N‐cadherin was predominantly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in the connective tissues in and around the vallate papillae. At the ultrastructural level, N‐cadherin immunoreactivity appears along the cell membrane and in the intracellular vesicles of type II cells. N‐cadherin immunoreactivity also is evident in the membranes of afferent terminals at the contact sites to N‐cadherin‐positive type II cells. At channel type synapses between type II cells and nerve fibers, N‐cadherin is present surrounding, but not within, the presumed neurotransmitter release zone, identified by large mitochondria apposed to the taste cells. The present results suggest that N‐cadherin is important for the formation or maintenance of type II cell afferent synapses in taste buds.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The family of lipid neuromodulators has been rapidly growing, as the use of different -omics techniques led to the discovery of a large number of naturally occurring N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and N-acyl amino acids belonging to the complex lipid signaling system termed endocannabinoidome. These molecules exert a variety of biological activities in the central nervous system, as they modulate physiological processes in neurons and glial cells and are involved in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Their effects on dopamine cells have attracted attention, as dysfunctions of dopamine systems characterize a range of psychiatric disorders, i.e., schizophrenia and substance use disorders (SUD). While canonical endocannabinoids are known to regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs impinging on dopamine cells and modulate several dopamine-mediated behaviors, such as reward and addiction, the effects of other lipid neuromodulators are far less clear. Here, we review the emerging role of endocannabinoid-like neuromodulators in dopamine signaling, with a focus on non-cannabinoid N-acylethanolamines and their receptors. Mounting evidence suggests that these neuromodulators contribute to modulate synaptic transmission in dopamine regions and might represent a target for novel medications in alcohol and nicotine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Stromal interaction molecules (STIMs), including STIM1 and STIM2, are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are located predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They serve as calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) sensors within the ER. In the central nervous system (CNS), they are involved mainly in Orai-mediated store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE). The key molecular components of the SOCE pathway are well-characterized, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of this pathway need further investigation. Numerous intracellular target proteins that are located in the plasma membrane, ER, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasm have been reported to play essential roles in concert with STIMs, such as conformational changes in STIMs, their translocation, the stabilization of their interactions with Orai, and the activation of other channels. The present review focuses on numerous regulators, such as Homer, SOCE-associated regulatory factor (SARAF), septin, synaptopodin, golli proteins, partner of STIM1 (POST), and transcription factors and proteasome inhibitors that regulate STIM-Orai interactions in the CNS. Further we describe novel roles of STIMs in mediating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx via other than Orai pathways, including TRPC channels, VGCCs, AMPA and NMDA receptors, and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. This review also summarizes recent findings on additional molecular targets of STIM proteins including SERCA, IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, end-binding proteins (EB), presenilin, and CaMKII. Dysregulation of the SOCE-associated toolkit, including STIMs, contributes to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease), traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and stroke. Emerging evidence points to the role of STIM proteins and several of their molecular effectors and regulators in neuronal and glial physiology and pathology, suggesting their potential application for future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry is the driving force behind current brain proteome analysis. In a typical proteomics approach, a protein isolate is digested into tryptic peptides and then analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The recent advancements in data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry provide higher sensitivity and protein coverage than the classic data dependent acquisition. DIA cycles through a pre-defined set of peptide precursor isolation windows stepping through 400–1,200 m/z across the whole liquid chromatography gradient. All peptides within an isolation window are fragmented simultaneously and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Peptides are identified by matching the ion peaks in a mass spectrum to a spectral library that contains information of the peptide fragment ions' pattern and its chromatography elution time. Currently, there are several reports on DIA in brain research, in particular the quantitative analysis of cellular and synaptic proteomes to reveal the spatial and/or temporal changes of proteins that underlie neuronal plasticity and disease mechanisms. Protocols in DIA are continuously improving in both acquisition and data analysis. The depth of analysis is currently approaching proteome-wide coverage, while maintaining high reproducibility in a stable and standardisable MS environment. DIA can be positioned as the method of choice for routine proteome analysis in basic brain research and clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Recent evidence increasingly associates network disruption in brain organization with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare terminal disease. However, the comparability of brain network characteristics across different studies remains a challenge for conventional graph theoretical methods. One suggested method to address this issue is minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis, which provides a less biased comparison. Here, we assessed the novel application of MST network analysis to hemodynamic responses recorded by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging modality, during an activity-based paradigm to investigate hypothetical disruptions in frontal functional brain network topology as a marker of the executive dysfunction, one of the most prevalent cognitive deficit reported across ALS studies. We analyzed data recorded from nine participants with ALS and ten age-matched healthy controls by first estimating functional connectivity, using phase-locking value (PLV) analysis, and then constructing the corresponding individual and group MSTs. Our results showed significant between-group differences in several MST topological properties, including leaf fraction, maximum degree, diameter, eccentricity, and degree divergence. We further observed a global shift toward more centralized frontal network organizations in the ALS group, interpreted as a more random or dysregulated network in this cohort. Moreover, the similarity analysis demonstrated marginally significantly increased overlap in the individual MSTs from the control group, implying a reference network with lower topological variation in the healthy cohort. Our nodal analysis characterized the main local hubs in healthy controls as distributed more evenly over the frontal cortex, with slightly higher occurrence in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC), while in the ALS group, the most frequent hubs were asymmetrical, observed primarily in the right prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the global PLV (gPLV) synchronization metric is associated with disease progression, and a few topological properties, including leaf fraction and tree hierarchy, are linked to disease duration. These results suggest that dysregulation, centralization, and asymmetry of the hemodynamic-based frontal functional network during activity are potential neuro-topological markers of ALS pathogenesis. Our findings can possibly support new bedside assessments of the functional status of ALS’ brain network and could hypothetically extend to applications in other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and cellular apoptosis caused by spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury result in neurological dysfunction. MicroRNAs (miRs) have crucial functions in spinal cord I/R injury pathogenesis according to previous evidences. Herein, whether miR-128-3p contributes to spinal cord I/R injury by regulating specificity protein 1 (SP1) was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A rat model of spinal cord I/R injury was established by occluding the aortic arch for 14 min. Then, miR-128-3p’s interaction with SP1 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assays. Next, miR-128-3p mimic and inhibitor, as well as adenovirus-delivered shRNA specific for SP1 were injected intrathecally for assessing the effects of miR-128-3p and SP1 on rats with spinal cord I/R injury. SP1, Bax and Bcl-2 expression levels in I/R injured spinal cord tissues were evaluated by Western blotting, while IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were quantitated by ELISA. Tarlov scores were obtained to detect hind-limb motor function. Evans blue (EB) dye extravasation was utilized to examine blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed for neuronal apoptosis assessment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;MiR-128-3p expression was decreased, while SP1 amounts were increased in rat spinal cord tissue specimens following I/R. SP1 was identified as a miR-128-3p target and downregulated by miR-128-3p. MiR-128-3p overexpression or SP1 silencing alleviated I/R-induced neuroinflammation and cell apoptosis, and improved Tarlov scores, whereas pretreatment with miR-128-3p inhibitor aggravated the above injuries.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Overexpression of miR-128-3p protects neurons from neuroinflammation and apoptosis during spinal cord I/R injury partially by downregulating SP1.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Brainstem-mediated functions are impaired in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Atrophy can be visualized by MRI. This study investigates extrinsic sources of brainstem volume variability, intrinsic sources of anatomical variability, and the influence of age and sex on the brainstem volumes in healthy subjects. We aimed to develop efficient normalization strategies to reduce the effects of intrinsic anatomic variability on brainstem volumetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Brainstem segmentation was performed from MPRAGE data using our deep-learning-based brainstem segmentation algorithm MD-GRU. The extrinsic variability of brainstem volume assessments across scanners and protocols was investigated in two groups comprising 11 (median age 33.3 years, 7 women) and 22 healthy subjects (median age 27.6 years, 50% women) scanned twice and compared using Dice scores. Intrinsic anatomical inter-individual variability and age and sex effects on brainstem volumes were assessed in segmentations of 110 healthy subjects (median age 30.9 years, range 18–72 years, 53.6% women) acquired on 1.5T (45%) and 3T (55%) scanners. The association between brainstem volumes and predefined anatomical covariates was studied using Pearson correlations. Anatomical variables with associations of |r| &amp;gt; 0.30 as well as the variables age and sex were used to construct normalization models using backward selection. The effect of the resulting normalization models was assessed by % relative standard deviation reduction and by comparing the inter-individual variability of the normalized brainstem volumes to the non-normalized values using paired t- tests with Bonferroni correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The extrinsic variability of brainstem volumetry across different field strengths and imaging protocols was low (Dice scores &amp;gt; 0.94). Mean inter-individual variability/SD of total brainstem volumes was 9.8%/7.36. A normalization based on either total intracranial volume (TICV), TICV and age, or v-scale significantly reduced the inter-individual variability of total brainstem volumes compared to non-normalized volumes and similarly reduced the relative standard deviation by about 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The extrinsic variability of the novel brainstem segmentation method MD-GRU across different scanners and imaging protocols is very low. Anatomic inter-individual variability of brainstem volumes is substantial. This study presents efficient normalization models for variability reduction in brainstem volumetry in healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease is associated with the cerebral accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The progressive occurrence of tau aggregates in different brain regions is closely related to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. However, our current understanding of tau propagation relies almost exclusively on postmortem histopathology, and the precise propagation dynamics of misfolded tau in the living brain remain poorly understood. Here we combine longitudinal positron emission tomography and dynamic network modeling to test the hypothesis that misfolded tau propagates preferably along neuronal connections. We follow 46 subjects for three or four annual positron emission tomography scans and compare their pathological tau profiles against brain network models of intracellular and extracellular spreading. For each subject, we identify a personalized set of model parameters that characterizes the individual progression of pathological tau. Across all subjects, the mean protein production rate was 0.21 ± 0.15 and the intracellular diffusion coefficient was 0.34 ± 0.43. Our network diffusion model can serve as a tool to detect non-clinical symptoms at an earlier stage and make informed predictions about the timeline of neurodegeneration on an individual personalized basis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In studies of cognitive neuroscience, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is widely used as it offers richer information than traditional univariate analysis. Representational similarity analysis (RSA), as one method of MVPA, has become an effective decoding method based on neural data by calculating the similarity between different representations in the brain under different conditions. Moreover, RSA is suitable for researchers to compare data from different modalities and even bridge data from different species. However, previous toolboxes have been made to fit specific datasets. Here, we develop NeuroRA, a novel and easy-to-use toolbox for representational analysis. Our toolbox aims at conducting cross-modal data analysis from multi-modal neural data (e.g., EEG, MEG, fNIRS, fMRI, and other sources of neruroelectrophysiological data), behavioral data, and computer-simulated data. Compared with previous software packages, our toolbox is more comprehensive and powerful. Using NeuroRA, users can not only calculate the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), which reflects the representational similarity among different task conditions and conduct a representational analysis among different RDMs to achieve a cross-modal comparison. Besides, users can calculate neural pattern similarity (NPS), spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS), and inter-subject correlation (ISC) with this toolbox. NeuroRA also provides users with functions performing statistical analysis, storage, and visualization of results. We introduce the structure, modules, features, and algorithms of NeuroRA in this paper, as well as examples applying the toolbox in published datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We found that phase cone clustering patterns in EEG ripple bands demonstrate an increased turnover rate in epileptogenic zones compared to adjacent regions. We employed 256 channel EEG data collected in four adult subjects with refractory epilepsy. The analysis was performed in the 80–150 and 150–250 Hz ranges. Ictal onsets were documented with intracranial EEG recordings. Interictal scalp recordings, free of epileptiform patterns, of 240-s duration, were selected for analysis for each subject. The data was filtered, and the instantaneous phase was extracted after the Hilbert transformation. Spatiotemporal contour plots of the unwrapped instantaneous phase with 1.0 ms intervals were constructed using a montage layout of the 256 electrode positions. Stable phase cone patterns were selected based on criteria that the sign of spatial gradient did not change for a minimum of three consecutive time samples and the frame velocity was consistent with known propagation velocities of cortical axons. These plots exhibited increased dynamical formation and dissolution of phase cones in the ictal onset zones, compared to surrounding cortical regions, in all four patients. We believe that these findings represent markers of abnormally increased cortical excitability. They are potential tools that may assist in localizing the epileptogenic zone.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Modulating connectivity measures in EEG-based neurofeedback studies is assumed to be a promising therapeutic and training tool. However, little is known so far about its effects and trainability. In the present study, we investigated the effects of up- and down-regulating SMR (12–15 Hz) coherence by means of neurofeedback training on EEG activity and memory functions. Twenty adults performed 10 neurofeedback training sessions in which half of them tried to increase EEG coherence between Cz and CPz in the SMR frequency range, while the other half tried to down-regulate coherence. Up-regulation of SMR coherence led to between- and within-session changes in EEG coherence. SMR power increased across neurofeedback training sessions but not within training sessions. Cross-over training effects on baseline EEG measures were also observed in this group. Up-regulation of SMR coherence was also associated with improvements in memory functions when comparing pre- and post-test results. Participants were not able to down-regulate SMR coherence. This group did not show any changes in baseline EEG measures or memory functions comparing pre- and post-test. Our results provide insights in the trainability and effects of connectivity-based neurofeedback training and indications for its practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a neuroimaging technique that may be useful for non-invasive mapping of brain temperature (i.e., thermometry) over a large brain volume. To date, intra-subject reproducibility of MRSI-based brain temperature (MRSI-t) has not been investigated. The objective of this repeated measures MRSI-t study was to establish intra-subject reproducibility and repeatability of brain temperature, as well as typical brain temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Healthy participants aged 23–46 years (N = 18; 7 females) were scanned at two time points ~12-weeks apart. Volumetric MRSI data were processed by reconstructing metabolite and water images using parametric spectral analysis. Brain temperature was derived using the frequency difference between water and creatine (T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt;) for 47 regions of interest (ROIs) delineated by the modified Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Reproducibility was measured using the coefficient of variation for repeated measures (COVrep), and repeatability was determined using the standard error of measurement (SEM). For each region, the upper and lower bounds of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were established to characterize the typical range of T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean global brain temperature over all subjects was 37.2°C with spatial variations across ROIs. There was a significant main effect for time [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 37.0, p &amp;lt; 0.0001] and for brain region [F&lt;sub&gt;(46, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.66, p &amp;lt; 0.0001]. The time&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;brain region interaction was not significant [F&lt;sub&gt;(46, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.80, p = 0.83]. Participants' T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; was stable for each ROI across both time points, with ROIs' COVrep ranging from 0.81 to 3.08% (mean COVrep = 1.92%); majority of ROIs had a COVrep &amp;lt;2.0%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Brain temperature measurements were highly consistent between both time points, indicating high reproducibility and repeatability of MRSI-t. MRSI-t may be a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool for non-invasively monitoring brain temperature changes in health and disease. However, further studies of healthy participants with larger sample size(s) and numerous repeated acquisitions are imperative for establishing a reference range of typical brain T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the threshold above which T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; is likely pathological.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aphasia is an acquired impairment of language functions resulting from a brain lesion. It is usually accompanied by deficits in non-linguistic cognitive processes. This study aimed to investigate in patients with aphasia the complex interrelationships between selected cognitive functions: auditory speech comprehension, working memory (WM), and temporal information processing (TIP) in the millisecond time range. Thirty right-handed subjects (20 males) aged from 27 to 82 years suffering from post-stroke aphasia participated in the study. Verbal working memory (VWM) and spatial working memory (SWM) were assessed with: (1) a receptive verbal test and (2) the Corsi Block-Tapping Test, respectively. Both these WM tests used the forward tasks (mainly engaging maintenance processes, i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching information) and backward tasks (engaging both maintenance and manipulation processes, i.e., reordering and updating information). Auditory comprehension was assessed by receptive language tests, and TIP efficiency was assessed by auditory perception of temporal order in the millisecond time range. We observed better performance of forward WM tasks than backward ones, independently of the type of material used. Furthermore, the severity of auditory comprehension impairment correlated with the efficiency on both forward and backward VWM tasks and the backward SWM task. Further analysis revealed that TIP plays a crucial role only in the latter task. These results indicate the divergent pattern of interactions between WM and TIP depending on the type of WM tasks. Level of verbal competency appeared to play an important role in both VWM tasks, whereas TIP (which is associated with manipulation processes) appeared to be important for SWM, but only on the backward task.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Adaptation can optimize information processing by allowing the visual system to always adjust to the environment. However, only a few studies have investigated how the visual system makes adjustments to repeatedly occurring changes in the input, still less about the related neural mechanism. Our previous study found that contrast adaptation attenuated after multiple daily sessions of repeated adaptation, which was explained by the habituation of either the adapter’s effective strength or the adaptation mechanisms. To examine the former hypothesis, in the present study we used the frequency tagging technique to measure the adapter-elicited steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) amplitudes. Participants repeatedly adapted to the same contrast adapter in a top-up manner for six continuous days, which was called training of adaptation. The behavioral adaptation effect and SSVEP response to the trained adapter and an untrained control adapter were measured before and after training. The psychophysical results showed that the effect of adaptation in the trained condition significantly reduced after training, replicating our previous finding. Contradicting the prediction of the hypothesis that repeated adaptation attenuated the effective strength of the adapter, the SSVEP amplitude was unchanged after training, which was further confirmed by an equivalence test. Taken together, the results challenge the account of habituation of adapter in repeated adaptation, while leaving the account of habituation of adaptation mechanism to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Numerical inductive reasoning has been considered as one of the most important higher cognitive functions of the human brain. Importantly, previous behavioral studies have consistently reported that one critical component of numerical inductive reasoning is checking, which often occurs when a discrepant element is discovered, and reprocessing is needed to determine whether the discrepancy is an error of the original series. However, less is known about the neural mechanism underlying the checking process. Given that the checking effect involves cognitive control processes, such as the incongruent resolution, that are linked to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), this study hypothesizes that the right DLPFC may play a specific role in the checking process. To test the hypothesis, this study utilized the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation method that could modulate cortical excitability, and examined whether and how the stimulation of the right DLPFC via tDCS could modulate the checking effect during a number-series completion problem task. Ninety healthy participants were allocated to one of the anodal, cathodal, and sham groups. Subjects were required to verify whether number sequences formed rule-based series, and checking effect was assessed by the difference in performance between invalid and valid conditions. It was found that significantly longer response times (RTs) were exhibited in invalid condition compared with valid condition in groups of anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS. Furthermore, the anodal tDCS significantly shortened the checking effect than those of the cathodal and sham groups, whereas no significantly prolonged checking effect was detected in the cathodal group. The current findings indicated that anodal tDCS affected the process of checking, which suggested that the right DLPFC might play a critical role in the checking process of numerical inductive reasoning by inhibiting incongruent response.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Humans learn motor skills (MSs) through practice and experience and may then retain them for recruitment, which is effective as a rapid response for novel contexts. For an MS to be recruited for novel contexts, its recruitment range must be extended. In addressing this issue, we hypothesized that an MS is dynamically modulated according to the feedback context to expand its recruitment range into novel contexts, which do not involve the learning of an MS. The following two sub-issues are considered. We previously demonstrated that the learned MS could be recruited in novel contexts through its modulation, which is driven by dynamically regulating the synergistic redundancy between muscles according to the feedback context. However, this modulation is trained in the dynamics under the MS learning context. Learning an MS in a specific condition naturally causes movement deviation from the desired state when the MS is executed in a novel context. We hypothesized that this deviation can be reduced with the additional modulation of an MS, which tunes the MS-produced muscle activities by using the feedback gain signals driven by the deviation from the desired state. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a feedback gain signal-driven tuning model of a learned MS for its robust recruitment. This model is based on the neurophysiological architecture in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, in which an MS is plausibly retained as it was learned and is then recruited by tuning its muscle control signals according to the feedback context. In this study, through computational simulation, we show that the proposed model may be used to neurophysiologically describe the recruitment of a learned MS in novel contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The mechanisms involved in generation of rhythmic locomotor activity in the mammalian spinal cord remain poorly understood. These mechanisms supposedly rely on both intrinsic properties of constituting neurons and interactions between them. A subset of Shox2 neurons was suggested to contribute to generation of spinal locomotor activity, but the possible cellular basis for rhythmic bursting in these neurons remains unknown. Ha and Dougherty (2018) recently revealed the presence of bidirectional electrical coupling between Shox2 neurons in neonatal spinal cords, which can be critically involved in neuronal synchronization and generation of populational bursting. Gap junctional connections found between functionally-related Shox2 interneurons decrease with age, possibly being replaced by increasing interactions through chemical synapses. Here, we developed a computational model of a heterogeneous population of neurons sparsely connected by electrical or/and chemical synapses and investigated the dependence of frequency of populational bursting on the type and strength of neuronal interconnections. The model proposes a mechanistic explanation that can account for the emergence of a synchronized rhythmic activity in the neuronal population and provides insights into the possible role of gap junctional coupling between Shox2 neurons in the spinal mechanisms for locomotor rhythm generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Krabbe's disease (KD) is primarily a demyelinating disorder, but recent studies have identified the presence of neuronal protein aggregates in the brain, at least partially composed by alpha-synuclein (α-syn). The role of this protein aggregation in the pathogenesis of KD is largely unknown, but it has added KD to a growing list of lysosomal storage diseases that can be also be considered as proteinopathies. While the presence of these protein aggregates within the KD brain is now appreciated, the remainder of the central nervous system (CNS) remains uncharacterized. This study is the first to report the presence of thioflavin-S reactive inclusions throughout the spinal cord of both murine and human spinal tissue. Stereological analysis revealed the temporal and spatial accumulation of these inclusions within the neurons of the ventral spinal cord vs. those located in the dorsal cord. This study also confirmed that these thio-S positive accumulations are present within neuronal populations and are made up at least in part by α-syn in both the twitcher mouse and cord autopsied material from affected human patients. Significantly, neonatal gene therapy for galactosylceramidase, a treatment that strongly improves the survival and health of KD mice, but not bone marrow transplantation prevents the formation of these inclusions in spinal neurons. These results expand the understanding of α-syn protein aggregation within the CNS of individuals afflicted with KD and underlines the tractability of this problem via early gene therapy, with potential impact to other synucleinopathies such as PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Chronic tear deficiency enhances the excitability of corneal cold-sensitive nerves that detect ocular dryness, which can lead to discomfort in patients with dry eye disease (DED). However, changes in corneal nerve excitations through the polymodal nociceptor “transient receptor potential vanilloid 1” (TRPV1) and the potential link between this receptor and symptoms of DED remain unclear. In this study, we examined the firing properties of corneal cold-sensitive nerves expressing TRPV1 and possible contributions of chronic tear deficiency to corneal nerve excitability by TRPV1 activation. The bilateral excision of lacrimal glands in guinea pigs decreased the tear volume and increased the frequency of spontaneous eyeblinks 1–4 weeks after surgery. An analysis of the firing properties of the cold-sensitive nerves was performed by single-unit recordings of corneal preparations 4 weeks after surgery in both the sham-operated and gland-excised groups. Perfusion of the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin (1 μM), transiently increased the firing frequency in approximately 46–48% of the cold-sensitive nerves characterized by low-background activity and high threshold (LB-HT) cold thermoreceptors in both groups. Gland excision significantly decreased the latency of capsaicin-induced firing in cold-sensitive nerves; however, its magnitude was unchanged. Calcium imaging of cultured trigeminal ganglion neurons from both groups showed that intracellular calcium elevation of corneal neurons induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.03 μM) was significantly larger in the gland excision group, regardless of responsiveness to cold. An immunohistochemical study of the trigeminal ganglion revealed that gland excision significantly increased the proportion of corneal neurons enclosed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunopositive satellite glial cells. Topical application of the TRPV1 antagonist, A784168 (30 μM), on the ocular surface attenuated eye-blink frequency after gland excision. Furthermore, gland excision enhanced blink behavior induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.1 μM). These results suggest that chronic tear deficiency sensitizes the TRPV1-mediated response in the corneal LB-HT cold thermoreceptors and cold-insensitive polymodal nociceptors, which may be linked to dry eye discomfort and hyperalgesia resulting from nociceptive stimuli in aqueous-deficient dry eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of necrotic cell death characterized by its dependency on iron and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis has attracted much attention recently in the area of neurodegeneration since the involvement of ferroptosis in Parkinson’s disease (PD), a major neurodegenerative disease, has been indicated using animal models. Although PD is associated with both genetic and environmental factors, sporadic forms of PD account for more than 90% of total PD. Following the importance of environmental factors, various neurotoxins are used as chemical inducers of PD both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases (AD and HD), many of the characteristics of PD can be reproduced in vivo by the use of specific neurotoxins. Given the indication of ferroptosis in PD pathology, several studies have been conducted to examine whether ferroptosis plays role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. However, there are still few reports showing an authentic form of ferroptosis in neuronal cells during exposure to the neurotoxins used as PD inducers. In this review article, we summarize the history of the uses of chemicals to create PD models in vivo and in vitro. Besides, we also survey recent reports examining the possible involvement of ferroptosis in chemical models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The aging process causes many changes to the brain and is a major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Despite an already vast amount of research on AD, a greater understanding of the disease's pathology and therapeutic options are desperately needed. One important distinction that is also in need of further study is the ability to distinguish changes to the brain observed in early stages of AD vs. changes that occur with normal aging. Current FDA-approved therapeutic options for AD patients have proven to be ineffective and indicate the need for alternative therapies. Aging interventions including alterations in diet (such as caloric restriction, fasting, or methionine restriction) have been shown to be effective in mediating increased health and lifespan in mice and other model organisms. Because aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, certain dietary interventions should be explored as they have the potential to act as a future treatment option for AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of neurodegenerative dementia. Yet, the domain-specific cognitive impairment of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase of this disease (DLB-MCI) is still not been established. This article gives an updated review on the neuropsychological profile of DLB-MCI, building on the findings from a previous review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed systematic review and searched five different electronic databases (Scopus, Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) in May 2020 based on a PICO scheme. Our search was then restricted to articles published in 2019 and 2020. Ending up with a total of 90 articles to be reviewed by abstract and/or full text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total four papers were included, whereof only one met our full inclusion criteria. Despite a substantial heterogeneity, our findings indicate that DLB-MCI patients have a pattern of executive, visuospatial, and attentional deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The findings indicate that the neuropsychological profile of DLB-MCI is characterized by executive, visuospatial, and attentional deficits. Furthermore, the shortage of studies clearly underlines the paucity of published research into DLB-MCI and emphasizes the need for well-controlled studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although seizures are common in prehospital settings, standardized emergency medical services (EMS) treatment algorithms do not exist nationally. We examined nationwide variability in status epilepticus treatment by analyzing 33 publicly available statewide EMS protocols. All adult protocols recommend intravenous benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 33; lorazepam, n = 23; diazepam, n = 24), 30 recommend intramuscular benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 30; lorazepam, n = 8; diazepam, n = 3), and 27 recommend intranasal benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 27; lorazepam, n = 3); pediatric protocols also frequently recommend rectal diazepam (n = 14). Recommended dosages vary widely, and first‐ and second‐line agents are designated in only 18 and 2 states, respectively. Given this degree of variability, standardized national EMS guidelines are needed. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) comprises several subtypes as defined by genetic and prion protein characteristics, which are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. To date, no clinical test can reliably diagnose the subtype. We established two procedures for the antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtype using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI of 1,458 patients referred to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center were collected through its consultation service. One neuroradiologist blind to the diagnosis scored 12 brain regions and generated a lesion profile for each MRI scan. We selected 487 patients with autopsy‐confirmed diagnosis of “pure” sCJD subtype and at least one positive diffusion MRI examination. We designed and tested two data‐driven procedures for subtype diagnosis: the first procedure—prion subtype classification algorithm with MRI (PriSCA_MRI)—uses only MRI examinations; the second—PriSCA_MRI + Gen—includes knowledge of the prion protein codon 129 genotype, a major determinant of sCJD subtypes. Both procedures were tested on the first MRI and the last MRI follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PriSCA_MRI classified the 3 most prevalent subtypes with 82% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PriSCA_MRI + Gen raised the accuracy to 89% and identified all subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individually, the 2 most prevalent sCJD subtypes, MM1 and VV2, were diagnosed with sensitivities up to 95 and 97%, respectively. The performances of both procedures did not change in 168 patients with longitudinal MRI studies when the last examination was used.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first practical algorithms for antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtypes. MRI diagnosis of subtype is likely to be attainable at early disease stages to prognosticate clinical course and design future therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds, many which can have antibiotic, antiviral, or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes. Natural product classes include polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V. The 2D structure of the new RiPP, which we name pristinin A3 (1), was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and chemical labeling. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bknPhbPA6VM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Primordial follicle assembly in the mouse occurs during perinatal ages and largely determines the ovarian reserve that will be available to support the reproductive life span. The development of primordial follicles is controlled by a complex network of interactions between oocytes and ovarian somatic cells that remain poorly understood. In the present research, using single-cell RNA sequencing performed over a time series on murine ovaries, coupled with several bioinformatics analyses, the complete dynamic genetic programs of germ and granulosa cells from E16.5 to postnatal day (PD) 3 were reported. Along with confirming the previously reported expression of genes by germ cells and granulosa cells, our analyses identified 5 distinct cell clusters associated with germ cells and 6 with granulosa cells. Consequently, several new genes expressed at significant levels at each investigated stage were assigned. By building single-cell pseudotemporal trajectories, 3 states and 1 branch point of fate transition for the germ cells were revealed, as well as for the granulosa cells. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment enabled identification of the biological process most represented in germ cells and granulosa cells or common to both cell types at each specific stage, and the interactions of germ cells and granulosa cells basing on known and novel pathway were presented. Finally, by using single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) algorithm, we were able to establish a network of regulons that can be postulated as likely candidates for sustaining germ cell-specific transcription programs throughout the period of investigation. Above all, this study provides the whole transcriptome landscape of ovarian cells and unearths new insights during primordial follicle assembly in mice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iFIJU6CdENw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis maintains tissue oxygen supply and protects against ischemia but also enhances tumor progression and malignancy. This is mediated through activation of transcription factors like hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and c-Myc, yet the impact of hypoxia on negative regulators of angiogenesis is unknown. During vascular development, seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) regulates angiogenesis through a novel mechanism by counteracting c-Myc and transcriptionally repressing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression. Here, we reveal that the transcriptional repressor role of SerRS is inactivated under hypoxia through phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at Ser101 and Ser241 to attenuate its DNA binding capacity. In zebrafish, SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101D/S241D&lt;/sup&gt;, a phosphorylation-mimicry mutant, cannot suppress VEGFA expression to support normal vascular development. Moreover, expression of SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101A/S241A&lt;/sup&gt;, a phosphorylation-deficient and constitutively active mutant, prevents hypoxia-induced binding of c-Myc and HIF-1 to the &lt;i&gt;VEGFA&lt;/i&gt; promoter, and activation of VEGFA expression. Consistently, SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101A/S241A&lt;/sup&gt; strongly inhibits normal and tumor-derived angiogenesis in mice. Therefore, we reveal a key step regulating hypoxic angiogenesis and highlight the importance of nuclear SerRS in post-developmental angiogenesis regulation in addition to vascular development. The role of nuclear SerRS in inhibiting both c-Myc and HIF-1 may provide therapeutic opportunities to correct dysregulation of angiogenesis in pathological settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rZ9l5M1hOJk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Computational protein design is rapidly becoming more powerful, and improving the accuracy of computational methods would greatly streamline protein engineering by eliminating the need for empirical optimization in the laboratory. In this work, we set out to design novel granulopoietic agents using a rescaffolding strategy with the goal of achieving simpler and more stable proteins. All of the 4 experimentally tested designs were folded, monomeric, and stable, while the 2 determined structures agreed with the design models within less than 2.5 Å. Despite the lack of significant topological or sequence similarity to their natural granulopoietic counterpart, 2 designs bound to the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor and exhibited potent, but delayed, in vitro proliferative activity in a G-CSF-dependent cell line. Interestingly, the designs also induced proliferation and differentiation of primary human hematopoietic stem cells into mature granulocytes, highlighting the utility of our approach to develop highly active therapeutic leads purely based on computational design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4g376v1rJ3I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Neurons extend long axons that require maintenance and are susceptible to degeneration. Long-term integrity of axons depends on intrinsic mechanisms including axonal transport and extrinsic support from adjacent glial cells. The mechanisms of support provided by myelinating oligodendrocytes to underlying axons are only partly understood. Oligodendrocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) with properties of exosomes, which upon delivery to neurons improve neuronal viability in vitro. Here, we show that oligodendroglial exosome secretion is impaired in 2 mouse mutants exhibiting secondary axonal degeneration due to oligodendrocyte-specific gene defects. Wild-type oligodendroglial exosomes support neurons by improving the metabolic state and promoting axonal transport in nutrient-deprived neurons. Mutant oligodendrocytes release fewer exosomes, which share a common signature of underrepresented proteins. Notably, mutant exosomes lack the ability to support nutrient-deprived neurons and to promote axonal transport. Together, these findings indicate that glia-to-neuron exosome transfer promotes neuronal long-term maintenance by facilitating axonal transport, providing a novel mechanistic link between myelin diseases and secondary loss of axonal integrity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Ph2iKJtdsn8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young and aged male and female C57BL/6J mice. We found age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA, and CD36 protein differed by region, age, and sex and was primarily expressed intravascularly. These variations may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition, while CD36 deficiency is associated with restored cerebrovascular function in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Yet the distribution of CD36 has not been examined in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young, middle aged, aged, and elderly male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA expression were observed in the male hippocampus and female midbrain. Additionally, male mice had greater CD36 mRNA expression than females in the striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. CD36 protein was primarily expressed intravascularly, and this expression differed by region, age, and sex in the mouse brain. Although male mice brains demonstrated an increase in CD36 protein with age in several cortices, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain, a decrease with age was observed in female mice in the same regions. These data suggest that distinctive age, region, and sex expression of CD36 in the brain may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain's endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems are neuromodulatory of synaptic transmission, and play key roles in pain, memory, reward, and addiction. Recent clinical and pre‐clinical evidence suggests that opioid use may be reduced with cannabinoid intake. This suggests the presence of a functional interaction between these two systems. Emerging research indicates that cannabinoids and opioids can functionally interact at different levels. At the cellular level, opioid and cannabinoids can have direct receptor associations, alterations in endogenous opioid peptide or cannabinoid release, or post‐receptor activation interactions via shared signal transduction pathways. At the systems level, the nature of cannabinoid and opioid interaction might differ in brain circuits underlying different behavioral phenomenon, including reward‐seeking or antinociception. Given the rising use of opioid and cannabinoid drugs, a better understanding of how these endogenous signaling systems interact in the brain is of significant interest. This review focuses on the potential relationship of these neural systems in addiction‐related processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with no cure and preventive therapy. Misfolding and extracellular aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are recognized as the main cause of AD progression, leading to the formation of toxic Aβ oligomers and to the deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the brain, representing the hallmarks of AD. Given the urgent need to provide alternative therapies, natural products serve as vital resources for novel drugs. In recent years, several natural compounds with different chemical structures, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and vitamins from plants have received attention for their role against the neurodegenerative pathological processes. However, only for a small subset of them experimental evidences are provided on their mechanism of action. This review focuses on those natural compounds shown to interfere with Aβ aggregation by direct interaction with Aβ peptide and whose inhibitory mechanism has been investigated by means of biophysical and structural biology experimental approaches. In few cases, the combination of approaches offering a macroscopic characterization of the oligomers, such as TEM, AFM, fluorescence, together with high-resolution methods could shed light on the complex mechanism of inhibition. In particular, solution NMR spectroscopy, through peptide-based and ligand-based observation, was successfully employed to investigate the interactions of the natural compounds with both soluble NMR-visible (monomer and low molecular weight oligomers) and NMR-invisible (high molecular weight oligomers and protofibrils) species. The molecular determinants of the interaction of promising natural compounds are here compared to infer the chemical requirements of the inhibitors and the common mechanisms of inhibition. Most of the data converge to indicate that the Aβ regions relevant to perturb the aggregation cascade and regulate the toxicity of the stabilized oligomers, are the N-term and β1 region. The ability of the natural aggregation inhibitors to cross the brain blood barrier, together with the tactics to improve their low bioavailability are discussed. The analysis of the data ensemble can provide a rationale for the selection of natural compounds as molecular scaffolds for the design of new therapeutic strategies against the progression of early and late stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration of the central and enteric nervous systems is a common feature of aging and aging-related diseases, and is accelerated in individuals with metabolic dysfunction including obesity and diabetes. The molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in both the CNS and ENS are overlapping. Sirtuins are an important family of histone deacetylases that are important for genome stability, cellular response to stress, and nutrient and hormone sensing. They are activated by calorie restriction (CR) and by the coenzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Sirtuins, specifically the nuclear SIRT1 and mitochondrial SIRT3, have been shown to have predominantly neuroprotective roles in the CNS while the cytoplasmic sirtuin, SIRT2 is largely associated with neurodegeneration. A systematic study of sirtuins in the ENS and their effect on enteric neuronal growth and survival has not been conducted. Recent studies, however, also link sirtuins with important hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, melatonin, and serotonin which influence many important processes including satiety, mood, circadian rhythm, and gut homeostasis. In this review, we address emerging roles of sirtuins in modulating the metabolic challenges from aging, obesity, and diabetes that lead to neurodegeneration in the ENS and CNS. We also highlight a novel role for sirtuins along the microbiota-gut-brain axis in modulating neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We present a fully convolutional neural network (ConvNet), named RatLesNetv2, for segmenting lesions in rodent magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. RatLesNetv2 architecture resembles an autoencoder and it incorporates residual blocks that facilitate its optimization. RatLesNetv2 is trained end to end on three-dimensional images and it requires no preprocessing. We evaluated RatLesNetv2 on an exceptionally large dataset composed of 916 T2-weighted rat brain MRI scans of 671 rats at nine different lesion stages that were used to study focal cerebral ischemia for drug development. In addition, we compared its performance with three other ConvNets specifically designed for medical image segmentation. RatLesNetv2 obtained similar to higher Dice coefficient values than the other ConvNets and it produced much more realistic and compact segmentations with notably fewer holes and lower Hausdorff distance. The Dice scores of RatLesNetv2 segmentations also exceeded inter-rater agreement of manual segmentations. In conclusion, RatLesNetv2 could be used for automated lesion segmentation, reducing human workload and improving reproducibility. RatLesNetv2 is publicly available at https://github.com/jmlipman/RatLesNetv2.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Noise has been proven to have a beneficial role in non-linear systems, including the human brain, based on the stochastic resonance (SR) theory. Several studies have been implemented on single-modal SR. Cross-modal SR phenomenon has been confirmed in different human sensory systems. In our study, a cross-modal SR enhanced brain–computer interface (BCI) was proposed by applying auditory noise to visual stimuli. Fast Fourier transform and canonical correlation analysis methods were used to evaluate the influence of noise, results of which indicated that a moderate amount of auditory noise could enhance periodic components in visual responses. Directed transfer function was applied to investigate the functional connectivity patterns, and the flow gain value was used to measure the degree of activation of specific brain regions in the information transmission process. The results of flow gain maps showed that moderate intensity of auditory noise activated the brain area to a greater extent. Further analysis by weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) revealed that the phase synchronization between visual and auditory regions under auditory noise was significantly enhanced. Our study confirms the existence of cross-modal SR between visual and auditory regions and achieves a higher accuracy for recognition, along with shorter time window length. Such findings can be used to improve the performance of visual BCIs to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Adapted exercise is an effective non-pharmacological tool to improve functional, cognitive, and psychological parameters in multiple sclerosis (MS), in association with increased quality of life (QoL) and decreased disease severity. Adipose tissue, through the production of different adipokines, is involved in regulating energy metabolism and inflammation. Adiponectin, increased in MS, circulates as oligomers of low (LMW), medium (MMW), and high molecular weight (HMW), the latter mediating the main biological effects. The aim of study was to evaluate the effects of 4 months training at moderate intensity [65% heart rate reserve (HRR)] on BMI, adiponectin, and QoL in a volunteer with secondary progressive MS. The parameters were evaluated before (T0), after 4 months training (T1), and 6 months after the end of training (T2); total serum adiponectin and its oligomeric profile were evaluated. We found a reduction in BMI (−0.9%) and FAT (−2.6%), an improvement in perceived QoL and a reduced expression of total adiponectin and HMW oligomers together with decreased MS disability level at T1 measured by EDSS. Despite the limitations of a case study, this represent a starting point to understand the influence of exercise in MS and the relationship with adiponectin expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) source reconstruction estimates spatial information from the brain’s electrical activity acquired using EEG. This method requires accurate identification of the EEG electrodes in a three-dimensional (3D) space and involves spatial localization and labeling of EEG electrodes. Here, we propose a new approach to tackle this two-step problem based on the simultaneous acquisition of EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the step of spatial localization of electrodes, we extract the electrode coordinates from the curvature of the protrusions formed in the high-resolution T1-weighted brain scans. In the next step, we assign labels to each electrode based on the distinguishing feature of the electrode’s distance profile in relation to other electrodes. We then compare the subject’s electrode data with template-based models of prelabeled distance profiles of correctly labeled subjects. Based on this approach, we could localize EEG electrodes in 26 head models with over 90% accuracy in the 3D localization of electrodes. Next, we performed electrode labeling of the subjects’ data with progressive improvements in accuracy: with ∼58% accuracy based on a single EEG-template, with ∼71% accuracy based on 3 EEG-templates, and with ∼76% accuracy using 5 EEG-templates. The proposed semi-automated method provides a simple alternative for the rapid localization and labeling of electrodes without the requirement of any additional equipment than what is already used in an EEG-fMRI setup.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In this study, voluntary and involuntary visual attention focused on different interpretations of a bistable image, were investigated using magnetoencephalography (MEG). A Necker cube with sinusoidally modulated pixels' intensity in the front and rear faces with frequencies 6.67 Hz (60/9) and 8.57 Hz (60/7), respectively, was presented to 12 healthy volunteers, who interpreted the cube as either left- or right-oriented. The tags of these frequencies and their second harmonics were identified in the average Fourier spectra of the MEG data recorded from the visual cortex. In the first part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to voluntarily control their attention by interpreting the cube orientation as either being on the left or right. Accordingly, we observed the dominance of the corresponding spectral component, and voluntary attention performance was measured. In the second part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to focus their gaze on a red marker at the center of the cube image without putting forth effort in its interpretation. The alternation of the dominant spectral energies at the second harmonics of the stimulation frequencies was treated as changes in the cube orientation. Based on the results of the first experimental stage and using a wavelet analysis, we developed a method which allowed us to identify the currently perceived cube orientation. Finally, we characterized involuntary attention using the distribution of dominance times when focusing attention on one of the cube orientations, which was related to voluntary attention performance and brain noise. In particular, we confirmed our hypothesis that higher attention performance is associated with stronger brain noise.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) theory predicts that [coronal] is the language universal default place of articulation for phonemes. This assumption has been consistently supported with adult behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data; however, this underspecification claim has not been tested in developmental populations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether children demonstrate [coronal] underspecification patterns similar to those of adults. Two English consonants differing in place of articulation, [labial] /b/ and [coronal] /d/, were presented to 24 children (ages 4–6 years) characterized by either a typically developing phonological system (TD) or a phonological disorder (PD). Two syllables, /bɑ/ and /dɑ/, were presented in an ERP oddball paradigm where both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Underspecification was examined with three analyses: traditional mean amplitude measurements, cluster-based permutation tests, and single-trial general linear model (GLM) analyses of single-subject data. Contrary to previous adult findings, children with PD demonstrated a large positive mismatch response (PMR) to /bɑ/ while the children with TD exhibited a negative mismatch response (MMN); significant group differences were not observed in the /dɑ/ responses. Moreover, the /bɑ/ deviant ERP response was significantly larger in the TD children than in the children with PD. At the single-subject level, more children demonstrated mismatch responses to /dɑ/ than to /bɑ/, though some children had a /bɑ/ mismatch response and no /dɑ/ mismatch response. While both groups of children demonstrated similar responses to the underspecified /dɑ/, their neural responses to the more specified /bɑ/ varied. These findings are interpreted within a proposed developmental model of phonological underspecification, wherein children with PD are functioning at a developmentally less mature stage of phonological acquisition than their same-aged TD peers. Thus, phonological underspecification is a phenomenon that likely develops over time with experience and exposure to language.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Experiments in animal models have shown that running increases neuronal activity in early visual areas in light as well as in darkness. This suggests that visual processing is influenced by locomotion independent of visual input. Combining mobile electroencephalography, motion- and eye-tracking, we investigated the influence of overground free walking on cortical alpha activity (~10 Hz) and eye movements in healthy humans. Alpha activity has been considered a valuable marker of inhibition of sensory processing and shown to negatively correlate with neuronal firing rates. We found that walking led to a decrease in alpha activity over occipital cortex compared to standing. This decrease was present during walking in darkness as well as during light. Importantly, eye movements could not explain the change in alpha activity. Nevertheless, we found that walking and eye related movements were linked. While the blink rate increased with increasing walking speed independent of light or darkness, saccade rate was only significantly linked to walking speed in the light. Pupil size, on the other hand, was larger during darkness than during light, but only showed a modulation by walking in darkness. Analyzing the effect of walking with respect to the stride cycle, we further found that blinks and saccades preferentially occurred during the double support phase of walking. Alpha power, as shown previously, was lower during the swing phase than during the double support phase. We however could exclude the possibility that the alpha modulation was introduced by a walking movement induced change in electrode impedance. Overall, our work indicates that the human visual system is influenced by the current locomotion state of the body. This influence affects eye movement pattern as well as neuronal activity in sensory areas and might form part of an implicit strategy to optimally extract sensory information during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The question of whether artificial beings or machines could become self-aware or conscious has been a philosophical question for centuries. The main problem is that self-awareness cannot be observed from an outside perspective and the distinction of being really self-aware or merely a clever imitation cannot be answered without access to knowledge about the mechanism's inner workings. We investigate common machine learning approaches with respect to their potential ability to become self-aware. We realize that many important algorithmic steps toward machines with a core consciousness have already been taken.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A common feature of the primary processing structures of sensory systems is the presence of parallel output “channels” that convey different information about a stimulus. In the mammalian olfactory bulb, this is reflected in the mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) that have differing sensitivities to odors, with TCs being more sensitive than MCs. In this study, we examined potential mechanisms underlying the different responses of MCs vs. TCs. For TCs, we focused on superficial TCs (sTCs), which are a population of output TCs that reside in the superficial-most portion of the external plexiform layer, along with external tufted cells (eTCs), which are glutamatergic interneurons in the glomerular layer. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse bulb slices, we first measured excitatory currents in MCs, sTCs, and eTCs following olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) stimulation, separating the responses into a fast, monosynaptic component reflecting direct inputs from OSNs and a prolonged component partially reflecting eTC-mediated feedforward excitation. Responses were measured to a wide range of OSN stimulation intensities, simulating the different levels of OSN activity that would be expected to be produced by varying odor concentrations in vivo. Over a range of stimulation intensities, we found that the monosynaptic current varied significantly between the cell types, in the order of eTC &amp;gt; sTC &amp;gt; MC. The prolonged component was smaller in sTCs vs. both MCs and eTCs. sTCs also had much higher whole-cell input resistances than MCs, reflecting their smaller size and greater membrane resistivity. To evaluate how these different electrophysiological aspects contributed to spiking of the output MCs and sTCs, we used computational modeling. By exchanging the different cell properties in our modeled MCs and sTCs, we could evaluate each property's contribution to spiking differences between these cell types. This analysis suggested that the higher sensitivity of spiking in sTCs vs. MCs reflected both their larger monosynaptic OSN signal as well as their higher input resistance, while their smaller prolonged currents had a modest opposing effect. Taken together, our results indicate that both synaptic and intrinsic cellular features contribute to the production of parallel output channels in the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The inhibitory effect of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00320 (LINC00320) in glioma cell proliferation has been proposed in a recent study. However, the mechanisms by which LINC00320 regulate aquaporin 9 (AQP9) in glioma require further exploration. Hence, this study aims to investigate effects of LINC00320 on tumorigenicity of glioma cells and angiogenesis of microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs). Expression of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma tissues and cells was measured by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The relationship among LINC00320, nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) and AQP9 was examined by RNA immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter gene, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The participation of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma cell proliferation and MVEC angiogenesis was analyzed using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Finally, a nude mouse orthotopic xenograft model of glioma was established to investigate the effects of LINC00320 and AQP9 on glioma growth in vivo. LINC00320 was under-expressed and AQP9 was over-expressed in glioma tissues. Further mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00320 downregulated AQP9 by inhibiting the recruitment of NFKB1 to the promoter region of AQP9. LINC00320 overexpression or AQP9 silencing inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells and angiogenesis of MVECs. Also, upregulation of LINC00320 restrained tumor growth and angiogenesis in xenograft mice by downregulating AQP9. Taken together, LINC00320 acts as a tumor suppressor in glioma, thus presenting a novel therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of dual-task training on cognitive status, physical performance, and brain oscillation of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Twenty-six AD patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the training group (TG) and control group (CG). TG executed progressive combined exercises with visual stimulation twice a week for 12 weeks. Training included muscle endurance, balance, flexibility, and aerobic exercises with eyes closed and opened. Brain oscillation on electroencephalography (EEG) and a series of physical, cognitive, and mental tests were taken before and post-intervention. There was a significant improvement after training protocol in cognitive function, particularly in short-term and working memory, attention, and executive function (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Besides, there were substantial improvements in depression status (GDS scale), aerobic fitness (6 min walking), flexibility (chair sit and reach) functional ability (chair stand, timed up and go test), strength (knee extensions, preacher biceps curl, handgrip) in TG compared to CG. These signs of progress were associated with a significant increase (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the frequency of brain oscillation and a decrease in the theta/alpha ratio. In addition to physical performance, the regular combined training with visual stimulation improves brain health as indicated by improving cognitive function and reducing the theta/alpha ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) https://www.irct.ir/, identifier IRCT20190504043468N1—August 5, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Irisin is a PGC-1α-dependent myokine that causes increased energy expenditure by driving the development of white adipose tissue into brown fat-like tissue. Exercise can improve irisin levels and lead to its release into the blood. In ischemic stroke, neurons are always sensitive to energy supply; after a series of pathophysiological processes, reactive oxygen species that are detrimental to cell survival via mitochondrial dysfunction are generated in large quantities. As a protein associated with exercise, irisin can alleviate brain injury in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. It is thought that irisin can upregulate the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which protects nerve cells from injury during ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the release of irisin into the blood via exercise influences the mitochondrial dynamics crucial to maintaining the normal function of nerve cells. Consequently, we intended to summarize the known effects of irisin during ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify preoperative predictive factors of long‐term motor outcome in a large cohort of consecutive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN‐DBS at the Grenoble University Hospital (France) from 1993 to 2015 were evaluated before surgery, at 1 year (short‐term) and in the long‐term after surgery. All demographic variables, neuroimaging data and clinical characteristics available were collected. Preoperative predictors of long‐term motor outcome were investigated by performing survival and univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses. Loss of motor benefit from stimulation in the long‐term was defined as a reduction lower than 25% of the Movement Disorder Society‐UPDRS (MDS‐UPDRS) part‐III scores compared to the baseline off‐medication scores. As secondary objective, potential predictors of short‐term motor outcome after STN‐DBS were assessed by performing univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long‐term analyses (mean follow‐up: 8.4 ± 6.26 years; median: 10 years, 1–17 range), 138 patients were included. Preoperative higher Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UDPRS part‐III scores predicted a better long‐term motor response to stimulation whereas the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging predicted a worse motor outcome. In 357 patients available with 1‐year follow‐up, preoperative levodopa response, tremor dominant phenotype, baseline Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UPDRS part‐III scores predicted the short‐term motor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobe dysfunction, disease severity in the off‐medication condition and the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging represent the main preoperative clinical predictors of long‐term motor STN‐DBS effects.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Synapse loss is the strongest correlate for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms underlying synapse loss have been extensively investigated using mouse models expressing genes with human familial Alzheimer's disease mutations. In this review, we summarize how multiphoton in vivo imaging has improved our understanding of synapse loss mechanisms associated with excessive amyloid in the living animal brain. We also discuss evidence obtained from these imaging studies for the role of cell-intrinsic calcium dyshomeostasis and cell-extrinsic activities of microglia, which are the immune cells of the brain, in mediating synapse loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a key biomarker of automatic deviance detection thought to emerge from 2 cortical sources. First, the auditory cortex (AC) encodes spectral regularities and reports frequency-specific deviances. Then, more abstract representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) allow to detect contextual changes of potential behavioral relevance. However, the precise location and time asynchronies between neuronal correlates underlying this frontotemporal network remain unclear and elusive. Our study presented auditory oddball paradigms along with “no-repetition” controls to record mismatch responses in neuronal spiking activity and local field potentials at the rat medial PFC. Whereas mismatch responses in the auditory system are mainly induced by stimulus-dependent effects, we found that auditory responsiveness in the PFC was driven by unpredictability, yielding context-dependent, comparatively delayed, more robust and longer-lasting mismatch responses mostly comprised of prediction error signaling activity. This characteristically different composition discarded that mismatch responses in the PFC could be simply inherited or amplified downstream from the auditory system. Conversely, it is more plausible for the PFC to exert top-down influences on the AC, since the PFC exhibited flexible and potent predictive processing, capable of suppressing redundant input more efficiently than the AC. Remarkably, the time course of the mismatch responses we observed in the spiking activity and local field potentials of the AC and the PFC combined coincided with the time course of the large-scale MMN-like signals reported in the rat brain, thereby linking the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic levels of automatic deviance detection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rfwvinIx228&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, leading to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that continues to cause significant global mortality in human populations. Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock, and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus, we demonstrate that, in addition to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the 22 different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat, and cattle were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the 3 genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage to the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and RaTG13 identified distinct tropisms, with the 2 human viruses being more closely aligned. Finally, using bioinformatics, structural data, and targeted mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues within the Spike–ACE2 interface, which may have played a pivotal role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock, and wildlife.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/m8cpZ3EpcOg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Coevolution between transposable elements (TEs) and their hosts can be antagonistic, where TEs evolve to avoid silencing and the host responds by reestablishing TE suppression, or mutualistic, where TEs are co-opted to benefit their host. The &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; TE functions as an important component of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; telomeres but has also reportedly inserted into the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; nuclear export factor gene &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt;. We find that, rather than inserting into &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; has actually captured a portion of &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; sequence. We show that &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; produces abundant Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs), some of which are antisense to the &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; transcript, and that the &lt;i&gt;TART&lt;/i&gt;-like region of &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; is evolving rapidly. Furthermore, in &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; is present at higher copy numbers, and &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; shows reduced expression, compared to the closely related species &lt;i&gt;Drosophila simulans&lt;/i&gt;. We propose that capturing &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; sequence allowed &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; to target the &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; gene for piRNA-mediated repression and that these 2 elements are engaged in antagonistic coevolution despite the fact that &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; is serving a critical role for its host genome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VY2O9I8cFrM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Smallpox is unique among infectious diseases in the degree to which it devastated human populations, its long history of control interventions, and the fact that it has been successfully eradicated. Mortality from smallpox in London, England was carefully documented, weekly, for nearly 300 years, providing a rare and valuable source for the study of ecology and evolution of infectious disease. We describe and analyze smallpox mortality in London from 1664 to 1930. We digitized the weekly records published in the London Bills of Mortality (LBoM) and the Registrar General’s Weekly Returns (RGWRs). We annotated the resulting time series with a sequence of historical events that might have influenced smallpox dynamics in London. We present a spectral analysis that reveals how periodicities in reported smallpox mortality changed over decades and centuries; many of these changes in epidemic patterns are correlated with changes in control interventions and public health policies. We also examine how the seasonality of reported smallpox mortality changed from the 17th to 20th centuries in London.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jF09DOqV7BQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcome prognostication unbiased by early care limitations (ECL) is essential for guiding treatment in patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of this study was to determine whether the max‐ICH (maximally treated ICH) Score provides improved and clinically useful prognostic estimation of functional long‐term outcomes after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multicenter validation study compared the prognostication of the max‐ICH Score versus the ICH Score regarding diagnostic accuracy (discrimination and calibration) and clinical utility using decision curve analysis. We performed a joint investigation of individual participant data of consecutive spontaneous ICH patients (n = 4,677) from 2 retrospective German‐wide studies (RETRACE I + II; anticoagulation‐associated ICH only) conducted at 22 participating centers, one German prospective single‐center study (UKER‐ICH; nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH only), and 1 US‐based prospective longitudinal single‐center study (MGH; both anticoagulation‐ and nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH), treated between January 2006 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 4,677 included ICH patients, 1,017 (21.7%) were affected by ECL (German cohort: 15.6% [440 of 2,377]; MGH: 31.0% [577 of 1,283]). Validation of long‐term functional outcome prognostication by the max‐ICH Score provided good and superior discrimination in patients without ECL compared with the ICH Score (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC], German cohort: 0.81 [0.78–0.83] vs 0.74 [0.72–0.77], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.85 [0.81–0.89] vs 0.78 [0.74–0.82], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), and for the entire cohort (AUROC, German cohort: 0.84 [0.82–0.86] vs 0.80 [0.77–0.82], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.83 [0.81–0.85] vs 0.77 [0.75–0.79], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Both scores showed no evidence of poor calibration. The clinical utility investigated by decision curve analysis showed, at high threshold probabilities (0.8, aiming to avoid false‐positive poor outcome attribution), that the max‐ICH Score provided a clinical net benefit compared with the ICH Score (14.1 vs 2.1 net predicted poor outcomes per 100 patients).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The max‐ICH Score provides valid and improved prognostication of functional outcome after ICH. The associated clinical net benefit in minimizing false poor outcome attribution might potentially prevent unwarranted care limitations in patients with ICH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) depends on precise delivery of electrical current to target tissues. However, the specific brain structures responsible for best outcome are still debated. We applied probabilistic stimulation mapping to a retrospective, multidisorder DBS dataset assembled over 15 years at our institution (n&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = 482 patients; n&lt;sub&gt;Parkinson disease&lt;/sub&gt; = 303; n&lt;sub&gt;dystonia&lt;/sub&gt; = 64; n&lt;sub&gt;tremor&lt;/sub&gt; = 39; n&lt;sub&gt;treatment‐resistant depression/anorexia nervosa&lt;/sub&gt; = 76) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates of optimal clinical response. Using high‐resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and activation volume modeling, probabilistic stimulation maps (PSMs) that delineated areas of above‐mean and below‐mean response for each patient cohort were generated and defined in terms of their relationships with surrounding anatomical structures. Our results show that overlap between PSMs and individual patients' activation volumes can serve as a guide to predict clinical outcomes, but that this is not the sole determinant of response. In the future, individualized models that incorporate advancements in mapping techniques with patient‐specific clinical variables will likely contribute to the optimization of DBS target selection and improved outcomes for patients.

 &lt;p&gt;Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development through trans-synaptic adhesion and assembly of diverse synaptic proteins. Many synaptic adhesion molecules positively regulate synapse development; some, however, exert negative regulation, although such cases are relatively rare. In addition, synaptic adhesion molecules regulate the amplitude of post-synaptic receptor responses, but whether adhesion molecules can regulate the kinetic properties of post-synaptic receptors remains unclear. Here we report that Clmp, a homophilic adhesion molecule of the Ig domain superfamily that is abundantly expressed in the brain, reaches peak expression at a neonatal stage (week 1) and associates with subunits of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and kainate receptors (KARs). Clmp deletion in mice increased the frequency and amplitude of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and the frequency, amplitude, and decay time constant of KAR-mediated mEPSCs in hippocampal CA3 neurons. Clmp deletion had minimal impacts on evoked excitatory synaptic currents at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses but increased extrasynaptic KAR, but not AMPAR, currents, suggesting that Clmp distinctly inhibits AMPAR and KAR responses. Behaviorally, Clmp deletion enhanced novel object recognition and susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures, without affecting contextual or auditory cued fear conditioning or pattern completion-based contextual fear conditioning. These results suggest that Clmp negatively regulates hippocampal excitatory synapse development and AMPAR and KAR responses in the neonatal hippocampal CA3 as well as object recognition and kainate seizure susceptibility in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent studies have demonstrated structural and functional alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the topological patterns of functional brain networks in newly diagnosed PD patients with MCI are unclear so far. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph theory approaches to explore the functional brain network in 45 PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI), 22 PD patients without MCI (PD-nMCI), and 18 healthy controls (HC). We found that the PD-MCI, PD-nMCI, and HC groups exhibited a small-world architecture in the functional brain network. However, early-stage PD-MCI patients had decreased clustering coefficient, increased characteristic path length, and changed nodal centrality in the default mode network (DMN), control network (CN), somatomotor network (SMN), and visual network (VN), which might contribute to factors for MCI symptoms in PD patients. Our results demonstrated that PD-MCI patients were associated with disrupted topological organization in the functional network, thus providing a topological network insight into the role of information exchange in the underlying development of MCI symptoms in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate brain white matter (WM) fibers connectivity damage in stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects by direct electrophysiological imaging (DELPHI) that analyzes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study included 123 participants, out of which 53 subjects with WM-related pathologies (39 stroke, 14 TBI) and 70 healthy age-related controls. All subjects underwent DELPHI brain network evaluations of TMS-electroencephalogram (EEG)-evoked potentials and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans for quantification of WM microstructure fractional anisotropy (FA).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;DELPHI output measures show a significant difference between the healthy and stroke/TBI groups. A multidimensional approach was able to classify healthy from unhealthy with a balanced accuracy of 0.81 ± 0.02 and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 ± 0.01. Moreover, a multivariant regression model of DELPHI output measures achieved prediction of WM microstructure changes measured by FA with the highest correlations observed for fibers proximal to the stimulation area, such as frontal corpus callosum (r = 0.7 ± 0.02), anterior internal capsule (r = 0.7 ± 0.02), and fronto-occipital fasciculus (r = 0.65 ± 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that features of TMS-evoked response are correlated to WM microstructure changes observed in pathological conditions, such as stroke and TBI, and that a multidimensional approach combining these features in supervised learning methods serves as a strong indicator for abnormalities and changes in WM integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Extracts from Holothuria scabra (HS) have been shown to possess anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities. More recently, it was shown to have neuroprotective potential in Caenorhabditis elegans PD model. Here, we assessed whether HS has neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects on dopaminergic neurons in both mouse and cellular models of PD. We found that both pre-treatment and post-treatment with HS improved motor deficits in PD mouse model induced with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as determined by grid walk test. This was likely mediated by HS protective and restorative effects on maintaining the numbers of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in both substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum. In a cellular model of PD, HS significantly attenuated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-induced apoptosis of DAergic-like neurons differentiated from SH-SY5Y cells by enhancing the expression of Bcl-2, suppressing the expression of cleaved Caspase 3 and preventing depolarization of mitochondrial membrane. In addition, HS could stimulate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and suppressed the formation of α-synuclein protein. Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro findings suggested that HS is an attractive candidate for the neuroprotection rather than neurorestoration in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroencephalograph (EEG) plays a significant role in the diagnostics process of epilepsy, but the detection rate is unsatisfactory when the length of interictal EEG signals is relatively short. Although the deliberate attacking theories for undirected brain network based on node removal method can extract potential network features, the node removal method fails to sufficiently consider the directionality of brain electrical activities. To solve the problems above, this study proposes a feature tensor-based epileptic detection method of directed brain networks. First, a directed functional brain network is constructed by calculating the transfer entropy of EEG signals between different electrodes. Second, the edge removal method is used to imitate the disruptions of brain connectivity, which may be related to the disorder of brain diseases, to obtain a sequence of residual networks. After that, topological features of these residual networks are extracted based on graph theory for constructing a five-way feature tensor. To exploit the inherent interactions among multiple modes of the feature tensor, this study uses the Tucker decomposition method to get a core tensor which is finally reshaped into a vector and input into the support vectors machine (SVM) classifier. Experiment results suggest that the proposed method has better epileptic screening performance for short-term interictal EEG data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As the global population ages, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is also increasing. At present, there are no widely recognized drugs able to ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction caused by AD. The failure of several promising clinical trials in recent years has highlighted the urgent need for novel strategies to both prevent and treat AD. Notably, a growing body of literature supports the efficacy of acupuncture for AD. In this review, we summarize the previously reported mechanisms of acupuncture's beneficial effects in AD, including the ability of acupuncture to modulate Aβ metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neurotransmitters, neurogenesis, synapse and neuron function, autophagy, neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, cerebral glucose metabolism, and brain responses. Taken together, these findings suggest that acupuncture provides therapeutic effects for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
