 Many in the neuroscience community were surprised and saddened to learn of Bruce McEwen’s sudden passing on January 2, 2020 after a brief illness. Several of us had interacted with Bruce recently, read his recent publications, and saw no signs of his enthusiasm for science or productivity waning despite being close to his 82nd birthday. Given that Bruce had a larger-than-life capacity for generating, storing, and integrating scientific knowledge, and a seemingly never-failing enthusiasm for stress neurobiology and neuroendocrinology in general, it seemed as though he would live forever.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A large network of integrate-and-fire neurons is studied analytically when
the synaptic weights are independently randomly distributed according to a
Gaussian distribution with arbitrary mean and variance. The relevant order
parameters are identified, and it is shown that such network is statistically
equivalent to an ensemble of independent integrate-and-fire neurons with each
input signal given by the sum of a self-interaction deterministic term and a
Gaussian colored noise. The model is able to reproduce the quasi-synchronous
oscillations, and the dropout of their frequency, of the central nervous system
neurons of the swimming Xenopus tadpole. Predictions from the model are
proposed for future experiments.

 &lt;p&gt;Neurons communicate with spikes, which are discrete events in time.
Functional network models often employ rate units that are continuously coupled
by analog signals. Is there a benefit of discrete signaling? By a unified
mean-field theory we show that large random networks of rate and binary units
have identical second order statistics. Yet their stimulus processing
properties are radically different: We discover a chaotic sub-manifold in
binary networks that does not exist in rate models. Its dimensionality
increases with time after stimulus onset and reaches a fixed point depending on
the synaptic coupling strength. Low dimensional stimuli are transiently
expanded into higher-dimensional representations within this manifold. High
noise resilience persists not only near the edge of chaos, but throughout the
chaotic regime. In rate models of spiking activity, the effective spiking noise
suppresses chaos, severely impairing classification performance. Chaotic rate
networks without effective spiking noise also show the transient performance
boost. The transition to chaos in the two models do not coincide and have
qualitatively different causes. Our theory mechanistically explains these
observations. These findings have several implications. 1) Discrete state
networks reach optimal performance with weaker synapses; implying lower
energetic costs for synaptic transmission. 2) The classification mechanism is
robust to noise, compatible with fluctuations in biophysical systems. 3)
Optimal performance is reached after only a single activation per participating
neuron; demonstrating event-based computation with short latencies. 4) The
chaotic sub-manifold predicts a transient increase of variability after
stimulus onset. Our results thus provide a hitherto unknown link between
recurrent and chaotic dynamics of functional networks, neuronal variability,
and dimensionality of neuronal responses.

 &lt;p&gt;Malfunctioning neurons in the brain sometimes operate synchronously,
reportedly causing many neurological diseases, e.g. Parkinson's. Suppression
and control of this collective synchronous activity are therefore of great
importance for neuroscience, and can only rely on limited engineering trials
due to the need to experiment with live human brains. We present the first
Reinforcement Learning gym framework that emulates this collective behavior of
neurons and allows us to find suppression parameters for the environment of
synthetic degenerate models of neurons. We successfully suppress synchrony via
RL for three pathological signaling regimes, characterize the framework's
stability to noise, and further remove the unwanted oscillations by engaging
multiple PPO agents.

 &lt;p&gt;Classification of whole-brain functional connectivity MRI data with
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has shown promise, but the complexity of
these models impedes understanding of which aspects of brain activity
contribute to classification. While visualization techniques have been
developed to interpret CNNs, bias inherent in the method of encoding abstract
input data, as well as the natural variance of deep learning models, detract
from the accuracy of these techniques. We introduce a stochastic encoding
method in an ensemble of CNNs to classify functional connectomes by gender. We
applied our method to resting-state and task data from the UK BioBank, using
two visualization techniques to measure the salience of three brain networks
involved in task- and resting-states, and their interaction. To regress
confounding factors such as head motion, age, and intracranial volume, we
introduced a multivariate balancing algorithm to ensure equal distributions of
such covariates between classes in our data. We achieved a final AUROC of
0.8459. We found that resting-state data classifies more accurately than task
data, with the inner salience network playing the most important role of the
three networks overall in classification of resting-state data and connections
to the central executive network in task data.

 &lt;p&gt;Value [4][5] is typically modeled using a continuous representation (i.e., a
Real number). A discrete representation of value has recently been postulated
[6]. A quantized representation of probability in the brain was also posited
and supported by experimental data [7]. In this paper, we hypothesize that
intertemporal choices may also be quantized. For example, people may treat (or
discount) 16 days indifferently to 17 days. To test this, we analyzed an
intertemporal task by using 2 novel models: quantized hyperbolic discounting,
and quantized exponential discounting. Our work here is a re-examination of the
behavioral data previously collected for an fMRI study [8]. Both quantized
hyperbolic and quantized exponential models were compared using AIC and BIC
tests. We found that 13/20 participants were best fit to the quantized
exponential model, while the remaining 7/20 were best fit to the quantized
hyperbolic model. Overall, 15/20 participants were best fit to models with a
5-bit precision (i.e., 25 = 32 steps). Our key conclusion is that, regardless
of whether a hyperbolic or an exponential model is employed, quantized versions
are a better fit to the experimental data than their continuous versions. We
finally outline some potential applications of our findings.

 &lt;p&gt;Brain neural networks characterize various information propagation patterns
for different emotional states. However, the statistical features based on
traditional graph theory may ignore the spacial network difference. To reveal
these inherent spatial features and increase the stability of emotional
recognition, we proposed a hierarchical framework that can perform the multiple
emotion recognitions with the multiple emotion-related spatial network topology
patterns (MESNP) by combining a supervised learning with ensemble co-decision
strategy. To evaluate the performance of our proposed MESNP approach, we
conduct both off-line and simulated on-line experiments with two public
datasets i.e., MAHNOB and DEAP. The experiment results demonstrated that MESNP
can significantly enhance the classification performance for the multiple
emotions. The highest accuracies of off-line experiments for MAHNOB-HCI and
DEAP achieved 99.93% (3 classes) and 83.66% (4 classes), respectively. For
simulated on-line experiments, we also obtained the best classification
accuracies with 100% (3 classes) for MAHNOB and 99.22% (4 classes) for DEAP by
proposed MESNP. These results further proved the efficiency of MESNP for
structured feature extraction in mult-classification emotional task.

 &lt;p&gt;Identifying the brain's neuronal cluster size to be presented as nodes in a
network computation is critical to both neuroscience and artificial
intelligence, as these define the cognitive blocks required for building
intelligent computation. Experiments support many forms and sizes of neural
clustering, while neural mass models (NMM) assume scale-invariant
functionality. Here, we use computational simulations with brain-derived fMRI
network to show that not only brain network stays structurally self-similar
continuously across scales, but also neuron-like signal integration
functionality is preserved at particular scales. As such, we propose a
coarse-graining of network of neurons to ensemble-nodes, with multiple spikes
making up its ensemble-spike, and time re-scaling factor defining its
ensemble-time step. The fractal-like spatiotemporal structure and function that
emerge permit strategic choice in bridging across experimental scales for
computational modeling, while also suggesting regulatory constraints on
developmental and/or evolutionary &quot;growth spurts&quot; in brain size, as per
punctuated equilibrium theories in evolutionary biology.

 &lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) has attracted much attention due to its great
potential of modeling time-dependent signals. The firing rate of spiking
neurons is decided by control rate which is fixed manually in advance, and
thus, whether the firing rate is adequate for modeling actual time series
relies on fortune. Though it is demanded to have an adaptive control rate, it
is a non-trivial task because the control rate and the connection weights
learned during the training process are usually entangled. In this paper, we
show that the firing rate is related to the eigenvalue of the spike generation
function. Inspired by this insight, by enabling the spike generation function
to have adaptable eigenvalues rather than parametric control rates, we develop
the Bifurcation Spiking Neural Network (BSNN), which has an adaptive firing
rate and is insensitive to the setting of control rates. Experiments validate
the effectiveness of BSNN on a broad range of tasks, showing that BSNN achieves
superior performance to existing SNNs and is robust to the setting of control
rates.

 &lt;p&gt;From philosophers of ancient times to modern economists, biologists and other
researchers are engaged in revealing causal relations. The most challenging
problem is inferring the type of the causal relationship: whether it is uni- or
bi-directional or only apparent - implied by a hidden common cause only. Modern
technology provides us tools to record data from complex systems such as the
ecosystem of our planet or the human brain, but understanding their functioning
needs detection and distinction of causal relationships of the system
components without interventions. Here we present a new method, which
distinguishes and assigns probabilities to the presence of all the possible
causal relations between two or more time series from dynamical systems. The
new method is validated on synthetic datasets and applied to EEG
(electroencephalographic) data recorded in epileptic patients. Given the
universality of our method, it may find application in many fields of science.

 &lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) technology, which is amongst the most used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques currently available, has developed rapidly from 2009 to 2018. However, reports on the trends of rTMS using bibliometric analysis are rare. The goal of the present bibliometric analysis is to analyze and visualize the trends of rTMS, including general (publication patterns) and emerging trends (research frontiers), over the last 10 years by using the visual analytic tool CiteSpace V. Publications related to rTMS from 2009 to 2018 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database, including 2,986 peer-reviewed articles/reviews. Active authors, journals, institutions, and countries were identified by WoS and visualized by CiteSpace V, which could also detect burst changes to identify emerging trends. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to analyze the time trend of annual publication outputs. The USA ranked first in this field. Pascual-Leone A (author A), Fitzgerald PB (author B), George MS (author C), Lefaucheur JP (author D), and Fregni F (author E) made great contributions to this field of study. The most prolific institution to publish rTMS-related publications in the last decade was the University of Toronto. The journal Brain Stimulation published most papers. Lefaucheur et al.'s paper in 2014, and the keyword “sham controlled trial” showed the strongest citation bursts by the end of 2018, which indicates increased attention to the underlying work, thereby indicating the research frontiers. This study reveals the publication patterns and emerging trends of rTMS based on the records published from 2009 to 2018. The insights obtained have reference values for the future research and application of rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, our understanding of the mechanism regulating the PGC-1α expression is still limited. We sought to determine whether the epigenetic modification of PPARGC1A (the gene encoding PGC-1α) could account for its diminished expression. We performed a study of PPARGC1A risk-SNP genotypes, methylation level, and the expression in blood from 171 subjects. The mean DNA methylation level of PPARGC1A intron 1 in patients with PD was higher than that in the controls (7.18 ± 1.74 vs. 6.36 ± 1.28, P = 0.007). A detailed comparison of the DNA methylation level at each CpG site showed that CpG_1, CpG_13.14, CpG_17.18, and CpG_20 were significantly hypermethylated in patients with PD. There was a significant negative correlation between PPARGC1A methylation and expression level (R = −0.404, P &amp;lt; 0.001). We found no correlations between the PPARGC1A methylation level and the clinical features, while the CpG_13.14 site methylation level was positively correlated with H&amp;amp;Y stage (R = 0.246, P = 0.020) and was increased in people carrying the rs2970848 AA genotype compared with that in carriers of the AG/GG genotype (7.27 ± 1.86 vs. 6.65 ± 1.92, P = 0.032). Our results support a link between PPARGC1A methylation, gene expression, and variability, which indicated that a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism controlling PPARGC1A expression influences PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Previous research demonstrated that cognitive conflict could induce an affective priming effect, and the stage (detection/resolution) of conflict processing led to different directions (positive/negative) of the affective priming effect. We suggested that rewards play a critical role in the affective priming effect on conflict resolution. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs), using the arrow flanker task as primes and choosing specific affective words as targets to investigate the affective priming effect induced by cognitive conflict during the resolution stage. Our question was whether rewards created a modulating effect. Participants were asked to judge the congruency of the prime stimuli and then evaluate the valence of the target words. For behavioral results, the conflict effect was significant, and the reward promoted the behavioral performance of participants. For ERP results, enhanced N2 amplitudes for incongruent primes indicated a significant conflict effect. More importantly, as expected, in the rewarded condition, the enhanced N400 amplitudes for positive targets following incongruent primes were found, indicating a positive priming effect. However, in the unrewarded condition, the reduced N400 amplitudes for positive targets following incongruent primes were found, indicating conflict resolution hindered the processing of positive stimuli. These findings suggested that cognitive conflict-induced the positive priming effect during the resolution stage and that rewards had a moderating effect on the positive priming effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including Developmental Dyslexia (DD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but not Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), are reported to show deficits in global motion processing. Such behavioral deficits have been linked to a temporal processing deficiency. However, to date, there have been few studies assessing the temporal processing efficiency of the Magnocellular M pathways through temporal modulation. Hence, we measured achromatic flicker fusion thresholds at high and low contrast in nonselective samples of NDDs and neurotypicals (mean age 10, range 7–12 years, n = 71) individually, and group matched, for both chronological age and nonverbal intelligence. Autistic tendencies were also measured using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient questionnaire as high AQ scores have previously been associated with the greater physiological amplitude of M-generated nonlinearities. The NDD participants presented with singular or comorbid combinations of DD, ASD, and ADHD. The results showed that ASD and DD, including those with comorbid ADHD, demonstrated significantly lower flicker fusion thresholds (FFTs) than their matched controls. Participants with a singular diagnosis of ADHD did not differ from controls in the FFTs. Overall, the entire NDD plus control populations showed a significant negative correlation between FFT and AQ scores (r = −0.269, p &amp;lt; 0.02 n = 71). In conclusion, this study presents evidence showing that a temporally inefficient M pathway could be the unifying network at fault across the NDDs and particularly in ASD and DD diagnoses, but not in singular diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Sensory dysfunction is prevalent in cerebral palsy (CP). Evidence suggests that sensory deficits can contribute to manual ability impairments in children with CP, yet it is still unclear how they contribute to balance and motor performance. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between lower extremity (LE) somatosensation and functional performance in children with CP. Ten participants with spastic diplegia (Gross Motor Function Classification Scale: I-III) and who were able to stand independently completed the study. Threshold of light touch pressure, two-point discriminatory ability of the plantar side of the foot, duration of cutaneous vibration sensation, and error in the joint position sense of the ankle were assessed to quantify somatosensory function. The balance was tested by the Balance Evaluation System Test (BESTest) and postural sway measures during a standing task. Motor performance was evaluated by using a battery of clinical assessments: (1) Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66-IS) to test gross motor ability; (2) spatiotemporal gait characteristics (velocity, step length) to evaluate walking ability; (3) Timed Up and Go (TUG) and 6 Min Walk (6MWT) tests to assess functional mobility; and (4) an isokinetic dynamometer was used to test the Maximum Volitional Isometric Contraction (MVIC) of the plantar flexor muscles. The results showed that the light touch pressure measure was strongly associated only with the 6MWT. Vibration and two-point discrimination were strongly related to balance performance. Further, the vibration sensation of the first metatarsal head demonstrated a significantly strong relationship with motor performance as measured by GMFM-66-IS, spatiotemporal gait parameters, TUG, and ankle plantar flexors strength test. The joint position sense of the ankle was only related to one subdomain of the BESTest (Postural Responses). This study provides preliminary evidence that LE sensory deficits can possibly contribute to the pronounced balance and motor impairments in CP. The findings emphasize the importance of developing a thorough LE sensory test battery that can guide traditional treatment protocols toward a more holistic therapeutic approach by combining both motor and sensory rehabilitative strategies to improve motor function in CP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy therapy is currently based on anti-seizure drugs that do not modify the course of the disease, i.e., they are not anti-epileptogenic in nature. Previously, we observed that in vivo casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibition with 4,5,6,7-tetrabromotriazole (TBB) had anti-epileptogenic effects in the acute epilepsy slice model.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Here, we pretreated rats with TBB in vivo prior to the establishment of a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in order to analyze the long-term sequelae of such a preventive TBB administration.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that TBB pretreatment delayed onset of seizures after pilocarpine and slowed down disease progression during epileptogenesis. This was accompanied with a reduced proportion of burst firing neurons in the CA1 area. Western blot analyses demonstrated that CA1 tissue from TBB-pretreated epileptic animals contained significantly less CK2 than TBB-pretreated controls. On the transcriptional level, TBB pretreatment led to differential gene expression changes of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2.2, but also of HCN1 and HCN3 channels. Thus, in the presence of the HCN channel blocker ZD7288, pretreatment with TBB rescued the afterhyperpolarizing potential (AHP) as well as spike frequency adaptation in epileptic animals, both of which are prominent functions of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that TBB pretreatment prior to SE slows down disease progression during epileptogenesis involving increased K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 function, probably due to a persistently decreased CK2 protein expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-related alterations of functional brain networks contribute to cognitive decline. Current theories indicate that age-related intrinsic brain functional reorganization may be a critical marker of cognitive aging. Yet, little is known about how intrinsic interhemispheric functional connectivity changes with age in adults, and how this relates to critical executive functions. To address this, we examined voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), a metric that quantifies interhemispheric communication, in 93 healthy volunteers (age range: 19–85) with executive function assessment using the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) scales. Resting functional MRI data were analyzed to assess VMHC, and then a multiple linear regression model was employed to evaluate the relationship between age and the whole-brain VMHC. We observed age-related reductions in VMHC of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and hippocampus in the medial temporal lobe subsystem, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula in salience network, and inferior parietal lobule in frontoparietal control network. Performance on the color-word inhibition task was associated with VMHC of vmPFC and insula, and VMHC of vmPFC mediated the relationship between age and CWIT inhibition reaction times. The percent ratio of correct design scores in design fluency test correlated positively with VMHC of the inferior parietal lobule. The current study suggests that brain interhemispheric functional alterations may be a promising new avenue for understanding age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is a major cause of stroke and morbidity. Recent genome-wide association studies have shown that paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (Pitx2) to be strongly associated with AF. However, the mechanisms underlying Pitx2 modulated arrhythmogenesis and variable effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in patients in the presence or absence of impaired Pitx2 expression remain unclear. We have developed multi-scale computer models, ranging from a single cell to tissue level, to mimic control and Pitx2-knockout atria by incorporating recent experimental data on Pitx2-induced electrical and structural remodeling in humans, as well as the effects of AADs. The key findings of this study are twofold. We have demonstrated that shortened action potential duration, slow conduction and triggered activity occur due to electrical and structural remodelling under Pitx2 deficiency conditions. Notably, the elevated function of calcium transport ATPase increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration, thereby enhancing susceptibility to triggered activity. Furthermore, heterogeneity is further elevated due to Pitx2 deficiency: 1) Electrical heterogeneity between left and right atria increases; and 2) Increased fibrosis and decreased cell-cell coupling due to structural remodelling slow electrical propagation and provide obstacles to attract re-entry, facilitating the initiation of re-entrant circuits. Secondly, our study suggests that flecainide has antiarrhythmic effects on AF due to impaired Pitx2 by preventing spontaneous calcium release and increasing wavelength. Furthermore, our study suggests that Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel effects alone are insufficient to explain the efficacy of flecainide. Our study may provide the mechanisms underlying Pitx2-induced AF and possible explanation behind the AAD effects of flecainide in patients with Pitx2 deficiency.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/De5Uze-Z81o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Correct annotation metadata is critical for reproducible and accurate RNA-seq analysis. When files are shared publicly or among collaborators with incorrect or missing annotation metadata, it becomes difficult or impossible to reproduce bioinformatic analyses from raw data. It also makes it more difficult to locate the transcriptomic features, such as transcripts or genes, in their proper genomic context, which is necessary for overlapping expression data with other datasets. We provide a solution in the form of an R/Bioconductor package tximeta that performs numerous annotation and metadata gathering tasks automatically on behalf of users during the import of transcript quantification files. The correct reference transcriptome is identified via a hashed checksum stored in the quantification output, and key transcript databases are downloaded and cached locally. The computational paradigm of automatically adding annotation metadata based on reference sequence checksums can greatly facilitate genomic workflows, by helping to reduce overhead during bioinformatic analyses, preventing costly bioinformatic mistakes, and promoting computational reproducibility. The tximeta package is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/tximeta.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hvnvmD4Ua98&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Upon exposure to different stimuli, resting macrophages undergo classical or alternative polarization into distinct phenotypes that can cause fatal dysfunction in a large range of diseases, such as systemic infection leading to sepsis or the generation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Investigating gene regulatory and metabolic networks, we observed two metabolic switches during polarization. Most prominently, anaerobic glycolysis was utilized by M1-polarized macrophages, while the biosynthesis of inosine monophosphate was upregulated in M2-polarized macrophages. Moreover, we observed a switch in the urea cycle. Gene regulatory network models revealed E2F1, MYC, PPARγ and STAT6 to be the major players in the distinct signatures of these polarization events. Employing functional assays targeting these regulators, we observed the repolarization of M2-like cells into M1-like cells, as evidenced by their specific gene expression signatures and cytokine secretion profiles. The predicted regulators are essential to maintaining the M2-like phenotype and function and thus represent potential targets for the therapeutic reprogramming of immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zo3nGf-wEEg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genes differ in the frequency at which they are expressed and in the form of regulation used to control their activity. In particular, positive or negative regulation can lead to activation of a gene in response to an external signal. Previous works proposed that the form of regulation of a gene correlates with its frequency of usage: positive regulation when the gene is frequently expressed and negative regulation when infrequently expressed. Such network design means that, in the absence of their regulators, the genes are found in their least required activity state, hence regulatory intervention is often necessary. Due to the multitude of genes and regulators, spurious binding and unbinding events, called “crosstalk”, could occur. To determine how the form of regulation affects the global crosstalk in the network, we used a mathematical model that includes multiple regulators and multiple target genes. We found that crosstalk depends non-monotonically on the availability of regulators. Our analysis showed that excess use of regulation entailed by the formerly suggested network design caused high crosstalk levels in a large part of the parameter space. We therefore considered the opposite ‘idle’ design, where the default unregulated state of genes is their frequently required activity state. We found, that ‘idle’ design minimized the use of regulation and thus minimized crosstalk. In addition, we estimated global crosstalk of &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; using transcription factors binding data. We demonstrated that even partial network data could suffice to estimate its global crosstalk, suggesting its applicability to additional organisms. We found that &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; estimated crosstalk is lower than that of a random network, suggesting that natural selection reduces crosstalk. In summary, our study highlights a new type of protein production cost which is typically overlooked: that of regulatory interference caused by the presence of excess regulators in the cell. It demonstrates the importance of whole-network descriptions, which could show effects missed by single-gene models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/njnC1ArBN2k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Striatal oscillatory activity is associated with movement, reward, and decision-making, and observed in several interacting frequency bands. Local field potential recordings in rodent striatum show dopamine- and reward-dependent transitions between two states: a “spontaneous” state involving &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; (∼15-30 Hz) and low &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; (∼40-60 Hz), and a state involving &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; (∼4-8 Hz) and high &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; (∼60-100 Hz) in response to dopaminergic agonism and reward. The mechanisms underlying these rhythmic dynamics, their interactions, and their functional consequences are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a biophysical model of striatal microcircuits that comprehensively describes the generation and interaction of these rhythms, as well as their modulation by dopamine. Building on previous modeling and experimental work suggesting that striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are capable of generating &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; oscillations, we show that networks of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are capable of generating &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; (ie, 2 to 6 Hz) and &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; rhythms. Under simulated low dopaminergic tone our model FSI network produces low &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; band oscillations, while under high dopaminergic tone the FSI network produces high &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; band activity nested within a &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; oscillation. SPN networks produce &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; rhythms in both conditions, but under high dopaminergic tone, this &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; oscillation is interrupted by &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;-periodic bursts of &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-frequency FSI inhibition. Thus, in the high dopamine state, packets of FSI &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; and SPN &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; alternate at a &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; timescale. In addition to a mechanistic explanation for previously observed rhythmic interactions and transitions, our model suggests a hypothesis as to how the relationship between dopamine and rhythmicity impacts motor function. We hypothesize that high dopamine-induced periodic FSI &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-rhythmic inhibition enables switching between &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-rhythmic SPN cell assemblies representing the currently active motor program, and thus that dopamine facilitates movement in part by allowing for rapid, periodic shifts in motor program execution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OdbxpQNuc_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Gap junctions are key mediators of intercellular communication in cardiac tissue, and their function is vital to sustaining normal cardiac electrical activity. Conduction through gap junctions strongly depends on the hemichannel arrangement and transjunctional voltage, rendering the intercellular conductance highly non-Ohmic, particularly under steady-state regimes of conduction. Despite this marked non-linear behavior, current tissue-level models of cardiac conduction are rooted in the assumption that gap-junctions conductance is constant (Ohmic), which results in inaccurate predictions of electrical propagation, particularly in the low junctional-coupling regime observed under pathological conditions. In this work, we present a novel non-Ohmic homogenization model (NOHM) of cardiac conduction that is suitable to tissue-scale simulations. Using non-linear homogenization theory, we develop a conductivity model that seamlessly upscales the voltage-dependent conductance of gap junctions, without the need of explicitly modeling gap junctions. The NOHM model allows for the simulation of electrical propagation in tissue-level cardiac domains that accurately resemble that of cell-based microscopic models for a wide range of junctional coupling scenarios, recovering key conduction features at a fraction of the computational complexity. A unique feature of the NOHM model is the possibility of upscaling the response of non-symmetric gap-junction conductance distributions, which result in conduction velocities that strongly depend on the direction of propagation, thus allowing to model the normal and retrograde conduction observed in certain regions of the heart. We envision that the NOHM model will enable organ-level simulations that are informed by sub- and inter-cellular mechanisms, delivering an accurate and predictive in-silico tool for understanding the heart function.

Tumor growth curves are classically modeled by means of ordinary differential equations. In analyzing the Gompertz model several studies have reported a striking correlation between the two parameters of the model, which could be used to reduce the dimensionality and improve predictive power. We analyzed tumor growth kinetics within the statistical framework of nonlinear mixed-effects (population approach). This allowed the simultaneous modeling of tumor dynamics and inter-animal variability. Experimental data comprised three animal models of breast and lung cancers, with 833 measurements in 94 animals. Candidate models of tumor growth included the exponential, logistic and Gompertz models. The exponential and—more notably—logistic models failed to describe the experimental data whereas the Gompertz model generated very good fits. The previously reported population-level correlation between the Gompertz parameters was further confirmed in our analysis (R&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 0.92 in all groups). Combining this structural correlation with rigorous population parameter estimation, we propose a reduced Gompertz function consisting of a single individual parameter (and one population parameter). Leveraging the population approach using Bayesian inference, we estimated times of tumor initiation using three late measurement timepoints. The reduced Gompertz model was found to exhibit the best results, with drastic improvements when using Bayesian inference as compared to likelihood maximization alone, for both accuracy and precision. Specifically, mean accuracy (prediction error) was 12.2% versus 78% and mean precision (width of the 95% prediction interval) was 15.6 days versus 210 days, for the breast cancer cell line. These results demonstrate the superior predictive power of the reduced Gompertz model, especially when combined with Bayesian estimation. They offer possible clinical perspectives for personalized prediction of the age of a tumor from limited data at diagnosis.

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Propagation of signals across the cerebral cortex is a core component of many cognitive processes and is generally thought to be mediated by direct intracortical connectivity. The thalamus, by contrast, is considered to be devoid of internal connections and organized as a collection of parallel inputs to the cortex. Here, we provide evidence that &quot;open-loop&quot; intrathalamic pathways involving the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) can support propagation of oscillatory activity across the cortex. Recent studies support the existence of open-loop thalamo-reticulo-thalamic (TC-TRN-TC) synaptic motifs in addition to traditional closed-loop architectures. We hypothesized that open-loop structural modules, when connected in series, might underlie thalamic and, therefore cortical, signal propagation. Using a supercomputing platform to simulate thousands of permutations of a thalamocortical network based on physiological data collected in mice, rats, ferrets, and cats and in which select synapses were allowed to vary both by class and individually, we evaluated the relative capacities of closed-loop and open-loop TC-TRN-TC synaptic configurations to support both propagation and oscillation. We observed that (1) signal propagation was best supported in networks possessing strong open-loop TC-TRN-TC connectivity; (2) intrareticular synapses were neither primary substrates of propagation nor oscillation; and (3) heterogeneous synaptic networks supported more robust propagation of oscillation than their homogeneous counterparts. These findings suggest that open-loop, heterogeneous intrathalamic architectures might complement direct intracortical connectivity to facilitate cortical signal propagation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The multitude of neuronal subtypes and extensive interconnectivity of the mammalian brain presents a substantial challenge to those seeking to decipher its functions. While the molecular mechanisms of several neuronal functions remain poorly characterized, advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and gene-editing technology have begun to close this gap. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats – CRISPR Associated Protein (CRISPR-Cas) system has emerged as a powerful genetic tool capable of manipulating the genome of essentially any organism and cell type, an attribute which has advanced our understanding of complex neurological diseases by enabling the rapid generation of novel, disease-relevant &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and transgenic animal models. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the rapidly accelerating field of CRISPR-mediated genome engineering. We begin with an overview of the canonical function of the CRISPR platform, followed by a functional review of its many adaptations, with an emphasis on its applications for genetic interrogation of the normal and diseased nervous system. Additionally, we discuss limitations of the CRISPR editing system and suggest how future modifications to existing platforms may advance our understanding of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in cortical networks are coupled by gap-junctions, forming a syncytium that supports propagating epileptiform discharges, induced by 4-aminopyridine. It remains unclear, however, whether these propagating events occur under more natural states, without pharmacological blockade. In particular, we investigated whether propagation also happens when extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rises, as is known to occur following intense network activity, such as during seizures. We examined how increasing [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; affects the likelihood of propagating activity away from a site of focal (200-400µm) optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Activity was recorded using a linear 16-electrode array placed along layer V of primary visual cortex. At baseline levels of [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; (3.5mM), induced activity was recorded only within the illuminated area. However, when [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; was increased above a threshold level (50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile= 8.0mM; interquartile range= 7.5-9.5mM), time-locked, fast-spiking unit activity, indicative of parvalbumin-expressing interneuron firing, was also recorded outside the illuminated area, propagating at 59.1mm/s. The propagating unit activity was unaffected by blockade of GABAergic synaptic transmission, but it was modulated by glutamatergic blockers, and was reduced, and in most cases prevented altogether, by pharmacological blockade of gap-junctions, achieved by any of three different drugs, quinine, mefloquine or carbenoxolone. Wash-out of quinine rapidly re-established the pattern of propagating activity. Computer simulations show qualitative differences between propagating discharges in high [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and 4-aminopyridine, arising from differences in the electrotonic effects of these two manipulations. These interneuronal syncytial interactions are likely to affect the complex electrographic dynamics of seizures, once [K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is raised above this threshold level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate the spatially extended propagation of activity through a gap-junction mediated syncytium of parvalbumin(PV)-expressing interneurons, in conditions that are known to exist at times within the brain. Previous work has only shown gap-junction coordination very locally, through directly connected cells, or induced at a distance by pharmacological means. We show that cell-class specific spread is facilitated by raised extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This is highly pertinent to what happens at the onset of, and during, seizures, when extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can rise rapidly to levels well in excess of the measured threshold for propagation. Our data suggests that interneuronal coupling will be enhanced at this time, and this has clear implications for the behaviour of these cells as seizures progress.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), human Tau is phosphorylated at S199 (hTau-S199-P) by the protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). HTau-S199-P mislocalizes to dendritic spines, which induces synaptic dysfunction at the early stage of AD. The AKT kinase, once phosphorylated, inhibits GSK3β by phosphorylating it at S9.

 VDAC1 is a critical substrate of Parkin responsible for the regulation of mitophagy and apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that VDAC1 can be either mono- or polyubiquitinated by Parkin in a PINK1-dependent manner.

 &lt;p&gt;We propose a novel biologically-plausible solution to the credit assignment
problem, being motivated by observations in the ventral visual pathway and
trained deep neural networks. In both, representations of objects in the same
category become progressively more similar, while objects belonging to
different categories becomes less similar. We use this observation to motivate
a layer-specific learning goal in a deep network: each layer aims to learn a
representational similarity matrix that interpolates between previous and later
layers. We formulate this idea using a supervised deep similarity matching cost
function and derive from it deep neural networks with feedforward, lateral and
feedback connections, and neurons that exhibit biologically-plausible Hebbian
and anti-Hebbian plasticity. Supervised deep similarity matching can be
interpreted as an energy-based learning algorithm, but with significant
differences from others in how a contrastive function is constructed.

 &lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a means to uncover deep patterns from rich sources of
data. Here, we find that machine learning can recover the conceptual
organization of the human mind when applied to the natural language use of
millions of people. Utilizing text from billions of webpages, we recover most
of the concepts contained in English, Dutch, and Japanese, as represented in
large scale Word Association networks. Our results justify machine learning as
a means to probe the human mind, at a depth and scale that has been
unattainable using self-report and observational methods. Beyond direct
psychological applications, our methods may prove useful for projects concerned
with defining, assessing, relating, or uncovering concepts in any scientific

 &lt;p&gt;This study investigates whether a machine-learning-based system can predict
the rate of cognitive-decline in mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) patients by
processing only the clinical and imaging data collected at the initial visit.
We build a predictive model based on a supervised hybrid neural network
utilizing a 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network to perform volume
analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and integration of non-imaging
clinical data at the fully connected layer of the architecture. The analysis is
performed on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.
Experimental results confirm that there is a correlation between cognitive
decline and the data obtained at the first visit. The system achieved an area
under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 66.6% for cognitive decline class
prediction.

 &lt;p&gt;Human learning is a complex process in which future behavior is altered via
the reorganization of brain activity and connectivity. It remains unknown
whether activity and connectivity differentially reorganize during learning,
and, if so, how that differential reorganization tracks stages of learning
across distinct brain areas. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by
measuring brain activity and functional connectivity in a longitudinal fMRI
experiment in which healthy adult human participants learn the values of novel
objects over the course of four days. An increasing similarity in activity or
functional connectivity across subjects during learning reflects reorganization
toward a common functional architecture. We assessed the presence of
reorganization in activity and connectivity both during value learning and
during the resting-state, allowing us to differentiate common elicited
processes from intrinsic processes. We found a complex and dynamic
reorganization of brain connectivity and activity--as a function of time,
space, and performance--that occurs while subjects learn. Spatially localized
brain activity reorganizes across the brain to a common functional architecture
early in learning, and this reorganization tracks early learning performance.
In contrast, spatially distributed connectivity reorganizes across the brain to
a common functional architecture as training progresses, and this
reorganization tracks later learning performance. Particularly good performance
is associated with a sticky connectivity, that persists into the resting state.
Broadly, our work uncovers distinct principles of reorganization in activity
and connectivity at different phases of value learning, which inform the
ongoing study of learning processes more generally.

 &lt;p&gt;Connections between neurons called synapses are the key components underlying all nervous system functions of animals and humans. However, important genetic information on the formation and plasticity of one type, the electrical (gap junction-mediated) synapse, is understudied in many invertebrates. In the present study, we set forth to identify and characterize the gap junction-encoding gene innexin in the central nervous system (CNS) of the mollusk pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. With PCR, 3′ and 5′ RACE, and BLAST searches, we identified eight innexin genes in the L. stagnalis genome, named Lst Inx1–Lst Inx8. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the L. stagnalis innexin genes originated from a single copy in the common ancestor of molluskan species by multiple gene duplication events and have been maintained in L. stagnalis since they were generated. The paralogous innexin genes demonstrate distinct expression patterns among tissues. In addition, one paralog, Lst Inx1, exhibits heterogeneity in cells and ganglia, suggesting the occurrence of functional diversification after gene duplication. These results introduce possibilities to study an intriguing potential relationship between innexin paralog expression and cell-specific functional outputs such as heterogenic ability to form channels and exhibit synapse plasticity. The L. stagnalis CNS contains large neurons and functionally defined networks for behaviors; with the introduction of L. stagnalis in the gap junction gene field, we are providing novel opportunities to combine genetic research with direct investigations of functional outcomes at the cellular, synaptic, and behavioral levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM 312750), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by regression with loss of spoken language and hand skills, development of characteristic hand stereotypies, and gait dysfunction, is primarily caused by de novo mutations in the X-linked gene Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Currently, treatment options are limited to symptomatic management, however, reversal of disease phenotype is possible in mouse models by restoration of normal MECP2 gene expression. A significant challenge is the lack of biomarkers of disease state, disease severity, or treatment response. Using a non-targeted metabolomic approach we evaluated metabolite profiles in plasma from thirty-four people with RTT compared to thirty-seven unaffected age- and gender-matched siblings. We identified sixty-six significantly altered metabolites that cluster broadly into amino acid, nitrogen handling, and exogenous substance pathways. RTT disease metabolite and metabolic pathways abnormalities point to evidence of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and alterations in gut microflora. These observed changes provide insight into underlying pathological mechanisms and the foundation for biomarker discovery of disease severity biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Selection of the time-window mainly affects the effectiveness of piecewise feature extraction procedures. We present an enhanced bag-of-patterns representation that allows capturing the higher-level structures of brain dynamics within a wide window range. So, we introduce augmented instance representations with extended window lengths for the short-time Common Spatial Pattern algorithm. Based on multiple-instance learning, the relevant bag-of-patterns are selected by a sparse regression to feed a bag classifier. The proposed higher-level structure representation promotes two contributions: (i) accuracy improvement of bi-conditional tasks, (ii) A better understanding of dynamic brain behavior through the learned sparse regression fits. Using a support vector machine classifier, the achieved performance on a public motor imagery dataset (left-hand and right-hand tasks) shows that the proposed framework performs very competitive results, providing robustness to the time variation of electroencephalography recordings and favoring the class separability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Heterogeneity between late-onset Parkinson’s disease (LOPD) and early-onset Parkinson’s disease (EOPD) is mainly reflected in the following aspects including genetics, disease progression, drug response, clinical manifestation, and neuropathological change. Although many studies have investigated these differences in relation to clinical significance, the functional processing circuits and underlying neural mechanisms have not been entirely understood. In this study, regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) maps were used to explore different spontaneous brain activity patterns in EOPD and LOPD patients. Abnormal synchronizations were found in the motor and emotional circuits of the EOPD group, as well as in the motor, emotional, and visual circuits of the LOPD group. EOPD patients showed functional activity change in the visual, emotional and motor circuits, and LOPD patients only showed increased functional activity in the emotional circuits. In summary, the desynchronization process in the LOPD group was relatively strengthened, and the brain areas with changed functional activity in the EOPD group were relatively widespread. The results might point out different impairments in the synchronization and functional activity for EOPD and LOPD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormally large and dysfunctional neuronal axons. Mutations in the GAN gene have been identified as the cause of this disorder. In this report, we performed a detailed phenotypic assessment of a Chinese patient with GAN. An array-based exon capture test and targeted next-generation sequencing were used to detect the suspected mutation sites. Compound heterozygous mutations of p.S79L (c.236C &amp;gt; T) in the BTB domain and p.T489S (c.1466C &amp;gt; G) in the kelch domain were identified in the proband’s genome. S79L was a known mutation, and T489S was reported for the first time. The p.S79L and p.T489S were confirmed in the proband’s mother and father, respectively. Both mutations were located in highly conserved regions and affected the predicted protein crystal structures. The proband’s sural biopsy revealed the classical GAN phenotype of swollen axons filled with closely packed neurofilaments. The combined application of the next-generation sequencing platform and bioinformatics analyses was an effective method for diagnosing GAN. The novel compound mutations of S79L and T489S in the GAN gene were likely the cause of the patient’s GAN symptoms. Our findings enrich the spectrum of mutations associated with this rare type of axonopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accurate localization of complex human experiences such as emotions, dreaming, creativity, and consciousness to specific cerebral structures or neural networks has remained elusive despite technological advances. We report the use of acute deep brain stimulation (DBS) to evoke behavioral and emotional effects by applying electrical stimulation (ES) at various voltage strengths to the basolateral and central subnuclei of the amygdala in addition to the head of hippocampus (HC) for two subjects with medically refractory post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our results suggest that the amygdala could be a node in a neural network responsible for the generation of complex vivid mental imagery and integrated sensory experiences similar to John Hughlings Jackson’s “dreamy state” and “double consciousness,” which have been classically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy during uncinate seizures. That we were able to elicit similar vivid, dynamic, complex, bizarre, and original mental imagery with ES in non-epileptic subjects suggests that Jackson’s seizure related “dreamy state” and “double consciousness” may arise from heightened innate brain mechanisms with the amygdala acting as a node in the neural network responsible for physiologic dreaming and creative functions. Furthermore, our subjects experienced different emotions with different stimulation strengths at various electrode contacts. Our results suggest that higher voltage stimulation of the amygdala and HC at 4–5 V leads to predominantly negative responses and 2–4 V stimulation showed inversely coupled positive and negative responses of the amygdala in either hemisphere which may imply hemispheric dominance of emotional valences without relation to handedness. Due to the unique and complex responses dependent on location and strength of stimulation, we advise that all patients receiving DBS of the amygdala undergo acute stimulation mapping in a monitored setting before selecting therapeutic parameters for chronic stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Although biofeedback using electrophysiology has been explored extensively, the approach of using neurofeedback corresponding to hemodynamic response is a relatively young field. Real time functional magnetic resonance imaging-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) uses sensory feedback to operantly reinforce patterns of neural response. It can be used, for example, to alter visual perception, increase brain connectivity, and reduce depression symptoms. Within recent years, interest in rt-fMRI-NF in both research and clinical contexts has expanded considerably. As such, building a consensus regarding best practices is of great value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This systematic review is designed to describe and evaluate the variations in methodology used in previous rt-fMRI-NF studies to provide recommendations for rt-fMRI-NF study designs that are mostly likely to elicit reproducible and consistent effects of neurofeedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We conducted a database search for fMRI neurofeedback papers published prior to September 26th, 2019. Of 558 studies identified, 146 met criteria for inclusion. The following information was collected from each study: sample size and type, task used, neurofeedback calculation, regulation procedure, feedback, whether feedback was explicitly related to changing brain activity, feedback timing, control group for active neurofeedback, how many runs and sessions of neurofeedback, if a follow-up was conducted, and the results of neurofeedback training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: rt-fMRI-NF is typically upregulation practice based on hemodynamic response from a specific region of the brain presented using a continually updating thermometer display. Most rt-fMRI-NF studies are conducted in healthy samples and half evaluate its effect on immediate changes in behavior or affect. The most popular control group method is to provide sham signal from another region; however, many studies do not compare use a comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: We make several suggestions for designs of future rt-fMRI-NF studies. Researchers should use feedback calculation methods that consider neural response across regions (i.e., SVM or connectivity), which should be conveyed as intermittent, auditory feedback. Participants should be given explicit instructions and should be assessed on individual differences. Future rt-fMRI-NF studies should use clinical samples; effectiveness of rt-fMRI-NF should be evaluated on clinical/behavioral outcomes at follow-up time points in comparison to both a sham and no feedback control group.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain imaging studies of tinnitus patients have revealed marked changes in brain structure and function, but there are inconsistencies in those findings. In this meta-analysis, we investigated concurrence across studies to clarify those abnormalities in brain structure and function in tinnitus. Neuroimaging studies published up to December 6, 2019 were searched in the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, Chinese Nation Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chongqing VIP, and Wanfang Database. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Anisotropic effect size signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) was used to perform a multimodal analysis of available studies reporting whole-brain structural or functional data in tinnitus patients. There were 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The structural dataset comprised 242 tinnitus patients and 217 matched healthy subjects (HS), while the functional dataset included 130 tinnitus patients and 140 matched HS. Our analysis revealed structural alterations in the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), angular gyrus, caudate nucleus, superior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area, as well as functional differences in the MTG, middle occipital gyrus, precuneus, and right inferior parietal (excluding supramarginal and angular) gyri. The multimodal analysis revealed significant differences in the right MTG of tinnitus patients relative to HS. These findings suggest the involvement of the cortico-striatal circuits in the neuropathology of tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stuttering is a disorder that impacts the smooth flow of speech production and is associated with a deficit in sensorimotor integration. In a previous experiment, individuals who stutter were able to vocally compensate for pitch shifts in their auditory feedback, but they exhibited more variability in the timing of their corrective responses. In the current study, we focused on the neural correlates of the task using functional MRI. Participants produced a vowel sound in the scanner while hearing their own voice in real time through headphones. On some trials, the audio was shifted up or down in pitch, eliciting a corrective vocal response. Contrasting pitch-shifted vs. unshifted trials revealed bilateral superior temporal activation over all the participants. However, the groups differed in the activation of middle temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus [Brodmann area 10 (BA 10)], with individuals who stutter displaying deactivation while controls displayed activation. In addition to the standard univariate general linear modeling approach, we employed a data-driven technique (independent component analysis, or ICA) to separate task activity into functional networks. Among the networks most correlated with the experimental time course, there was a combined auditory-motor network in controls, but the two networks remained separable for individuals who stuttered. The decoupling of these networks may account for temporal variability in pitch compensation reported in our previous work, and supports the idea that neural network coherence is disturbed in the stuttering brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: Glioma cell infiltration, in which the glioma tumor cells spread long distances from the primary location using white matter (WM) or blood vessels, is known as a significant challenge for surgery or localized chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Following the World Health Organization (WHO), the glioma grading system ranges from stages I to IV, in which lower-grade gliomas represent benign tumors, and higher grade gliomas are considered the most malignant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: We gathered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data for seven patients with right precentral gyrus-located tumors and six age- and sex-matched healthy subjects for analysis. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) was utilized to evaluate whole-brain WM implication due to probable tumor infiltration. Also, along-tract statistics were used in order to trace the implicated WM tracts. Finally, for cortical evaluation of probable tumor cell migration, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was utilized, which allowed us to do whole-brain cortical estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The TBSS results revealed significantly higher fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower mean diffusivity (MD) in the left side superior corona radiata. Also, higher FA was observed in the right corticostriatal tract. Along-tract statistics were also compiled on the corpus callosum (CC), which is anatomically known as a hub between hemispheres. The body of the CC, which connected with the superior corona radiata anatomically, showed significantly higher FA values relative to healthy subjects, which are in line with the TBSS results. Consistent with these results, whole-brain gray matter changes were analyzed via VBM, which showed significant hypertrophy of both sides of the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In future investigations, focusing on the genetic basis of the glioma patients in line with imaging studies on a larger sample size, which is known as genetics imaging, would be a suitable approach for tracing this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Modern machine learning is based on powerful algorithms running on digital computing platforms and there is great interest in accelerating the learning process and making it more energy efficient. In this paper we present a fully autonomous probabilistic circuit for fast and efficient learning that makes no use of digital computing. Specifically we use SPICE simulations to demonstrate a clockless autonomous circuit where the required synaptic weights are read out in the form of analog voltages. This allows us to demonstrate a circuit that can be built with existing technology to emulate the Boltzmann machine learning algorithm based on gradient optimization of the maximum likelihood function. Such autonomous circuits could be particularly of interest as standalone learning devices in the context of mobile and edge computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature brain but has the paradoxical property of depolarizing neurons during early development. Depolarization provided by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission during this early phase regulates neural stem cell proliferation, neural migration, neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and circuit refinement, making GABA a key factor in neural circuit development. Importantly, depending on the context, depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission can either drive neural activity or inhibit it through shunting inhibition. The varying roles of depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission during development, and its ability to both drive and inhibit neural activity, makes it a difficult developmental cue to study. This is particularly true in the later stages of development when the majority of synapses form and GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission switches from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. Here, we addressed the importance of depolarizing but inhibitory (or shunting) GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission in glutamatergic synapse formation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We first showed that the developmental depolarizing-to-hyperpolarizing switch in GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission is recapitulated in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Based on the expression profile of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;−Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; co-transporter 2 (KCC2) and changes in the GABA reversal potential, we pinpointed the timing of the switch from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission in CA1 neurons. We found that blocking depolarizing but shunting GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission increased excitatory synapse number and strength, indicating that depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission can restrain glutamatergic synapse formation. The increase in glutamatergic synapses was activity-dependent but independent of BDNF signaling. Importantly, the elevated number of synapses was stable for more than a week after GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitors were washed out. Together these findings point to the ability of immature GABAergic transmission to restrain glutamatergic synapse formation and suggest an unexpected role for depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission in shaping excitatory connectivity during neural circuit development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) is a member of the Forkhead family of genes with non-redundant roles in brain development, where alteration of this gene’s expression significantly affects the formation and function of the mammalian cerebral cortex. FOXG1 haploinsufficiency in humans is associated with prominent differences in brain size and impaired intellectual development noticeable in early childhood, while homozygous mutations are typically fatal. As such, FOXG1 has been implicated in a wide spectrum of congenital brain disorders, including the congenital variant of Rett syndrome, infantile spasms, microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. Recent technological advances have yielded greater insight into phenotypic variations observed in FOXG1 syndrome, molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of the disease, and multifaceted roles of FOXG1 expression. In this review, we explore the emerging mechanisms of FOXG1 in a range of transcriptional to posttranscriptional events in order to evolve our current view of how a single transcription factor governs the assembly of an elaborate cortical circuit responsible for higher cognitive functions and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Exposure to toxic metals and metalloids is an important cause of preventable diseases worldwide. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) affects several organs and tissues, causing neurobehavioral alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) that might lead to neurodegeneration. In this work, we wanted to explore the time- and dose-related changes on glutathione (GSH) levels in several regions of the CNS, such as the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, to identify the initial cellular changes associated to GSH depletion due to iAs exposure. Mice received a single intraperitoneal injection containing 5 or 14 mg/kg sodium arsenite. Animals were killed at 2, 6, and 24 h. Significant depletion of GSH levels was observed in the cortex at 2 and 6 h, while on the striatum, hippocampus, or cerebellum regions, no significant changes were observed. GSH depletion in the cortex was associated with the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathways, which led to the upregulation of xCT, excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1), glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), and glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), and the activation of the transsulfuration pathways, which led to the overproduction of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in the cortex and increased levels of GSH in the cortex and cerebellum at 24 h. In the cortex, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B were also altered at 24 h. These early effects were not homogeneous among different brain regions and indicate early neurotoxic alterations in the cortex and cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Among non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's Disease (PD), peripheral, sensory symptoms are particularly relevant. Smell dysfunction starts very early and frequently precedes the PD motor symptoms by years (being often a cue to the diagnosis). Moreover, olfactory system could be, together with gut, one of those peripheral sites where PD pathology first develops. Unlike smell loss, the relationship between PD and taste impairment is far less established. It can start early in the course of the disease but more frequently appears in advanced stages, in parallel with the advent of MCI, likely reflecting cortical involvement. Among PD patients has been demonstrated an increase in the frequency of the non-tasters for PROP (prototypical gustatory stimulus, 6- n-propylthiouracil), a genetically determined bitter taste which is mediated by TAS2RS38 receptor, and a significant increase of the recessive non-testing variant of this receptor. TAS2R38 receptors are expressed also in other tissues, such as in the epithelia of the gut and nasal cavities, where they can influence epithelial immunity ad its interaction with microbiota. Those pieces of evidence suggest that not only systematic assessment of taste and smell can be of a remarkable help for clinicians in the early diagnosis, but also that understanding the mechanisms of sensory involvement in PD could increase the knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) demonstrate significant cognitive deficits, especially in the memory aspect. The memory deficiency might be attributed to the difficulties in the inhibitory function to suppress redundant stimuli. Sensory gating (SG) refers to the attenuation of neural responses to the second identical stimulus in a paired-click paradigm, in which auditory stimuli are delivered in pairs with inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) of 500 ms and inter-pair intervals of 6–8 s. It is considered as an electrophysiological signal to reflect the brain’s automatic response to gate out repetitive sensory inputs. However, there has been no study systematically investigating SG function in aMCI patients. Thus, the present study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record neuromagnetic responses to a paired-click paradigm in 23 healthy controls (HC) and 26 aMCI patients. The Stimulus 2/Stimulus 1 (S2/S1) amplitude ratio was used to represent the SG function. Compared to HC, aMCI patients showed M50 SG deficits in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL). M100 SG defects were also observed in the right IPL. Based on the ROIs showing significant between-group SG differences, we found that a more deficient M50 SG function in the right IPL was associated with poorer performance in the immediate recall of Logic Memory (LM), Chinese Version Verbal Learning Test (CVVLT) and Digit Span Backward (DSB) Test. Furthermore, the M50 SG ratios of the right IPL together with the neuropsychological performance of LM and CVVLT demonstrated very good accuracy in the discrimination of aMCI from HC. In conclusion, compared to HC, aMCI patients showed a significant SG deficit in the right IPL, which was correlated with the auditory short-term memory function. We suggest the combination of SG in the right IPL, LM and CVVLT to be sensitive indicators to differentiate aMCI patients from HC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Several sensorimotor modifications are known to occur with aging, possibly leading to adverse outcomes such as falls. Recently, some of those modifications have been proposed to emerge from motor planning deteriorations. Motor planning of vertical movements is thought to engage an internal model of gravity to anticipate its mechanical effects on the body-limbs and thus to genuinely produce movements that minimize muscle effort. This is supported, amongst other results, by direction-dependent kinematics where relative durations to peak accelerations and peak velocity are shorter for upward than for downward movements. The present study compares the motor planning of fast and slow vertical arm reaching movements between 18 young (24 ± 3 years old) and 17 older adults (70 ± 5 years old). We found that older participants still exhibit strong directional asymmetries (i.e., differences between upward and downward movements), indicating that optimization processes during motor planning persist with healthy aging. However, the size of these differences was increased in older participants, indicating that gravity-related motor planning changes with age. We discuss this increase as the possible result of an overestimation of gravity torque or increased weight of the effort cost in the optimization process. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that feedforward processes and, more precisely, optimal motor planning, remain active with healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Multiple-modality exercise improves brain function. However, whether task-based brain functional connectivity (FC) following exercise suggests adaptations in preferential brain regions is unclear. The objective of this study was to explore memory function and task-related FC changes following multiple-modality exercise and mind–motor training in older adults with subjective cognitive complaints.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We performed secondary analysis of memory function data in older adults [n = 127, mean age 67.5 (7.3) years, 71% women] randomized to an exercise intervention comprised of 45 min of multiple-modality exercise with additional 15 min of mind-motor training (M4 group, n = 63) or an active control group (M2 group, n = 64). In total, both groups exercised for 60 min/day, 3 days/week, for 24 weeks. We then conducted exploratory analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from a sample of participants from the M4 group [n = 9, mean age 67.8 (8.8) years, 8 women] who completed baseline and follow-up task-based fMRI assessment. Four computer-based memory tasks from the Cambridge Brain Sciences cognitive battery (i.e. Monkey Ladder, Spatial Span, Digit Span, Paired Associates) were employed, and participants underwent 5 min of continuous fMRI data collection while completing the tasks. Behavioral data were analyzed using linear mixed models for repeated measures and paired-samples t-test. All fMRI data were analyzed using group-level independent component analysis and dual regression procedures, correcting for voxel-wise comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicated that the M4 group showed greater improvements in the Paired Associates tasks compared to the M2 group at 24 weeks [mean difference: 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08 to 0.86, p = 0.019]. For our fMRI analysis, dual regression revealed significant decrease in FC co-activation in the right precentral/postcentral gyri after the exercise program during the Spatial Span task (corrected p = 0.008), although there was no change in the behavioral task performance. Only trends for changes in FC were found for the other tasks (all corrected p &amp;lt; 0.09). In addition, for the Paired Associates task, there was a trend for increased co-activation in the right temporal lobe (Brodmann Area = 38, corrected p = 0.07), and left middle frontal temporal gyrus (corrected p = 0.06). Post hoc analysis exploring voxel FC within each group spatial map confirmed FC activation trends observed from dual regression.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that multiple modality exercise with mind–motor training resulted in greater improvements in memory compared to an active control group. There were divergent FC adaptations including significant decreased co-activation in the precentral/postcentral gyri during the Spatial Span task. Borderline significant changes during the Paired Associates tasks in FC provided insight into the potential of our intervention to promote improvements in visuospatial memory and impart FC adaptations in brain regions relevant to Alzheimer’s disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov in April 2014, Identifier: NCT02136368.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through allostery, and it is increasingly clear that chemically distinct agonists can produce different receptor-based effects. It has been proposed that agonists selectively promote receptors to recruit one cellular interacting partner over another, introducing allosteric ‘bias’ into the signaling system. However, the underlying hypothesis - that different agonists drive GPCRs to engage different cytoplasmic proteins in living cells - remains untested due to the complexity of readouts through which receptor-proximal interactions are typically inferred. We describe a cell-based assay to overcome this challenge, based on GPCR-interacting biosensors that are disconnected from endogenous transduction mechanisms. Focusing on opioid receptors, we directly demonstrate differences between biosensor recruitment produced by chemically distinct opioid ligands in living cells. We then show that selective recruitment applies to GRK2, a biologically relevant GPCR regulator, through discrete interactions of GRK2 with receptors or with G protein beta-gamma subunits which are differentially promoted by agonists.</content>

 Voltage-gated ion channels feature voltage sensor domains (VSDs) that exist in three distinct conformations during activation: resting, intermediate, and activated. Experimental determination of the structure of a potassium channel VSD in the intermediate state has previously proven elusive. Here, we report and validate the experimental three-dimensional structure of the human KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium channel VSD in the intermediate state. We also used mutagenesis and electrophysiology in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocytes to functionally map the determinants of S4 helix motion during voltage-dependent transition from the intermediate to the activated state. Finally, the physiological relevance of the intermediate state KCNQ1 conductance is demonstrated using voltage-clamp fluorometry. This work illuminates the structure of the VSD intermediate state and demonstrates that intermediate state conductivity contributes to the unusual versatility of KCNQ1, which can function either as the slow delayed rectifier current (I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt;) of the cardiac action potential or as a constitutively active epithelial leak current.</content>

 Antioxidant systems, such as the thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) pathway, ensure cellular redox homeostasis. However, how such systems regulate development and function of myeloid cells is barely understood. Here we show that in contrast to its critical role in T cells, the murine Trx1 system is dispensable for steady-state myeloid-cell hematopoiesis due to their capacity to tap the glutathione/glutaredoxin pathway for DNA biosynthesis. However, the Trx1 pathway instrumentally enables nuclear NF-kB DNA-binding and thereby pro-inflammatory responses in monocytes and dendritic cells. Moreover, independent of this activity, Trx1 is critical for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1b production in macrophages by detoxifying excessive ROS levels. Notably, we exclude the involvement of the Trx1 inhibitor Txnip as a redox-sensitive ligand of NLRP3 as previously proposed. Together, this study suggests that targeting Trx1 may be exploited to treat inflammatory diseases.</content>

 Recent studies indicate that the precise timing and location of excitation and inhibition (E/I) within active dendritic trees can significantly impact neuronal function. How synaptic inputs are functionally organized at the subcellular level in intact circuits remains unclear. To address this issue, we took advantage of the retinal direction-selective ganglion cell circuit, where tuned inhibition is known to shape non-directional excitatory signals. We combined two-photon calcium imaging with genetic, pharmacological, and single-cell ablation methods to examine the extent to which inhibition 'vetoes' excitation at the level of individual dendrites of direction-selective ganglion cells. We demonstrate that inhibition accurately shapes direction selectivity independently within small dendritic segments (&amp;lt;10 μm) with remarkable accuracy. This suggests that the parallel processing schemes proposed for direction encoding could be more fine-grained than previously envisioned.</content>

 Voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (Cavs) are indispensable for coupling action potentials with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in living organisms. The structure of Cavs is similar to that of voltage-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (Navs). It is known that prokaryotic Navs can obtain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity by negative charge mutations of the selectivity filter, but native prokaryotic Cavs had not yet been identified. We report the first identification of a native prokaryotic Cav, CavMr, whose selectivity filter contains a smaller number of negatively charged residues than that of artificial prokaryotic Cavs. A relative mutant whose selectivity filter was replaced with that of CavMr exhibits high Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity. Mutational analyses revealed that the glycine residue of the CavMr selectivity filter is a determinant for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity. This glycine residue is well conserved among subdomains I and III of eukaryotic Cavs. These findings provide new insight into the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity mechanism that is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.</content>

 The Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma (Dcc) receptor plays a critical role in optic nerve development. Whilst Dcc is expressed postnatally in the eye, its function remains unknown as &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt; knockouts die at birth. To circumvent this drawback, we generated an eye-specific &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt; mutant. To study the organization of the retina and visual projections in these mice, we also established EyeDISCO&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; a novel tissue clearing protocol that removes melanin allowing 3D imaging of whole eyes and visual pathways. We show that in the absence of &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt;, some ganglion cell axons stalled at the optic disc, whereas others perforated the retina, separating photoreceptors from the retinal pigment epithelium. A subset of visual axons entered the CNS, but these projections are perturbed. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Dcc&lt;/i&gt;-deficient retinas displayed a massive postnatal loss of retinal ganglion cells and a large fraction of photoreceptors. Thus, Dcc is essential for the development and maintenance of the retina.</content>

 In the nematode &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, insulin signaling regulates development and aging in response to the secretion of numerous insulin peptides. Here, we describe a novel, non-signaling isoform of the nematode insulin receptor (IR), DAF-2B, that modulates insulin signaling by sequestration of insulin peptides. DAF-2B arises via alternative splicing and retains the extracellular ligand binding domain but lacks the intracellular signaling domain. A &lt;i&gt;daf-2b&lt;/i&gt; splicing reporter revealed active regulation of this transcript through development, particularly in the dauer larva, a diapause stage associated with longevity. CRISPR knock-in of mScarlet into the &lt;i&gt;daf-2b&lt;/i&gt; genomic locus confirmed that DAF-2B is expressed in vivo and is likely secreted. Genetic studies indicate that DAF-2B influences dauer entry, dauer recovery and adult lifespan by altering insulin sensitivity according to the prevailing insulin milieu. Thus, in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; alternative splicing at the &lt;i&gt;daf-2&lt;/i&gt; locus generates a truncated IR that fine-tunes insulin signaling in response to the environment.</content>

 Economic choices entail computing and comparing subjective values. Evidence from primates indicates that this behavior relies on the orbitofrontal cortex. Conversely, previous work in rodents provided conflicting results. Here we present a mouse model of economic choice behavior, and we show that the lateral orbital (LO) area is intimately related to the decision process. In the experiments, mice chose between different juices offered in variable amounts. Choice patterns closely resembled those measured in primates. Optogenetic inactivation of LO dramatically disrupted choices by inducing erratic changes of relative value and by increasing choice variability. Neuronal recordings revealed that different groups of cells encoded the values of individual options, the binary choice outcome and the chosen value. These groups match those previously identified in primates, except that the neuronal representation in mice is spatial (in monkeys it is good-based). Our results lay the foundations for a circuit-level analysis of economic decisions.</content>

 Therapeutic hypothermia is a standard therapy for neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. One potential additional therapy is the free radical scavenger edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one). To compare the neuroprotective effects of edaravone plus therapeutic hypothermia with those of therapeutic hypothermia alone after a hypoxic-ischaemic insult in the newborn piglet, anaesthetized piglets were subjected to 40 min of hypoxia (3-5% inspired oxygen) and cerebral ischaemia was assessed by cerebral blood volume. Body temperature was maintained at 38.5 {degrees}C in the normothermia group (NT, n = 8) and at 34 {degrees}C (24 h after the insult) in the therapeutic hypothermia (TH, n = 7) and therapeutic hypothermia plus edaravone (3 mg intravenous every 12 h for 3 days after the insult; TH+EV, n = 6) groups under mechanical ventilation. Five days after the insult, the mean (standard deviation) neurological scores were 10.9 (5.7) in the NT group, 17.0 (0.4) in the TH group ( p = 0.025 vs. NT) and 15.0 (3.9) in the TH+EV group. The histopathological score of the TH+EV group showed no significant improvement compared with that of the other groups. In conclusion, edaravone plus therapeutic hypothermia had no additive neuroprotective effects after hypoxia-ischaemia in neurological and histopathological assessments.</content>

 The hippocampal CA1 field integrates a wide variety of subcortical and cortical inputs, but its synaptic organization in humans is still unknown due to the difficulties involved studying the human brain via electron microscope techniques. However, we have shown that the 3D reconstruction method using Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM) can be applied to study in detail the synaptic organization of the human brain obtained from autopsies, yielding excellent results. Using this technology, 24,752 synapses were fully reconstructed in CA1, revealing that most of them were excitatory, targeting dendritic spines and displaying a macular shape, regardless of the layer examined. However, remarkable differences were observed between layers. These data constitute the first extensive description of the synaptic organization of the neuropil of the human CA1 region.</content>

 Deposition of beta-amyloid deposits is one major histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we introduce volumetric multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (vMSOT), which covers 10x10x10 mm3 field-of-view, capable of 3D whole mouse brain imaging. We show for the first time the optoacoustic properties of oxazine-derivative AOI987 probe, which binds to beta-amyloid, and the application of vMSOT for the quantification of brain-wide beta-amyloid; deposition. Administration of AOI987 to two common transgenic mouse strains of AD amyloidosis led to a retention of the probe in beta-amyloid-laden brain regions. Co-registered of vMSOT data to a brain atlas revealed strain-specific pattern of AOI987 uptake. A comparison with ex vivo light-sheet microscopy in cleared mouse brains showed a good correspondence in beta-amyloid; distribution. Lastly, we demonstrate the specificity of the AOI987 probe by immunohistochemistry. vMSOT with AOI987 facilitates preclinical brain region-specific studies of beta-amyloid; spread and accumulation, and the monitoring of putative treatments targeting beta-amyloid;.</content>

 The mammalian rod bipolar (RB) cell pathway is perhaps the best-studied circuit in the vertebrate retina. Its synaptic interactions with other retinal circuits, however, remain unresolved. Here, we combined anatomical and physiological analyses of the mouse retina to discover that the majority of synaptic inhibition to the AII amacrine cell (AC), the central neuron in the RB pathway, is provided by a single interneuron type: a multistratified, axon-bearing GABAergic AC, with dendrites in both ON and OFF synaptic layers, but with a pure ON (depolarizing) response to light. We used the nNOS-CreER mouse retina to confirm the identity of this interneuron as the wide-field NOS-1 AC. Our study demonstrates generally that novel neural circuits can be identified from targeted connectomic analyses and specifically that the NOS-1 AC mediates long-range inhibition during night vision and is a major element of the RB pathway.</content>

 The temporal pole (TP) is an associative cortical region required for complex cognitive functions such as social and emotional cognition. However, functional mapping of the TP with functional magnetic resonance imaging is technically challenging and thus understanding of its interaction with other key emotional circuitry, such as the amygdala, remain elusive. We exploited the unique advantages of stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) to assess the responses of the TP and the amygdala during the perception of emotionally salient stimuli of pictures, music and movies. These stimuli consistently elicited high gamma responses (70-140 Hz) in both the TP and the amygdala, accompanied by functional connectivity in the low frequency range (2-12 Hz). Computational analyses suggested the TP driving this effect in the theta-alpha frequency range and which was modulated by the emotional salience of the stimuli. Of note, cross-frequency analysis indicated the phase of theta-alpha oscillations in the TP modulated the amplitude of high gamma activity in the amygdala. These results were reproducible with three types of stimuli including naturalistic stimuli suggesting a hierarchical influence of the TP over the amygdala in non-threatening stimuli.</content>

 In higher mammals, the primary visual cortex (V1) is organized into diverse tuning maps of visual features such as orientation, spatial frequency and ocular dominance. The topography of these maps is observed to intersect orthogonally, implying that a developmental principle for efficient tiling of sensory modules may exist. However, it remains unclear how such a systematic relationship among cortical tuning maps could develop. Here, we show that the orthogonal organization of tuning modules already exist in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics, and that this provides a blueprint of the orthogonal organization in V1. Firstly, from the analysis of multi-electrode recording data in V1, we found that the ON-OFF subregion distance of receptive fields varies periodically across the cortical surface, strongly correlated to ocular dominance and spatial frequency in the area. Further, the ON-OFF alignment angle, that is orthogonal to the ON-OFF distance, appears to correlate with orientation tuning. These suggest that the orthogonal organization in V1 may originate from the spatial organization of the ON-OFF receptive fields in the bottom-up projections, and this scenario was tested from analysis of the RGC mosaics data in monkeys and cats. We found that the ON-OFF RGC distance and ON-OFF angle of neighbouring RGCs are organized into a topographic tiling across mosaics, analogous to the orthogonal intersection of cortical tuning maps. These findings suggest that the regularly structured ON-OFF patterns mirrored from a retina may initiate efficient tiling of functional domains in V1.</content>

 Serotonergic neurons modulate diverse physiological and behavioral processes in a context-dependent manner, based on their complex connectivity. However, their connectivity has not been comprehensively explored at a single-cell resolution. Using a whole-brain EM dataset we determined the wiring logic of a broadly projecting serotonergic neuron (the &quot;CSDn&quot;) in Drosophila. Within the antennal lobe (AL; first-order olfactory region), the CSDn receives glomerulus-specific input and preferentially targets distinct local interneuron subtypes. Furthermore, the wiring logic of the CSDn differs between olfactory regions. The CSDn innervates the AL and lateral horn (LH), yet does not maintain the same synaptic relationship with individual projection neurons that also span both regions. Consistent with this, the CSDn has more distributed connectivity in the LH relative to the AL, preferentially synapsing with principal neuron types based on presumptive transmitter content. Lastly, we identify protocerebral neurons that provide abundant synaptic input to the CSDn. Our study demonstrates how an individual modulatory neuron can interact with local networks and integrate input from non-olfactory sources.</content>

 Hydrogen peroxide is the preeminent chemical weapon that organisms use for combat. Individual cells rely on conserved defenses to prevent and repair peroxide-induced damage, but whether similar defenses might be coordinated across cells in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that processes information perceived by two sensory neurons to control the induction of hydrogen-peroxide defenses in the organism. We found that catalases produced by Escherichia coli, the nematode's food source, can deplete hydrogen peroxide from the local environment and thereby protect the nematodes. In the presence of E. coli, the nematode's neurons signal via TGF{beta}-insulin/IGF1 relay to target tissues to repress expression of catalases and other hydrogen-peroxide defenses. This adaptive strategy is the first example of a multicellular organism modulating its defenses when it expects to freeload from the protection provided by molecularly orthologous defenses from another species.</content>

 Insular and anterior cingulate cortex activation across vicarious pain induction procedures suggests that they are core pain empathy nodes. However, pain empathic responses encompass emotional contagion as well as unspecific arousal and overlapping functional activations are not sufficient to determine shared and process-specific neural representations. We employed multivariate pattern analyses to fMRI data acquired during physical and affective vicarious pain induction and found spatially and functionally similar cross-modality (physical versus affective) whole-brain vicarious pain-predictive patterns. Further analyses consistently identified shared neural representations in the bilateral mid-insula. Mid-insula vicarious pain patterns were not sensitive to capture non-painful arousing negative stimuli but predicted self-experienced pain during thermal stimulation, suggesting process-specific representation of emotional contagion for pain. Finally, a domain-general vicarious pain pattern which predicted vicarious as well as self-experienced pain was developed. Our findings demonstrate a generalizable neural expression of vicarious pain and suggest that the mid-insula encodes emotional contagion for pain.</content>

 Mapping neuroanatomy is a foundational goal towards understanding brain function. Electron microscopy (EM) has been the gold standard for connectivity analysis because nanoscale resolution is necessary to unambiguously resolve chemical and electrical synapses. However, molecular information that specifies cell types is often lost in EM reconstructions. To address this, we devised a light microscopy approach for connectivity analysis of defined cell types called spectral connectomics. We combined multicolor genetic labeling (Brainbow) of neurons with a multi-round immunostaining Expansion Microscopy (miriEx) strategy to simultaneously interrogate morphology, molecular markers, and connectivity in the same brain section. We applied our multimodal profiling strategy to directly link inhibitory neuron cell types with their network morphologies. Furthermore, we showed that correlative Brainbow and endogenous synaptic machinery immunostaining can be used to define putative synaptic connections between spectrally unique neurons, as well as map putative inhibitory and excitatory inputs. We envision that spectral connectomics can be applied routinely in neurobiology labs to gain insights into normal and pathophysiological neuroanatomy across multiple animals and time points.</content>

 Background: Single-unit recording in Pavlovian conditioning tasks requires the use of within-subject designs as well as sampling a considerable number of trials per trial type and session, which increases the total trial count. Pavlovian conditioning, on the other hand, requires a long average intertrial interval (ITI) relative to cue duration for cue-specific learning to occur. These requirements combined can make the session duration unfeasibly long. New Method: To circumvent this issue, we developed a self-initiated variant of the Pavlovian magazine-approach procedure in rodents. Unlike the standard procedure, where the animals passively receive the trials, the self-initiated procedure grants animals agency to self-administer and self-pace trials from a predetermined, pseudorandomized list. Critically, whereas in the standard procedure the typical ITI is in the order of minutes, our procedure uses a much shorter ITI (10 s). Results: Despite such a short ITI, discrimination learning in the self-initiated procedure is comparable to that observed in the standard procedure with a typical ITI, and superior to that observed in the standard procedure with an equally short ITI. Comparison with Existing Method(s): The self-initiated procedure permits delivering 100 trials in a ~1-h session, almost doubling the number of trials safely attainable over that period with the standard procedure. Conclusions: The self-initiated procedure enhances the collection of neural correlates of cue-reward learning while producing good discrimination performance. Other advantages for neural recording studies include ensuring that at the start of each trial the animal is engaged, attentive and in the same location within the conditioning chamber.</content>

 Paranoia is the belief that harm is intended by others. It may arise from selective pressures to infer and avoid social threats, particularly in ambiguous or changing circumstances. We propose that uncertainty may be sufficient to elicit learning differences in paranoid individuals, without social threat. We used reversal learning behaviour and computational modelling to estimate belief updating across individuals with and without mental illness, online participants, and rats exposed to chronic methamphetamine, an elicitor of paranoia in humans. Paranoia is associated with a strong but immutable prior on volatility, accompanied by elevated sensitivity to perceived changes in the task environment. Methamphetamine exposure in rats recapitulates this impaired uncertainty-driven belief updating and rigid anticipation of a volatile environment. Our work provides evidence of fundamental, domain-general learning differences in paranoid individuals. This paradigm enables further assessment of the interplay between uncertainty and belief-updating across individuals and species.</content>

 In this study, we investigated the effect of experimentally delivered acute pain on explicit and implicit memory. Twenty-five subjects participated in experimental sessions on consecutive days. The first session involved a categorization task intended to induce incidental memory encoding. There were two conditions, presented in randomized order, in which subjects listened to a series of words, which was repeated three times. In one condition, one-third of the word items were immediately followed by a painful electrical shock and these pain-paired items were presented unpredictably. In the other condition, all word items were not associated with pain. Response times over these repeated presentations were assessed for differences. Explicit memory was tested the following day, employing a Remember-Know assessment of word recognition, with no shocks employed. Recollection was significantly reduced for pain-paired words, as the proportion of correct Remember responses (out of total correct responses) was significantly lower. There were no significant reductions in memory for non-pain items that followed painful stimulation after a period of several seconds. Consistent with the experience of pain consuming working memory resources, we theorize that painful shocks interrupt memory encoding for the immediately preceding experimental items, due to a shift in attention away from the word item.</content>

 Infra-slow (&amp;lt;0.01Hz) and fast beta/gamma (15 - 60 Hz) oscillations in neurophysiological activity have been widely found in the subcortical visual system. While it is well established that fast beta/gamma oscillations are involved in visual processing the role (if any) of infra-slow oscillations is currently unknown. In this study we tested the possibility that infra-slow oscillations affect visual processing by modulating fast beta/gamma oscillations. We recorded spontanous activity in vivo from the mouse subcortical visual system. We found that in neurons expressing both rhythms the phase of infra-slow modulates the amplitude of fast beta/gamma oscillations. Moreover the level of co-expression of these rhythms was substantially above chance suggesting that these rhythms are functionally linked. To further investigate infra-slow and fast beta/gamma coupling we asked whether its emergence was contingent upon intact rod/cone and melanopsin photoreception. In animals with non-functional rod/cone vision fast beta/gamma were abolished while infra-slow were potentiated indicating that infra-slow and fast beta/gamma are distinct events. In animals with genetic deletion of melanopsin both rhythms were expressed but their interaction was substantially disrupted. Together our results indicate that infra-slow oscillations are separable phenomena tied together by vision. Thus under physiological conditions infra-slow modulate fast beta/gamma oscillations through a sizeable population of neurons expressing both rhythms.</content>

 Cognitive deficits in Down syndrome (DS) can originate from cortical over-inhibition, but whether this is due to specific alterations of distinct GABAergic circuits is unknown. In the prefrontal cortex of a DS mouse model, we found specific enhancement of dendritic inhibition and altered excitability of perisomatic inhibitory interneurons. These effects resulted in reduced pyramidal-neuron firing and increased phase locking to cognitive-relevant network oscillations in vivo. Our results reveal potential circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits of DS.</content>

 This work explored hybrid films of silver nanowires (AgNWs) with indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO) for developing high-performance and low-cost electrocorticography (ECoG) electrodes. The hybrid films achieved a sheet resistance of 6 {Omega}/sq while maintaining a transparency of {approx}60% at 550 nm. Electrodes with 500 m diameter were fabricated with these films and reached an impedance of 20 k{Omega} at 1 kHz and a charge storage capacity of 3.2 mC/cm2, a 2x and 320x improvement over IZO electrodes, respectively. Characterization of light-induced artifacts was performed showing that small light intensities (&amp;lt;14 mW/mm2) elicit electrical potential variation in the magnitude order of baseline noise. The validation of electrodes in vivo was achieved by recording electrical neural activity from the surface of rat cortex under anaesthesia. Moreover, the presence of the films did not cause obstruction of light during fluorescence microscopy. The presented film and electrode characterization studies highlighted the capabilities of this hybrid structure to fabricate transparent and flexible electrodes that are able to combine the superior temporal resolution of extracellular electrophysiology with the spatial resolution offered by optical imaging.</content>

 What is selected when attention is directed to a specific location of the visual field? Theories of object-based attention have suggested that when spatial attention is directed to part of an object, attention does not simply enhance the attended location but automatically spreads to enhance all locations that comprise the object. Here, we tested this hypothesis by reconstructing the distribution of attention from population neuronal activity patterns in V1 using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and population-based receptive field mapping. We find that attention spreads from a spatially cued location to the underlying object - and enhances all spatial locations that comprise the object. Importantly, this spreading was also evident when the object was not task-relevant. These data suggest that attentional selection automatically operates at an object level, facilitating the reconstruction of coherent objects from fragmented representations in early visual cortex.</content>

 Protection of organismal integrity involves both molecular cytoprotective responses and behavioral defenses. Here we show that exposure of Caenorhabditis elegans to high concentrations of naturally attractive food-derived odors, benzaldehyde and diacetyl, induces toxicity and aversive behavior. Benzaldehyde preconditioning activates systemic cytoprotective responses involving DAF-16/FOXO, SKN-1/Nrf and Hsp90 in somatic cells, which confer behavioral tolerance to benzaldehyde and cross-tolerance to methyl-salicylate, but not to diacetyl. In contrast, diacetyl preconditioning augments diacetyl avoidance and does not induce apparent molecular defenses. Reinforcement of the experiences by massed training forms relevant associative memories. Memory retrieval by the odor olfactory cues leads to avoidance of food contaminated by diacetyl and context-dependent behavioral decision to avoid benzaldehyde only if there is an alternative, food-indicative odor. Our findings reveal a regulatory link between cytoprotective mechanisms and behavior which facilitates self-protection in real and anticipated stresses and might have relevance in maladaptive avoidant human behaviors.</content>

 CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing may allow treating and studying rare genetic disorders by respectively, correcting disease mutations in patients, or introducing them in cell cultures. Both applications are highly dependent on Cas9 and sgRNA delivery efficiency. While gene editing methods are usually efficiently applied to cell lines such as HEK293 or hiPSCs, CRISPR/Cas9 editing in vivo or in cultured myoblasts prove to be much less efficient, limiting its use. After a careful optimisation of different steps of the editing protocol, we established a consistent approach to generate human immortalised myoblasts disease models through CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Using this protocol we successfully created a coding deletion of exon 52 of the DYSTROPHIN (DMD) gene in wild type immortalised myoblasts modelling Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and a microRNA binding sites deletion in the regulatory region of the UTROPHIN (UTRN) gene leading to utrophin upregulation in in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patient immortalised cultures. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the corresponding genomic alterations and protein expression was characterised using myoblots. To show the utility of these cultures as platforms for assessing the efficiency of DMD treatments, we used them to evaluate the impact of exon skipping therapy and ezutromid treatment. Our editing protocol may be useful to others interested in genetically manipulating myoblasts and the resulting edited cultures for studying DMD disease mechanisms and assessing therapeutic approaches.</content>

 Choices rely on a transformation of sensory inputs into motor responses. Using invasive single neuron recordings, the evolution of a choice process has been tracked by projecting population neural responses into state spaces. Here we develop an approach that allows us to recover state space trajectories on a millisecond timescale in non-invasive human recordings. We selectively suppress activity related to relevant and irrelevant sensory inputs and response direction in magnetoencephalography data acquired during context-dependent choices. Recordings from premotor cortex show a smooth progression from sensory input encoding to response encoding. In contrast to previous macaque recordings, information related to choice-irrelevant features is represented more weakly than choice-relevant sensory information. To test whether this mechanistic difference between species is caused by extensive overtraining common in non-human primate studies, we trained humans on &amp;gt;20,000 trials of the task. Choice-irrelevant features were still weaker than relevant features in premotor cortex after overtraining.</content>

Increasing availability of comprehensive experimental datasets and of high-performance computing resources are driving rapid growth in scale, complexity, and biological realism of computational models in neuroscience. To support construction and simulation, as well as sharing of such large-scale models, a broadly applicable, flexible, and high-performance data format is necessary. To address this need, we have developed the Scalable Open Network Architecture TemplAte (SONATA) data format. It is designed for memory and computational efficiency and works across multiple platforms. The format represents neuronal circuits and simulation inputs and outputs via standardized files and provides much flexibility for adding new conventions or extensions. SONATA is used in multiple modeling and visualization tools, and we also provide reference Application Programming Interfaces and model examples to catalyze further adoption. SONATA format is free and open for the community to use and build upon with the goal of enabling efficient model building, sharing, and reproducibility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OfUKjuXg6SI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Complex molecular biological processes such as transcription and translation, signal transduction, post-translational modification cascades, and metabolic pathways can be described in principle by biochemical reactions that explicitly take into account the sophisticated network of chemical interactions regulating cell life. The ability to deduce the possible qualitative behaviors of such networks from a set of reactions is a central objective and an ongoing challenge in the field of systems biology. Unfortunately, the construction of complete mathematical models is often hindered by a pervasive problem: despite the wealth of qualitative graphical knowledge about network interactions, the form of the governing nonlinearities and/or the values of kinetic constants are hard to uncover experimentally. The kinetics can also change with environmental variations. This work addresses the following question: given a set of reactions and without assuming a particular form for the kinetics, what can we say about the asymptotic behavior of the network? Specifically, it introduces a class of networks that are “structurally (mono) attractive” meaning that they are incapable of exhibiting multiple steady states, oscillation, or chaos by virtue of their reaction graphs. These networks are characterized by the existence of a universal energy-like function called a &lt;i&gt;Robust Lyapunov function&lt;/i&gt; (RLF). To find such functions, a finite set of rank-one linear systems is introduced, which form the extremals of a linear convex cone. The problem is then reduced to that of finding a common Lyapunov function for this set of extremals. Based on this characterization, a computational package, Lyapunov-Enabled Analysis of Reaction Networks (LEARN), is provided that constructs such functions or rules out their existence. An extensive study of biochemical networks demonstrates that LEARN offers a new unified framework. Basic motifs, three-body binding, and genetic networks are studied first. The work then focuses on cellular signalling networks including various post-translational modification cascades, phosphotransfer and phosphorelay networks, T-cell kinetic proofreading, and ERK signalling. The Ribosome Flow Model is also studied.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UfUKO5iF130&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Human movements are flexible as they continuously adapt to changes in the environment. The recalibration of corrective responses to sustained perturbations (e.g., constant force) altering one’s movement contributes to this flexibility. We asked whether the recalibration of corrective actions involve cerebral structures using stroke as a disease model. We characterized changes in muscle activity in stroke survivors and control subjects before, during, and after walking on a split-belt treadmill moving the legs at different speeds. The recalibration of corrective muscle activity was comparable between stroke survivors and control subjects, which was unexpected given the known deficits in feedback responses poststroke. Also, the intact recalibration in stroke survivors contrasted their limited ability to adjust their muscle activity during steady-state split-belt walking. Our results suggest that the recalibration and execution of motor commands are partially dissociable: cerebral lesions interfere with the execution, but not the recalibration, of motor commands on novel movement demands.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM), a technique where volumes of tissue can be anatomically reconstructed by imaging consecutive tissue slices, has proven to be a powerful tool for the investigation of brain anatomy. Between the process of cutting the slices—or &quot;sections&quot;—and imaging them, however, handling 10°-10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; delicate sections remains a bottleneck in ssEM, especially for batches in the &quot;mesoscale&quot; regime, i.e.,10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; sections. We present a tissue section handling device that transports and positions sections—accurately and repeatability—for automated, robotic section pick-up and placement onto an imaging substrate. The device interfaces with a conventional ultramicrotomy diamond knife, accomplishing in-line, exact-constraint trapping of sections with 100 µm repeatability. An associated mathematical model includes capillary- and Stokes-based forces, accurately describing observed behavior and fundamentally extends the modeling of water-air interface forces. Using the device, we demonstrate and describe the limits of reliable handling of hundreds of slices onto a variety of electron and light microscopy substrates without significant defects (n=8 datasets composed of 126 serial sections in an automated fashion with an average loss rate and throughput of 0.50% and 63 seconds/section, respectively. In total, this work represents an automated mesoscale serial sectioning system for scalable 3D-EM connectomics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM), a technique where volumes of tissue can be anatomically reconstructed by imaging consecutive tissue slices, has proven to be a powerful tool for studying neuroanatomy. However, between the process of cutting the slices and imaging them, handling 10°-10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; delicate slices—or &quot;sections&quot;—remains a bottleneck in ssEM, especially for batches in the &quot;mesoscale&quot; regime, i.e.,10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; sections. Here, we present a section handling device that transports and positions sections for automated, robotic section pick-up and placement onto an imaging substrate. As a part of this device, we characterize a trapping technique that utilizes curvature-induced capillary-based forces and hydrodynamic Stokes drag-based forces. In total, this work represents an automated mesoscale serial sectioning system for scalable 3D-EM connectomics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;To make full use of optogenetic and molecular techniques in the study of motor control, rich behavioral paradigms for rodentsmust rise to the same level of sophistication and applicability. We describe the layout, construction, use and analysis of data from joystick-based reaching in ahead-fixed mouse. The step-by-step guide is designed for both experienced rodent motor labs and new groups looking to enter into this research space. Using this platform,mice learn to consistently perform large, easily-quantified reaches, including during a two-armed bandit probabilistic learning task.The metrics of performance (reach trajectory, amplitude, speed, duration, and inter-reach interval) can be used to quantify behavior or administer stimulation in closed loop with behavior. We provide a highly customizable, low costand reproducible open-source behavior training platform for studying motor control, decision making, and reaching reaction time. The development of this software and hardware platform enables behavioral work to complement recent advances in rodents, while remaining accessible to smaller institutions and labs, thus providing a high-throughput method to study unexploredfeatures of action selection, motivation, and value-based decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We are realizing that the behavioral repertoire of mice is much richer than previously thought, including motor control and decision-making using reaches. Modern neuroscience is now capturing this richness, paired with new genetic tools, to understand fundamental neuroscience principles. Here, we provide an illustrated build guide, code, multiple use scenarios, and analytic tools to a low-cost, highly customizable mouse joystick. This tool will enable improved throughput, accessibility, and experimental design (e.g. spatiotemporal reach trajectories over lever presses) for labs wishing to study a range of reach-based experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, the number of mental disorder
patients, especially depression patients, has grown rapidly and become a
leading contributor to the global burden of disease. However, the present
common practice of depression diagnosis is based on interviews and clinical
scales carried out by doctors, which is not only labor-consuming but also
time-consuming. One important reason is due to the lack of physiological
indicators for mental disorders. With the rising of tools such as data mining
and artificial intelligence, using physiological data to explore new possible
physiological indicators of mental disorder and creating new applications for
mental disorder diagnosis has become a new research hot topic. However, good
quality physiological data for mental disorder patients are hard to acquire. We
present a multi-model open dataset for mental-disorder analysis. The dataset
includes EEG and audio data from clinically depressed patients and matching
normal controls. All our patients were carefully diagnosed and selected by
professional psychiatrists in hospitals. The EEG dataset includes not only data
collected using traditional 128-electrodes mounted elastic cap, but also a
novel wearable 3-electrode EEG collector for pervasive applications. The
128-electrodes EEG signals of 53 subjects were recorded as both in resting
state and under stimulation; the 3-electrode EEG signals of 55 subjects were
recorded in resting state; the audio data of 52 subjects were recorded during
interviewing, reading, and picture description. We encourage other researchers
in the field to use it for testing their methods of mental-disorder analysis.

		<updated>2020-02-24T01:30:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Recent experiments suggested that homeostatic regulation of synaptic balance
leads the visual system to recover and maintain a regime of power-law
avalanches. Here we study an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) mean-field neuronal
network that has a critical point with power-law avalanches and synaptic
balance. When short term depression in inhibitory synapses and firing threshold
adaptation are added, the system hovers around the critical point. This
homeostatically self-organized quasi-critical (SOqC) dynamics generates E/I
synaptic current cancellation in fast time scales, causing fluctuation-driven
asynchronous-irregular (AI) firing. We present the full phase diagram of the
model without adaptation varying external input versus synaptic coupling. This
system has a rich dynamical repertoire of spiking patterns: synchronous regular
(SR), asynchronous regular (AR), synchronous irregular (SI), slow oscillations
(SO) and AI. It also presents dynamic balance of synaptic currents, since
inhibitory currents try and compensate excitatory currents over time, resulting
in both of them scaling linearly with external input. Our model thus unifies
two different perspectives on cortical spontaneous activity: both critical
avalanches and fluctuation-driven AI firing arise from SOqC homeostatic
adaptation, and are indeed two sides of the same coin.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;With an estimated five million new stroke survivors every year and a rapidly
aging population suffering from hyperintensities and diseases of presumed
vascular origin that affect white matter and contribute to cognitive decline,
it is critical that we understand the impact of white matter damage on brain
structure and behavior. Current techniques for assessing the impact of lesions
consider only location, type, and extent, while ignoring how the affected
region was connected to the rest of the brain. Regional brain function is a
product of both local structure and its connectivity. Therefore, obtaining a
map of white matter disconnection is a crucial step that could help us predict
the behavioral deficits that patients exhibit. In the present work, we
introduce a new practical method for computing lesion-based white matter
disconnection maps that require only moderate computational resources. We
achieve this by creating diffusion tractography models of the brains of healthy
adults and assessing the connectivity between small regions. We then interrupt
these connectivity models by projecting patients' lesions into them to compute
predicted white matter disconnection. A quantified disconnection map can be
computed for an individual patient in approximately 35 seconds using a single
core CPU-based computation. In comparison, a similar quantification performed
with other tools provided by MRtrix3 takes 5.47 minutes.

 &lt;p&gt;We present a hybrid method that performs the complete parcellation of the
cerebral cortex of an individual, based on the connectivity information of the
white matter fibers from a whole-brain tractography dataset. The method
consists of five steps, first intra-subject clustering is performed on the
brain tractography. The fibers that make up each cluster are then intersected
with the cortical mesh and then filtered to discard outliers. In addition, the
method resolves the overlapping between the different intersection regions
(sub-parcels) throughout the cortex efficiently. Finally, a post-processing is
done to achieve more uniform sub-parcels. The output is the complete labeling
of cortical mesh vertices, representing the different cortex sub-parcels, with
strong connections to other sub-parcels. We evaluated our method with measures
of brain connectivity such as functional segregation (clustering coefficient),
functional integration (characteristic path length) and small-world. Results in
five subjects from ARCHI database show a good individual cortical parcellation
for each one, composed of about 200 subparcels per hemisphere and complying
with these connectivity measures.

 &lt;p&gt;Our ability to interact with the world around us relies on being able to
infer what actions objects afford -- often referred to as affordances. The
neural mechanisms of object-action associations are realized in the visuomotor
pathway where information about both visual properties and actions is
integrated into common representations. However, explicating these mechanisms
is particularly challenging in the case of affordances because there is hardly
any one-to-one mapping between visual features and inferred actions. To better
understand the nature of affordances, we trained a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN) to recognize affordances from images and to learn the underlying
features or the dimensionality of affordances. Such features form an underlying
compositional structure for the general representation of affordances which can
then be tested against human neural data. We view this representational
analysis as the first step towards a more formal account of how humans perceive
and interact with the environment.

 &lt;p&gt;Quantitative MRI modalities, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) are sensitive to the neuronal effects of aging of the cerebral white matter (WM), but lack the specificity for myelin content. Myelin water imaging (MWI) is highly specific for myelin and may be more sensitive for the detection of changes in myelin content inside the cerebral WM microstructure. In this multiparametric imaging study, we evaluated the performance of myelin water fraction (MWF) estimates as a marker for myelin alterations during normal-aging. Multiparametric MRI data derived from DTI, MTI and a novel, recently-proposed MWF-map processing and reconstruction algorithm were acquired from 54 healthy subjects (aged 18–79 years) and region-based multivariate regression analysis was performed. MWFs significantly decreased with age in most WM regions (except corticospinal tract) and changes of MWFs were associated with changes of radial diffusivity, indicating either substantial alterations or preservation of myelin content in these regions. Decreases of fractional anisotropy and magnetization transfer ratio were associated with lower MWFs in commissural fiber tracts only. Mean diffusivity had no regional effects on MWF. We conclude that MWF estimates are sensitive for the assessment of age-related myelin alterations in the cerebral WM of normal-aging brains.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by travellers who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Mitochondria control the activity, quality, and lifetime of their proteins with an autonomous system of chaperones, but the signals that direct substrate-chaperone interactions and outcomes are poorly understood. We previously discovered that the mitochondrial AAA+ protein unfoldase ClpX (mtClpX) activates the initiating enzyme for heme biosynthesis, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS), by promoting cofactor incorporation. Here, we ask how mtClpX accomplishes this activation. Using &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;proteins, we identified sequence and structural features within ALAS that position mtClpX and provide it with a grip for acting on ALAS. Observation of ALAS undergoing remodeling by mtClpX revealed that unfolding is limited to a region extending from the mtClpX-binding site to the active site. Unfolding along this path is required for mtClpX to gate cofactor binding to ALAS. This targeted unfolding contrasts with the global unfolding canonically executed by ClpX homologs and provides insight into how substrate-chaperone interactions direct the outcome of remodeling.</content>

 Pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) are an essential component of the gas exchange machinery of the lung alveolus. Despite this, the extent and function of lung EC heterogeneity remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell analytics, we identify multiple EC populations in the mouse lung, including macrovascular endothelium (maEC), microvascular endothelium (miECs), and a new population we have termed &lt;i&gt;Car4&lt;/i&gt;-high ECs. &lt;i&gt;Car4&lt;/i&gt;-high ECs express a unique gene signature, and ligand-receptor analysis indicates they are primed to receive reparative signals from alveolar type I cells. After acute lung injury, they are preferentially localized in regenerating regions of the alveolus. Influenza infection reveals the emergence of a population of highly proliferative ECs that likely arise from multiple miEC populations and contribute to alveolar revascularization after injury. These studies map EC heterogeneity in the adult lung and characterize the response of novel EC subpopulations required for tissue regeneration after acute lung injury.</content>

 Despite the medical importance of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;cellular heterogeneity of GPCR signaling and downstream transcriptional responses are not understood. We report the comprehensive characterization of transcriptomes (bulk and single-cell) and chromatin domains regulated by sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) in adult mouse aortic endothelial cells. First, S1PR1 regulates NFkB and nuclear glucocorticoid receptor pathways to suppress inflammation-related mRNAs. Second, S1PR1 signaling in the heterogenous endothelial cell (EC) subtypes occurs at spatially-distinct areas of the aorta. For example, a transcriptomically distinct arterial EC population at vascular branch points (aEC1) exhibits ligand-independent S1PR1/β-arrestin coupling. In contrast, circulatory S1P-dependent S1PR1/β-arrestin coupling was observed in non-branch point aEC2 cells that exhibit an inflammatory gene expression signature. Moreover, S1P/S1PR1 signaling regulates the expression of lymphangiogenic and inflammation-related transcripts in an adventitial lymphatic EC (LEC) population in a ligand-dependent manner. These insights add resolution to existing concepts of GPCR signaling and S1P biology.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Previously, we developed a 3-dimensional cell culture model of human tuberculosis (TB) and demonstrated its potential to interrogate the host-pathogen interaction (Tezera et al, 2017). Here, we use the model to investigate mechanisms whereby immune checkpoint therapy for cancer paradoxically activates TB infection. In patients, PD-1 is expressed in &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb)-infected lung tissue but absent in areas of immunopathology. In the microsphere model, PD-1 ligands are up-regulated by infection, and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is further induced by hypoxia. Inhibition of PD-1 signalling increases Mtb growth, and augments cytokine secretion. TNF-α is responsible for accelerated Mtb growth, and TNF-α neutralisation reverses augmented Mtb growth caused by anti-PD-1 treatment. In human TB, pulmonary TNF-α immunoreactivity is increased and circulating PD-1 expression negatively correlates with sputum TNF-α concentrations. Together, our findings demonstrate that PD-1 regulates the immune response in TB, and inhibition of PD-1 accelerates Mtb growth via excessive TNF-α secretion.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The vertebral skeleton is a defining feature of vertebrate animals. However, the mode of vertebral segmentation varies considerably between major lineages. In tetrapods, adjacent somite halves recombine to form a single vertebra through the process of 'resegmentation'. In teleost fishes, there is considerable mixing between cells of the anterior and posterior somite halves, without clear resegmentation. To determine whether resegmentation is a tetrapod novelty, or an ancestral feature of jawed vertebrates, we tested the relationship between somites and vertebrae in a cartilaginous fish, the skate (&lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;). Using cell lineage tracing, we show that skate trunk vertebrae arise through tetrapod-like resegmentation, with anterior and posterior halves of each vertebra deriving from adjacent somites. We further show that tail vertebrae also arise through resegmentation, though with a duplication of the number of vertebrae per body segment. These findings resolve axial resegmentation as an ancestral feature of the jawed vertebrate body plan.</content>

		<content type="html">
 A central function of many neural circuits is to rapidly extract salient information from sensory inputs. Detecting approaching motion is an example of a challenging computational task that is important for avoiding threats and navigating through the environment. Here, we report that detection of approaching motion begins at the earliest stages of visual processing in primates. Several ganglion cell types, the retinal output neurons, show selectivity to approaching motion. Synaptic current recordings from these cells further reveal that this preference for approaching motion arises in the interplay between presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory circuit elements. These findings demonstrate how excitatory and inhibitory circuits interact to mediate an ethologically relevant neural function. They further indicate that the elementary computations that detect approaching motion begin early in the visual stream of primates.</content>

 Despite advances in methods to detect protein synthesis, it has not been possible to measure endogenous protein synthesis levels in vivo in an entire vertebrate brain. We developed a transgenic zebrafish line that allows for cell-type-specific labeling and imaging of nascent proteins in the entire animal. By replacing leucine with glycine in the zebrafish MetRS-binding pocket (MetRS-L270G), we enabled the cell-type-specific incorporation of the azide-bearing non-canonical-amino-acid azidonorleucine (ANL) during protein synthesis. Newly synthesized proteins were then labeled via 'click chemistry'. Using a Gal4-UAS-ELAV3 line to express MetRS-L270G in neurons, we measured protein synthesis intensities across the entire nervous system. We visualized endogenous protein synthesis and demonstrated that seizure-induced neural activity results in enhanced translation levels in neurons. This method allows for robust analysis of endogenous protein synthesis in a cell-type-specific manner, in vivo at single-cell resolution.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Control of cell death/survival balance is an important feature to maintain tissue homeostasis. Dependence receptors are able to induce either survival or cell death in presence or absence of their ligand, respectively. However, their precise mechanism of action and their physiological importance are still elusive for most of them including the MET receptor. We evidence that pro-apoptotic fragment generated by caspase cleavage of MET localizes to the mitochondria-associated membrane region. This fragment triggers a calcium transfer from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria, which is instrumental for the apoptotic action of the receptor. Knock-in mice bearing a mutation of MET caspase cleavage site highlighted that p40MET production is important for FAS-driven hepatocyte apoptosis, and demonstrate that MET acts as a dependence receptor in vivo. Our data shed light on new signaling mechanisms for dependence receptors’ control of cell survival/death balance, which may offer new clues for the pathophysiology of epithelial structures.</content>

&lt;p&gt;Expanding use of immune‐checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) underscores the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely management of neurological immune‐related adverse events (irAE‐N). We evaluate the real‐world frequency, phenotypes, co‐occurring immune‐related adverse events (irAEs), and long‐term outcomes of severe, grade III‐V irAE‐N at a tertiary‐care center over 6 years. We analyze how our experience supports published literature and professional society guidelines. We also discuss these data with regard to common clinical scenarios, such as combination therapy, ICI re‐challenge and risk of relapse of irAE‐N, and corticosteroid taper, which are not specifically addressed by current guidelines and/or have limited data. Recommendations for management and future irAE‐N reporting are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;

Cell-to-cell variability generates subpopulations of drug-tolerant cells that diminish the efficacy of cancer drugs. Efficacious combination therapies are thus needed to block drug-tolerant cells via minimizing the impact of heterogeneity. Probabilistic models such as Bliss independence have been developed to evaluate drug interactions and their combination efficacy based on probabilities of specific actions mediated by drugs individually and in combination. In practice, however, these models are often applied to conventional dose-response curves in which a normalized parameter with a value between zero and one, generally referred to as fraction of cells affected (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;), is used to evaluate the efficacy of drugs and their combined interactions. We use basic probability theory, computer simulations, time-lapse live cell microscopy, and single-cell analysis to show that &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; metrics may bias our assessment of drug efficacy and combination effectiveness. This bias may be corrected when dynamic probabilities of drug-induced phenotypic events, i.e. induction of cell death and inhibition of division, at a single-cell level are used as metrics to assess drug efficacy. Probabilistic phenotype metrics offer the following three benefits. First, in contrast to the commonly used &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; metrics, they directly represent probabilities of drug action in a cell population. Therefore, they deconvolve differential degrees of drug effect on tumor cell killing versus inhibition of cell division, which may not be correlated for many drugs. Second, they increase the sensitivity of short-term drug response assays to cell-to-cell heterogeneities and the presence of drug-tolerant subpopulations. Third, their probabilistic nature allows them to be used directly in unbiased evaluation of synergistic efficacy in drug combinations using probabilistic models such as Bliss independence. Altogether, we envision that probabilistic analysis of single-cell phenotypes complements currently available assays via improving our understanding of heterogeneity in drug response, thereby facilitating the discovery of more efficacious combination therapies to block drug-tolerant cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ivq4hLChHLc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In multi-ciliated cells, directed and synchronous ciliary beating in the apical membrane occurs through appropriate configuration of basal bodies (BBs, roots of cilia). Although it has been experimentally shown that the position and orientation of BBs are coordinated by apical cytoskeletons (CSKs), such as microtubules (MTs), and planar cell polarity (PCP), the underlying mechanism for achieving the patterning of BBs is not yet understood. In this study, we propose that polarity in bundles of apical MTs play a crucial role in the patterning of BBs. First, the necessity of the polarity was discussed by theoretical consideration on the symmetry of the system. The existence of the polarity was investigated by measuring relative angles between the MTs and BBs using published experimental data. Next, a mathematical model for BB patterning was derived by combining the polarity and self-organizational ability of CSKs. In the model, BBs were treated as finite-size particles in the medium of CSKs and excluded volume effects between BBs and CSKs were taken into account. The model reproduces the various experimental observations, including normal and drug-treated phenotypes. Our model with polarity provides a coherent and testable mechanism for apical BB pattern formation. We have also discussed the implication of our study on cell chirality.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GY_pf5o3ZIw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The ongoing Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trials will uncover whether passive infusion of the broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) VRC01 can protect against HIV acquisition. Previous statistical simulations indicate these trials may be partially protective. In that case, it will be crucial to identify the mechanism of breakthrough infections. To that end, we developed a mathematical modeling framework to simulate the AMP trials and infer the breakthrough mechanisms using measurable trial outcomes. This framework combines viral dynamics with antibody pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and will be generally applicable to forthcoming bNAb prevention trials. We fit our model to human viral load data (RV217). Then, we incorporated VRC01 neutralization using serum pharmacokinetics (HVTN 104) and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; pharmacodynamics (LANL CATNAP database). We systematically explored trial outcomes by reducing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; potency and varying the distribution of sensitivity to VRC01 in circulating strains. We found trial outcomes could be used in a clinical trial regression model (CTRM) to reveal whether partially protective trials were caused by large fractions of VRC01-resistant (IC50&amp;gt;50 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) circulating strains or rather a global reduction in VRC01 potency against all strains. The former mechanism suggests the need to enhance neutralizing antibody breadth; the latter suggests the need to enhance VRC01 delivery and/or &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; binding. We will apply the clinical trial regression model to data from the completed trials to help optimize future approaches for passive delivery of anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/npxL3G8_iv0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Our aim is to complement observer-dependent approaches of immune cell evaluation in microscopy images with reproducible measures for spatial composition of lymphocytic infiltrates. Analyzing such patterns of inflammation is becoming increasingly important for therapeutic decisions, for example in transplantation medicine or cancer immunology. We developed a graph-based assessment of lymphocyte clustering in full whole slide images. Based on cell coordinates detected in the full image, a Delaunay triangulation and distance criteria are used to build neighborhood graphs. The composition of nodes and edges are used for classification, e.g. using a support vector machine. We describe the variability of these infiltrates on CD3/CD20 duplex staining in renal biopsies of long-term functioning allografts, in breast cancer cases, and in lung tissue of cystic fibrosis patients. The assessment includes automated cell detection, identification of regions of interest, and classification of lymphocytic clusters according to their degree of organization. We propose a neighborhood feature which considers the occurrence of edges with a certain type in the graph to distinguish between phenotypically different immune infiltrates. Our work addresses a medical need and provides a scalable framework that can be easily adjusted to the requirements of different research questions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dzVWfoNzifw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Hi-C is commonly used to study three-dimensional genome organization. However, due to the high sequencing cost and technical constraints, the resolution of most Hi-C datasets is coarse, resulting in a loss of information and biological interpretability. Here we develop DeepHiC, a generative adversarial network, to predict high-resolution Hi-C contact maps from low-coverage sequencing data. We demonstrated that DeepHiC is capable of reproducing high-resolution Hi-C data from as few as 1% downsampled reads. Empowered by adversarial training, our method can restore fine-grained details similar to those in high-resolution Hi-C matrices, boosting accuracy in chromatin loops identification and TADs detection, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy of prediction. Finally, application of DeepHiC to Hi-C data on mouse embryonic development can facilitate chromatin loop detection. We develop a web-based tool (DeepHiC, http://sysomics.com/deephic) that allows researchers to enhance their own Hi-C data with just a few clicks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BTEAPe47fK4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion, cerebral β‐amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction in Lewy body disease (LBD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cross‐sectional study recruited 48 LBD patients (30 with dementia and 18 with mild cognitive impairment) and 15 control subjects from a university‐based hospital. We measured the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and regional β‐amyloid burden using&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐FP‐CIT positron emission tomography (PET) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetaben (FBB) PET, respectively. The relationship between striatal FP‐CIT uptake, regional cortical FBB uptake, and cognitive function scores was evaluated using path analyses. We also investigated the effects of striatal FP‐CIT uptake and cortical FBB uptake on the interval between motor symptom and dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with increased FBB uptake in the posterior cortical regions, most prominently in the occipital cortices. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the anterior putamen was associated with visuospatial dysfunction with mediation of increased occipital FBB uptake. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the posterior putamen and an increased parietal FBB uptake were independently associated with memory dysfunction. Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with attention, language, and frontal/executive dysfunction, independent of amyloid deposition. Increased FBB uptake, especially in the parietal cortex, was associated with earlier onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that occipital β‐amyloid deposition may contribute to the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion and visuospatial dysfunction in LBD patients. Although the effects of reduced DAT activity are more prominent than those of β‐amyloid burden on cognitive dysfunction, the latter affects the onset of cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Visceral sensory neurons encode distinct sensations from healthy organs and initiate pain states that are resistant to common analgesics. Transcriptome analysis is transforming our understanding of sensory neuron subtypes but has generally focused on somatic sensory neurons or the total population of neurons in which visceral neurons form the minority. Our aim was to define transcripts specifically expressed by sacral visceral sensory neurons, as a step towards understanding the unique biology of these neurons and potentially leading to identification of new analgesic targets for pelvic visceral pain. Our strategy was to identify genes differentially expressed between sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) that include somatic neurons and sacral visceral neurons, and adjacent lumbar DRG that comprise exclusively of somatic sensory neurons. This was performed in adult and E18.5 male and female mice. By developing a method to restrict analyses to nociceptive Trpv1 neurons, a larger group of genes were detected as differentially expressed between spinal levels. We identified many novel genes that had not previously been associated with pelvic visceral sensation or nociception. Limited sex differences were detected across the transcriptome of sensory ganglia, but more were revealed in sacral levels and especially in Trpv1 nociceptive neurons. These data will facilitate development of new tools to modify mature and developing sensory neurons and nociceptive pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Spike conduction velocity characteristically differs between myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Here we test whether spikes of myelinated and unmyelinated paths differ in other respects by measuring rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spike duration in the intraretinal, unmyelinated nerve fiber layer and the extraretinal, myelinated optic nerve and optic chiasm. We find that rapid spike firing and illumination broaden spikes in intraretinal axons but not in extraretinal axons. RGC axons thus initiate spikes intraretinally and normalize spike duration extraretinally. Additionally, we analyze spikes that were recorded in a previous study of rhesus macaque retinogeniculate transmission and find that rapid spike firing does not broaden spikes in optic tract. The spike normalization we find reduces the number of spike properties that can change during RGC light responses. However, this is not because identical spikes fire in all axons. Instead, our recordings show that different subtypes of RGC generate axonal spikes of different durations and that the differences resemble spike duration increases that alter neurotransmitter release from other neurons. Moreover, previous studies have shown that RGC spikes of shorter duration can fire at higher maximum frequencies. These properties should facilitate signal transfer by different mechanisms at RGC synapses onto subcortical target neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE&lt;/b&gt; Myelination increases spike conduction velocity in axons. To test whether unmyelinated and myelinated segments of axons differ only in propagation speed, we compared spikes in unmyelinated intraretinal and myelinated extraretinal portions of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. Short interspike intervals and illumination increased spike duration intraretinally but not extraretinally. Consequently, light can change only whether and how often extraretinal spikes fire. Notably, this does not eliminate axonal spike duration differences between subtypes of RGC. This would allow previously described properties of narrower and broader spikes to facilitate signal transfer by different mechanisms at RGC synapses onto subcortical target neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;How an individual's unique brain connectivity determines that individual's
cognition, behavior, and risk for pathology is a fundamental question in basic
and clinical neuroscience. In seeking answers, many have turned to machine
learning, with some noting the particular promise of deep neural networks in
modelling complex non-linear functions. However, it is not clear that complex
functions actually exist between brain connectivity and behavior, and thus if
deep neural networks necessarily outperform simpler linear models, or if their
results would be interpretable. Here we show that, across 52 subject measures
of cognition and behavior, deep neural networks fit to each brain region's
connectivity outperform linear regression, particularly for the brain's
connector hubs--regions with diverse brain connectivity--whereas the two
approaches perform similarly when fit to brain systems. Critically, averaging
deep neural network predictions across brain regions results in the most
accurate predictions, demonstrating the ability of deep neural networks to
easily model the various functions that exists between regional brain
connectivity and behavior, carving the brain at its joints. Finally, we shine
light into the black box of deep neural networks using multislice network
models. We determined that the relationship between connector hubs and behavior
is best captured by modular deep neural networks. Our results demonstrate that
both simple and complex relationships exist between brain connectivity and
behavior, and that deep neural networks can fit both. Moreover, deep neural
networks are particularly powerful when they are first fit to the various
functions of a system independently and then combined. Finally, deep neural
networks are interpretable when their architectures are structurally
characterized using multislice network models.

 &lt;p&gt;Fontenele and collaborators \cite{fontenele} reported extensive analyses of
power-law scalings of neuronal avalanches from experimental recordings and from
numerical simulations of a model. One of their main conclusions is that the
brain may operate at criticality in specific regimes. We show here that two
non-critical systems exhibit similar behaviors as those used to conclude on
criticality, and thus, the experimental observations provided in
\cite{fontenele} are not sufficient to support the conclusion that the system
is at criticality.

 Background&lt;p&gt;To compare the efficacies of univariate and radiomics analyses of amide proton transfer weighted (APT&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;) imaging in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation of grade II/III gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-nine grade II/III glioma patients with known IDH1 mutation status were prospectively included (IDH1 wild type, 16; IDH1 mutation, 43). A total of 1044 quantitative radiomics features were extracted from APT&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; images. The efficacies of univariate and radiomics analyses in predicting IDH1 mutation were compared. Feature values were compared between two groups with independent t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to evaluate the predicting efficacy of each feature. Cases were randomly assigned to either the training (n = 49) or test cohort (n = 10) for the radiomics analysis. Support vector machine with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) was adopted to select the optimal feature subset. The adverse impact of the imbalance dataset in the training cohort was solved by synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Subsequently, the performance of SVM model was assessed on both training and test cohort.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;As for univariate analysis, 18 features were significantly different between IDH1 wild-type and mutant groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Among these parameters, High Gray Level Run Emphasis All Direction offset 8 SD achieved the biggest area under the curve (AUC) (0.769) with the accuracy of 0.799. As for radiomics analysis, SVM model was established using 19 features selected with SVM-RFE. The AUC and accuracy for IDH1 mutation on training set were 0.892 and 0.952, while on the testing set were 0.7 and 0.84, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Radiomics strategy based on APT image features is potentially useful for preoperative estimating IDH1 mutation status.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Olfaction is a sense involved in a complex set of tasks, influencing eating behavior, increasing awareness of environmental hazards and affecting social communication. Surprisingly, smell disorders are very frequent, especially in the elderly population. Several recent studies conducted mostly in older subjects have demonstrated a strong association between olfactory impairment and overall mortality risk, with anosmia being even more predictive of 5 years mortality risk than cardiovascular disease. Presently, the underlying pathophysiology linking olfactory impairment to mortality remains unknown and only putative mechanisms are suggested. This review aims to examine the link between olfactory impairment and mortality and to discuss existing ideas on underlying existing mechanisms including, (1) the effect of olfactory loss on nutrition, life-threatening situations and social interactions, (2) associated neurodegenerative diseases, (3) accelerated brain aging, and (4) reflection of general health status being reflected in olfactory function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;The Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and lower limbs (LL) weakness. There is no treatment to cure or halt the disease, except for symptomatic therapy. The use of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is one of the primary treatment for focal spasticity. Physiotherapy (PT) can help in maintaining residual functioning. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the effect of the combined BoNT-A and intensive PT in patients with HSP.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Eighteen adult patients (50% females) with clinical diagnosis of HSP were recruited. Eleven patients had a genetic diagnosis of SPG4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 72. Patients were all autonomously deambulant or needed support. BoNT-A was injected in 36 LL in different spastic muscles under electromyographic guidance and followed by intensive PT sessions. Outcome measures included disease severity, motor functional measures, perceived pain self-report and quality of life. Assessments occurred at baseline, 1 and 3 months after BoNT-A injection.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Most inoculated muscles were hamstrings, rectus femoris and gastrocnemius. We observed an improvement in muscle tone, in the gait velocity and distance length. Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale was significantly reduced after treatment, in addition to improving pain and quality of life. These results were riconfirmed in 3 months time.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study indicates that combined treatment of BoNT-A and PT can lead to improvement of spasticity and quality of life in patients with HSP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness that is unremittingly fatal and for which no effective treatment exists. All forms of ALS are characterized by protein aggregation. In familial forms of ALS, specific and heritable aggregation-prone proteins have been identified, such as mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1). It has been suggested that a factor capable of preventing mutant SOD1 protein aggregation and/or disassembling mutant SOD1 protein aggregates would ameliorate SOD1-associated forms of familial ALS. Here we identify Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule (FAIM), a highly evolutionarily conserved 20 kDa protein, as an agent with this activity. We show FAIM counteracts intracellular accumulation of mutant SOD1 protein aggregates, which is increased in the absence of FAIM, as determined by pulse-shape analysis and filter trap assays. In a cell-free system, FAIM inhibits aggregation of mutant SOD1, and further disassembles and solubilizes established mutant SOD1 protein aggregates, as determined by thioflavin T (ThT), filter trap, and sedimentation assays. In sum, we report here a previously unknown activity of FAIM that opposes ALS disease-related protein aggregation and promotes proteostasis of an aggregation-prone ALS protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Biomedical imaging Is an important source of information in cancer research. Characterizations of cancer morphology at onset, progression, and in response to treatment provide complementary information to that gleaned from genomics and clinical data. Accurate extraction and classification of both visual and latent image features Is an increasingly complex challenge due to the increased complexity and resolution of biomedical image data. In this paper, we present four deep learning-based image analysis methods from the Computational Precision Medicine (CPM) satellite event of the 21st International Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2018) conference. One method Is a segmentation method designed to segment nuclei in whole slide tissue images (WSIs) of adult diffuse glioma cases. It achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.868 with the CPM challenge datasets. Three methods are classification methods developed to categorize adult diffuse glioma cases into oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma classes using radiographic and histologic image data. These methods achieved accuracy values of 0.75, 0.80, and 0.90, measured as the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the number of total cases, with the challenge datasets. The evaluations of the four methods indicate that (1) carefully constructed deep learning algorithms are able to produce high accuracy in the analysis of biomedical image data and (2) the combination of radiographic with histologic image information improves classification performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives&lt;p&gt;Gliomas are widely considered to be related to the altered topological organization of functional networks before operations. Tumors are usually thought to cause multimodal cognitive impairments. The structure is thought to form the basics of function, and the aim of this study was to reveal the rich-club organization and topological patterns of white matter (WM) structural networks associated with cognitive impairments in patients with frontal and temporal gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Graph theory approaches were utilized to reveal the global and regional topological organization and rich-club organization of WM structural networks of 14 controls (CN), 13 frontal tumors (FTumor), and 18 temporal tumors (TTumor). Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between cognitive performances and altered topological parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;When compared with CN, both FTumor and TTumor showed no alterations in small-world properties and global network efficiency, but instead showed altered local network efficiency. Second, FTumor and TTumor patients showed similar deficits in the nodal shortest path in the left rolandic operculum and degree centrality (DC) of the right dorsolateral and medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed). Third, compared to FTumor patients, TTumor patients showed a significantly higher DC in the right dorsolateral and SFGmed, a higher level of betweenness in the right SFGmed, and higher nodal efficiency in the left middle frontal gyrus and right SFGmed. Finally, rich-club organization was disrupted, with increased structural connectivity among rich-club nodes and reduced structural connectivity among peripheral nodes in FTumor and TTumor patients. Altered local efficiency in TTumor correlated with memory function, while altered local efficiency in FTumor correlated with the information processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both FTumor and TTumor presented an intact global topology and altered regional topology related to cognitive impairment and may also share the convergent and divergent regional topological organization of WM structural networks. This suggested that a compensatory mechanism plays a key role in global topology formation in both FTumor and TTumor patients, and as such, development of a structural connectome for patients with brain tumors would be an invaluable medical resource and allow clinicians to make comprehensive preoperative planning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Advances in computation and neuronal modeling have enabled the study of entire neural tissue systems with an impressive degree of biological realism. These efforts have focused largely on modeling dendrites and somas while largely neglecting axons. The need for biologically realistic explicit axonal models is particularly clear for applications involving clinical and therapeutic electrical stimulation because axons are generally more excitable than other neuroanatomical subunits. While many modeling efforts can rely on existing repositories of reconstructed dendritic/somatic morphologies to study real cells or to estimate parameters for a generative model, such datasets for axons are scarce and incomplete. Those that do exist may still be insufficient to build accurate models because the increased geometric variability of axons demands a proportional increase in data. To address this need, a Ruled-Optimum Ordered Tree System (ROOTS) was developed that extends the capability of neuronal morphology generative methods to include highly branched cortical axon terminal arbors. Further, this study presents and explores a clear use-case for such models in the prediction of cortical tissue response to externally applied electric fields. The results presented herein comprise (i) a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the generative algorithm proposed, (ii) a comparison of generated fibers with those observed in histological studies, (iii) a study of the requisite spatial and morphological complexity of axonal arbors for accurate prediction of neuronal response to extracellular electrical stimulation, and (iv) an extracellular electrical stimulation strength–duration analysis to explore probable thresholds of excitation of the dentate perforant path under controlled conditions. ROOTS demonstrates a superior ability to capture biological realism in model fibers, allowing improved accuracy in predicting the impact that microscale structures and branching patterns have on spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the presence of extracellular electric fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently used to treat depression during pregnancy. Various concerns have been raised about the possible effects of these drugs on fetal development. Current developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing conducted in rodents is expensive, time-consuming, and does not necessarily represent human pathophysiology. A human, in vitro testing battery to cover key events of brain development, could potentially overcome these challenges. In this study, we assess the DNT of paroxetine—a widely used SSRI which has shown contradictory evidence regarding effects on human brain development using a versatile, organotypic human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain model (BrainSpheres). At therapeutic blood concentrations, which lie between 20 and 60 ng/ml, Paroxetine led to an 80% decrease in the expression of synaptic markers, a 60% decrease in neurite outgrowth and a 40–75% decrease in the overall oligodendrocyte cell population, compared to controls. These results were consistently shown in two different iPSC lines and indicate that relevant therapeutic concentrations of Paroxetine induce brain cell development abnormalities which could lead to adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Memory deficits are linked to dysfunctional HPA axis activity and negative affect in older adults. This study evaluated the mediating effect of the diurnal cortisol pattern on the relationship between affect and memory in older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal study recruited 189 Chinese older adults with MCI from elderly centers in Hong Kong. The participants completed assessments of affect, salivary cortisol, and digit spans at baseline; neurocognitive assessments on verbal fluency, memory retrieval, and digit spans at 6-month follow-up; and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) at 1-year follow-up. Structural equation modeling examined the direct and indirect effects of negative affect on memory and IADL via diurnal cortisol pattern.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Controlling for covariates, negative affect significantly predicted flattened diurnal cortisol slopes (β = 0.17, p &amp;lt; 0.05) but not memory or IADL (p = 0.23 – 0.91) directly. Diurnal cortisol slopes negatively predicted memory retrieval (β = −0.20, p &amp;lt; 0.05), which in turn positively predicted IADL (β = 0.22, p &amp;lt; 0.01). The indirect effect from negative affect to IADL via cortisol slope and memory retrieval was significant and negative (αβγ = −0.05, 95% bootstrapped CI = −0.248 to −0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The present study established certain temporal linkages among affect and cortisol slopes at baseline, memory retrieval at 6 months, and functional decline 1 year later in older adults with MCI. Flattened diurnal cortisol slopes might mediate the detrimental effects of negative affect on memory retrieval and functioning across 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Spatially explicit livestock disease models require demographic data for individual farms or premises. In the U.S., demographic data are only available aggregated at county or coarser scales, so disease models must rely on assumptions about how individual premises are distributed within counties. Here, we addressed the importance of realistic assumptions for this purpose. We compared modeling of foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks using simple randomization of locations to premises configurations predicted by the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS), which infers location based on features such as topography, land-cover, climate, and roads. We focused on three premises-level Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed models available from the literature, all using the same kernel approach but with different parameterizations and functional forms. By computing the basic reproductive number of the infection (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) for both FLAPS and randomized configurations, we investigated how spatial locations and clustering of premises affects outbreak predictions. Further, we performed stochastic simulations to evaluate if identified differences were consistent for later stages of an outbreak. Using Ripley’s &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; to quantify clustering, we found that FLAPS configurations were substantially more clustered at the scales relevant for the implemented models, leading to a higher frequency of nearby premises compared to randomized configurations. As a result, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was typically higher in FLAPS configurations, and the simulation study corroborated the pattern for later stages of outbreaks. Further, both &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and simulations exhibited substantial spatial heterogeneity in terms of differences between configurations. Thus, using realistic assumptions when de-aggregating locations based on available data can have a pronounced effect on epidemiological predictions, affecting if, where, and to what extent FMD may invade the population. We conclude that methods such as FLAPS should be preferred over randomization approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VWjvSF_hLYk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we use an optogenetic inhibitor of c-Jun NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-terminal kinase (JNK) in dendritic spine sub-compartments of rat hippocampal neurons. We show that JNK inhibition exerts rapid (within seconds) reorganization of actin in the spine-head. Using real-time Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure JNK activity, we find that either excitotoxic insult (NMDA) or endocrine stress (corticosterone), activate spine-head JNK causing internalization of AMPARs and spine retraction. Both events are prevented upon optogenetic inhibition of JNK, and rescued by JNK inhibition even 2 h after insult. Moreover, we identify that the fast-acting anti-depressant ketamine reduces JNK activity in hippocampal neurons suggesting that JNK inhibition may be a downstream mediator of its anti-depressant effect. In conclusion, we show that JNK activation plays a role in triggering spine elimination by NMDA or corticosterone stress, whereas inhibition of JNK facilitates regrowth of spines even in the continued presence of glucocorticoid. This identifies that JNK acts locally in the spine-head to promote AMPAR internalization and spine shrinkage following stress, and reveals a protective function for JNK inhibition in preventing spine regression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;To manipulate target gene function in specific adult cell populations, tamoxifen-dependent CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt; is widely used to drive inducible, site-specific recombination of loxP flanked sequences. In studies of cell autonomous target gene function, it is common practice to combine these CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;-lox systems with a ubiquitously expressed stop-floxed fluorescent reporter gene to identify single cells supposedly undergoing target gene recombination. Here, we studied the reliability of using Cre-induced recombination of one gene to predict recombination in another gene at the single cell level in adult hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Using both probabilistic predictions in a generic experimental paradigm, as well as a mouse model with two separate stop-floxed reporters plus a Nestin promoter-driven CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;, we found that, in individual cells, recombination of one gene was a poor predictor of recombination in another. This poor concordance in floxed sequence recombination across genes suggests that use of stop-floxed reporters to investigate cell autonomous gene function may not be universally reliable and could lead to false conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigate the reliability of a widely used transgenic mouse model in studies of adult NSPCs. Ligand-dependent Cre recombinases, such as the CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt; model, are a fundamental tool for inducible gene modification used to investigate gene function in many cell populations. It is common practice to combine NSPC-specific CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;-lox systems with a ubiquitously expressed stop-floxed fluorescent reporter gene to identify single cells undergoing target gene recombination in studies of cell autonomous gene function. Our probabilistic predictions and experimental data suggest that use of stop-floxed reporters to investigate cell autonomous gene function in NSPCs may lead to false conclusions because recombination in separate genes can show poor concordance in individual cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Selective spatial attention is a crucial cognitive process that guides us to the behaviorally relevant objects in a complex visual world by using exploratory eye movements. The spatial location of objects, their (bottom-up) saliency and (top-down) relevance is assumed to be encoded in one “attentional priority map” in the brain, using different egocentric (eye-, head- and trunk-centered) spatial reference frames. In patients with hemispatial neglect, this map is supposed to be imbalanced, leading to a spatially biased exploration of the visual environment. As a proof of concept, we altered the visual saliency (and thereby attentional priority) of objects in a naturalistic scene along a left-right spatial gradient and investigated whether this can induce a bias in the exploratory eye movements of healthy humans (n = 28; all right-handed; mean age: 23 years, range 19–48). We developed a computerized mask, using high-end “gaze-contingent display (GCD)” technology, that immediately and continuously reduced the saliency of objects on the left—“left” with respect to the head (body-centered) and the current position on the retina (eye-centered). In both experimental conditions, task-free viewing and goal-driven visual search, this modification induced a mild but significant bias in visual exploration similar to hemispatial neglect. Accordingly, global eye movement parameters changed (reduced number and increased duration of fixations) and the spatial distribution of fixations indicated an attentional bias towards the right (rightward shift of first orienting, fixations favoring the scene’s outmost right over left). Our results support the concept of an attentional priority map in the brain as an interface between perception and behavior and as one pathophysiological ground of hemispatial neglect.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;MRI gradient-fields may induce extrinsic voltage between electrodes and conductive neurostimulator enclosure of implanted deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems, and may cause unintended stimulation and/or malfunction. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations using detailed anatomical human models, therapy implant trajectories, and gradient coil models can be used to calculate clinically relevant induced voltage levels. Incorporating additional anatomical human models into the EM simulation library can help to achieve more clinically relevant and accurate induced voltage levels, however, adding new anatomical human models and developing implant trajectories is time-consuming, expensive and not always feasible.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;MRI gradient-field induced voltage levels are simulated in six adult human anatomical models, along clinically relevant DBS implant trajectories to generate the dataset. Predictive artificial neural network (ANN) regression models are trained on the simulated dataset. Leave-one-out cross validation is performed to assess the performance of ANN regressors and quantify model prediction errors.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;More than 180,000 unique gradient-induced voltage levels are simulated. ANN algorithm with two fully connected layers is selected due to its superior generalizability compared to support vector machine and tree-based algorithms in this particular application. The ANN regression model is capable of producing thousands of gradient-induced voltage predictions in less than a second with mean-squared-error less than 200 mV.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We have integrated machine learning (ML) with computational modeling and simulations and developed an accurate predictive model to determine MRI gradient-field induced voltage levels on implanted DBS systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hair cells are sensitive to many insults including environmental toxins such as heavy metals. We show here that cadmium can consistently kill hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line. Disrupting hair cell mechanotransduction genetically or pharmacologically significantly reduces the amount of hair cell death seen in response to cadmium, suggesting a role for mechanotransduction in this cell death process, possibly as a means for cadmium uptake into the cells. Likewise, when looking at multiple cilia-associated gene mutants that have previously been shown to be resistant to aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death, resistance to cadmium-induced hair cell death is only seen in those with mechanotransduction defects. In contrast to what was seen with mechanotransduction, significant protection was not consistently seen from other ions previously shown to compete for cadmium uptake into cells or tissue including zinc and copper. These results show that functional mechanotransduction activity is playing a significant role in cadmium-induced hair cell death.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Extracellular matrix (ECM) is prominent in the scar and potently regulates cell behavior. However, comprehensive information about the ECM proteome is largely lacking, and region- as well as injury-specific differences are often not taken into account. These aspects are the focus of our perspective on injury and scar formation. To highlight the importance of such comprehensive proteome analysis we include data obtained with novel analysis tools of the ECM composition in the scar and show the contribution of monocytes to the ECM composition after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Monocyte invasion was reduced using the CCR2-/- mouse line and step-wise de-cellularization and proteomics allowed determining monocyte-dependent ECM composition and architecture of the glial scar. We find significant reduction in the ECM proteins Tgm1, Itih (1,2, and 3), and Ftl in the absence of monocyte invasion. We also describe the scar ECM comprising zones with distinctive composition and show a subacute signature upon comparison to proteome obtained at earlier times after TBI. These results are discussed in light of injury-, region- and time-specific regulation of scar formation highlighting the urgent need to differentiate injury conditions and CNS-regions using comprehensive ECM analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Morphine is a potent analgesic opiate commonly used in treating pain, and it is also a substance of abuse and highly addictive. Hence, it is vital to discover the action sites of morphine in the brain to increase its efficacy of treatment. In the present study, we aimed at identifying comprehensive neuroanatomical locations that are sensitive to morphine in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We performed in situ hybridization to localize the mu opioid receptor (oprm1) gene and to map the morphine sensitive brain areas using neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 4a (npas4a), an early gene marker. Real-time PCR was used to detect changes in mRNA levels of oprm1 and npas4a in control and acute morphine treated fish (2 mg/L; 20 min). Intense positive oprm1 signals were seen in the telencephalon, preoptic area, habenula, hypothalamic area and periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum. Acute morphine exposure significantly increased oprm1 and npas4a mRNA levels in the medial zone of dorsal telencephalon (Dm), ventral region of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), preoptic area, and in the hypothalamus but a decrease in oprm1 and npas4a signals in the dorsal habenula. This study provides a detailed map of oprm1 localization in the brain, which includes previously unreported oprm1 in the habenula of teleost. Presence of oprm1 in multiple brain sites implies multiple action targets of morphine and potential brain functions which could include reward, cognitive and negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The current longitudinal study examined factors (sex, physical function, response to novelty, ability to adapt to a shift in light/dark cycle, brain connectivity), which might predict the emergence of impaired memory during aging. Male and female Fisher 344 rats were tested at 6, 12, and 18 months of age. Impaired spatial memory developed in middle-age (12 months), particularly in males, and the propensity for impairment increased with advanced age. A reduced response to novelty was observed over the course of aging, which is inconsistent with cross-sectional studies. This divergence likely resulted from differences in the history of environmental enrichment/impoverishment for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Animals that exhibited lower level exploration of the inner region on the open field test exhibited better memory at 12 months. Furthermore, males that exhibited a longer latency to enter a novel environment at 6 months, exhibited better memory at 12 months. For females, memory at 12 months was correlated with the ability to behaviorally adapt to a shift in light/dark cycle. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, conducted at 12 months, indicated that the decline in memory was associated with altered functional connectivity within different memory systems, most notably between the hippocampus and multiple regions such as the retrosplenial cortex, thalamus, striatum, and amygdala. Overall, some factors, specifically response to novelty at an early age and the capacity to adapt to shifts in light cycle, predicted spatial memory in middle-age, and spatial memory is associated with corresponding changes in brain connectivity. We discuss similarities and differences related to previous longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, as well as the role of sex differences in providing a theoretical framework to guide future longitudinal research on the trajectory of cognitive decline. In addition to demonstrating the power of longitudinal studies, these data highlight the importance of middle-age for identifying potential predictive indicators of sexual dimorphism in the trajectory in brain and cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background and Objectives: The identification of functional performance deficits is critical to the community independence of older adults. We examined whether a combined cognitive and performance-based medication management measure would be able to better classify an individual’s functional cognitive status and potential for instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairment than either measure alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Design and Methods: Community-dwelling adults age 55 and older (n = 185) were administered the Mini-Cog, the Medication Transfer Screen-Revised (MTS-R), a combination measure the Medi-Cog-Revised (Medi-Cog-R), the Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills (PASS) Checkbook Balancing and Shopping tasks (PCST), additional cognitive screening measures, and a self-report daily living scale. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were computed for the Mini-Cog, MTS-R and the Medi-Cog-R using the PCST performance as the criterion measure. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were computed for each measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The Medi-Cog-R most accurately identified individuals as impaired on the PCST. An AUC statistic of 0.82 for the Medi-Cog-R was greater than either the Mini-Cog (0.75) or the MTS-R (0.73). The Medi-Cog-R demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.78 in classifying individuals with impaired IADL as measured by the PCST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion and Implications: The Mini-Cog, the MTS-R, and the Medi-Cog-R all show discriminant validity, but the combined measure demonstrates greater sensitivity and specificity than either component measure alone in identifying IADL impairment. The Medi-Cog-R appears to be a useful screening measure for functional cognition and can be used to prompt further assessment and intervention to promote community independence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral MRI data to predict disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain networks of ALS patients (n=208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group‐ and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that computer simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, both at the group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore the potential as a prognostic biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein that regulates ER homeostasis and unfolded protein response (UPR). The biology of endogenous MANF in the mammalian brain is unknown and therefore we studied the brain phenotype of MANF-deficient female and male mice at different ages focusing on the midbrain dopamine system and cortical neurons. We show that a lack of MANF from the brain led to the chronic activation of UPR by upregulation of the endoribonuclease activity of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) pathway. Furthermore, in the aged MANF-deficient mouse brain in addition the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) branches of the UPR pathways were activated. Neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases has been associated with chronic ER stress. In our mouse model, increased UPR activation did not lead to neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra (SN), decrease of striatal dopamine or behavioral changes of MANF-deficient mice. However, cortical neurons lacking MANF were more vulnerable to chemical induction of additional ER stress &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We conclude that embryonic neuronal deletion of MANF does not cause the loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in mice. However, endogenous MANF is needed for maintenance of neuronal ER homeostasis both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The zona incerta is a subthalamic nucleus proposed to link sensory stimuli with motor responses to guide behavior, but its functional role is not well established. Using mice of either sex, we studied the effect of manipulating zona incerta GABAergic cells on the expression of a signaled locomotor action, known as signaled active avoidance. We found that modulation of GABAergic zona incerta cells, but not of cells in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus (NRT), fully controls the expression of signaled active avoidance responses. Inhibition of zona incerta GABAergic cells drives active avoidance responses, while excitation of these cells blocks signaled active avoidance mainly by inhibiting cells in the midbrain pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT). The zona incerta regulates signaled locomotion in the midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Increase in blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability is a crucial step in neuroinflammatory processes. We previously showed that N Methyl D Aspartate Receptor (NMDARs), expressed on cerebral endothelial cells forming the BBB, regulate immune cell infiltration across this barrier in the mouse. Here, we describe the mechanism responsible for the action of NMDARs on BBB permeabilization. We report that mouse CNS endothelial NMDARs display the regulatory GluN3A subunit. This composition confers to NMDARs' unconventional properties: these receptors do not induce Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx but rather show nonionotropic properties. In inflammatory conditions, costimulation of human brain endothelial cells by NMDA agonists (NMDA or glycine) and the serine protease tissue plasminogen activator, previously shown to potentiate NMDAR activity, induces metabotropic signaling via the Rho/ROCK pathway. This pathway leads to an increase in permeability via phosphorylation of myosin light chain and subsequent shrinkage of human brain endothelial cells. Together, these data draw a link between NMDARs and the cytoskeleton in brain endothelial cells that regulates BBB permeability in inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The authors describe how NMDARs expressed on endothelial cells regulate blood–brain barrier function via myosin light chain phosphorylation and increase in permeability. They report that these non-neuronal NMDARs display distinct structural, functional, and pharmacological features than their neuronal counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Open spina bifida (OSB) is one of the most prevalent congenital malformations of the CNS that often leads to severe disabilities. Previous studies reported the volume and thickness of the neocortex to be altered in children and adolescents diagnosed with OSB. Until now, the onset and the underlying cause of the atypical neocortex organization in OSB patients remain largely unknown. To examine the effects of OSB on fetal neocortex development, we analyzed human fetuses of both sexes diagnosed with OSB between 11 and 15 weeks of gestation by immunofluorescence for established neuronal and neural progenitor marker proteins and compared the results with healthy controls of the same, or very similar, gestational age. Our data indicate that neocortex development in OSB fetuses is altered as early as 11 weeks of gestation. We observed a marked reduction in the radial thickness of the OSB neocortex, which appears to be attributable to a massive decrease in the number of deep- and upper-layer neurons per field, and found a marked reduction in the number of basal progenitors (BPs) per field in the OSB neocortex, consistent with an impairment of cortical neurogenesis underlying the neuronal decrease in OSB fetuses. Moreover, our data suggest that the decrease in BP number in the OSB neocortex may be associated with BPs spending a lesser proportion of their cell cycle in M-phase. Together, our findings expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of OSB and support the need for an early fetal therapy (i.e., in the first trimester of pregnancy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Open spina bifida (OSB) is one of the most prevalent congenital malformations of the CNS. This study provides novel data on neocortex development of human OSB fetuses. Our data indicate that neocortex development in OSB fetuses is altered as early as 11 weeks of gestation.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal mitochondria dysfunction and neuroinflammation are two prominent pathological features increasingly realized as important pathogenic mechanisms for neurodegenerative diseases. However, little attempt has been taken to investigate the likely interactions between them. Mitofusin2 (Mfn2) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein regulating mitochondrial fusion, a dynamic process essential for mitochondrial function. To explore the significance of neuronal mitochondria in the regulation of neuroinflammation, male and female transgenic mice with forced overexpression of Mfn2 specifically in neurons were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a widely used approach to model neurodegeneration-associated neuroinflammation. Remarkably, LPS-induced lethality was almost completely abrogated in neuronal Mfn2 overexpression mice. Compared with nontransgenic wild-type mice, mice with neuronal Mfn2 overexpression also exhibited alleviated bodyweight loss, behavioral sickness, and myocardial dysfunction. LPS-induced release of IL-1β but not TNF-α was further found greatly inhibited in the CNS of mice with neuronal Mfn2 overexpression, whereas peripheral inflammatory responses in the blood, heart, lung, and spleen remained unchanged. At the cellular and molecular levels, neuronal Mfn2 suppressed the activation of microglia, prevented LPS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in neurons, and importantly, upregulated the expression of CX3CL1, a unique chemokine constitutively produced by neurons to suppress microglial activation. Together, these results reveal an unrecognized possible role of neuronal mitochondria in the regulation of microglial activation, and propose neuronal Mfn2 as a likely mechanistic linker between neuronal mitochondria dysfunction and neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our study suggests that Mfn2 in neurons contributes to the regulation of neuroinflammation. Based on the remarkable suppression of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and dynamic abnormalities by neuronal Mfn2, this study centered on Mfn2-mediated neuroinflammation reveals novel molecular mechanisms that are involved in both mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. The pharmacological targeting of Mfn2 may present a novel treatment for neuroinflammation-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cognitive processes contribute to the control of feeding behavior and help organism's survival when they support physiological needs. They can become maladaptive, such as when learned food cues drive feeding in the absence of hunger. Associative learning is the basis for cue-driven food seeking and consumption, and behavioral paradigms with Pavlovian cue-food conditioning are well established. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying circuit plasticity across cue-food learning, cue memory recall, and subsequent food motivation are unknown. Here, we demonstrated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a site of learning-induced plasticity and signaling of the neuropeptide orexin within the mPFC mediates cue potentiated feeding (CPF). First, using a marker of neuronal activation, &lt;i&gt;c-fos,&lt;/i&gt; we confirmed that the mPFC is activated during CPF. Next, to assess whether the same mPFC neuronal ensemble is activated during cue-food learning and later CPF, we used the Daun02 chemogenetic inactivation method in &lt;i&gt;c-fos-lacZ&lt;/i&gt; transgenic male and female rats. Selective inactivation of the mPFC neurons that were active during the last cue-food training session abolished CPF during test, demonstrating that the mPFC is a site of plasticity. We postulated that integration of food cue memory and feeding motivation requires mPFC communications with lateral hypothalamus and showed that disconnection of that system abolished CPF. Then we showed that lateral hypothalamus orexin-producing neurons project to the mPFC. Finally, we blocked orexin receptor 1 signaling in the mPFC and showed that it is a neuromodulator necessary for the cue-driven consumption. Together, our findings identify a causal function for the mPFC in the cognitive motivation to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, and the associated health consequences are serious and costly. The causes of obesity are complex because, in addition to physiological energy and nutrient needs, environmental cues can drive feeding through hedonic and cognitive processes. Learned food cues from the environment can powerfully stimulate appetite and food consumption in the absence of hunger. Using an animal model for cue-potentiated feeding, the current study determined the mPFC neuronal plasticity and neuropeptide orexin signaling are critical circuit and neurotransmitter mechanisms involved in this form of cognitive motivation to eat. These findings identify key targets for potential treatment of excessive appetite and overeating.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Optogenetic Activation of the Basolateral Amygdala Promotes Both Appetitive Conditioning and the Instrumental Pursuit of Reward Cues</title>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Reward-associated stimuli can both evoke conditioned responses and acquire reinforcing properties in their own right, becoming avidly pursued. Such conditioned stimuli (CS) can guide reward-seeking behavior in adaptive (e.g., locating food) and maladaptive (e.g., binge eating) ways. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) regulates conditioned responses evoked by appetitive CS, but less is known about how the BLA contributes to the instrumental pursuit of CS. Here we studied the influence of BLA neuron activity on both behavioral effects. Water-restricted male rats learned to associate a light-tone cue (CS) with water delivery into a port. During these Pavlovian conditioning sessions, we paired CS presentations with photo-stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing BLA neurons. BLA photo-stimulation potentiated CS-evoked port entries during conditioning, indicating enhanced conditioned approach and appetitive conditioning. Next, new rats received Pavlovian conditioning without photo-stimulation. These rats then received instrumental conditioning sessions where they could press an inactive lever or an active lever that produced CS presentation, without water delivery. Rats pressed more on the active versus inactive lever, and pairing CS presentation with BLA-ChR2 photo-stimulation intensified responding for the CS. This suggests that BLA-ChR2 photo-stimulation enhanced CS incentive value. In a separate experiment, rats did not reliably self-administer BLA-ChR2 stimulations, suggesting that BLA neurons do not carry a primary reward signal. Last, intra-BLA infusions of d-amphetamine also intensified lever-pressing for the CS. The findings suggest that BLA-mediated activity facilitates CS control over behavior by enhancing both appetitive Pavlovian conditioning and instrumental pursuit of CS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cues paired with rewards can guide animals to valuable resources such as food. Cues can also promote dysfunctional reward-seeking behavior, as in overeating. Reward-paired cues influence reward seeking through two major mechanisms. First, reward-paired cues evoke conditioned anticipatory behaviors to prepare for impending rewards. Second, reward-paired cues are powerful motivators and they can evoke pursuit in their own right. Here we show that increasing neural activity in the basolateral amygdala enhances both conditioned anticipatory behaviors and pursuit of reward-paired cues. The basolateral amygdala therefore facilitates cue-induced control over behavior by both increasing anticipation of impending rewards and making reward cues more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Temporal Invariance in SCA6 Is Related to Smaller Cerebellar Lobule VI and Greater Disease Severity</title>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Regulating muscle force and timing are fundamental for accurate motor performance. In spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), there is evidence that individuals have greater force dysmetria but display better temporal accuracy during fast goal directed contractions. Here, we test whether greater temporal accuracy occurs in all individuals with SCA6, and can be explained by lesser temporal variability. Further we examine whether it is linked to disease severity and specific degenerative changes in the cerebellum. Nineteen human participants with SCA6 (13 woman) and 18 healthy controls performed fast goal-directed ankle dorsiflexion contractions aiming at a spatiotemporal target. We quantified the endpoint control of these contractions, gray matter (GM) integrity of the cerebellum, and disease severity using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). SCA6 individuals exhibited lower temporal endpoint error and variability than the healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008). Statistically, SCA6 clustered into two distinct groups for temporal variability. A group with low temporal variability ranging from 10 to 19% (SCA6a) and a group with temporal variability similar to healthy controls (SCA6b; 19–40%).SCA6a exhibited greater disease severity than SCA6b, as assessed with ICARS (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Lower temporal variability, which was not associated with disease duration (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.2), did correlate with both greater ICARS (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.3) and reduced GM volume in cerebellar lobule VI (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.35). Other cerebellar lobules did not relate to temporal variability. We provide new evidence that a subset of SCA6 with greater loss of GM in cerebellum lobule VI exhibit temporal invariance and more severe ataxia than other SCA6 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Variability is an inherent feature of voluntary movement, and traditionally more variability in the targeted output infers impaired performance. For example, cerebellar patients present exacerbated temporal variability during multijoint movements, which is thought to contribute to their motor deficits. In the current work, we show that in a subgroup of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 individuals, temporal variability is lower than that of healthy controls when performing single-joint fast-goal directed movements. This invariance related to exacerbated atrophy of lobule VI of the cerebellum and exacerbated disease severity. The relation between invariance and disease severity suggests that pathological motor variability can manifest not only as an exacerbation but also as a reduction relative to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Drawing is a powerful tool that can be used to convey rich perceptual information about objects in the world. What are the neural mechanisms that enable us to produce a recognizable drawing of an object, and how does this visual production experience influence how this object is represented in the brain? Here we evaluate the hypothesis that producing and recognizing an object recruit a shared neural representation, such that repeatedly drawing the object can enhance its perceptual discriminability in the brain. We scanned human participants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 31; 11 male) using fMRI across three phases of a training study: during training, participants repeatedly drew two objects in an alternating sequence on an MR-compatible tablet; before and after training, they viewed these and two other control objects, allowing us to measure the neural representation of each object in visual cortex. We found that: (1) stimulus-evoked representations of objects in visual cortex are recruited during visually cued production of drawings of these objects, even throughout the period when the object cue is no longer present; (2) the object currently being drawn is prioritized in visual cortex during drawing production, while other repeatedly drawn objects are suppressed; and (3) patterns of connectivity between regions in occipital and parietal cortex supported enhanced decoding of the currently drawn object across the training phase, suggesting a potential neural substrate for learning how to transform perceptual representations into representational actions. Together, our study provides novel insight into the functional relationship between visual production and recognition in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans can produce simple line drawings that capture rich information about their perceptual experiences. However, the mechanisms that support this behavior are not well understood. Here we investigate how regions in visual cortex participate in the recognition of an object and the production of a drawing of it. We find that these regions carry diagnostic information about an object in a similar format both during recognition and production, and that practice drawing an object enhances transmission of information about it to downstream regions. Together, our study provides novel insight into the functional relationship between visual production and recognition in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Progression from Feature-Specific Brain Activity to Hippocampal Binding during Episodic Encoding</title>

 &lt;p&gt;The hallmark of episodic memory is recollecting multiple perceptual details tied to a specific spatial-temporal context. To remember an event, it is therefore necessary to integrate such details into a coherent representation during initial encoding. Here we tested how the brain encodes and binds multiple, distinct kinds of features in parallel, and how this process evolves over time during the event itself. We analyzed data from 27 human subjects (16 females, 11 males) who learned a series of objects uniquely associated with a color, a panoramic scene location, and an emotional sound while fMRI data were collected. By modeling how brain activity relates to memory for upcoming or just-viewed information, we were able to test how the neural signatures of individual features as well as the integrated event changed over the course of encoding. We observed a striking dissociation between early and late encoding processes: left inferior frontal and visuo-perceptual signals at the onset of an event tracked the amount of detail subsequently recalled and were dissociable based on distinct remembered features. In contrast, memory-related brain activity shifted to the left hippocampus toward the end of an event, which was particularly sensitive to binding item color and sound associations with spatial information. These results provide evidence of early, simultaneous feature-specific neural responses during episodic encoding that predict later remembering and suggest that the hippocampus integrates these features into a coherent experience at an event transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding and remembering complex experiences are crucial for many socio-cognitive abilities, including being able to navigate our environment, predict the future, and share experiences with others. Probing the neural mechanisms by which features become bound into meaningful episodes is a vital part of understanding how we view and reconstruct the rich detail of our environment. By testing memory for multimodal events, our findings show a functional dissociation between early encoding processes that engage lateral frontal and sensory regions to successfully encode event features, and later encoding processes that recruit hippocampus to bind these features together. These results highlight the importance of considering the temporal dynamics of encoding processes supporting multimodal event representations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The development of sensory circuits is partially guided by sensory experience. In the medial superior olive (MSO), these refinements generate precise coincidence detection to localize sounds in the azimuthal plane. Glycinergic inhibitory inputs to the MSO, which tune the sensitivity to interaural time differences, undergo substantial structural and functional refinements after hearing onset. Whether excitation and calcium signaling in the MSO are similarly affected by the onset of acoustic experience is unresolved. To assess the time window and mechanism of excitatory and calcium-dependent refinements during late postnatal development, we quantified EPSCs and calcium entry in MSO neurons of Mongolian gerbils of either sex raised in a normal and in an activity altered, omnidirectional white noise environment. Global dendritic calcium transients elicited by action potentials disappeared rapidly after hearing onset. Local synaptic calcium transients decreased, leaving a GluR2 lacking AMPAR-mediated influx as the only activity-dependent source in adulthood. Exposure to omnidirectional white noise accelerated the decrease in calcium entry, leaving membrane properties unaffected. Thus, sound-driven activity accelerates the excitatory refinement and shortens the period of activity-dependent calcium signaling around hearing onset. Together with earlier reports, our findings highlight that excitation, inhibition, and biophysical properties are differentially sensitive to distinct features of sensory experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons in the medial superior olive, an ultra-fast coincidence detector for sound source localization, acquire their specialized function through refinements during late postnatal development. The refinement of inhibitory inputs that convey sensitivity to relevant interaural time differences is instructed by the experience of sound localization cues. Which cues instruct the refinement of excitatory inputs, calcium signaling, and biophysical properties is unknown. Here we demonstrate a time window for activity- and calcium-dependent refinements limited to shortly after hearing onset. Exposure to omnidirectional white noise, which suppresses sound localization cues but increases overall activity, accelerates the refinement of calcium signaling and excitatory inputs without affecting biophysical membrane properties. Thus, the refinement of excitation, inhibition, and intrinsic properties is instructed by distinct cues.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The striatum is critical for controlling motor output. However, it remains unclear how striatal output neurons encode and facilitate movement. A prominent theory suggests that striatal units encode movements in bursts of activity near specific events, such as the start or end of actions. These bursts are theorized to gate or permit specific motor actions, thereby encoding and facilitating complex sequences of actions. An alternative theory has suggested that striatal neurons encode continuous changes in sensory or motor information with graded changes in firing rate. Supporting this theory, many striatal neurons exhibit such graded changes without bursting near specific actions. Here, we evaluated these two theories in the same recordings of mice (both male and female). We recorded single-unit and multiunit activity from the dorsomedial striatum of mice as they spontaneously explored an arena. We observed both types of encoding, although continuous encoding was more prevalent than bursting near movement initiation or termination. The majority of recorded units did not exhibit positive linear relationships with speed but instead exhibited nonlinear relationships that peaked at a range of locomotor speeds. Bulk calcium recordings of identified direct and indirect pathway neurons revealed similar speed tuning profiles, indicating that the heterogeneity in response profiles was not due to this genetic distinction. We conclude that continuous encoding of speed is a central component of movement encoding in the striatum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The striatum is a structure that is linked to volitional movements and is a primary site of pathology in movement disorders. It remains unclear how striatal neurons encode motor parameters and use them to facilitate movement. Here, we evaluated two models for this: a &quot;discrete encoding model&quot; in which striatal neurons facilitate movements with brief burst of activity near the start and end of movements, and a &quot;continuous encoding model,&quot; in which striatal neurons encode the sensory or motor state of the animal with continuous changes in firing. We found evidence primarily in support of the continuous encoding model. This may have implications for understanding the striatal control of movement, as well as informing therapeutic approaches for treating movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Understanding the neural code requires understanding how populations of neurons code information. Theoretical models predict that information may be limited by correlated noise in large neural populations. Nevertheless, analyses based on tens of neurons have failed to find evidence of saturation. Moreover, some studies have shown that noise correlations can be very small, and therefore may not affect information coding. To determine whether information-limiting correlations exist, we implanted eight Utah arrays in prefrontal cortex (PFC; area 46) of two male macaque monkeys, recording &amp;gt;500 neurons simultaneously. We estimated information in PFC about saccades as a function of ensemble size. Noise correlations were, on average, small (~10&lt;sup&gt;–3&lt;/sup&gt;). However, information scaled strongly sublinearly with ensemble size. After shuffling trials, destroying noise correlations, information was a linear function of ensemble size. Thus, we provide evidence for the existence of information-limiting noise correlations in large populations of PFC neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent theoretical work has shown that even small correlations can limit information if they are &quot;differential correlations,&quot; which are difficult to measure directly. However, they can be detected through decoding analyses on recordings from a large number of neurons over a large number of trials. We have achieved both by collecting neural activity in dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex of macaques using eight microelectrode arrays (768 electrodes), from which we were able to compute accurate information estimates. We show, for the first time, strong evidence for information-limiting correlations. Despite pairwise correlations being small (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;–3&lt;/sup&gt;), they affect information coding in populations on the order of 100 s of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<title type="html">Differential Roles of Mediodorsal Nucleus of the Thalamus and Prefrontal Cortex in Decision-Making and State Representation in a Cognitive Control Task Measuring Deficits in Schizophrenia</title>
		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1650?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) is reciprocally connected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and although the MD has been implicated in a range of PFC-dependent cognitive functions (Watanabe and Funahashi, 2012; Mitchell and Chakraborty, 2013; Parnaudeau et al., 2018), little is known about how MD neurons in the primate participate specifically in cognitive control, a capability that reflects the ability to use contextual information (such as a rule) to modify responses to environmental stimuli. To learn how the MD-PFC thalamocortical network is engaged to mediate forms of cognitive control that are selectively disrupted in schizophrenia, we trained male monkeys to perform a variant of the AX continuous performance task, which reliably measures cognitive control deficits in patients (Henderson et al., 2012) and used linear multielectrode arrays to record neural activity in the MD and PFC simultaneously. We found that the two structures made clearly different contributions to distributed processing for cognitive control: MD neurons were specialized for decision-making and response selection, whereas prefrontal neurons were specialized to preferentially encode the environmental state on which the decision was based. In addition, we observed that functional coupling between MD and PFC was strongest when the decision as to which of the two responses in the task to execute was being made. These findings delineate unique contributions of MD and PFC to distributed processing for cognitive control and characterized neural dynamics in this network associated with normative cognitive control performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive control is fundamental to healthy human executive functioning (Miller and Cohen, 2001) and deficits in patients with schizophrenia relate to decreased functional activation of the MD thalamus and the prefrontal cortex (Minzenberg et al., 2009), which are reciprocally linked (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985; Xiao et al., 2009). We carry out simultaneous neural recordings in the MD and PFC while monkeys perform a cognitive control task translated from patients with schizophrenia to relate thalamocortical dynamics to cognitive control performance. Our data suggest that state representation and decision-making computations for cognitive control are preferentially performed by PFC and MD, respectively. This suggests experiments to parse decision-making and state representation deficits in patients while providing novel computational targets for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To bridge the gap between preclinical cellular models of disease and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging of human cognitive network dynamics, there is a pressing need for informative biophysical models. Here we assess dynamic causal models (DCM) of cortical network responses, as generative models of magnetoencephalographic observations during an auditory oddball roving paradigm in healthy adults. This paradigm induces robust perturbations that permeate frontotemporal networks, including an evoked 'mismatch negativity' response and transiently induced oscillations. Here, we probe GABAergic influences in the networks using double-blind placebo-controlled randomized-crossover administration of the GABA reuptake inhibitor, tiagabine (oral, 10 mg) in healthy older adults. We demonstrate the facility of conductance-based neural mass mean-field models, incorporating local synaptic connectivity, to investigate laminar-specific and GABAergic mechanisms of the auditory response. The neuronal model accurately recapitulated the observed magnetoencephalographic data. Using parametric empirical Bayes for optimal model inversion across both drug sessions, we identify the effect of tiagabine on GABAergic modulation of deep pyramidal and interneuronal cell populations. We found a transition of the main GABAergic drug effects from auditory cortex in standard trials to prefrontal cortex in deviant trials. The successful integration of pharmaco- magnetoencephalography with dynamic causal models of frontotemporal networks provides a potential platform on which to evaluate the effects of disease and pharmacological interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding human brain function and developing new treatments require good models of brain function. We tested a detailed generative model of cortical microcircuits that accurately reproduced human magnetoencephalography, to quantify network dynamics and connectivity in frontotemporal cortex. This approach identified the effect of a test drug (GABA-reuptake inhibitor, tiagabine) on neuronal function (GABA-ergic dynamics), opening the way for psychopharmacological studies in health and disease with the mechanistic precision afforded by generative models of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The loss of sensory input following a spinal deafferentation injury can be debilitating, and this is especially true in primates when the hand is involved. Although significant recovery of function occurs, little is currently understood about the reorganization of the neuronal circuitry, particularly within the dorsal horn. This region receives primary afferent input from the periphery, and cortical input via the somatosensory subcomponent of the corticospinal tract (S1 CST), and is critically important in modulating sensory transmission, both in normal and lesioned states. To determine how dorsal horn circuitry alters to facilitate recovery post-injury, we used an established deafferentation lesion model (dorsal root/dorsal column) in male monkeys to remove sensory input from just the opposing digits (digits 1–3) of one hand. This results in a deficit in fine dexterity that recovers over several months. Electrophysiological mapping, tract tracing, and immunolabeling techniques were combined to delineate specific changes to dorsal horn input circuitry. Our main findings show that (1) there is complementary sprouting of the primary afferent and S1 CST populations into an overlapping region of the reorganizing dorsal horn; (2) S1 CST and primary afferent inputs connect in different ways within this region to facilitate sensory integration; and (3) there is a loss of larger S1 CST terminal boutons in the affected dorsal horn, but no change in the size profile of the spared/sprouted primary afferent terminal boutons post-lesion. Understanding such changes helps to inform new and targeted therapies that best promote recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Spinal injuries that remove sensation from the hand, can be debilitating, though functional recovery does occur. We examined changes to the neuronal circuitry of the dorsal horn in monkeys following a lesion that deafferented three digits of one hand. Little is understood about dorsal horn circuitry, despite the fact that this region loses most of its normal input after such an injury, and is clearly a major focus of reorganization. We found that both the spared primary afferents and somatosensory corticospinal efferents sprouted in an overlapping region of the dorsal horn after injury, and that larger (presumably faster) corticospinal terminals are lost, suggesting a significantly altered cortical modulation of primary afferents. Understanding this changing circuitry is important for designing targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/8/1611?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The dogma that the synaptic cleft acidifies during neurotransmission is based on the corelease of neurotransmitters and protons from synaptic vesicles, and is supported by direct data from sensory ribbon-type synapses. However, it is unclear whether acidification occurs at non–ribbon-type synapses. Here we used genetically encoded fluorescent pH indicators to examine cleft pH at conventional neuronal synapses. At the neuromuscular junction of female &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, we observed alkaline spikes of over 1 log unit during fictive locomotion &lt;i&gt;in vivo. Ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;, single action potentials evoked alkalinizing pH transients of only ~0.01 log unit, but these transients summated rapidly during burst firing. A chemical pH indicator targeted to the cleft corroborated these findings. Cleft pH transients were dependent on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; movement across the postsynaptic membrane, rather than neurotransmitter release per se, a result consistent with cleft alkalinization being driven by the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporting activity of the plasma membrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase at the postsynaptic membrane. Targeting the pH indicators to the microenvironment of the presynaptic voltage gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels revealed that alkalinization also occurred within the cleft proper at the active zone and not just within extrasynaptic regions. Application of the pH indicators at the mouse calyx of Held, a mammalian central synapse, similarly revealed cleft alkalinization during burst firing in both males and females. These findings, made at two quite different non–ribbon type synapses, suggest that cleft alkalinization during neurotransmission, rather than acidification, is a generalizable phenomenon across conventional neuronal synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurotransmission is highly sensitive to the pH of the extracellular milieu. This is readily evident in the neurological symptoms that accompany systemic acid/base imbalances. Imaging data from sensory ribbon-type synapses show that neurotransmission itself can acidify the synaptic cleft, likely due to the corelease of protons and glutamate. It is not clear whether the same phenomenon occurs at conventional neuronal synapses due to the difficulties in collecting such data. If it does occur, it would provide for an additional layer of activity-dependent modulation of neurotransmission. Our findings of alkalinization, rather than acidification, within the cleft of two different neuronal synapses encourages a reassessment of the scope of activity-dependent pH influences on neurotransmission and short-term synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;SynGAP is a potent regulator of biochemical signaling in neurons and plays critical roles in neuronal function. It was first identified in 1998, and has since been extensively characterized as a mediator of synaptic plasticity. Because of its involvement in synaptic plasticity, SynGAP has emerged as a critical protein for normal cognitive function. In recent years, mutations in the &lt;i&gt;SYNGAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene have been shown to cause intellectual disability in humans and have been linked to other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. While the structure and biochemical function of SynGAP have been well characterized, a unified understanding of the various roles of SynGAP at the synapse and its contributions to neuronal function remains to be achieved. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current understanding of the multifactorial role of SynGAP in regulating neuronal function gathered over the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Perceptual performance in a visual task can be enhanced by simultaneous multisensory information, but can also be enhanced by a symbolic or amodal cue inducing a specific expectation. That similar benefits can arise from multisensory information and within-modality expectation raises the question of whether the underlying neurophysiological processes are the same or distinct. We investigated this by comparing the influence of three types of auxiliary probabilistic cues on visual motion discrimination in humans: i) acoustic motion, ii) a pre-motion visual symbolic cue, iii) a post-motion symbolic cue. Using multivariate analysis of the EEG data we show that both the multisensory and preceding visual symbolic cue enhance the encoding of visual motion direction as reflected by cerebral activity arising from occipital regions around 200-400ms post-stimulus onset. This suggests a common or overlapping physiological correlate of crossmodal and intramodal auxiliary information, pointing to neural mechanism susceptive to both multisensory and more abstract probabilistic cues. We also asked how pre-stimulus activity shapes the cue-stimulus combination and found a differential influence on crossmodal and intramodal combination: while alpha power modulated the relative weight of visual motion and the acoustic cue, it did not modulate the behavioural influence of a visual symbolic cue, pointing to differences in how pre-stimulus activity shapes the combination of multisensory and abstract cues with task-relevant information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Perception can be enhanced by the combination of multisensory information and by the exploitation of amodal or symbolic cues presented within the same modality as the task-relevant information. We here asked whether the physiological correlates reflecting the behavioural benefits induced by each type of cue are similar or not. Using multivariate analysis of EEG data we show that the perceptual enhancement induced by an acoustic cue and a visual-symbolic cue for the discrimination of visual motion arise from the same physiological source. This suggests that the impact of multisensory information and more abstract sensory expectations on perception arise from shared mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The molecular mechanisms governing normal neurodevelopment are tightly regulated by the action of transcription factors. Repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is widely documented as a regulator of neurogenesis that acts by recruiting corepressor proteins and repressing neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells. The REST corepressor 1 (CoREST1), CoREST2 and CoREST3 are best described for their role as part of the REST complex. However, recent evidence has shown the proteins have the ability to repress expression of distinct target genes in a REST-independent manner. These findings indicate that each CoREST paralogue may have distinct and critical roles in regulating neurodevelopment and are more than simply &quot;REST corepressors&quot;, whereby they act as independent repressors orchestrating biological processes during neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The molecular mechanisms governing normal development of the brain are yet to be fully elucidated. The regulation of gene expression by transcription factors plays a significant role in the specification and maturation of neurons and glia. Repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST) has been well characterised as a transcriptional regulator of neurogenesis through the formation of a complex with the REST corepressor (CoREST) proteins. Recently, the CoREST protein family has been shown to independently target unique genes, have distinct expression patterns, and important REST-independent functions during neurodevelopment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governed by the CoREST family will provide insight into the regulatory networks directing normal neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Exposure to severe stress has immediate and prolonged neuropsychiatric consequences and increases the risk of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Importantly, PTSD develops in only a subset of individuals after exposure to a traumatic event, with the understanding of this selective vulnerability being very limited. Individuals who go on to develop PTSD after a traumatic experience typically demonstrate sleep disturbances including persistent insomnia and recurrent trauma-related nightmares. We previously established a repeated social defeat paradigm in which rats segregate into either passively or actively coping subpopulations, and we found that this distinction correlates with measures of vulnerability or resilience to stress. In this study, we examined differences between these two behavioral phenotypes in sleep changes resulting from repeated social defeat stress. Our data indicate that, compared to control and actively coping rats, passively coping rats have less slow-wave sleep (SWS) for at least 2 weeks after the end of a series of exposures to social defeat. Furthermore, resilient rats show less exaggerated motor activation at awakenings from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and less fragmentation of REM sleep compared to control and passively coping rats. Together, these data associate a passive coping strategy in response to repeated social defeat stress with persisting sleep disturbances. Conversely, an active coping strategy may be associated with resilience to sleep disturbances. These findings may have both prognostic and therapeutic applications to stress-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, including PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cutaneous sensation is vital to controlling our hands and upper limbs. It helps close the motor control loop by informing adjustments of grasping forces during object manipulations and provides much of the information the brain requires to perceive our limbs as a part of our bodies. This sensory information is absent to upper-limb prosthesis users. Although robotic prostheses are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the absence of feedback imposes a reliance on open-loop control and limits the functional potential as an integrated part of the body. Experimental systems to restore physiologically relevant sensory information to prosthesis users are beginning to emerge. However, the impact of their long-term use on functional abilities, body image, and neural adaptation processes remains unclear. Understanding these effects is essential to transition sensate prostheses from sophisticated assistive tools to integrated replacement limbs. We recruited three participants with high-level upper-limb amputation who previously received targeted reinnervation surgery. Each participant was fit with a neural-machine-interface prosthesis that allowed participants to operate their device by thinking about moving their missing limb. Additionally, we fit a sensory feedback system that allowed participants to experience touch to the prosthesis as touch on their missing limb. All three participants performed a long-term take-home trial. Two participants used their neural-machine-interface systems with touch feedback and one control participant used his prescribed, insensate prosthesis. A series of functional outcome metrics and psychophysical evaluations were performed using sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses before and after the take-home period to capture changes in functional abilities, limb embodiment, and neural adaptation. Our results demonstrated that the relationship between users and sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses is dynamic and changes with long-term use. The presence of touch sensation had a near-immediate impact on how the users operated their prostheses. In the multiple independent measures of users’ functional abilities employed, we observed a spectrum of performance changes following long-term use. Furthermore, after the take-home period, participants more appropriately integrated their prostheses into their body images and psychophysical tests provided strong evidence that neural and cortical adaptation occurred.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This paper presents a wireless distributed Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) architecture. It is based on a set of, potentially heterogeneous, distributed stimulation and measurement units managed by a wearable controller. Through a proof-of-concept application, the characterization of the wireless network performances was assessed to check the adequacy of this solution with open-loop and closed-loop control requirements. We show the guaranteed time performances over the network through the control of quadriceps and hamstrings stimulation parameters based on the monitoring of the knee joint angle. Our solution intends to be a tool for researchers and therapists to develop closed-loop control algorithms and strategies for rehabilitation, allowing the design of wearable systems for a daily use context.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders in aging. Hyposmia has been described as an early symptom that can precede cognitive and motor deficits by decades. Certain regions within the olfactory system, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, display the neuropathological markers tau and amyloid-β or α-synuclein from the earliest stages of disease progression in a preferential manner. Specific neuronal subpopulations, namely those expressing somatostatin (SST), are preferentially affected throughout the olfactory and limbic systems. SST is a neuropeptide present in a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons throughout the brain and its main function is to inhibit principal neurons and/or other interneurons. It has been reported that SST expression is reduced by 50% in Alzheimer’s disease and that it is related to the formation of Aβ oligomers. The mechanisms underlying the preferential vulnerability of SST-expressing neurons in Alzheimer’s disease (and, to a minor extent, in Parkinson’s disease) are not known but analysis of the available data could shed light on their etiology. This short review aims to update the knowledge of functional features of somatostatin within the olfactory system and its role in olfactory deficits during neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The consistency, efficacy, and safety of cannabis-based medicines have been demonstrated in humans, leading to the approval of the first cannabis-based therapy to alleviate spasticity and pain associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, the evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for the management of pathological events related to this disease is ever increasing. Different mechanisms of action have been proposed for cannabis-based treatments in mouse models of demyelination, such as Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Theiler’s Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus-Induced Demyelinating Disease (TMEV-IDD). Cells in the immune and nervous system express the machinery to synthesize and degrade endocannabinoids, as well as their CB1 and CB2 receptors, each mediating different intracellular pathways upon activation. Hence, the effects of cannabinoids on cells of the immune system, on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons, potentially open the way for a plethora of therapeutic actions on different targets that could aid the management of MS. As such, cannabinoids could have an important impact on the outcome of MS in terms of the resolution of inflammation or the potentiation of endogenous repair in the central nervous system (CNS), as witnessed in the EAE, TMEV-IDD and toxic demyelination models, and through other in vitro approaches. In this mini review article, we summarize what is currently known about the peripheral and central effects of cannabinoids in relation to the neuroinflammation coupled to MS. We pay special attention to their effects on remyelination and axon preservation within the CNS, considering the major questions raised in the field and future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortical tissue of murine embryo and pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons can survive in the adult brain and extend axons to the spinal cord. These features suggest that cell transplantation can be a strategy to reconstruct the corticospinal tract (CST). It is unknown, however, which cell population makes for safe and effective donor cells. To address this issue, we grafted the cerebral cortex of E14.5 mouse to the brain of adult mice and found that the cells in the graft extending axons along the CST expressed CTIP2. By using CTIP2:GFP knock-in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we identified L1CAM as a cell surface marker to enrich CTIP2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. We sorted L1CAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells from E14.5 mouse brain and confirmed that they extended a larger number of axons along the CST compared to L1CAM&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Our results suggest that sorting L1CAM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells from the embryonic cerebral cortex enriches subcortical projection neurons to reconstruct the CST.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Axonal development is essential to the establishment of neuronal morphology and circuitry, although the mechanisms underlying axonal outgrowth during the early developmental stages remain unclear. Here, we showed that the conserved disco-interacting protein B (DIP2B) which consists of a DMAP1 domain and a crotonobetaine/carnitine CoA ligase (Caic) domain, is highly expressed in the excitatory neurons of the hippocampus. DIP2B knockout led to excessive axonal outgrowth but not polarity at an early developmental stage. Furthermore, the loss of DIP2B inhibited synaptic transmission for both spontaneous and rapid release in cultured hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, DIP2B function during axonal outgrowth requires tubulin acetylation. These findings reveal a new conserved regulator of neuronal morphology and provide a novel intervention mechanism for neurocognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of dementia among the elderly worldwide. Unfortunately, the mechanism of AD remains unclear, and no effective therapies are available yet. An increasing amount of studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play a notable role in the pathogenesis of plenty of human diseases, and they have served as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. However, the function of LncRNAs in AD remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential role of LncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in AD. We found that LncRNA NEAT1 was upregulated in the AD animal models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NEAT1 could interact with NEDD4L and promote PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)’s ubiquitination and degradation and then impaired PINK1-dependent autophagy. Collectively, the lncRNA NEAT1 promotes the pathogenesis of AD and serves as a promising novel target for pharmacological intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered a critical time window for predicting early conversion to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Brain functional connectome data (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides numerous information about brain networks and has been used to discriminate normal controls (NCs) from subjects with MCI. In this paper, Student’s t-tests and group-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (group-LASSO) were used to extract functional connections with significant differences and the most discriminative network nodes, respectively. Based on group-LASSO, the middle temporal, inferior temporal, lingual, posterior cingulate, and middle frontal gyri were the most predominant brain regions for nodal observation in MCI patients. Nodal graph metrics (within-module degree, participation coefficient, and degree centrality) showed the maximum discriminative ability. To effectively combine the multipattern information, we employed the multiple kernel learning support vector machine (MKL-SVM). Combined with functional connectome information, the MKL-SVM achieved a good classification performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve = 0.9728). Additionally, the altered brain connectome pattern revealed that functional connectivity was generally decreased in the whole-brain network, whereas graph theory topological attributes of some special nodes in the brain network were increased in MCI patients. Our findings demonstrate that optimal feature selection and combination of all connectome features (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) can achieve good performance in discriminating NCs from MCI subjects. Thus, the combination of functional connections and global and nodal graph metrics of brain networks can predict the occurrence of MCI and contribute to the early clinical diagnosis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Selecting goals and successfully pursuing them in an uncertain and dynamic environment is an important aspect of human behaviour. In order to decide which goal to pursue at what point in time, one has to evaluate the consequences of one’s actions over future time steps by forward planning. However, when the goal is still temporally distant, detailed forward planning can be prohibitively costly. One way to select actions at minimal computational costs is to use heuristics. It is an open question how humans mix heuristics with forward planning to balance computational costs with goal reaching performance. To test a hypothesis about dynamic mixing of heuristics with forward planning, we used a novel stochastic sequential two-goal task. Comparing participants’ decisions with an optimal full planning agent, we found that at the early stages of goal-reaching sequences, in which both goals are temporally distant and planning complexity is high, on average 42% (SD = 19%) of participants’ choices deviated from the agent’s optimal choices. Only towards the end of the sequence, participant’s behaviour converged to near optimal performance. Subsequent model-based analyses showed that participants used heuristic preferences when the goal was temporally distant and switched to forward planning when the goal was close.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Li469oKS05g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Influenza A/H3N2 is a rapidly evolving virus which experiences major antigenic transitions every two to eight years. Anticipating the timing and outcome of transitions is critical to developing effective seasonal influenza vaccines. Using a published phylodynamic model of influenza transmission, we identified indicators of future evolutionary success for an emerging antigenic cluster and quantified fundamental trade-offs in our ability to make such predictions. The eventual fate of a new cluster depends on its initial epidemiological growth rate––which is a function of mutational load and population susceptibility to the cluster––along with the variance in growth rate across co-circulating viruses. Logistic regression can predict whether a cluster at 5% relative frequency will eventually succeed with ~80% sensitivity, providing up to eight months advance warning. As a cluster expands, the predictions improve while the lead-time for vaccine development and other interventions decreases. However, attempts to make comparable predictions from 12 years of &lt;i&gt;empirical&lt;/i&gt; influenza surveillance data, which are far sparser and more coarse-grained, achieve only 56% sensitivity. By expanding influenza surveillance to obtain more granular estimates of the frequencies of and population-wide susceptibility to emerging viruses, we can better anticipate major antigenic transitions. This provides added incentives for accelerating the vaccine production cycle to reduce the lead time required for strain selection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vvRt_QEk7t8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

English Wikipedia, containing more than five millions articles, has approximately eleven thousands web pages devoted to proteins or genes most of which were generated by the Gene Wiki project. These pages contain information about interactions between proteins and their functional relationships. At the same time, they are interconnected with other Wikipedia pages describing biological functions, diseases, drugs and other topics curated by independent, not coordinated collective efforts. Therefore, Wikipedia contains a directed network of protein functional relations or physical interactions embedded into the global network of the encyclopedia terms, which defines hidden (indirect) functional proximity between proteins. We applied the recently developed reduced Google Matrix (REGOMAX) algorithm in order to extract the network of hidden functional connections between proteins in Wikipedia. In this network we discovered tight communities which reflect areas of interest in molecular biology or medicine and can be considered as definitions of biological functions shaped by collective intelligence. Moreover, by comparing two snapshots of Wikipedia graph (from years 2013 and 2017), we studied the evolution of the network of direct and hidden protein connections. We concluded that the hidden connections are more dynamic compared to the direct ones and that the size of the hidden interaction communities grows with time. We recapitulate the results of Wikipedia protein community analysis and annotation in the form of an interactive online map, which can serve as a portal to the Gene Wiki project.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XcU5tOwpDGc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Methods for the analysis of time series single cell expression data (scRNA-Seq) either do not utilize information about transcription factors (TFs) and their targets or only study these as a post-processing step. Using such information can both, improve the accuracy of the reconstructed model and cell assignments, while at the same time provide information on how and when the process is regulated. We developed the Continuous-State Hidden Markov Models TF (CSHMM-TF) method which integrates probabilistic modeling of scRNA-Seq data with the ability to assign TFs to specific activation points in the model. TFs are assumed to influence the emission probabilities for cells assigned to later time points allowing us to identify not just the TFs controlling each path but also their order of activation. We tested CSHMM-TF on several mouse and human datasets. As we show, the method was able to identify known and novel TFs for all processes, assigned time of activation agrees with both expression information and prior knowledge and combinatorial predictions are supported by known interactions. We also show that CSHMM-TF improves upon prior methods that do not utilize TF-gene interaction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5niHEV2Zq3o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Significant maturation of swimming in zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) occurs within the first few days of life when fish transition from coiling movements to burst swimming and then to beat-and-glide swimming. This maturation occurs against a backdrop of numerous developmental changes - neurogenesis, a transition from predominantly electrical to chemical-based neurotransmission, and refinement of intrinsic properties. There is evidence that spinal locomotor circuits undergo fundamental changes as the zebrafish transitions from burst to beat-and-glide swimming. Our electrophysiological recordings confirm that the operation of spinal locomotor circuits becomes increasingly reliant on glycinergic neurotransmission for rhythmogenesis governing the rhythm of tail beats. This transition occurred at the same time that we observed a change in rhythmicity of synaptic inhibition to spinal motoneurons (MNs). When we examined whether the transition from weakly to strongly glycinergic dependent rhythmogenesis occurred at a uniform pace across the length of the spinal cord, we found that this transition occurred earlier at caudal segments than at rostral segments of the spinal cord. Furthermore, while this rhythmogenic transition occurred when fish transition from burst swimming to beat-and-glide swimming, these two transitions were not interdependent. These results suggest that there is a developmental transition in the operation of spinal locomotor circuits that is gradually set in place in the spinal cord in a caudo-rostral temporal sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating chronic pain disorder typically in the upper or lower limbs. While CRPS usually develops from a peripheral event, it is likely maintained by CNS changes. Indeed, CRPS is reported to be associated with sensorimotor cortex changes, or functional &quot;reorganization,&quot; as well as deficits such as poor tactile acuity. While the mechanisms underpinning cortical reorganization in CRPS are unknown, some have hypothesized that it involves disinhibition (i.e., a reduction in GABA activity). In this study, we addressed this hypothesis by using edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine sensorimotor GABA and glutamate concentrations in 16 humans with CRPS and 30 matched control subjects and the relationship of these concentrations with tactile acuity. We found that individuals with upper limb CRPS displayed reduced tactile acuity in the painful hand, compared with the nonpainful hand and pain-free control subjects. Despite this acuity deficit, CRPS was not associated with altered GABA or glutamate concentrations within the sensorimotor cortex on either the side that represents the affected or unaffected hand. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between sensorimotor GABA or glutamate concentrations and tactile acuity in CRPS subjects or control subjects. Although our sample was small, these data suggest that CRPS is not associated with altered total sensorimotor GABA or glutamate concentrations. While these results are at odds with the sensorimotor cortex disinhibition hypothesis, it is possible that GABAergic mechanisms other than total GABA concentration may contribute to such disinhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pain is a multi-dimensional experience of sensory-discriminative, cognitive, and affective processes; however, current basic research methods rely heavily on response to threshold stimuli, bypassing the supraspinal processing that ultimately gives rise to the pain experience. We developed the Operant Planter Thermal Assay (OPTA), which utilizes a novel, conflict-based operant task requiring evaluation and active decision making to obtain reward under thermally aversive conditions to quantify thermal pain tolerance. In baseline measures, male and female mice exhibited similar temperature preferences, however in the OPTA, female mice exhibited greater temperature-dependent tolerance, as defined by choice time spent in an adverse thermal condition to obtain reward. Increasing reward salience (4% vs 10% sucrose solution) led to increased thermal tolerance for males but not females. To determine whether neuropathic and inflammatory pain models alter thermal tolerance, animals with chronic constriction injury (CCI) or complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), respectively, were tested in the OPTA. Surprisingly, neuropathic animals exhibited increased thermal tolerance, as shown by greater time spent in the reward zone in an adverse thermal condition, compared with sham animals. There was no effect of inflammation on thermal tolerance. Administration of clonidine in the CCI model led to increased thermal tolerance in both injured and sham animals. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meloxicam was anti-hyperalgesic in the CFA model, but reduced thermal pain tolerance. These data support the feasibility of utilizing the OPTA to assess thermal pain tolerance to gain new insights into complex pain behaviors and to investigate novel aspects of analgesic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The translation of novel pain management techniques has been hindered, in part, by reliance on pre-clinical models that do not to measure the multi-dimensional experience of pain. Here we present a novel device and protocol to assess pain tolerance in the mouse. We show that pain tolerance is a dynamic behavior influenced by sex, that hypersensitivity does not necessarily predict pain tolerance, and that analgesics that reduce hypersensitivity may not enhance pain tolerance. This approach increases the capability to pursue new directions in basic pain research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin have both been investigated in clinical trials designed to treat the cognitive deficits associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Neurofibromatosis type 1, Fragile X and autism. In a recent study, the therapeutic efficacy of lovastatin and simvastatin were compared in a Fragile X (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;) mouse model. The authors concluded that lovastatin was superior to simvastatin in rescuing the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; phenotypes, and cautioned against considering simvastatin as treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders. We discuss these findings in the context of published literature and argue that more support is needed for this potentially far-reaching conclusion. We further provide recommendations to improve the translation of pre-clinical studies of cognitive disorders into the clinical domain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a ribonuclear protein regulating many aspects of RNA metabolism. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases with the presence of TDP-43 aggregates in neuronal cells. Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal degradation pathway participating in the proteostasis of several cytosolic proteins including neurodegenerative associated proteins. In addition, protein oligomers or aggregates can affect the status of CMA. In this work, we studied the relationship between CMA and the physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43. First, we found that recombinant TDP-43 was specifically degraded by rat liver’s CMA+ lysosomes and that endogenous TDP-43 is localized in rat brain’s CMA+ lysosomes, indicating that TDP-43 can be a CMA substrate in vivo. Next, by using a previously reported TDP-43 aggregation model, we have shown that wild-type and an aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 are detected in CMA+ lysosomes isolated from cell cultures. In addition, their protein levels increased in cells displaying CMA down-regulation, indicating that these two TDP-43 forms are CMA substrates in vitro. Finally, we observed that the aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 is able to interact with Hsc70, to co-localize with Lamp2A, and to up-regulate the levels of these molecular components of CMA. The latter was followed by an up-regulation of the CMA activity and lysosomal damage. Altogether our data shows that: (i) TDP-43 is a CMA substrate; (ii) CMA can contribute to control the turnover of physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43; and (iii) TDP-43 aggregation can affect CMA performance. Overall, this work contributes to understanding how a dysregulation between CMA and TDP-43 would participate in neuropathological mechanisms associated with TDP-43 aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The specific role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in emotional and behavioral regulation—particularly in relation to automatic processes—has gained increased attention in the sensory modulation literature. This mini-review article summarizes current knowledge about the role of the ANS in sensory modulation, with a focus on the integrated functions of the ANS and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and their measurement. Research from the past decade illustrates that sympathetic and parasympathetic interactions are more complex than previously assumed. Patterns of ANS activation vary across individuals, with distinct physiological response profiles influencing the reactivity underlying automatic behavioral responses. This review article advances a deeper understanding of stress and the complex stress patterns within the ANS and HPA axis that contribute to allostatic load (AL). We argue that using multiple physiological measurements to capture individual ANS response variation is critical for effectively treating children with sensory modulation disorder (SMD) and sensory differences. We consider the relative contributions of automatic vs. deliberately controlled processes across large-scale neural networks in the development of sensorimotor function and their associated links with arousal patterns and sensory over- and under-responsivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Natural exploration of textures involves active sensing, i.e., voluntary movements of tactile sensors (e.g., human fingertips or rodent whiskers) across a target surface. Somatosensory input during moving tactile sensors varies according to both the movement and the surface texture. Combining motor and sensory information, the brain is capable of extracting textural features of the explored surface. Despite the ecological relevance of active sensing, psychophysical studies on active touch are largely missing. One reason for the lack of informative studies investigating active touch is the considerable challenge of assembling an appropriate experimental setup. A possible solution might be in the realm of virtual tactile reality that provides tactile finger stimulation depending on the position of the hand and the simulated texture of a target surface. In addition to rigorous behavioral studies, the investigation of the neuronal mechanisms of active tactile sensing in humans is highly warranted, requiring neurophysiological experiments using electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, current neuroimaging techniques impose specific requirements on the tactile stimulus delivery equipment in terms of compatibility with the neurophysiological methods being used. Here, we present a user-friendly, MEG compatible, tactile virtual reality simulator. The simulator consists of a piezo-electric tactile stimulator capable of independently protruding 16 plastic pistons of 1 mm diameter arranged in a 4 × 4 matrix. The stimulator delivers a spatial pattern of tactile stimuli to the tip of a finger depending on the position of the finger moving across a 2-dimensional plane. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the tactile virtual reality, we determined participants’ detection thresholds in active and passive touch conditions. Thresholds in both conditions were higher than reported in the literature. It could well be that the processing of the piston-related stimulation was masked by the sensory input generated by placing the finger on the scanning probe. More so, the thresholds for both the active and passive tasks did not differ significantly. In further studies, the noise introduced by the stimulator in neuromagnetic recordings was quantified and somatosensory evoked fields for active and passive touch were recorded. Due to the compatibility of the stimulator with neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, and based on the feasibility to record somatosensory-related neuromagnetic brain activity the apparatus has immense potential for the exploration of the neural underpinnings of active tactile perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Captioning is the process of transcribing speech and acoustical information into text to help deaf and hard of hearing people accessing to the auditory track of audiovisual media. In addition to the verbal transcription, it includes information such as sound effects, speaker identification, or music tagging. However, it just takes into account a limited spectrum of the whole acoustic information available in the soundtrack, and hence, an important amount of emotional information is lost when attending just to the normative compliant captions. In this article, it is shown, by means of behavioral and EEG measurements, how emotional information related to sounds and music used by the creator in the audiovisual work is perceived differently by normal hearing group and hearing disabled group when applying standard captioning. Audio and captions activate similar processing areas, respectively, in each group, although not with the same intensity. Moreover, captions require higher activation of voluntary attentional circuits, as well as language-related areas. Captions transcribing musical information increase attentional activity, instead of emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure reportedly enhances allergic airway inflammation. However, some studies have shown an association between current cigarette smoke exposure and a low risk for allergic rhinitis. Thus, the impact of CS exposure on allergic rhinitis remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CS on the respiratory mucosa (RM) and the olfactory epithelium (OE) of mice with allergic rhinitis, as the effects may differ depending on the nasal histological compartments.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Eight-week-old male BALB/c mice were used for this study. We developed a mouse model of smoking by intranasally administering 10 doses of a CS solution (CSS), and a mouse model of allergic rhinitis by sensitization with intraperitoneal ovalbumin (OVA) injection and intranasal challenge with OVA. We examined the effects of CS on the nasal RM and OE in mice with or without allergic rhinitis using histological, serum, and genetic analyses. First, we examine whether CSS exposure induces allergic responses and then, examined allergic responses in the OVA-sensitized allergic rhinitis mice with or without CSS exposure.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Short-term CSS administration intensified allergic responses including increased infiltration of eosinophils and inflammatory cells and upregulation of interleukin-5 expression in the nasal RM of OVA-immunized mice, although only CSS induced neither allergic responses nor impairment of the RM and OE. Notably, repetitive OVA-immunization partially impaired the OE in the upper-lateral area, but CSS administration did not reinforce this impairment in OVA-induced allergic mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Short-term CSS exposure strengthened allergic responses in the nasal RM and did not change the structure of the OE. These results suggest that patients with allergic rhinitis could experience exacerbation of allergic symptoms after CS exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are becoming increasingly popular as a tool to improve the quality of life of patients with disabilities. Recently, time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-fNIRS) based BCIs are gaining traction because of their enhanced depth sensitivity leading to lower signal contamination from the extracerebral layers. This study presents the first account of TR-fNIRS based BCI for “mental communication” on healthy participants. Twenty-one (21) participants were recruited and were repeatedly asked a series of questions where they were instructed to imagine playing tennis for “yes” and to stay relaxed for “no.” The change in the mean time-of-flight of photons was used to calculate the change in concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin since it provides a good compromise between depth sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Features were extracted from the average oxyhemoglobin signals to classify them as “yes” or “no” responses. Linear-discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify the responses using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The overall accuracies achieved for all participants were 75% and 76%, using LDA and SVM, respectively. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference in accuracy between questions. In addition, physiological parameters [heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] were recorded on seven of the 21 participants during motor imagery (MI) and rest to investigate changes in these parameters between conditions. No significant difference in these parameters was found between conditions. These findings suggest that TR-fNIRS could be suitable as a BCI for patients with brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Growing evidence links impairment of brain functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with disruptions of brain functional connectivity. However, whether the AD brain shows similar changes from a dynamic or cross-frequency view remains poorly explored. This paper provides an effective framework to investigate the properties of multiplex brain networks in AD considering inter-frequency and temporal dynamics. Using resting-state EEG signals, two types of multiplex networks were reconstructed separately considering the network interactions between different frequency bands or time points. We further applied multiplex network features to characterize functional integration and segregation of the cross-frequency or time-varying networks. Finally, machine learning methods were employed to evaluate the performance of multiplex-network-based indexes for detection of AD. Results revealed that the brain networks of AD patients are disrupted with reduced segregation particularly in the left occipital area for both cross-frequency and time-varying networks. However, the alteration of integration differs among brain regions and may show an increasing trend in the frontal area of AD brain. By combining the features of integration and segregation in time-varying networks, the best classification performance was achieved with an accuracy of 92.5%. These findings suggest that our multiplex framework can be applied to explore functional integration and segregation of brain networks and characterize the abnormalities of brain function. This may shed new light on the brain network analysis and extend our understanding of brain function in patients with neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation is of great importance in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). During the process of neuroinflammation, overactivated microglia release many proinflammatory factors, which eventually induce neurodegeneration. Inhibition of excessive microglial activation is regarded as a promising strategy for PD treatment. Src is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is closely related to tumors. Recently, some reports indicated that Src is a central mediator in multiple signaling pathways including neuroinflammation. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the role of Src in microglial regulation and neuroinflammation. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia model and the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model were applied in this study. The results showed that inhibition of Src could significantly relieve microgliosis and decrease levels of inflammatory factors. Besides, inhibition of Src function reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons and improved the motor behavior of the MPTP-treated mice. Thus, this study not only verified the critical role of Src tyrosine kinase in neuroinflammation but also further proved that interfering neuroinflammation is beneficial for PD treatment. More importantly, this study shed a light on the hypothesis that Src tyrosine kinase might be a potential therapeutic target for PD and other neuroinflammation-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Developments of new strategies to restore vision and improving on current strategies by harnessing new advancements in material and electrical sciences, and biological and genetic-based technologies are of upmost health priorities around the world. Federal and private entities are spending billions of dollars on visual prosthetics technologies. This review describes the most current and state-of-the-art bioengineering technologies to restore vision. This includes a thorough description of traditional electrode-based visual prosthetics that have improved substantially since early prototypes. Recent advances in molecular and synthetic biology have transformed vision-assisted technologies; For example, optogenetic technologies that introduce light-responsive proteins offer excellent resolution but cortical applications are restricted by fiber implantation and tissue damage. Other stimulation modalities, such as magnetic fields, have been explored to achieve non-invasive neuromodulation. Miniature magnetic coils are currently being developed to activate select groups of neurons. Magnetically-responsive nanoparticles or exogenous proteins can significantly enhance the coupling between external electromagnetic devices and any neurons affiliated with these modifications. The need to minimize cytotoxic effects for nanoparticle-based therapies will likely restrict the number of usable materials. Nevertheless, advances in identifying and utilizing proteins that respond to magnetic fields may lead to non-invasive, cell-specific stimulation and may overcome many of the limitations that currently exist with other methods. Finally, sensory substitution systems also serve as viable visual prostheses by converting visual input to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. This review also discusses major challenges in the field and offers bioengineering strategies to overcome those.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Many people with cognitive disabilities avoid outside activities, apparently for fear of getting lost. However, little is known about the nature of the difficulties encountered and the ways in which these individuals deal with them. None of the few studies on wayfinding by people with cognitive disabilities have explored the various specific difficulties they meet in everyday life. Using both a qualitative and quantitative methodology, this study aimed at profiling the types of difficulties encountered in urban mobility and the associated problem-solving strategies. In order to provide more direct evidence from the field, we conducted semi-structured interviews using the critical incident technique (Flanagan, 1954). Among the 66 participants interviewed, 44 had cognitive disabilities and 22 were matched controls. The analysis of the transcripts showed in particular an overall reduced autonomy in problem-solving strategies for people with a cognitive disability. The multiple correspondence analysis highlighted three main types of complex situations, covering a comprehensive range of complex situations that are met in everyday life by these individuals. Results also indicated that people with cognitive disabilities request assistance from another person more frequently when a complex event occurs. These situations are discussed as potential cues for improvements in navigational aids. Conclusions and perspectives are provided to improve wayfinding among people with cognitive disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Physics-based simulations of walking have the theoretical potential to support clinical decision-making by predicting the functional outcome of treatments in terms of walking performance. Yet before using such simulations in clinical practice, their ability to identify the main treatment targets in specific patients needs to be demonstrated. In this study, we generated predictive simulations of walking with a medical imaging based neuro-musculoskeletal model of a child with cerebral palsy presenting crouch gait. We explored the influence of altered muscle-tendon properties, reduced neuromuscular control complexity, and spasticity on gait dysfunction in terms of joint kinematics, kinetics, muscle activity, and metabolic cost of transport. We modeled altered muscle-tendon properties by personalizing Hill-type muscle-tendon parameters based on data collected during functional movements, simpler neuromuscular control by reducing the number of independent muscle synergies, and spasticity through delayed muscle activity feedback from muscle force and force rate. Our simulations revealed that, in the presence of aberrant musculoskeletal geometries, altered muscle-tendon properties rather than reduced neuromuscular control complexity and spasticity were the primary cause of the crouch gait pattern observed for this child, which is in agreement with the clinical examination. These results suggest that muscle-tendon properties should be the primary target of interventions aiming to restore an upright gait pattern for this child. This suggestion is in line with the gait analysis following muscle-tendon property and bone deformity corrections. Future work should extend this single case analysis to more patients in order to validate the ability of our physics-based simulations to capture the gait patterns of individual patients pre- and post-treatment. Such validation would open the door for identifying targeted treatment strategies with the aim of designing optimized interventions for neuro-musculoskeletal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traditional rehabilitation techniques present limitations and the majority of patients show poor 1-year post-stroke recovery. Thus, Neurofeedback (NF) or Brain-Computer-Interface applications for stroke rehabilitation purposes are gaining increased attention. Indeed, NF has the potential to enhance volitional control of targeted cortical areas and thus impact on motor function recovery. However, current implementations are limited by temporal, spatial or practical constraints of the specific imaging modality used. In this pilot work and for the first time in literature, we applied bimodal EEG-fMRI NF for upper limb stroke recovery on four stroke-patients with different stroke characteristics and motor impairment severity. We also propose a novel, multi-target training approach that guides the training towards the activation of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex. In addition to fMRI and EEG outcomes, we assess the integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) with tractography. Preliminary results suggest the feasibility of our approach and show its potential to induce an augmented activation of ipsilesional motor areas, depending on the severity of the stroke deficit. Only the two patients with a preserved CST and subcortical lesions succeeded in upregulating the ipsilesional primary motor cortex and exhibited a functional improvement of upper limb motricity. These findings highlight the importance of taking into account the variability of the stroke patients’ population and enabled to identify inclusion criteria for the design of future clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Within a decade, single trial analysis of functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals has gained significant momentum, and fNIRS joined the set of modalities frequently used for active and passive Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). A great variety of methods for feature extraction and classification have been explored using state-of-the-art Machine Learning methods. In contrast, signal preprocessing and cleaning pipelines for fNIRS often follow simple recipes and so far rarely incorporate the available state-of-the-art in adjacent fields. In neuroscience, where fMRI and fNIRS are established neuroimaging tools, evoked hemodynamic brain activity is typically estimated across multiple trials using a General Linear Model (GLM). With the help of the GLM, subject, channel, and task specific evoked hemodynamic responses are estimated, and the evoked brain activity is more robustly separated from systemic physiological interference using independent measures of nuisance regressors, such as short-separation fNIRS measurements. When correctly applied in single trial analysis, e.g., in BCI, this approach can significantly enhance contrast to noise ratio of the brain signal, improve feature separability and ultimately lead to better classification accuracy. In this manuscript, we provide a brief introduction into the GLM and show how to incorporate it into a typical BCI preprocessing pipeline and cross-validation. Using a resting state fNIRS data set augmented with synthetic hemodynamic responses that provide ground truth brain activity, we compare the quality of commonly used fNIRS features for BCI that are extracted from (1) conventionally preprocessed signals, and (2) signals preprocessed with the GLM and physiological nuisance regressors. We show that the GLM-based approach can provide better single trial estimates of brain activity as well as a new feature type, i.e., the weight of the individual and channel-specific hemodynamic response function (HRF) regressor. The improved estimates yield features with higher separability, that significantly enhance accuracy in a binary classification task when compared to conventional preprocessing—on average +7.4% across subjects and feature types. We propose to adapt this well-established approach from neuroscience to the domain of single-trial analysis and preprocessing wherever the classification of evoked brain activity is of concern, for instance in BCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: In recent years, the study of the benefits that physical exercise has on brain health has acquired special relevance. In order to implement exercise as an intervention to protect the brain, it is important to have a more clear idea of its effect in the young population. However, few studies have been carried out on these ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The main objective of our study was to evaluate the association between physical activity (PA) with memory and executive function, in university students, analyzing the modulatory effect of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methodology: We collected socio-demographic and life habit information, as well as data on the PA that was carried out during the previous week using the international PAquestionnaire short version (IPAQ-SF) questionnaire in 206 university students (mean age 19.55 ± 2.39; 67.5% women). Memory and executive function were assessed using a comprehensive battery of validate cognitive tests. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to correlate PA with cognitive tests scores and to evaluate the potential synergistic role of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The main finding was that the total amount of PA correlated positively with several tests that evaluated aspects of executive function, specifically Stroop Colors (Pearson’s r = 0.17; p = 0.01) and the Stroop Test Color–Word (Pearson’s r = 0.15. p = 0.03). These results were adjusted by a large number of possible confounders and modifying variables in a multivariate analysis, like age, sex, academic record, day of the week, and time at which the test was performed. Additionally, we found out that sex had a synergistic effect with PA on the executive test Trail making test-A (TMTA), and in women, this association was stronger than in men. The more PA women reported, the better they performed, that is to say that they took less time to finalize the TMT-A (interaction term between PA and sex: b = −0.0009; p = 0.014).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study adds evidence of the benefit of PA in cognition in the young population, specifically in the executive inhibitory control, and more significantly in women.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Natural brains perform miraculously well in learning new tasks from a small number of samples, whereas sample efficient learning is still a major open problem in the field of machine learning. Here, we raise the question, how the neural coding scheme affects sample efficiency, and make first progress on this question by proposing and analyzing a learning algorithm that uses a simple reinforce-type plasticity mechanism and does not require any gradients to learn low dimensional mappings. It harnesses three bio-plausible mechanisms, namely, population codes with bell shaped tuning curves, continous attractor mechanisms and probabilistic synapses, to achieve sample efficient learning. We show both theoretically and by simulations that population codes with broadly tuned neurons lead to high sample efficiency, whereas codes with sharply tuned neurons account for high final precision. Moreover, a dynamic adaptation of the tuning width during learning gives rise to both, high sample efficiency and high final precision. We prove a sample efficiency guarantee for our algorithm that lies within a logarithmic factor from the information theoretical optimum. Our simulations show that for low dimensional mappings, our learning algorithm achieves comparable sample efficiency to multi-layer perceptrons trained by gradient descent, although it does not use any gradients. Furthermore, it achieves competitive sample efficiency in low dimensional reinforcement learning tasks. From a machine learning perspective, these findings may inspire novel approaches to improve sample efficiency. From a neuroscience perspective, these findings suggest sample efficiency as a yet unstudied functional role of adaptive tuning curve width.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurons in many brain regions exhibit spontaneous, intrinsic rhythmic firing activity. This rhythmic firing activity may determine the way in which these neurons respond to extrinsic synaptic inputs. We hypothesized that neurons should be most responsive to inputs at the frequency of the intrinsic oscillation frequency. We addressed this question in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic nucleus in the midbrain. VTA neurons have a unique propensity to exhibit spontaneous intrinsic rhythmic activity in the 1–5 Hz frequency range, which persists in the in-vitro brain slice, and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators. Here, we combine in-vitro simultaneous recording of action potentials from a 60 channel multi-electrode-array with cell-type-specific optogenetic stimulation of the VTA dopamine neurons. We investigated how VTA neurons respond to wide-band stochastic (Poisson input) as well as regular laser pulses. Strong synchrony was induced between the laser input and the spike timing of the neurons, both for regular pulse trains and Poisson pulse trains. For rhythmically pulsed input, the neurons demonstrated resonant behavior with the strongest phase locking at their intrinsic oscillation frequency, but also at half and double the intrinsic oscillation frequency. Stochastic Poisson pulse stimulation provided a more effective stimulation of the entire population, yet we observed resonance at lower frequencies (approximately half the oscillation frequency) than the neurons' intrinsic oscillation frequency. The non-linear filter characteristics of dopamine neurons could allow the VTA to predict precisely timed future rewards based on past sensory inputs, a crucial component of reward prediction error signaling. In addition, these filter characteristics could contribute to a pacemaker role for the VTA in synchronizing activity with other regions like the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with varying degrees of aggressiveness and prognosis. Understanding of tumor biology and intra-tumor heterogeneity is necessary for planning personalized therapy and predicting response to therapy. Accurate tumoral and intra-tumoral segmentation on MRI is the first step toward understanding the tumor biology through computational methods. The purpose of this study was to design a segmentation algorithm and evaluate its performance on pre-treatment brain MRIs obtained from patients with gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: In this study, we have designed a novel 3D U-Net architecture that segments various radiologically identifiable sub-regions like edema, enhancing tumor, and necrosis. Weighted patch extraction scheme from the tumor border regions is proposed to address the problem of class imbalance between tumor and non-tumorous patches. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and the symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. The Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based architecture is trained on 285 patients, validated on 66 patients and tested on 191 patients with Glioma from Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 challenge dataset. Three dimensional patches are extracted from multi-channel BraTS training dataset to train 3D U-Net architecture. The efficacy of the proposed approach is also tested on an independent dataset of 40 patients with High Grade Glioma from our tertiary cancer center. Segmentation results are assessed in terms of Dice Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Hausdorff 95 distance (ITCN intra-tumoral classification network).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Our proposed architecture achieved Dice scores of 0.88, 0.83, and 0.75 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively, on BraTS validation dataset and 0.85, 0.77, 0.67 on test dataset. The results were similar on the independent patients' dataset from our hospital, achieving Dice scores of 0.92, 0.90, and 0.81 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results of this study show the potential of patch-based 3D U-Net for the accurate intra-tumor segmentation. From experiments, it is observed that the weighted patch-based segmentation approach gives comparable performance with the pixel-based approach when there is a thin boundary between tumor subparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The study investigated the consequences of age-related decline in inhibition processes on intentional switching between bimanual coordination patterns. Fifteen young (24±2.8 years) and 20 older adults (69±5.3 years) performed Stroop tasks and bimanual coordination tasks. Stroop tasks included neutral, congruent, and incongruent conditions. Response time and error rate were measured. Bimanual coordination tasks consisted of performing in-phase (IP) and anti-phase (AP) patterns. Participants were requested to switch as quickly as possible from one pattern to the other, resulting in two different switching directions (AP to IP; IP to AP). Mean and standard deviation (SD) of the continuous relative phase (CRP) were calculated pre- and post-switching for each participant. Total switching time (TST) was measured. The switching phase was also decomposed into reaction time (RT) and reversal time (REvT). Pearson correlation analyses were performed to test for correlations between: (i) SD of CRP and response time in Stroop tasks, and (ii) switching times (TST, RT, RevT) and response time in Stroop task, respectively. In addition, parallel mediation analyses were conducted. Results showed that: (i) the AP pattern was less stable than the IP pattern in both young and older adults, (ii) coordination patterns were less stable in older adults, (iii) response times in Stroop task were longer in the incongruent condition, and (iv) RespTs were longer in older than in young participants, whatever the condition. In the bimanual coordination task, RT, RevT, and TST increased with age. The stability of the IP pattern was correlated with the response times observed in neutral and congruent conditions, while the stability of the AP pattern was correlated with response time observed in the incongruent condition. Correlation and mediation analyses showed that, in the AP to IP switching direction, RT and RevT were both significantly correlated with response times observed in the incongruent condition of Stroop task. These findings suggest that inhibition processes are involved in switching between bimanual coordination patterns, at least to trigger the early phase of switching. They also support the hypothesis that inhibition processes are more involved in maintaining the AP pattern and switching to the IP pattern. Finally, age-related changes in switching times seem to be prominently mediated by alterations of inhibition processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) process multiple aspects of a tasting experience, encoding not only the physiochemical identity of tastes, but also their anticipation and hedonic value. Information pertaining to these stimulus features is relayed to GC via the gustatory thalamus (VPMpc) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). It is not known whether these inputs drive separate groups of neurons, thus activating separate channels of information, or are integrated by neurons that receive both afferents. Here, we used anterograde labeling and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; intracellular recordings in anesthetized rats to assess the potential convergence of BLA and VPMpc inputs in GC, and to investigate the dynamics of integration of these inputs. We report substantial anatomic overlap of BLA and VPMpc axonal fields across GC, and identify a population of GC neurons receiving converging BLA and VPMpc inputs. Our data show that BLA modulates the gain of VPMpc-evoked responses in a time-dependent fashion and that this modulation is dependent on the recruitment of synaptic inhibition by both BLA and VPMpc. Our results suggest that BLA shapes cortical processing of thalamic inputs by dynamically gating the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the GC circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Reward value guides goal-directed behavior and modulates early sensory processing. Rewarding stimuli are often multisensory, but it is not known how reward value is combined across sensory modalities. Here we show that the integration of reward value critically depends on whether the distinct sensory inputs are perceived to emanate from the same multisensory object. We systematically manipulated the congruency in monetary reward values and the relative spatial positions of co-occurring auditory and visual stimuli that served as bimodal distractors during an oculomotor task performed by healthy human participants (male and female). The amount of interference induced by the distractors was used as an indicator of their perceptual salience. Our results across two experiments show that when reward value is linked to each modality separately, the value congruence between vision and audition determines the combined salience of the bimodal distractors. However, the reward value of vision wins over the value of audition if the two modalities are perceived to convey conflicting information regarding the spatial position of the bimodal distractors. These results show that in a task that highly relies on the processing of visual spatial information, the reward values from multiple sensory modalities are integrated with each other, each with their respective weights. This weighting depends on the strength of prior beliefs regarding a common source for incoming unisensory signals based on their congruency in reward value and perceived spatial alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bicaudal D cargo adaptor 2 (BICD2) gene encodes a conserved cargo adapter protein required for dynein‐mediated transport. Inherited and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; variants in &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; cause spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity dominant 2 (SMALED2), and a subset have recently been reported to cause severe, often lethal disease. However, a true genotype‐phenotype correlation for &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; has not been performed, and cases described to date are scattered among at least 14 publications. In this review, we identify the characteristics of disease‐causing variants in &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; that distinguish them from benign variation, and perform genotype‐phenotype correlations for 99 &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; variant carriers from 35 families.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early step in tau‐mediated neurodegeneration and is associated with intracellular aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Sleep loss increases the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of amyloid‐β and tau. Using mass spectrometry, we measured tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations in serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected from participants who were sleep‐deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. We found that sleep loss affected phosphorylated tau differently depending on the modified site. These findings suggest a mechanism for sleep loss to increase risk of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel, highly effective disease‐modifying therapies have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care. However, evidence from large comparative studies on important safety outcomes, such as cancer, is still lacking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this nationwide register‐based cohort study, we linked data from the Swedish MS register to the Swedish Cancer Register and other national healthcare and census registers. We included 4187 first‐ever initiations of rituximab, 1620 of fingolimod, and 1670 of natalizumab, in 6136 MS patients, age‐sex‐and‐location matched to 37801 non‐MS general population subjects. Primary outcome was time to first invasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 78 invasive cancers among treated patients: rituximab 33 (incidence rate, IR, per 10,000 person years 34.4 [95% confidence interval 23.7–48.3]), fingolimod 28 (44.0 [29.2–63.5]), and natalizumab 17 (26.0 [15.1–41.6]). The general population IR was 31.0 [27.8–34.4]. Adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found no difference in risk of invasive cancer between rituximab, natalizumab, and the general population, but a possibly higher risk with fingolimod compared to the general population (1.53 [0.98–2.38]) and rituximab (hazard ratio 1.68 [1.00–2.84]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first, large, comparative study of three highly effective MS disease‐modifying therapies, no increased risk of invasive cancer was seen with rituximab and natalizumab, compared to the general population. However, there was a borderline‐significant increased risk with fingolimod, compared to both the general population and rituximab. It was not possible to attribute this increased risk to any specific type of cancer and further studies are warranted to validate these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex post‐processing or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time‐efficient simultaneous T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐relaxometry and proton density mapping, in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3 Tesla MRI; &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; in three multiple sclerosis brain samples and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex‐matched healthy controls, with scan‐rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2‐year follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin‐related stains (proteolipid protein‐immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole‐brain and normal‐appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow‐up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal‐appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Since the technique is fast with automatic post‐processing and FDA/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Monosynaptically-restricted transsynaptic tracing using deletion-mutant rabies virus (RV) has become a widely used technique in neuroscience, allowing identification, imaging, and manipulation of neurons directly presynaptic to a starting neuronal population. Its most common implementation is to use Cre mouse lines in combination with Cre-dependent “helper” adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) to supply the required genes to the targeted population before subsequent injection of a first-generation (ΔG) rabies viral vector. Here we show that the efficiency of transsynaptic spread and the degree of nonspecific labeling in wild-type control animals depend strongly on the concentrations of these helper AAVs. Our results suggest practical guidelines for achieving good results.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a challenging condition for which current therapies often remain unsatisfactory. Chronic administration of β2 adrenergic agonists, including formoterol currently used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alleviates mechanical allodynia in the sciatic nerve cuff model of neuropathic pain. The limited clinical data currently available also suggest that formoterol would be a suitable candidate for drug repurposing. The antiallodynic action of β2 adrenergic agonists is known to require activation of the delta-opioid (DOP) receptor but better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved is necessary. Using a mouse line in which DOP receptors were selectively ablated in neurons expressing Nav1.8 sodium channels (DOP cKO), we showed that these DOP peripheral receptors were necessary for the antiallodynic action of the β2 adrenergic agonist formoterol in the cuff model. Using a knock-in mouse line expressing a fluorescent version of the DOP receptor fused with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (DOPeGFP), we established in a previous study, that mechanical allodynia is associated with a smaller percentage of DOPeGFP positive small peptidergic sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), with a reduced density of DOPeGFP positive free nerve endings in the skin and with increased DOPeGFP expression at the cell surface. Here, we showed that the density of DOPeGFP positive free nerve endings in the skin is partially restored and no increase in DOPeGFP translocation to the plasma membrane is observed in mice in which mechanical pain is alleviated upon chronic oral administration of formoterol. This study, therefore, extends our previous results by confirming that changes in the mechanical threshold are associated with changes in peripheral DOP profile. It also highlights the common impact on DOP receptors between serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine and the β2 mimetic formoterol.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent task fMRI studies suggest that individual differences in trait empathy and empathic concern are mediated by patterns of connectivity between self-other resonance and top-down control networks that are stable across task demands. An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) and the Waterloo Footedness Questionnaire (WFQ) are two of the most widely used questionnaires to assess lateralized everyday behavior in human participants. However, it is unclear to what extent the specific behavior assessed in these questionnaires elicit lateralized neural activity when performed in real-life situations. To illuminate this unresolved issue, we assessed EEG alpha and beta asymmetries during real-life performance of the behaviors assessed in the EHI and WFQ using a mobile EEG system. This methodology provides high ecological validity for studying neural correlates of motor behavior under more naturalistic conditions. Our results indicate that behavioral performance of items of both the EHI and WFQ differentiate between left- and right-handers and left- and right-footers on the neural level, especially in the alpha frequency band. These results were unaffected by movement parameters. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that neural activity elicited specifically during left-sided task performance provides predictive power for the EHI or WFQ score of the participants. Overall, our results show that these prominent questionnaires not only distinguish between different motor preferences on the behavioral level, but also on the neurophysiological level. Furthermore, we could show that mobile EEG systems are a powerful tool to investigate motor asymmetries in ecologically valid situations outside of the laboratory setting. Future research should focus on other lateralized behavioral phenotypes in real-life settings to provide more insights into lateralized motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The main hypothesis of this work is that the time of delay in reaction to an unexpected event can be predicted on the basis of the brain activity recorded prior to that event. Such mental activity can be represented by electroencephalographic data. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a novel experiment involving 19 participants that took part in a 2-h long session of simulated aircraft flights. An EEG signal processing pipeline is proposed that consists of signal preprocessing, extracting bandpass features, and using regression to predict the reaction times. The prediction algorithms that are used in this study are the Least Absolute Shrinkage Operator and its Least Angle Regression modification, as well as Kernel Ridge and Radial Basis Support Vector Machine regression. The average Mean Absolute Error obtained across the 19 subjects was 114 ms. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to predict reaction times on the basis of EEG data. The presented solution can serve as a foundation for a system that can, in the future, increase the safety of air traffic.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Research is increasingly focusing on promoting healthy aging and the related extension of the health span by targeting crucial biological processes responsible for age-related conditions. While age-related gradual changes in steroid hormones such as testosterone, estradiol, or cortisol are well described in men, their interactions among each other or with genetic markers have not been sufficiently investigated with regard to physical health or psychological well-being. More specifically, the examination of age-related alterations in hormone interactions and the androgen receptor polymorphism, which modulates androgen action on target cells, in relation to physical health and psychological well-being represents a promising avenue for research on healthy aging in men. A total of 97 healthy aging men provided complete data on psychometric health measures as well as hormonal and genetic parameters at baseline and a 4-year follow-up assessment. Fasting saliva samples were taken at 8:00 am under standardized laboratory conditions, while the androgen receptor gene polymorphism was analyzed from dried blood spots. Longitudinal analyses revealed that psychological well-being and physical health remained stable over time. Analyses indicated that E2 moderated the course of psychological well-being, while the androgen receptor gene polymorphism moderated the course of physical health. Further, T was a strong predictor of physical health. These results suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis might be important for the maintenance of psychological well-being in men, while physical health depends more on interindividual differences in the androgen receptor gene and T.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) walk independently although with an asymmetrical, more poorly coordinated pattern compared to their peers. While gait biomechanics in unilateral CP and their alteration from those without CP have been well documented, cortical mechanisms underlying gait remain inadequately understood. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) during treadmill gait in older children with and without CP. Lower limb surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected and muscle synergy analyses performed to quantify motor output. Our primary goal was to evaluate the relationships between cortical and muscle activation within and across groups and hemispheres to provide novel insights into neural control of gait and how it may be disrupted by an early unilateral brain injury. Participants included 9 children with unilateral CP, mean age 16.0 ± 2.7 years, and 12 with typical development (TD), mean age 14.8 ± 3.0 years. EEG data were collected during a standing baseline and treadmill walking at self-selected speed. EMG of 16 lower limb muscles were also collected bilaterally and synchronized with EEG. No significant group differences were found in synergy number or structure across groups. Six cortical clusters were identified as having gait-related activation and all contained participants from both CP and TD groups; however, the percent of individuals per group appearing in different clusters varied. Notably, the cluster least represented in CP was the non-dominant motor region. Both groups showed mu-band ERD in the motor clusters during gait although sustained beta-band ERD was not evident in TD. The CP group showed greater cortical activation than TD during walking as measured by mu- and beta-ERD in the dominant and non-dominant motor and parietal regions and elevated low gamma-activity in the frontal and parietal areas, a unique finding in CP. CP showed greater bilateral motor EEG-EMG coherence in the gamma-band with the hallucis longus compared to TD. In summary, individuals with CP display increased cortical activation during gait possibly relating to differences in distal motor control of the more affected side. Strategies that iteratively reduce cortical activation while improving selective motor control are needed in CP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stimulating the primary motor cortex (M1) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) causes unique multisensory experience such as the targeted muscle activity, afferent/reafferent sensory feedback, tactile sensation over the scalp and “click” sound. Although the human M1 has been intensively investigated using TMS, the experience of the M1 stimulation has not been elucidated at the whole brain. Here, using concurrent TMS/fMRI, we investigated the acute effect of the M1 stimulation of functional brain networks during task and at rest. A short train of 1 Hz TMS pulses applied to individuals’ hand area in the M1 during motor execution or at rest. Employing the independent component analysis (ICA), we showed the M1 stimulation decreased the motor networks activity when the networks were engaged in the task and increased the deactivation of networks when the networks were not involved in the ongoing task. The M1 stimulation induced the activation in the key networks involved in bodily self-consciousness (BSC) including the insular and rolandic operculum systems regardless of states. The degree of activation in these networks was prominent at rest compared to task conditions, showing the state-dependent TMS effect. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the M1 stimulation modulated other domain-general networks such as the default mode network (DMN) and attention network and the inter-network connectivity between these networks. Our results showed that the M1 stimulation induced the widespread changes in the brain at the targeted system as well as non-motor, remote brain networks, specifically related to the BSC. Our findings shed light on understanding the neural mechanism of the complex and multisensory experience of the M1 stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose a novel cascaded V-Nets method to segment brain tumor substructures in multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Although V-Net has been successfully used in many segmentation tasks, we demonstrate that its performance could be further enhanced by using a cascaded structure and ensemble strategy. Briefly, our baseline V-Net consists of four levels with encoding and decoding paths and intra- and inter-path skip connections. Focal loss is chosen to improve performance on hard samples as well as balance the positive and negative samples. We further propose three preprocessing pipelines for multimodal magnetic resonance images to train different models. By ensembling the segmentation probability maps obtained from these models, segmentation result is further improved. In other hand, we propose to segment the whole tumor first, and then divide it into tumor necrosis, edema, and enhancing tumor. Experimental results on BraTS 2018 online validation set achieve average Dice scores of 0.9048, 0.8364, and 0.7748 for whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. The corresponding values for BraTS 2018 online testing set are 0.8761, 0.7953, and 0.7364, respectively. We also evaluate the proposed method in two additional data sets from local hospitals comprising of 28 and 28 subjects, and the best results are 0.8635, 0.8036, and 0.7217, respectively. We further make a prediction of patient overall survival by ensembling multiple classifiers for long, mid and short groups, and achieve accuracy of 0.519, mean square error of 367240 and Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.168 for BraTS 2018 online testing set.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Pericytes are perivascular mural cells that enwrap brain capillaries and maintain blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Most studies suggest that pericytes regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen delivery to activated brain structures, known as neurovascular coupling. While we have previously shown that congenital loss of pericytes leads over time to aberrant hemodynamic responses, the effects of acute global pericyte loss on neurovascular coupling have not been studied. To address this, we used our recently reported inducible pericyte-specific Cre mouse line crossed to iDTR mice carrying Cre-dependent human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor, which upon DT treatment leads to acute pericyte ablation. As expected, DT led to rapid progressive loss of pericyte coverage of cortical capillaries up to 50% at 3 days post-DT, which correlated with approximately 50% reductions in stimulus-induced CBF responses measured with laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) and/or intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging. Endothelial response to acetylcholine, microvascular density, and neuronal evoked membrane potential responses remained, however, unchanged, as well as arteriolar smooth muscle cell (SMC) coverage and functional responses to adenosine, as we previously reported. Together, these data suggest that neurovascular uncoupling in this model is driven by pericyte loss, but not other vascular deficits or neuronal dysfunction. These results further support the role of pericytes in CBF regulation and may have implications for neurological conditions associated with rapid pericyte loss such as hypoperfusion and stroke, as well as conditions where the exact time course of global regional pericyte loss is less clear, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurogenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unknown whether patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with ischaemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy are at increased risk for further recurrent strokes and how ongoing secondary prevention should be managed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an individual patient data pooled analysis of seven prospective cohort studies which recruited patients with AF and cerebral ischemia. We compared patients taking oral anticoagulants (Vitamin K antagonists [VKA] or direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC]) prior to index event (OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt;) with those without prior anticoagulation (OAC&lt;sub&gt;naive&lt;/sub&gt;). We further compared those who changed the type (i.e. from VKA or DOAC, vice versa or DOAC to DOAC) of anticoagulation (OAC&lt;sub&gt;changed&lt;/sub&gt;) with those who continued the same anticoagulation as secondary prevention (OAC&lt;sub&gt;unchanged&lt;/sub&gt;). Time to recurrent ischaemic stroke (AIS) was analysed using multivariate competing risk Fine‐Gray models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 5413 patients (median age 78years [IQR 71‐84years], 5136 [96.7%] had ischaemic stroke as the index event (median NIHSS‐on‐admission 6 [IQR 2‐12]). The median CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐Vasc score was 5 (IQR4‐6) and not different between OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt; (n=1195) and OAC&lt;sub&gt;naive&lt;/sub&gt; (n=4119, p=0.103). During 6128 patient‐years of follow‐up, 289 patients had AIS (4.7%/year, 95%CI 4.2‐5.3%). OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt; was associated with an increased risk of AIS (HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.2‐2.3, p=0.005). OAC&lt;sub&gt;changed&lt;/sub&gt; (n=307) was not associated with decreased risk of AIS (HR 1.2, 95%CI 0.7‐2.1, p=0.415) compared with OAC&lt;sub&gt;unchanged&lt;/sub&gt; (n=585).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with AF who have a stroke despite oral anticoagulation once are at a higher risk for recurrent strokes despite a similar CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐Vasc score to those without prior oral anticoagulation. Better prevention strategies are needed for this high risk patient group.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies against neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis alter neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, but the effects on other cells of the nervous system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSF of patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (preabsorbed or not with GluN1) and a human NMDAR specific monoclonal antibody (SSM5) derived from plasma cells of a patient, along the corresponding controls, were used in the studies. To evaluate the activity of oligodendrocyte NMDARs and AMPARs in vitro after exposure to patients'CSF antibodies or SSM5 we used a functional assay based on cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging. Expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT1) in oligodencrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NMDAR agonists responses were robustly reduced after pre‐incubation of oligodendrocytes with patients' CSF, or SSM5, but remained largely unaltered with the corresponding controls. These effects were NMDAR‐specific as patients' CSFs did not alter responses to AMPA receptor agonists and were abrogated by pre‐absorption of CSF with HEK cells expressing GluN1 subunit. Additionally, patients' CSF reduced oligodendrocyte expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 induced by NMDAR activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis specifically alter the function of NMDAR in oligodendrocytes causing a decrease of expression of GLUT1. Considering that normal GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes and myelin is needed to metabolically support axonal function, the findings suggest a link between antibody‐mediated dysfunction of NMDAR in oligodendrocytes and the white matter alterations reported in patients with this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Purkinje cell microcircuits perform diverse functions using widespread inputs from the brain and spinal cord. The formation of these functional circuits depends on developmental programs and molecular pathways that organize mossy fiber afferents from different sources into a complex and precisely patterned map within the granular layer of the cerebellum. During development, Purkinje cell zonal patterns are thought to guide mossy fiber terminals into zones. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this process remain unclear. Here, we used knockout mice to test whether Eph/ephrin signaling controls Purkinje cell-mossy fiber interactions during cerebellar circuit formation. Loss of ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 disrupted the patterning of spinocerebellar terminals into discrete zones. Zone territories in the granular layer that normally have limited spinocerebellar input contained ectopic terminals in ephrin-A2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;;ephrin-A5&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; double knockout mice. However, the overall morphology of the cerebellum, lobule position, and Purkinje cell zonal patterns developed normally in the ephrin-A2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;;ephrin-A5&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice. This work suggests that communication between Purkinje cell zones and mossy fibers during postnatal development allows contact-dependent molecular cues to sharpen the innervation of sensory afferents into functional zones.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Polymorphisms in the human circadian clock gene PERIOD3 (PER3) are associated with a wide variety of phenotypes such as diurnal preference, delayed sleep phase disorder, sleep homeostasis, cognitive performance, bipolar disorder, type 2 diabetes, cardiac regulation, cancer, light sensitivity, hormone and cytokine secretion, and addiction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypic associations remain unknown. Per3 knockout mice (Per3&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) have phenotypes related to activity, sleep homeostasis, anhedonia, metabolism, and behavioral responses to light. Using a protocol that induces behavioral differences in response to light in wild type and Per3&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we compared genome-wide expression in the eye and hypothalamus in the two genotypes. Differentially expressed transcripts were related to inflammation, taste, olfactory and melatonin receptors, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, ubiquitination, and hormones, as well as receptors and channels related to sleep regulation. Differentially expressed transcripts in both tissues co-localized with Per3 on an ∼8Mbp region of distal chromosome 4. The most down-regulated transcript is Prdm16, which is involved in adipocyte differentiation and may mediate altered body mass accumulation in Per3&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. eQTL analysis with BXD mouse strains showed that the expression of some of these transcripts and also others co-localized at distal chromosome 4, is correlated with brain tissue expression levels of Per3 with a highly significant linkage to genetic variation in that region. These data identify a cluster of transcripts on mouse distal chromosome 4 that are co-regulated with Per3 and whose expression levels correlate with those of Per3. This locus lies within a topologically associating domain island that contains many genes with functional links to several of the diverse non-circadian phenotypes associated with polymorphisms in human PER3.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (GAT)-1, the major GABA transporter in the brain, plays a key role in modulating GABA signaling and is involved in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric diseases, including epilepsy. The original description of GAT-1 as a neuronal transporter has guided the interpretation of the findings of all physiological, pharmacological, genetic, or clinical studies. However, evidence published in the past few years, some of which is briefly reviewed herein, does not seem to be consistent with a neurocentric view of GAT-1 function and calls for more detailed analysis of its localization. We therefore performed a thorough systematic assessment of GAT-1 localization in neocortex and subcortical white matter. In line with earlier work, we found that GAT-1 was robustly expressed in axon terminals forming symmetric synapses and in astrocytic processes, whereas its astrocytic expression was more diffuse than expected and, even more surprisingly, immature and mature oligodendrocytes and microglial cells also expressed the transporter. These data indicate that the era of “neuronal” and “glial” GABA transporters has finally come to a close and provide a wider perspective from which to view GABA-mediated physiological phenomena. In addition, given the well-known involvement of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells in physiological as well as pathological conditions, the demonstration of functional GAT-1 in these cells is expected to provide greater insight into the phenomena occurring in the diseased brain as well as to prompt a reassessment of earlier findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The search for new disease-modifying drugs for Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a slow and highly expensive process, and the repurposing of drugs already approved for different medical indications is becoming a compelling alternative option for researchers. Genetic variables represent a predisposing factor to the disease and mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) locus have been correlated to late-onset autosomal-dominant PD. The common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster carrying the mutation LRRK2 loss-of-function in the WD40 domain (LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt;), is a simple in vivo model of PD and is a valid tool to first evaluate novel therapeutic approaches to the disease. Recent studies have suggested a neuroprotective activity of immunomodulatory agents in PD models. Here the immunomodulatory drug Pomalidomide (POM), a Thalidomide derivative, was examined in the Drosophila LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt; genetic model of PD. Mutant and wild type flies received increasing POM doses (1, 0.5, 0.25 mM) through their diet from day 1 post eclosion, until postnatal day (PN) 7 or 14, when POM’s actions were evaluated by quantifying changes in climbing behavior as a measure of motor performance, the number of brain dopaminergic neurons and T-bars, mitochondria integrity. LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt; flies displayed a spontaneous age-related impairment of climbing activity, and POM significantly and dose-dependently improved climbing performance both at PN 7 and PN 14. LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt; fly motor disability was underpinned by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in posterior clusters of the protocerebrum, which are involved in the control of locomotion, by a low number of T-bars density in the presynaptic bouton active zones. POM treatment fully rescued the cell loss in all posterior clusters at PN 7 and PN 14 and significantly increased the T-bars density. Moreover, several damaged mitochondria with dilated cristae were observed in LRRK2&lt;sup&gt;WD40&lt;/sup&gt; flies treated with vehicle but not following POM. This study demonstrates the neuroprotective activity of the immunomodulatory agent POM in a genetic model of PD. POM is an FDA-approved clinically available and well-tolerated drug used for the treatment of multiple myeloma. If further validated in mammalian models of PD, POM could rapidly be clinically tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The global incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is on the rise with the increase in obesity and metabolic disease epidemic. Obesity is co-morbid with the increase in mass of adipose tissue, which secretes numerous molecules that are biologically important. Obesity and its associated conditions are perhaps involved in the causative pathway of AD. Immunologically important cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-18, which are released by adipose tissue, are also found to be associated with AD. Besides, the expression of IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF alpha are also associated with AD. Ang-I and Ang-II are found to mediate the progression of AD. Complement factors B, C4b, and H are differentially expressed in AD. Overall, several adipocyte-derived cytokines are found to be dysregulated in AD, and their role in AD remains to be studied. The induction of autophagy is a very promising strategy in the treatment of AD. A variety of adipose-derived molecules have been shown to modulate autophagy. However, very little literature is available on the role of adipose-derived molecules in inducing autophagy in microglial cells of AD. Understanding the role of adipose-derived molecules in the development of AD, especially in the induction of autophagy, would open up new avenues in devising strategies for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Synaptic transmission and plasticity are shaped by the dynamic reorganization of signaling molecules within pre- and postsynaptic compartments. The nanoscale organization of key effector molecules has been revealed by single-particle trajectory (SPT) methods. Interestingly, this nanoscale organization is highly heterogeneous. For example, presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and postsynaptic ligand-gated ion channels such as AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are organized into so-called nanodomains where individual molecules are only transiently trapped.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, resulting in the progressive decline of cognitive function in patients. Familial forms of AD are tied to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, but the cellular mechanisms that cause AD remain unclear. Inflammation and amyloidosis from amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates are implicated in neuron loss and cognitive decline. Inflammation activates the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and this could suppress many signaling pathways that activate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) implicated in neurodegeneration. However, the significance of PTP1B in AD pathology remains unclear. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B with trodusquemine or selective ablation of PTP1B in neurons prevents hippocampal neuron loss and spatial memory deficits in a transgenic AD mouse model with Aβ pathology (hAPP-J20 mice of both sexes). Intriguingly, while systemic inhibition of PTP1B reduced inflammation in the hippocampus, neuronal PTP1B ablation did not. These results dissociate inflammation from neuronal loss and cognitive decline and demonstrate that neuronal PTP1B hastens neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in this model of AD. The protective effect of PTP1B inhibition or ablation coincides with the restoration of GSK3β inhibition. Neuronal ablation of PTP1B did not affect cerebral amyloid levels or plaque numbers, but reduced Aβ plaque size in the hippocampus. In summary, our preclinical study suggests that targeting PTP1B may be a new strategy to intervene in the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are tied to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, but the cellular mechanisms that cause AD remain unclear. Here, we used a mouse model expressing human amyloid precursor protein bearing two familial mutations and asked whether activation of a phosphatase PTP1B participates in the disease process. Systemic inhibition of this phosphatase using a selective inhibitor prevented cognitive decline, neuron loss in the hippocampus, and attenuated inflammation. Importantly, neuron-targeted ablation of PTP1B also prevented cognitive decline and neuron loss but did not reduce inflammation. Therefore, neuronal loss rather than inflammation was critical for AD progression in this mouse model, and that disease progression could be ameliorated by inhibition of PTP1B.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to impaired memory and cognitive deficits. Spine loss as well as changes in spine morphology correlates with cognitive impairment in this neurological disorder. Many studies in animal models and ex vivo cultures indicate that amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) oligomers induce synaptic damage early during the progression of the disease. Here, in order to determine the events that initiate synaptic alterations, we acutely applied oligomeric Aβ to primary hippocampal neurons and an ex vivo model of organotypic hippocampal cultures from a mouse after targeted expression of EGFP to allow high-resolution imaging and algorithm-based evaluation of spine changes. Dendritic spines were classified as thin, stubby or mushroom, based on morphology. In vivo, time-lapse imaging showed that the three spine types were relatively stable, although their stability significantly decreased after treatment with Aβ oligomers. Unexpectedly, we observed that the density of total dendritic spines increased in organotypic hippocampal slices treated with Aβ compared to control cultures. Specifically, the fraction of stubby spines significantly increased, while mushroom and thin spines remained unaltered. Pharmacological tools revealed that acute Aβ oligomers induced spine changes through mechanisms involving CaMKII and integrin β1 activities. Additionally, analysis of dendritic complexity based on a 3D reconstruction of the whole neuron morphology showed an increase in the apical dendrite length and branching points in CA1 organotypic hippocampal slices treated with Aβ. In contrast to spines, the morphological changes were affected by integrin β1 but not by CaMKII inhibition. Altogether, these data indicate that the Aβ oligomers exhibit early dual effects by acutely enhancing dendritic complexity and spine density.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Emerging studies have demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-33 and its receptor ST2 act as key factors in inflammatory diseases. Moreover, accumulating evidence has suggested that cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β, trigger an inflammatory cascade. SIRT1 has been shown to suppress the expression of inflammatory cytokines. However, the effects of SIRT1 on IL-33/ST2 signaling and initiation of the inflammatory cascade via modulation of TNF-α and IL-1β by IL-33 remain unclear. In the present study, we found that the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) IL-33 and ST2 were upregulated in a rat model of spared nerve injury (SNI) and intrathecal injection of either IL-33 or ST2 antibodies alleviated mechanical allodynia and downregulated TNF-α and IL-1β induced by SNI. In addition, activation of SIRT1 decreased enhanced DRG IL-33/ST2 signaling in SNI rats. Artificial inactivation of SIRT1 via intrathecal injection of an SIRT1 antagonist could induce mechanical allodynia and upregulate IL-33 and ST2. These results demonstrated that reduction in SIRT1 could induce upregulation of DRG IL-33 and ST2 and contribute to mechanical allodynia induced by SNI in rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Social attention deficits are a hallmark characteristic within autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and have been hypothesized to have cascading effects on emotion recognition. Eye-tracking methodology has emerged as a potentially reliable, feasible, and sensitive biomarker for examining core phenotypic features of ASD; however, these findings are mixed with regards to measuring treatment change in clinical trials. The present study aimed to assess the utility of an eye-tracking paradigm to discriminate between clinical groups in social attention and emotion recognition through face scanning and pupillometry. The present study also assessed the reliability of this paradigm within the ASD sample to further our understanding of the utility of eye-tracking for future clinical trials. Participants included 42 individuals with ASD, 29 developmental disability (DD) controls, and 62 typically developing (TD) controls between 3 and 25 years of age. An emotional faces eye-tracking paradigm was administered to all participants, with the ASD group completing the paradigm a second time approximately 2 months later. Participants’ average proportion of looking and number of fixations to specific areas of interest (AOI) were examined along with changes in pupil reactivity while viewing different emotional faces. Results suggest atypical face-scanning through a reduced proportion of looking and the number of fixations toward the eyes in the ASD group regardless of the emotion that was presented. Further, pupillometry measures were able to detect increases in pupil dilation to happy faces in the ASD group. Lastly, test-retest reliability coefficients varied between the poor and excellent range based on the mechanism assessed, with the proportion of looking demonstrating the highest reliability coefficients. These findings build on the promise of eye-tracking as a feasible and reliable biomarker for identifying social attention and emotion recognition deficits in ASD. Detecting differences in emotion recognition explicitly through facial scanning was not as clear. Specific mechanisms within the eye-tracking paradigm may be viable options for assessing treatment-specific outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Abnormal structural connectivity of cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD) is associated with cognitive impairment. But the different characteristics of structural connectivity have not been elucidated in early CSVD patients. The current study aimed to investigate the potential differences of structural connectivity in CSVD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and CSVD patients with normal cognition. Twenty-two CSVD patients with MCI, 34 CSVD patients with normal cognition, and 35 controls, who were age, sex, and education matched underwent diffusion tensor imaging and high resolution T1-weighted imaging. Clinical characteristics, lacunar infarct volume, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and global atrophy were quantitatively evaluated. Maps of fiber connectivity density (FiCD) were constructed and compared across groups in vertex levels. Pearson correlation was used to estimate the imaging–clinical relationships with control of general characteristics. CSVD patients with MCI had higher lesion load of WMH and lacunar infarcts, and correspondingly lower global FiCD value than CSVD patients with normal cognition (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Lacunar infarct (r = −0.318, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and WMH (r = −0.400, P &amp;lt; 0.01), but not global atrophy, age, or sex, were significantly correlated with the global FiCD value. CSVD patients with normal cognition showed decreased FiCD value mainly in the prefrontal areas (P &amp;lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Compared with CSVD patients with normal cognition, CSVD patients with MCI showed significantly decreased FiCD value in enlarged frontal and parietal areas (P &amp;lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Inter-group comparisons showed regional enhanced impairment of connectivity density in CSVD patients with MCI in the left superior frontal gyrus, the left precuneus, and the orbital part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (P &amp;lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Regional FiCD value of frontal and parietal areas was associated with the cognitive function (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In conclusion, cognitively normal CSVD patients already have disruptions of structural connectivity. The extent and intensity of connectivity disruptions in frontal and parietal areas may underlie the mechanism of cognitive impairment in CSVD. Fiber connectivity density measurements may be helpful for quantitative description of structural cortical connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent works have shown that the resting-state brain functional connectivity hypernetwork, where multiple nodes can be connected, are an effective technique for brain disease diagnosis and classification research. The lasso method was used to construct hypernetworks by solving sparse linear regression models in previous research. But, constructing a hypernetwork based on the lasso method simply selects a single variable, in that it lacks the ability to interpret the grouping effect. Considering the group structure problem, the previous study proposed to create a hypernetwork based on the elastic net and the group lasso methods, and the results showed that the former method had the best classification performance. However, the highly correlated variables selected by the elastic net method were not necessarily in the active set in the group. Therefore, we extended our research to address this issue. Herein, we propose a new method that introduces the sparse group lasso method to improve the construction of the hypernetwork by solving the group structure problem of the brain regions. We used the traditional lasso, group lasso method, and sparse group lasso method to construct a hypernetwork in patients with depression and normal subjects. Meanwhile, other clustering coefficients (clustering coefficients based on pairs of nodes) were also introduced to extract features with traditional clustering coefficients. Two types of features with significant differences obtained after feature selection were subjected to multi-kernel learning for feature fusion and classification using each method, respectively. The network topology results revealed differences among the three networks, where hypernetwork using the lasso method was the strictest; the group lasso, most lenient; and the sgLasso method, moderate. The network topology of the sparse group lasso method was similar to that of the group lasso method but different from the lasso method. The classification results show that the sparse group lasso method achieves the best classification accuracy by using multi-kernel learning, which indicates that better classification performance can be achieved when the group structure exists and is properly extended.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sleep and wakefulness are promoted not by a single neural pathway but via wake or sleep-promoting nodes distributed across layers of the brain. We equate each layer with a brain region in proposing a layered subsumption model for arousal based on a computational architecture. Beyond the brainstem the layers include the diencephalon (hypothalamus, thalamus), basal ganglia, and cortex. In light of existing empirical evidence, we propose that each layer have sleep and wake computations driven by similar high-level architecture and processing units. Specifically, an interconnected wake-promoting system is suggested as driving arousal in each brain layer with the processing converging to produce the features of wakefulness. In contrast, sleep-promoting GABAergic neurons largely project to and inhibit wake-promoting neurons. We propose a general pattern of caudal wake-promoting and sleep-promoting neurons having a strong effect on overall behavior. However, while rostral brain layers have less influence on sleep and wake, through descending projections, they can subsume the activity of caudal brain layers to promote arousal. The two models presented in this work will suggest computations for the layering and hierarchy. Through dynamic system theory several hypotheses are introduced for the interaction of controllers and systems that correspond to the different populations of neurons at each layer. The models will be drawn-upon to discuss future experiments to elucidate the structure of the hierarchy that exists among the sleep-arousal architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In contrast to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced preconditioning, which has repeatedly been examined in the past, the effects of post-ischemic LPS-induced sepsis, although clinically considerably more important, have not systemically been studied. We exposed mice to transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and examined the effects of intraperitoneal LPS (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) which was administered 24 h post-ischemia. Post-ischemic glial reactivity, neuronal survival and neurological outcome were differently modulated by the higher and the lower LPS dose. Although both doses promoted neuronal survival after 72 h, the underlying mechanisms were not similar. Mice receiving 1 mg/kg LPS exhibited transient hypothermia at 1 and 3 hours post sepsis (hps), followed by reduced focal neurological deficits at 24, 48 and 72 hps. The lower dose (0.1 mg/kg) did not induce hypothermia, but reduced microglia/macrophage activation with the appearance of an anti-inflammatory CD206 positive cell phenotype in the brain parenchyma. Together, our results indicate a novel, dose-dependent modulation of microglial cells that is intricately involved in brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 It is now widely recognized that children exposed to adverse life events in the first years of life are at increased risk for a variety of neural, behavioral, and psychological sequelae. As we discuss in this paper, adverse events represent a violation of the expectable environment. If such violations occur during a critical period of brain development, the detrimental effects of early adversity are likely to be long lasting. Here we discuss the various ways adversity becomes neurobiologically embedded, and how the timing of such adversity plays an important role in determining outcomes.</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Consciousness while under general anesthesia is a dreadful condition. Various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based technologies have been developed, on the basis of empirical evidence, in order to identify this condition. However, certain electrophysiological phenomena, which seem strongly related with depth of anesthesia in some drugs, appear less consistent with those of other anesthetic drugs. There is a gap between the complexity of the phenomenon of consciousness and its behavioral manifestations, on the one hand, and the empirical nature of the reported electrophysiological markers, which are associated with it, on the other hand. In fact, such a gap might prevent us from progressing toward unified electrophysiological markers of consciousness while under anesthesia, which are applicable to all anesthetic drugs. We believe that there is a need to bridge this conceptual gap. Therefore, in this work, we will try to present a theoretical framework for such bridging. First, we suggest focusing on neuropsychological processes, which seem to have a clear role in the behavioral manifestations of consciousness while under anesthesia but seem, nevertheless, better defined than consciousness itself—such as perception and attention. Then, we suggest analyzing the effects of anesthesia upon these neuropsychological processes, as they are manifested in the EEG signal. Specifically, we will focus on the effects of anesthesia on event-related potentials (ERPs), which seem more easily associable with neuropsychological modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission between neurons is the basic mechanism for information processing in cortical microcircuits. To date, paired recording from synaptically coupled neurons is the most widely used method which allows a detailed functional characterization of unitary synaptic transmission at the cellular and synaptic level in combination with a structural characterization of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons at the light and electron microscopic level. In this review, we will summarize the many applications of paired recordings to investigate synaptic function and structure. Paired recordings have been used to study the detailed electrophysiological and anatomical properties of synaptically coupled cell pairs within a synaptic microcircuit; this is critical in order to understand the connectivity rules and dynamic properties of synaptic transmission. Paired recordings can also be adopted for quantal analysis of an identified synaptic connection and to study the regulation of synaptic transmission by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, the monoamines, neuropeptides, and adenosine etc. Taken together, paired recordings from synaptically coupled neurons will remain a very useful approach for a detailed characterization of synaptic transmission not only in the rodent brain but also that of other species including humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Multiple TREX mRNA export complex subunits (e.g., THOC1, THOC2, THOC5, THOC6, THOC7) have now been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), neurodegeneration and cancer. We previously implicated missense and splicing-defective THOC2 variants in NDDs and a broad range of other clinical features. Here we report 10 individuals from nine families with rare missense THOC2 variants including the first case of a recurrent variant (p.Arg77Cys), and an additional individual with an intragenic THOC2 microdeletion (Del-Ex37-38). Ex vivo missense variant testing and patient-derived cell line data from current and published studies show 9 of the 14 missense THOC2 variants result in reduced protein stability. The splicing-defective and deletion variants result in a loss of small regions of the C-terminal THOC2 RNA binding domain (RBD). Interestingly, reduced stability of THOC2 variant proteins has a flow-on effect on the stability of the multi-protein TREX complex; specifically on the other NDD-associated THOC subunits. Our current, expanded cohort refines the core phenotype of THOC2 NDDs to language disorder and/or ID, with a variable severity, and disorders of growth. A subset of affected individuals’ has severe-profound ID, persistent hypotonia and respiratory abnormalities. Further investigations to elucidate the pathophysiological basis for this severe phenotype are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Laminin-α2-related congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene. These mutations result in the complete absence or truncated expression of the laminin-α2 chain. The α2-chain is a major component of the laminin-211 and laminin-221 isoforms, the predominant laminin isoforms in healthy adult skeletal muscle. Mutations in this chain result in progressive skeletal muscle degeneration as early as neonatally. Laminin-211/221 is a ligand for muscle cell receptors integrin-α7β1 and α-dystroglycan. LAMA2 mutations are correlated with integrin-α7β1 disruption in skeletal muscle. In this review, we will summarize laminin-211/221 interactions with integrin-α7β1 in LAMA2-CMD muscle. Additionally, we will summarize recent developments using upregulation of laminin-111 in the sarcolemma of laminin-α2-deficient muscle. We will discuss potential mechanisms of action by which laminin-111 is able to prevent myopathy. These published studies demonstrate that laminin-111 is a disease modifier of LAMA2-CMD through different methods of delivery. Together, these studies show the potential for laminin-111 therapy as a novel paradigm for the treatment of LAMA2-CMD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Maladaptive reactivity to sensory inputs is commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD). Little is known, however, about the underlying neural mechanisms. For some children, atypical sensory reactivity is the primary complaint, despite absence of another identifiable neurodevelopmental diagnosis. Studying Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) may well provide a window into the neuropathology of these symptoms. It has been proposed that a deficit in sensory integration underlies the SPD phenotype, but objective quantification of sensory integration is lacking. Here we used neural and behavioral measures of multisensory integration (MSI), which would be affected by impaired sensory integration and for which there are well accepted objective measures, to test whether failure to integrate across the senses is associated with atypical sensory reactivity in SPD. An autism group served to determine if observed differences were unique to SPD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We tested whether children aged 6–16 years with SPD (N = 14) integrate multisensory inputs differently from age-matched typically developing controls (TD: N = 54), or from children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD: N = 44). Participants performed a simple reaction-time task to the occurrence of auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli presented in random order, while high-density recordings of electrical brain activity were made.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Children with SPD showed large reductions in the extent to which they benefited from multisensory inputs compared to TDs. The ASD group showed similarly reduced response speeding to multisensory relative to unisensory inputs. Neural evidence for MSI was seen across all three groups, with the multisensory response differing from the sum of the unisensory responses. Post hoc tests suggested the possibility of enhanced MSI in SPD in timeframes consistent with cortical sensory registration (∼60 ms), followed by reduced MSI during a timeframe consistent with object formation (∼130 ms). The ASD group also showed reduced MSI in the later timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Children with SPD showed reduction in their ability to benefit from redundant audio-visual inputs, similar to children with ASD. Neurophysiological recordings, on the other hand, showed that major indices of MSI were largely intact, although post hoc testing pointed to periods of potential differential processing. While these exploratory electrophysiological observations point to potential sensory-perceptual differences in multisensory processing in SPD, it remains equally plausible at this stage that later attentional processing differences may yet prove responsible for the multisensory behavioral deficits uncovered here.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: To explore structural variations of the circle of Willis using three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA), and to compare this modality with digital subtraction angiography (DSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 819 consecutive patients suspected of having cerebral vascular diseases underwent 3D-TOF-MRA, followed by DSA within 2 weeks. We report accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 3D-TOF-MRA compared with DSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The sensitivity and specificity of combined analyses were 90–100 and 98–100%, respectively. The sensitivity and NPV of 3D-TOF-MRA images for A-, C-, D-, and H-types of circle of Willis anomalies were 100%. The specificity, accuracy and sensitivity were all 100% for detecting absence of the anterior communicating artery (ACOA). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were all 100% for detecting F-type. The sensitivity and PPV of volume rendered (VR) images for the B-, E-, and G-types were relatively low (85.0, 86.2, and 73.8%, respectively). Maximum intensity projection (MIP) was somewhat better (88.3, 89.2, and 81.8%, respectively). Combined analyses were better still (95.8, 96.1, and 99.0%, respectively). Specificity and NPVs were high (99.3–100%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: 3D-TOF-MRA compares well to DSA for evaluation of the structure of the circle of Willis. As 3D-TOF-MRA is a non-invasive modality, it may be preferred as a means to evaluate structural variations of the circle of Willis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of aggregates of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Deciphering the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead from the alteration of Tau biology to neuronal death depends on the identification of Tau cellular partners. Combining genetic and transcriptomic analyses in Drosophila, we identified 77 new modulators of human Tau-induced toxicity, bringing to 301 the number of Tau genetic interactors identified so far in flies. Network analysis showed that 229 of these genetic modulators constitute a connected network. The addition of 77 new genes strengthened the network structure, increased the intergenic connectivity and brought up key hubs with high connectivities, namely Src64B/FYN, Src42A/FRK, kuz/ADAM10, heph/PTBP1, scrib/SCRIB, and Cam/CALM3. Interestingly, we established for the first time a genetic link between Tau-induced toxicity and ADAM10, a recognized Alzheimer Disease protective factor. In addition, our data support the importance of the presynaptic compartment in mediating Tau toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This paper examines the problem of diffeomorphic image registration in the presence of differing image intensity profiles and sparsely sampled, missing, or damaged tissue. Our motivation comes from the problem of aligning 3D brain MRI with 100-micron isotropic resolution to histology sections at 1 × 1 × 1,000-micron resolution with multiple varying stains. We pose registration as a penalized Bayesian estimation, exploiting statistical models of image formation where the target images are modeled as sparse and noisy observations of the atlas. In this injective setting, there is no assumption of symmetry between atlas and target. Cross-modality image matching is achieved by jointly estimating polynomial transformations of the atlas intensity. Missing data is accommodated via a multiple atlas selection procedure where several atlas images may be of homogeneous intensity and correspond to “background” or “artifact.” The two concepts are combined within an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, where atlas selection posteriors and deformation parameters are updated iteratively and polynomial coefficients are computed in closed form. We validate our method with simulated images, examples from neuropathology, and a standard benchmarking dataset. Finally, we apply it to reconstructing digital pathology and MRI in standard atlas coordinates. By using a standard convolutional neural network to detect tau tangles in histology slices, this registration method enabled us to quantify the 3D density distribution of tauopathy throughout the medial temporal lobe of an Alzheimer's disease postmortem specimen.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Large-scale research integration is contingent on seamless access to data in standardized formats. Standards enable researchers to understand external experiment structures, pool results, and apply homogeneous preprocessing and analysis workflows. Particularly, they facilitate these features without the need for numerous potentially confounding compatibility add-ons. In small animal magnetic resonance imaging, an overwhelming proportion of data is acquired via the ParaVision software of the Bruker Corporation. The original data structure is predominantly transparent, but fundamentally incompatible with modern pipelines. Additionally, it sources metadata from free-field operator input, which diverges strongly between laboratories and researchers. In this article we present an open-source workflow which automatically converts and reposits data from the ParaVision structure into the widely supported and openly documented Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). Complementing this workflow we also present operator guidelines for appropriate ParaVision data input, and a programmatic walk-through detailing how preexisting scans with uninterpretable metadata records can easily be made compliant after the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;IRSp53 (also known as BAIAP2) is an abundant excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). IRSp53 is expressed in different cell types across different brain regions, although it remains unclear how IRSp53 deletion in different cell types affects brain functions and behaviors in mice. Here, we deleted IRSp53 in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mice and compared resulting phenotypes in males and females. IRSp53 deletion in excitatory neurons driven by Emx1 leads to strong social deficits and hyperactivity without affecting anxiety-like behavior, whereas IRSp53 deletion in inhibitory neurons driven by Viaat has minimal impacts on these behaviors in male mice. In female mice, excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion induces hyperactivity but moderate social deficits. Excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion in male mice induces an increased ratio of evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (E/I ratio) in layer V pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas the same mutation does not alter the E/I ratio in female neurons. These results suggest that IRSp53 deletion in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and in male and female mice has distinct impacts on behaviors and synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Glial cells are multifunctional, non-neuronal components of the central nervous system with diverse phenotypes that have gained much attention for their close involvement in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Glial phenotypes are primarily characterized by their structural and functional changes in response to various stimuli, which can be either neuroprotective or neurotoxic. The reliance of neurons on glial cells is essential to fulfill the energy demands of the brain for its proper functioning. Moreover, the glial cells perform distinct functions to regulate their own metabolic activities, as well as work in close conjunction with neurons through various secreted signaling or guidance molecules, thereby constituting a complex network of neuron-glial interactions in health and disease. The emerging evidence suggests that, in disease conditions, the metabolic alterations in the glial cells can induce structural and functional changes together with neuronal dysfunction indicating the importance of neuron–glia interactions in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. This review covers the recent developments that implicate the regulation of glial phenotypic changes and its consequences on neuron–glia interactions in neurological disorders. Finally, we discuss the possibilities and challenges of targeting glial metabolism as a strategy to treat neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a specific form of hemorrhagic stroke that frequently causes intracranial hypertension. The choroid plexus (CP) of the brain ventricles is responsible for producing cerebrospinal fluid and forms the blood – cerebrospinal fluid barrier. The aim of the current study was to determine whether SAH induces an immune cell reaction in the CP and whether the resulting increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) itself can lead to cellular changes in the CP. SAH was induced by injecting non-heparinized autologous blood to the cisterna magna. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) instead of blood was used to assess influence of increased ICP alone. SAH and ACSF animals were left to survive for 1, 3, and 7 days. SAH induced significantly increased numbers of M1 (ED1+, CCR7+) and M2 (ED2+, CD206+) macrophages as well as MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells (APC) compared to naïve and ACSF animals. Increased numbers of ED1+ macrophages and APC were found in the CP only 3 and 7 days after ACSF injection, while ED2+ macrophage number did not increase. CD3+ T cells were not found in any of the animals. Following SAH, proliferation activity in the CP gradually increased over time while ACSF application induced higher cellular proliferation only 1 and 3 days after injection. Our results show that SAH induces an immune reaction in the CP resulting in an increase in the number of several macrophage types in the epiplexus position. Moreover, we also found that increased ICP due to ACSF application induced both an immune reaction and increased proliferation of epiplexus cells in the CP. These findings indicate that increased ICP, and not just blood, contributes to cellular changes in the CP following SAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence is a homeostatic biological process characterized by a permanent state of cell cycle arrest that can contribute to the decline of the regenerative potential and function of tissues. The increased presence of senescent cells in different neurodegenerative diseases suggests the contribution of senescence in the pathophysiology of these disorders. Although several factors can induce senescence, DNA damage, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and altered proteostasis have been shown to play a role in its onset. Oxidative stress contributes to accelerated aging and cognitive dysfunction stages affecting neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, connectivity, and survival. During later life stages, it is implicated in the progression of cognitive decline, synapse loss, and neuronal degeneration. Also, neuroinflammation exacerbates oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death through the harmful effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on cell proliferation and maturation. Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can induce DNA damage and alterations in DNA repair that, in turn, can exacerbate them. Another important feature associated with senescence is altered proteostasis. Because of the disruption in the function and balance of the proteome, senescence can modify the proper synthesis, folding, quality control, and degradation rate of proteins producing, in some diseases, misfolded proteins or aggregation of abnormal proteins. There is an extensive body of literature that associates cellular senescence with several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Down syndrome (DS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This review summarizes the evidence of the shared neuropathological events in these neurodegenerative diseases and the implication of cellular senescence in their onset or aggravation. Understanding the role that cellular senescence plays in them could help to develop new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human brain organoids (mini-brains) consist of self-organized three-dimensional (3D) neural tissue which can be derived from reprogrammed adult cells and maintained for months in culture. These 3D structures manifest substantial potential for the modeling of neurodegenerative diseases and pave the way for personalized medicine. However, as these 3D brain models can express the whole human genetic complexity, it is critical to have access to isogenic mini-brains that only differ in specific and controlled genetic variables. Genetic engineering based on retroviral vectors is incompatible with the long-term modeling needed here and implies a risk of random integration while methods using CRISPR-Cas9 are still too complex to adapt to stem cells. We demonstrate in this study that our strategy which relies on an episomal plasmid vector derived from the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) offers a simple and robust approach, avoiding the remaining caveats of mini-brain models. For this proof-of-concept, we used a normal tau protein with a fluorescent tag and a mutant genetic form (P301S) leading to Fronto-Temporal Dementia. Isogenic cell lines were obtained which were stable for more than 30 passages expressing either form. We show that the presence of the plasmid in the cells does not interfere with the mini-brain differentiation protocol and obtain the development of a pathologically relevant phenotype in cerebral organoids, with pathological hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. Such a simple and versatile genetic strategy opens up the full potential of human organoids to contribute to disease modeling, personalized medicine and testing of therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Our study was designed to investigate whether the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) pathway participates in the development of emotional deficits from ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The expression of proinflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IDO levels in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot, and the neurotransmitters were tested by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Emotional deficits of mice were evaluated by behavioral tests.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Expression levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were increased in mice after 4 weeks of alcohol exposure. As for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression, only the subtype IDO1 was found to increase at both mRNA level and protein level in all the tested brain regions of ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice. In behavioral tests, mice exposed to alcohol showed gradually declined memory function accompanied by anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. Meanwhile, increased expression of KYN, decreased expression of 5-HT, and abnormal expression of 3-HK and KA were found in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala of ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice. Interestingly, the IDO1 inhibitor, 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (1-MT), reversed all above alterations induced by ethanol in mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggested that the TRP/KYN pathway, medicated by IDO1, in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala, plays an important role in the development of emotional deficits caused by ethanol addiction and withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Zebrafish do not possess the typical astrocytes that are found in mammalian systems. In some brain areas, this teleost has radial glia that appears to perform astrocyte-like functions, but these cells have not been described in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. Mammalian astrocytes facilitate neuroplasticity and undergo astrogliosis after insult. The role of these cells in the zebrafish olfactory system after the damage has been poorly explored. This is important to examine because zebrafish have a high degree of neuroplasticity and the olfactory bulb is a brain area renowned for plasticity. The goal of this study was to explore the potential role of zebrafish astrocytes in the olfactory bulb damage response, with a goal to exploit the high level of regeneration in this system. We found that anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) labels numerous processes in the zebrafish olfactory bulb that are concentrated in the nerve and glomerular layers (GL) and do not show radial glial-like morphology. We propose to term this astroglia, since their location and response to damage suggests that they are similar in function to the mammalian astrocyte. To induce repetitive peripheral damage to the olfactory organ, a wax plug was inserted into the nasal cavity of adult zebrafish every 12 h for up to 7 days; this crushes the olfactory organ and leads to degradation of olfactory sensory neuron axons that project to the olfactory bulb. After 1 day, we found a significant increase in astroglial labeling in the affected bulb when compared to the internal control bulb and astroglial branches appeared to increase in number and size. By the third day of plug insertions there was no significant difference in astroglial labeling between the affected bulb and the internal control bulb. These data lead us to believe that astrogliosis does occur in the presence of peripheral damage, but this process attenuates within 1 week and no glial scar is evident upon recovery from the damage. Further exploration of astrocytes in zebrafish, in particular this apparent attenuation of astrogliosis, has the potential to elucidate key differences in glial function between teleosts and mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cat brain is a useful model for neuroscientific research and with the increasing use of advanced neuroimaging techniques there is a need for an open-source stereotaxic white matter brain atlas to accompany the cortical gray matter atlas, currently available. A stereotaxic white matter atlas would facilitate anatomic registration and segmentation of the white matter to aid in lesion localization or standardized regional analysis of specific regions of the white matter. In this article, we document the creation of a stereotaxic feline white matter atlas from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data obtained from a population of eight mesaticephalic felines. Deterministic tractography reconstructions were performed to create tract priors for the major white matter projections of Corpus callosum (CC), fornix, cingulum, uncinate, Corona Radiata (CR), Corticospinal tract (CST), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF), and the cerebellar tracts. T1-weighted, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) population maps were generated. The volume, mean tract length and mean FA, MD, AD and RD values for each tract prior were documented. A structural connectome was then created using previously published cortical priors and the connectivity metrics for all cortical regions documented. The provided white matter atlas, diffusivity maps, tract priors and connectome will be a valuable resource for anatomical, pathological and translational neuroimaging research in the feline model. Multi-atlas population maps and segmentation priors are available at Cornell’s digital repository: https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/58775.2.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Age-related hearing loss, one of the most frequently diagnosed disabilities in industrialized countries, may result from declining levels of GABA in the aging inferior colliculus (IC). However, the mechanisms of aging and subsequent disruptions of temporal processing in elderly hearing abilities are still being investigated. Perineuronal nets (PNs) are a specialized form of the extracellular matrix and have been linked to GABAergic neurotransmission and to the regulation of structural and synaptic plasticity. We sought to determine whether the density of PNs in the IC changes with age. We combined Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) staining with immunohistochemistry to glutamic acid decarboxylase in three age groups of Fischer Brown Norway (FBN) rats. The density of PNs on GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells in the three major subdivisions of the IC was quantified. Results first demonstrate that the density of PNs in the FBN IC increase with age. The greatest increases of PN density from young to old age occurred in the central IC (67% increase) and dorsal IC (117% increase). Second, in the young IC, PNs surround non-GABAergic and GABAergic cells with the majority of PNs surrounding the former. The increase of PNs with age in the IC occurred on both non-GABAergic and GABAergic populations. The average density of PN-surrounded non-GABAergic cells increased from 84.9 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the young to 134.2 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the old. While the density of PN-surrounded GABAergic cells increased from 26 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the young to 40.6 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the old. The causality is unclear, but increases in PN density in old age may play a role in altered auditory processing in the elderly, or may lead to further changes in IC plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Vascular pulsations, contractions of vascular smooth muscle cells and breathing have been reported to foster movement and clearance of interstitial and cerebrospinal fluids from the brain. The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of these vital functions. We compared the spread of an injected hydrophilic tracer (Fluoro-Emerald, a 10 kDa fluorescein-coupled dextran amine) in the brains of live anesthetized and sacrificed rats at 30 and 90 min after injection. To determine the overall pattern of distribution of tracers, we created 3D-reconstructions of the horizontal transections of the whole brain. Immunofluorescence staining with laminin and collagen IV was performed to determine the pattern of distribution of tracer in relation to the cerebrovascular basement membranes. We found that diffusion was widely restricted to the periventricular region in sacrificed rats with no spread to the contralateral hemisphere, while the bulk flow occurred along the vasculature and reached the surface and the contralateral hemisphere as soon as 30 min after injection in live anesthetized animals. The tracer appeared to be localized along the vascular basement membranes and along fiber tracts as reported previously. Thus, our data indicate that vital functions are essential for the remote movement of extracellular fluids within the cerebral parenchyma.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: There is growing evidence supporting behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as extreme points of a disease spectrum. The aim of this study was to delineate the common and different patterns of gray matter atrophy associated with bvFTD and with ALS by pooling together the results of previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We retrieved VBM studies that investigated gray matter atrophy in bvFTD patients vs. controls and in ALS patients vs. controls. Stereotactic data were extracted from those studies and subsequently tested for convergence and differences using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). A behavioral analysis using the BrainMap database was performed to assess the functional roles of the regions affected by bvFTD and/or ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study demonstrated a convergence of gray matter atrophy in the frontolimbic structures that involve the bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Comparing the pattern of GM atrophy in bvFTD and ALS patients revealed greater atrophy in the frontomedial cortex, bilateral caudate, left anterior insula, and right thalamus in those with bvFTD and a higher degree of atrophy in the right motor cortex of those with ALS. Behavioral analysis revealed that the pattern of the affected regions contributed to the dysfunction of emotional and cognitive processing in bvFTD patients and the dysfunction of motor execution in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results revealed a shared neural basis between bvFTD and ALS subjects, as well as a specific and distinct neural signature that underpinned the clinical manifestations of those two diseases. Those findings outlined the role of the frontomedial-caudate circuit in the development of bvFTD-like deficits in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have great potentials in cell replacement therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), by promoting neurogenesis associated with hippocampal memory improvement. Ephrin receptors and angiogenic growth factor receptors have a marked impact on the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs. Although ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) was shown to directly interact with platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), the functional effects of this interaction on neurogenesis in cultured NPCs and adult hippocampus have not yet been studied. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EphA4 directly interacted with PDGFRβ in NPCs under ligand stimulation. Ephrin-A1 and PDGF-platelet-derived growth factor BB (BB) significantly increased proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NPCs, which was further augmented by combined treatment of Ephrin-A1 and PDGF-BB. We also found that ligand-dependent proliferation and neuronal differentiation were inhibited by the dominant-negative EphA4 mutant or a PDGFR inhibitor. Most importantly, injection of ephrin-A1 and/or PDGF-BB promoted hippocampal NPC proliferation in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, indicating that direct interaction of EphA4 with PDGFRβ plays a functional role on neurogenesis in vivo. Finally, studies in NPCs showed that the EphA4/PDGFRβ/FGFR1/FRS2α complex formed by ligand stimulation is involved in neurogenesis via ERK signaling. The present findings provided a novel insight into the functional role of direct interaction of EphA4 and PDGFRβ in neurogenesis, implicating its potential use for treating neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Dysfunctional dopamine (DA) signaling has been associated with a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders, prompting investigations into how midbrain DA neuron heterogeneity may underpin this variety of behavioral symptoms. Emerging literature indeed points to functional heterogeneity even within anatomically defined DA clusters. Recognizing the need for a systematic classification scheme, several groups have used single-cell profiling to catalog DA neurons based on their gene expression profiles.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Annals of Neurology TLR4 signaling in neurons enhances calcium‐permeable AMPAR currents and drives post‐traumatic epileptogenesis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/53bcdd2a-3cb5-4ce1-a7af-507b4bddbfc1/ana25698-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphic illustration of the effect of injury and early TLR4 antagonist treatment on early network excitability and the long‐term network state. The schematic neurons include TLR4 and AMPAR subunit expression profiles in the acute phase of sham or brain injury. The corresponding early effects on network excitability are depicted by schematic population response traces (inset on upper left). Note the increase in excitability of the uninjured neuron after TLR4 antagonism without changes in AMPAR expression. Note also the increase in TLR4, calcium permeable AMPARs and population excitability after injury and its reduction by TLR4 antagonist treatment. Ampakine enhancement of excitability during TLR4 antagonism is illustrated. The early phase responses and manipulations (including injury, treatments, and molecular responses) are superimposed on a two‐tone color‐coded network state topology where green indicates low‐normal network excitability, ensuring network stability and low risk for epilepsy (Inset on upper right). Note the correspondence between early excitability state (population response profile) and long‐term seizure susceptibility and the effects of pharmacological manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury is a major risk factor for acquired epilepsies and understanding the mechanisms underlying the early pathophysiology could yield viable therapeutic targets. Growing evidence indicates a role for inflammatory signaling in modifying neuronal excitability and promoting epileptogenesis. Here we examined the effect of innate immune receptor, toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) on excitability of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and epileptogenesis after brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slice and in vivo electrophysiology and western blots were conducted in rats subject to fluid percussion brain injury or sham injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies identify that TLR4 signaling in neurons, augments dentate granule cell calcium‐permeable AMPA receptor (CP‐AMPAR) currents after brain injury. Blocking TLR4 signaling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; shortly after brain injury reduced dentate network excitability and seizure susceptibility. When blocking of TLR4 signaling after injury was delayed, however, this treatment failed to reduce post‐injury seizure susceptibility. Further, TLR4 signal blocking was less efficacious in limiting seizure susceptibility when AMPAR currents, downstream targets of TLR4 signaling, were transiently enhanced. Paradoxically, blocking TLR4 signaling augmented both network excitability and seizure susceptibility in uninjured controls. Despite the differential effect on seizure susceptibility, TLR4 antagonism suppressed cellular inflammatory responses after injury without impacting sham controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrate that independently of glia, the immune receptor TLR4 directly regulates post‐traumatic neuronal excitability. Moreover, the TLR4‐dependent early increase in dentate excitability is causally associated with epileptogenesis. Identification and selective targeting of the mechanisms underlying the aberrant TLR4‐mediated increase in CP‐AMPAR signaling after injury may prevent epileptogenesis after brain trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although migraine is defined by the headache and headache‐associated symptoms, the true beginning of a migraine attack lies in the premonitory phase. To understand the generation of attacks, one needs to investigate the phase before headache starts. The premonitory phase of migraine is characterized by a well‐described complex of symptoms. Its duration, however, is not clearly defined, and there are no biomarkers to help define when this phase starts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate the duration of the premonitory phase in spontaneous human migraine attacks. Because migraine attacks are hardly predictable and thereby the premonitory phase is difficult to catch, we scanned 9 patients daily over a minimum period of 30 days using a well‐established paradigm for functional MRI of trigeminal nociception.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven patients were included in the analysis, thus providing cumulative data of 27 spontaneous human migraine attacks including scans before, during, and after migraine pain as well as interictal scans. As a response to painful trigeminal stimulation, activation of the hypothalamus was present within the last 48 hours before headache onset but not earlier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using hypothalamic activation as a potential marker for the premonitory phase of migraine in this unique dataset, our data corroborated a duration of 48 hours for the premonitory phase of migraine. We suggest applying this time criterion in future studies when focusing on this phase of the migraine cycle. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational epidemiological studies have reported a relationship between coffee intake and risk of stroke. However, evidence for this association is inconsistent, and it remains uncertain whether the association is causal or due to confounding or reverse causality. To clarify this relationship, we adopted a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate the effects of coffee consumption on the risk of stroke and its subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meta‐analysis of genome‐wide association studies (GWASs) including 91,462 coffee consumers was used to identify instruments for coffee consumption. Summary‐level data for stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke (IS), and IS subtypes were obtained from GWAS meta‐analyses conducted by the MEGASTROKE consortium. MR analyses were performed using the inverse‐variance‐weighted, weighted‐median, MR‐PRESSO (Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier) test and MR‐Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using alternative instruments to test the robustness of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted coffee consumption (high vs infrequent/no) was not associated with risk of stroke. Similarly, among coffee consumers, MR analysis did not indicate causal associations between coffee consumption (cups/day) and risk of stroke. However, in the subgroup analysis, we found weak suggestive evidence for a potential protective effect of coffee consumption on risk of small vessel (SV)‐IS, although the association did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that coffee consumption is not causally associated with risk of stroke or its subtypes. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible association between coffee intake and risk of SV‐IS, as well as its potential underlying mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual hit hypothesis about the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) suggests that the brainstem is a convergent area for the propagation of pathological α‐synuclein from the periphery to the brain. Although brainstem structures are likely to be affected early in the course of the disease, detailed information regarding specific brainstem regions is lacking. The aim of our study was to investigate the function of the superior colliculus, a sensorimotor brainstem structure, in de novo PD patients compared to controls using brain functional magnetic imaging and visual stimulation paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De novo PD patients and controls were recruited. PD subjects were imaged before and after starting PD medications. A recently developed functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol was used to stimulate and visualize the superior colliculus and 2 other visual structures: the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 22 PD patients, there was no modulation of the superior colliculus responses to the luminance contrasts compared to controls. This implies a hypersensitivity to low luminance contrast and abnormal rapid blood oxygenation level–dependent signal saturation to high luminance contrasts. The lateral geniculate nucleus was only modulated by 3 to 9% luminance contrasts compared to controls. No major differences were found in the primary visual cortex between both groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that pathological superior colliculus visual responses in de novo PD patients are present early in the course of the disease. Changes in imaging the superior colliculus could play an important role as a preclinical biomarker of the disease. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) is a molecule involved in several cell processes including plasticity related to learning and memory. Activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors results in translocation of CaMKII to synapses. However, there are at least two distinct mechanisms by which glutamate-dependent CaMKII translocation occurs: one well-studied process resulting from whole-cell glutamate stimulation and one resulting from brief, local glutamate application. Unlike the relatively fast CaMKII translocation seen following whole-cell glutamate delivery (seconds), local application results in CaMKII translocation that occurs gradually within 6–10 min. This locally-induced translocation of CaMKII requires L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel co-activation but does not rely on GluN2B receptor subunit expression, unlike translocation following whole-cell application of glutamate. The current study examined if nucleotide binding is necessary for locally-induced CaMKII translocation, similar to CaMKII translocation resulting from whole-cell glutamate application. Three different mechanisms of inhibition were employed: staurosporine (ATP inhibitor), CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor and expression of the K42M mutation. Locally-induced CaMKII translocation was moderately suppressed in the presence of either the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine (100 nm) or the CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor. However, expression of the catalytically dead K42M mutation that prevents ATP-binding to CaMKII, significantly inhibited locally-induced translocation. Thus, CaMKII translocation following brief, local glutamate application requires nucleotide binding, providing support for future research into the molecular mechanisms of this distinct form of CaMKII translocation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The brainstem has traditionally been considered an area of the brain with autonomous control of mostly homeostatic functions such as heart rate, respiration, and the sleep and wakefulness state, which would preclude the necessity to exhibit the high degree of synaptic or cellular mechanisms of plasticity typical of regions of the brain responsible for flexible, executive control, such as the medial prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus. The perception that the brainstem does not share the same degree of flexibility to alter synaptic strength and/or wiring within local circuits makes intuitive sense, as it is not easy to understand how “soft wiring” would be an advantage when considering the importance of faithful and consistent performance of the homeostatic, autonomic functions that are controlled by the brainstem. However, many of the molecular and cellular requirements which underlie strengthening of synapses seen in brain regions involved in higher-level processing are present in brainstem nuclei, and recent research suggest that the view of the brainstem as “hard wired,” with rigid and static connectivity and with unchanging synaptic strength, is outdated. In fact, information from studies within the last decades, including work conducted in our group, leads us to propose that the brainstem can dynamically alter synaptic proteins, and change synaptic connections in response to prenatal or postnatal stimuli, and this would likely alter functionality and output. This article reviews recent research that has provided information resulting in our revision of the view of the brainstem as static and non-changing by using as example recent information gleaned from a brainstem pontine nucleus, the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). The LDT has demonstrated mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, and plasticity has been exhibited in the postnatal LDT following exposure to drugs of abuse. Further, exposure of the brain during gestation to drugs of abuse results in alterations in development of signaling pathways in the LDT. As the LDT provides a high degree of innervation of mesoaccumbal and mesocortical circuits involved in salience, as well as thalamocortical circuits involved in control of arousal and orientation, changes in synaptic strength would be expected to alter output, which would significantly impact behavioral state, motivated behavior and directed attention. Further, alterations in developmental trajectory within the LDT following prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse would be expected to impact on later life expression of motivation and arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The P/Q-type Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channel regulates neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and many central synapses. CACNA1A encodes the pore-containing α&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; subunit of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels. In humans, de novo CACNA1A mutations result in a wide spectrum of neurological, neuromuscular, and movement disorders, such as familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), as well as a more recently discovered class of more severe disorders, which are characterized by ataxia, hypotonia, cerebellar atrophy, and cognitive/developmental delay. Heterologous expression of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels has allowed for an understanding of the consequences of CACNA1A missense mutations on channel function. In contrast, a mechanistic understanding of how specific CACNA1A mutations lead in vivo to the resultant phenotypes is lacking. In this review, we present the zebrafish as a model to both study in vivo mechanisms of CACNA1A mutations that result in synaptic and behavioral defects and to screen for effective drug therapies to combat these and other Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channelopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The objective of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is to evaluate a set of lab-based behavioral video tracking (VT), electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking (ET) measures for use in clinical trials with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Within the larger organizational structure of the ABC-CT, the Data Acquisition and Analytic Core (DAAC) oversees the standardization of VT, EEG, and ET data acquisition, data processing, and data analysis. This includes designing and documenting data acquisition and analytic protocols and manuals; facilitating site training in acquisition; data acquisition quality control (QC); derivation and validation of dependent variables (DVs); and analytic deliverables including preparation of data for submission to the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR). To oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for data acquisition, processing, and analytics, we developed standard operating procedures that reflect the logistical needs of multi-site research, and the need for well-articulated, transparent processes that can be implemented in future clinical trials. This report details the methodology of the ABC-CT related to acquisition and QC in our Feasibility and Main Study phases. Based on our acquisition metrics from a preplanned interim analysis, we report high levels of acquisition success utilizing VT, EEG, and ET experiments in a relatively large sample of children with ASD and typical development (TD), with data acquired across multiple sites and use of a manualized training and acquisition protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Non-invasive imaging methods have become essential tools for understanding the central nervous system (CNS) in health and disease. In particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques provide information about the anatomy, microstructure, and function of the brain and spinal cord in vivo non-invasively. However, MRI is limited by its spatial resolution and signal specificity. In order to mitigate these shortcomings, it is crucial to validate MRI with an array of ancillary ex vivo imaging techniques. These techniques include histological methods, such as light and electron microscopy (EM), which can provide specific information on the tissue structure in healthy and diseased brain and spinal cord, at cellular and subcellular level. However, these conventional histological techniques are intrinsically two-dimensional (2D) and, as a result of sectioning, lack volumetric information of the tissue. This limitation can be overcome with genuine three-dimensional (3D) imaging approaches of the tissue. 3D highly resolved information of the CNS achievable by means of other imaging techniques can complement and improve the interpretation of MRI measurements. In this article, we provide an overview of different 3D imaging techniques that can be used to validate MRI. As an example, we introduce an approach of how to combine diffusion MRI and synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography (SXRPCT) data. Our approach paves the way for a new multiscale assessment of the CNS allowing to validate and to improve our understanding of in vivo imaging (such as MRI).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural network (CNN) models obtain state of the art performance on image classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Limitations in computer hardware, most notably memory size in deep learning accelerator cards, prevent relatively large images, such as those from medical and satellite imaging, from being processed as a whole in their original resolution. A fully convolutional topology, such as U-Net, is typically trained on down-sampled images and inferred on images of their original size and resolution, by simply dividing the larger image into smaller (typically overlapping) tiles, making predictions on these tiles, and stitching them back together as the prediction for the whole image. In this study, we show that this tiling technique combined with translationally-invariant nature of CNNs causes small, but relevant differences during inference that can be detrimental in the performance of the model. Here we quantify these variations in both medical (i.e., BraTS) and non-medical (i.e., satellite) images and show that training a 2D U-Net model on the whole image substantially improves the overall model performance. Finally, we compare 2D and 3D semantic segmentation models to show that providing CNN models with a wider context of the image in all three dimensions leads to more accurate and consistent predictions. Our results suggest that tiling the input to CNN models—while perhaps necessary to overcome the memory limitations in computer hardware—may lead to undesirable and unpredictable errors in the model's output that can only be adequately mitigated by increasing the input of the model to the largest possible tile size.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Available evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a non-genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD and DM have shared similarities in pathogenetic mechanisms, including age, environmental factors, inflammatory reaction, and protein aggregation, etc. α-Synuclein is the primary protein component in the protein inclusions in PD, while islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregates to form amyloid structures in β cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Pancreatic and cerebral functions, pancreas and brain α-synuclein deposition as well as striatal alterations, were assessed in spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys and age-matched normal monkeys. We demonstrated increased accumulation, aggregation, and phosphorylation of α-synuclein, and IAPP in the pancreatic islets of spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys, compared to the age-matched normal subjects. Double immunofluorescence analyses showed complete overlap between α-synuclein and IAPP in the pancreatic islets. In addition, in T2DM monkeys’ brain, we observed concomitantly increased accumulation and phosphorylation of α-synuclein in the cortex, pre-commissural putamen and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which interestingly showed high correlation with levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglyceride (TG), and high density lipoprotein (HDL). Our data indicates the close association between IAPP and α-synuclein and the potential link between T2DM and PD, which implies that T2DM may facilitate PD disease onset and progress by interfering with the pathological protein aggregation both in the pancreatic islets and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain valuable information about the different physiological states of the brain, with a variety of linear and nonlinear features that can be used to investigate brain activity. Monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) with EEG is an ongoing challenge in anesthesia research. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a sparse denoising autoencoder (SDAE) to combine the hybrid features of EEG to monitor the DoA. The EEG signals were preprocessed using filtering, etc., and then more than ten features including sample entropy, permutation entropy, spectra, and alpha-ratio were extracted from the EEG signal. We then integrated the optional features such as permutation entropy and alpha-ratio to extract the essential structure and learn the most efficient temporal model for monitoring the DoA. Compared with using a single feature, the proposed model could accurately estimate the depth of anesthesia with higher prediction probability (P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;). Experimental results evaluated on the datasets demonstrated that our proposed method provided better performance than the methods using permutation entropy, alpha-ratio, LSTM, and other traditional indices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Classic motion abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as tremor, bradykinesia, or rigidity, are well-covered by standard clinical assessments such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). However, PD includes motor abnormalities beyond the symptoms and signs as measured by UPDRS, such as the lack of anticipatory adjustments or compromised movement smoothness, which are difficult to assess clinically. Moreover, PD may entail motor abnormalities not yet known. All these abnormalities are quantifiable via motion capture and may serve as biomarkers to diagnose and monitor PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: In this pilot study, we attempted to identify motion features revealing maximum contrast between healthy subjects and PD patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN) switched off and on as the first step to develop biomarkers for detecting and monitoring PD patients' motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed 3D gait analysis in 7 out of 26 PD patients with DBS switched off and on, and in 25 healthy control subjects. We computed feature values for each stride, related to 22 body segments, four time derivatives, left–right mean vs. difference, and mean vs. variance across stride time. We then ranked the feature values according to their distinguishing power between PD patients and healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The foot and lower leg segments proved better in classifying motor anomalies than any other segment. Higher degrees of time derivatives were superior to lower degrees (jerk &amp;gt; acceleration &amp;gt; velocity &amp;gt; displacement). The averaged movements across left and right demonstrated greater distinguishing power than left–right asymmetries. The variability of motion was superior to motion's absolute values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This small pilot study identified the variability of a smoothness measure, i.e., jerk of the foot, as the optimal signal to separate healthy subjects' from PD patients' gait. This biomarker is invisible to clinicians' naked eye and is therefore not included in current motor assessments such as the UPDRS. We therefore recommend that more extensive investigations be conducted to identify the most powerful biomarkers to characterize motor abnormalities in PD. Future studies may challenge the composition of traditional assessments such as the UPDRS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The detailed mechanisms underlying oxidative stress that leads to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in retinal vascular conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity etc., remain largely unexplored mainly due to a lack of suitable disease models that can simulate the inherent neuron–glia interactions in human retina. Specifically, establishment of a mixed retinal culture (MRC) containing both neuron and glial cell types remains a challenge due to different conditions required for their optimal growth and differentiation. Here, we establish a novel primary MRC model system containing neurons, astrocytes, Müller glia, and microglia from human donor retina that can be used to study the neuromodulatory effects of glial cells under the stress. The cell characterization based on immunostaining with individual cell type–specific markers and their presence in close vicinity to each other further underscores their utility for studying their cross talk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of an in vitro model obtained from human donor retina containing four major cell types. Next, we induce hypoxic stress to MRC to investigate if hypoxia activated neuroglia modulates altered gene expression for inflammatory, apoptotic, and angiogenic markers and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients by live cell imaging. Further, we performed k-means clustering of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to identify the modification of clustering pattern in stressed condition. Finally, we provide the evidence that the altered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient correlates to differential expression of genes shown to be involved in neuroinflammation, angiogenesis, and neurodegeneration under the hypoxic conditions as seen earlier in human cell lines and animal models of diabetic retinopathy. The major features of the hypoxic conditions in the proposed human MRC model included: increase in microglia activity, chemokine and cytokine expression, and percentage of cells having higher amplitude and frequency of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Thus, the proposed experimental system can potentially serve as an ideal in vitro model for studying the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative changes in the retina and identifying newer drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A non-invasive, brain-to-brain interface (BBI) requires precision neuromodulation and high temporal resolution as well as portability to increase accessibility. A BBI is a combination of the brain–computer interface (BCI) and the computer–brain interface (CBI). The optimization of BCI parameters has been extensively researched, but CBI has not. Parameters taken from the BCI and CBI literature were used to simulate a two-class medical monitoring BBI system under a wide range of conditions. BBI function was assessed using the information transfer rate (ITR), measured in bits per trial and bits per minute. The BBI ITR was a function of classifier accuracy, window update rate, system latency, stimulation failure rate (SFR), and timeout threshold. The BCI parameters, including window length, update rate, and classifier accuracy, were kept constant to investigate the effects of varying the CBI parameters, including system latency, SFR, and timeout threshold. Based on passively monitoring BCI parameters, a base ITR of 1 bit/trial was used. The optimal latency was found to be 100 ms or less, with a threshold no more than twice its value. With the optimal latency and timeout parameters, the system was able to maintain near-maximum efficiency, even with a 25% SFR. When the CBI and BCI parameters are compared, the CBI’s system latency and timeout threshold should be reflected in the BCI’s update rate. This would maximize the number of trials, even at a high SFR. These findings suggested that a higher number of trials per minute optimizes the ITR of a non-invasive BBI. The delays innate to each BCI protocol and CBI stimulation method must also be accounted for. The high latencies in each are the primary constraints of non-invasive BBI for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;At present, the diagnosis of brain disease is mainly based on the self-reported symptoms and clinical signs of the patient, which can easily lead to psychiatrists' bias. The purpose of this study is to develop a brain network clustering model to accurately identify brain diseases based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the absence of clinical information. We use cosine similarity and sub-network kernels to measure attribute similarity and structure similarity, respectively. By integrating the structure similarity and attribute similarity into one matrix, spectral clustering is used to achieve brain network clustering. Finally, we evaluate this method on three diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Bipolar disorder patients, and Schizophrenia. The performance of methods is evaluated by measuring clustering consistency. Clustering consistency is similar to clustering accuracy, which is used to evaluate the consistency between the clustering labels and clinical diagnostic labels of the subjects. The experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve clustering performance, with a consistency of 60.6% for Alzheimer's disease, with a consistency of 100% for Schizophrenia, with a consistency of 100% for Bipolar disorder patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Curiosity has shown great performance in brain learning, which helps biological brains grasp new knowledge efficiently and actively. Inspired by this leaning mechanism, we propose a curiosity-based SNN (CBSNN) model, which contains four main learning processes. Firstly, the network is trained with biologically plausible plasticity principles to get the novelty estimations of all samples in only one epoch; secondly, the CBSNN begins to repeatedly learn the samples whose novelty estimations exceed the novelty threshold and dynamically update the novelty estimations of samples according to the learning results in five epochs; thirdly, in order to avoid the overfitting of the novel samples and forgetting of the learned samples, CBSNN retrains all samples in one epoch; finally, step two and step three are periodically taken until network convergence. Compared with the state-of-the-art Voltage-driven Plasticity-centric SNN (VPSNN) under standard architecture, our model achieves a higher accuracy of 98.55% with only 54.95% of its computation cost on the MNIST hand-written digit recognition dataset. Similar conclusion can also be found out in other datasets, i.e., Iris, NETtalk, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, respectively. More experiments and analysis further prove that such curiosity-based learning theory is helpful in improving the efficiency of SNNs. As far as we know, this is the first practical combination of the curiosity mechanism and SNN, and these improvements will make the realistic application of SNNs possible on more specific tasks within the von Neumann framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The accurate automatic segmentation of gliomas and its intra-tumoral structures is important not only for treatment planning but also for follow-up evaluations. Several methods based on 2D and 3D Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been developed to segment brain tumors and to classify different categories of tumors from different MRI modalities. However, these networks are often black-box models and do not provide any evidence regarding the process they take to perform this task. Increasing transparency and interpretability of such deep learning techniques is necessary for the complete integration of such methods into medical practice. In this paper, we explore various techniques to explain the functional organization of brain tumor segmentation models and to extract visualizations of internal concepts to understand how these networks achieve highly accurate tumor segmentations. We use the BraTS 2018 dataset to train three different networks with standard architectures and outline similarities and differences in the process that these networks take to segment brain tumors. We show that brain tumor segmentation networks learn certain human-understandable disentangled concepts on a filter level. We also show that they take a top-down or hierarchical approach to localizing the different parts of the tumor. We then extract visualizations of some internal feature maps and also provide a measure of uncertainty with regards to the outputs of the models to give additional qualitative evidence about the predictions of these networks. We believe that the emergence of such human-understandable organization and concepts might aid in the acceptance and integration of such methods in medical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The piriform cortex (PC) is a key brain area involved in both processing and coding of olfactory information. It is implicated in various brain disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism. The PC consists of the anterior (APC) and posterior (PPC) parts, which are different anatomically and functionally. However, the direct input networks to specific neuronal populations within the APC and PPC remain poorly understood. Here, we mapped the whole-brain direct inputs to the two major neuronal populations, the excitatory glutamatergic principal neurons and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons within the APC and PPC using the rabies virus (RV)-mediated retrograde trans-synaptic tracing system. We found that for both types of neurons, APC and PPC share some similarities in input networks, with dominant inputs originating from the olfactory region (OLF), followed by the cortical subplate (CTXsp), isocortex, cerebral nuclei (CNU), hippocampal formation (HPF) and interbrain (IB), whereas the midbrain (MB) and hindbrain (HB) were rarely labeled. However, APC and PPC also show distinct features in their input distribution patterns. For both types of neurons, the input proportion from the OLF to the APC was higher than that to the PPC; while the PPC received higher proportions of inputs from the HPF and CNU than the APC did. Overall, our results revealed the direct input networks of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations of different PC subareas, providing a structural basis to analyze the diverse PC functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a natural non-proteinogenic diamino acid produced by several species of both prokaryotic (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic (diatoms and dinoflagellates) microorganisms. BMAA has been shown to biomagnify through the food chain in some ecosystems, accumulating for example in seafood such as shellfish and fish, common dietary sources of BMAA whose ingestion may have possible neuronal consequences. In addition to its excitotoxic potential, BMAA has been implicated in protein misfolding and aggregation, inhibition of specific enzymes and neuroinflammation, all hallmark features of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity remain to be elucidated in detail. Although BMAA is commonly detected in its free form, complex BMAA-containing molecules have also been identified such as the paenilamicins, produced by an insect gut bacterial pathogen. On the other hand, production of BMAA or BMAA-containing molecules by members of the human gut microbiota, for example by non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the Melainabacteria, remains only hypothetical. In any case, should BMAA reach the gut it may interact with cells of the mucosal immune system and neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and possibly target the mitochondria. Here, we review the available evidence and hint on possible mechanisms by which chronic exposure to dietary sources of this microbial neurotoxin may drive protein misfolding and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant activation of innate immune responses, chronic low-grade gut inflammation, and ultimately the neurodegenerative features observed across the gut-brain axis in Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;With a lipid-rich environment and elevated oxygen consumption, the central nervous system (CNS) is subject to intricate regulation by lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs). Investigations into oxidative damage and chronic LDE generation in neural disorders have spurred the development of tools that can detect and catalog the gamut of LDE-adducted proteins. Despite these advances, deconstructing the precise consequences of individual protein-specific LDE modifications remained largely impossible until recently. In this perspective, we first overview emerging toolsets that can decode electrophile-signaling events in a protein/context-specific manner, and how the accumulating mechanistic insights brought about by these tools have begun to offer new means to modulate pathways relevant to multiple sclerosis (MS). By surveying the latest data surrounding the blockbuster MS drug dimethyl fumarate that functions through LDE-signaling-like mechanisms, we further provide a vision for how chemical biology tools probing electrophile signaling may be leveraged toward novel interventions in CNS disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Healthy central nervous system (CNS) development and function require an intricate and balanced bidirectional communication between neurons and glia cells. In this review, we discuss the complementary roles of astrocytes and microglia in building the brain, including in the formation and refinement of synapses. We discuss recent evidence demonstrating how these interactions are coordinated in the transition from healthy physiology towards disease and discuss known and potential molecular mechanisms that mediate this cellular crosstalk.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human babies respond preferentially to faces or face-like images. It has been proposed that an innate and rapid face detection system is present at birth before the cortical visual pathway is developed in many species, including primates. However, in primates, the visual area responsible for this process is yet to be unraveled. We hypothesized that the superior colliculus (SC) that receives direct and indirect retinal visual inputs may serve as an innate rapid face-detection system in primates. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responsiveness of monkey SC neurons to first-order information of faces required for face detection (basic spatial layout of facial features including eyes, nose, and mouth), by analyzing neuronal responses to line drawing images of: (1) face-like patterns with contours and properly placed facial features; (2) non-face patterns including face contours only; and (3) nonface random patterns with contours and randomly placed face features. Here, we show that SC neurons respond stronger and faster to upright and inverted face-like patterns compared to the responses to nonface patterns, regardless of contrast polarity and contour shapes. Furthermore, SC neurons with central receptive fields (RFs) were more selective to face-like patterns. In addition, the population activity of SC neurons with central RFs can discriminate face-like patterns from nonface patterns as early as 50 ms after the stimulus onset. Our results provide strong neurophysiological evidence for the involvement of the primate SC in face detection and suggest the existence of a broadly tuned template for face detection in the subcortical visual pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation is a therapeutic technique that is well-established in the treatment of idiopathic Lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction such as overactive bladder (OAB). We have recently developed a novel neuromodulation approach, Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Neuromodulation (TESCoN) and demonstrated its acute effects on LUT dysfunction after spinal cord injury (SCI) during urodynamic studies. We found that TESCoN can promote urinary storage and induce urinary voiding when delivered during urodynamic studies. The objective of this study was to determine whether TESCoN can retrain the spinal neural networks to induce chronic improvement in the LUT, such that positive changes can persist even in the absence of stimulation. In addition, we wished to examine the effect of TESCoN on LUT dysfunction due to multiple pathologies. To achieve this objective, 14 patients [SCI = 5, stroke = 5, multiple sclerosis (MS) = 3, and idiopathic OAB (iOAB) = 1] completed 24 sessions of TESCoN over the course of 8 weeks. Patients completed urodynamic studies before and after undergoing TESCoN therapy. Additionally, each subject completed a voiding diary and the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score questionnaire before and after receiving TESCoN therapy. We found that TESCoN led to decreased detrusor overactivity, improved continence, and enhanced LUT sensation across the different pathologies underlying LUT dysfunction. This study serves as a pilot in preparation for a rigorous randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to demonstrate the effect of TESCoN on LUT function in neurogenic and non-neurogenic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;New And Noteworthy&lt;p&gt;Non-Surgical modality to reduce incidence of urinary incontinence and improve neurogenic bladder symptom scores (NBSS) in individuals with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Lysophosphatidic acid is a small extracellular signaling molecule, which is elevated in pathological conditions such as ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). LPA regulates the survival of neurons in various diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPA-induced neuronal death remain unclear. Here we report that LPA activates LPA1 and LPA2 receptors, and the downstream MAPK pathway to induce the apoptosis of PC12 cells through mitochondrial dysfunction. LPA elicits the activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways, decreases the expression of Bcl2, promotes the translocation of Bax, and enhances the activation of caspase-3, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis. This process can be blocked by LPA1 receptor antagonist and LPA2 receptor antagonist and MAPK pathway inhibitors. Our results indicate that LPA1 receptor, LPA2 receptor and MAPK pathway play a critical role in LPA-induced neuronal injury. LPA receptors and MAPK pathways may be novel therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke and TBI, where excessive LPA signaling exist.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry has enabled neuroscientists to easily measure targeted brain activity patterns in awake, freely behaving animal. A focus of this technique is to identify functionally-relevant changes in activity around particular environmental and/or behavioral events, i.e., event-related activity transients (ERT). A simple and popular approach to identifying ERT is to summarize peri-event signal [e.g., area under the curve (AUC), peak activity, etc.,] and perform standard analyses on this summary statistic. We highlight the various issues with this approach and overview straightforward alternatives: waveform confidence intervals (CIs) and permutation tests. We introduce the rationale behind these approaches, describe the results of Monte Carlo simulations evaluating their effectiveness at controlling Type I and Type II error rates, and offer some recommendations for selecting appropriate analysis strategies for fiber photometry experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) is a commonly used unsupervised machine learning approach for identifying informative natural clusters of observations. HCA is performed by calculating a pairwise dissimilarity matrix and then clustering similar observations until all observations are grouped within a cluster. Verifying the empirical clusters produced by HCA is complex and not well studied in biomedical applications. Here, we demonstrate the comparability of a novel HCA technique with one that was used in previous biomedical applications while applying both techniques to plasma angiogenic (FGF, FLT, PIGF, Tie-2, VEGF, VEGF-D) and inflammatory (MMP1, MMP3, MMP9, IL8, TNFα) protein data to identify informative subsets of individuals. Study subjects were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease (MCI-CVD). Through comparison of the two HCA techniques, we were able to identify subsets of individuals, based on differences in VEGF (p &amp;lt; 0.001), MMP1 (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and IL8 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) levels. These profiles provide novel insights into angiogenic and inflammatory pathologies that may contribute to VCID.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that typically manifests in midlife with motor, cognitive, and/or psychiatric symptoms. The disease is caused by a CAG triplet expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene and leads to a severe neurodegeneration in the striatum and cortex. Classical electrophysiological studies in genetic HD mouse models provided important insights into the disbalance of excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs, as well as progressive disconnection between the cortex and striatum. However, the involvement of local cortical and striatal microcircuits still remains largely unexplored. Here we review the progress in understanding HD-related impairments in the cortical and basal ganglia circuits, and outline new opportunities that have opened with the development of modern circuit analysis methods. In particular, in vivo imaging studies in mouse HD models have demonstrated early structural and functional disturbances within the cortical network, and optogenetic manipulations of striatal cell types have started uncovering the causal roles of certain neuronal populations in disease pathogenesis. In addition, the important contribution of astrocytes to HD-related circuit defects has recently been recognized. In parallel, unbiased systems biology studies are providing insights into the possible molecular underpinnings of these functional defects at the level of synaptic signaling and neurotransmitter metabolism. With these approaches, we can now reach a deeper understanding of circuit-based HD mechanisms, which will be crucial for the development of effective and targeted therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) obtained from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has been shown to provide novel insights into brain function which may be obscured by static functional connectivity (SFC). Further, DFC, and by implication how different brain regions may engage or disengage with each other over time, has been shown to be behaviorally relevant and more predictive than SFC of behavioral performance and/or diagnostic status. DFC is not a directional entity and may capture neural synchronization. However, directional interactions between different brain regions is another putative mechanism by which neural populations communicate. Accordingly, static effective connectivity (SEC) has been explored as a means of characterizing such directional interactions. But investigation of its dynamic counterpart, i.e., dynamic effective connectivity (DEC), is still in its infancy. Of particular note are methodological insufficiencies in identifying DEC configurations that are reproducible across time and subjects as well as a lack of understanding of the behavioral relevance of DEC obtained from resting state fMRI. In order to address these issues, we employed a dynamic multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model to estimate DEC. The method was first validated using simulations and then applied to resting state fMRI data obtained in-house (N = 21), wherein we performed dynamic clustering of DEC matrices across multiple levels [using adaptive evolutionary clustering (AEC)] – spatial location, time, and subjects. We observed a small number of directional brain network configurations alternating between each other over time in a quasi-stable manner akin to brain microstates. The dominant and consistent DEC network patterns involved several regions including inferior and mid temporal cortex, motor and parietal cortex, occipital cortex, as well as part of frontal cortex. The functional relevance of these DEC states were determined using meta-analyses and pertained mainly to memory and emotion, but also involved execution and language. Finally, a larger cohort of resting-state fMRI and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 232, Q1–Q3 release) was used to demonstrate that metrics derived from DEC can explain larger variance in 70 behaviors across different domains (alertness, cognition, emotion, and personality traits) compared to SEC in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This article unifies neural modeling results that illustrate several basic design principles and mechanisms that are used by advanced brains to develop cortical maps with multiple psychological functions. One principle concerns how brains use a strip map that simultaneously enables one feature to be represented throughout its extent, as well as an ordered array of another feature at different positions of the strip. Strip maps include circuits to represent ocular dominance and orientation columns, place-value numbers, auditory streams, speaker-normalized speech, and cognitive working memories that can code repeated items. A second principle concerns how feature detectors for multiple functions develop in topographic maps, including maps for optic flow navigation, reinforcement learning, motion perception, and category learning at multiple organizational levels. A third principle concerns how brains exploit a spatial gradient of cells that respond at an ordered sequence of different rates. Such a rate gradient is found along the dorsoventral axis of the entorhinal cortex, whose lateral branch controls the development of time cells, and whose medial branch controls the development of grid cells. Populations of time cells can be used to learn how to adaptively time behaviors for which a time interval of hundreds of milliseconds, or several seconds, must be bridged, as occurs during trace conditioning. Populations of grid cells can be used to learn hippocampal place cells that represent the large spaces in which animals navigate. A fourth principle concerns how and why all neocortical circuits are organized into layers, and how functionally distinct columns develop in these circuits to enable map development. A final principle concerns the role of Adaptive Resonance Theory top-down matching and attentional circuits in the dynamic stabilization of early development and adult learning. Cortical maps are modeled in visual, auditory, temporal, parietal, prefrontal, entorhinal, and hippocampal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accurate stimulus onset timing is critical to almost all behavioral research. Auditory, visual, or manual response time stimulus onsets are typically sent through wires to various machines that record data such as: eye gaze positions, electroencephalography, stereo electroencephalography, and electrocorticography. These stimulus onsets are collated and analyzed according to experimental condition. If there is variability in the temporal accuracy of the delivery of these onsets to external systems, the quality of the resulting data and scientific analyses will degrade. Here, we describe an approximately 200 dollar Arduino based system and associated open-source codebase that achieved a maximum of 4 microseconds of delay from the inputs to the outputs while electrically opto-isolating the connected external systems. Using an oscilloscope, the device is configurable for the different environmental conditions particular to each laboratory (e.g., light sensor type, screen type, speaker type, stimulus type, temperature, etc). This low-cost open-source project delivered electrically isolated digital stimulus onset Transistor-Transistor Logic triggers with an input/output delay of 4 μs, and was successfully tested with seven different external systems that record eye and neurological data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Analyses of genoarchitecture recently stimulated substantial revisions of anatomical models for the developing hypothalamus in mammalian and other vertebrate systems. The prosomeric model proposes the hypothalamus to be derived from the secondary prosencephalon, and to consist of alar and basal regions. The basal hypothalamus can further be subdivided into tuberal and mamillary regions, each with distinct subregions. Albeit being a widely used model system for neurodevelopmental studies, no detailed genoarchitectural maps exist for the zebrafish (Danio rerio) hypothalamus. Here, we compare expression domains of zebrafish genes, including arxa, shha, otpa, isl1, lhx5, nkx2.1, nkx2.2a, pax6, and dlx5a, the orthologs of which delimit specific subregions within the murine basal hypothalamus. We develop the highly conserved brain-specific homeobox (bsx) gene as a novel marker for genoarchitectural analysis of hypothalamic regions. Our comparison of gene expression patterns reveals that the genoarchitecture of the basal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos 48 hours post fertilization is highly similar to mouse embryos at E13.5. We found the tuberal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos to be relatively large and to comprise previously ill-defined regions around the posterior hypothalamic recess. The mamillary hypothalamus is smaller and concentrates to rather medial areas in proximity to the anterior end of the neural tube floor plate. Within the basal hypothalamus we identified longitudinal and transverse tuberal and mamillary subregions topologically equivalent to those previously described in other vertebrates. However, the hypothalamic diencephalic boundary region and the posterior tuberculum still provide a challenge. We applied the updated prosomeric model to the developing zebrafish hypothalamus to facilitate cross-species comparisons. Accordingly, we applied the mammalian nomenclature of hypothalamic organization to zebrafish and propose it to replace some controversial previous nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is a problem that impacts a significant proportion of the adult population. Cochlear hair cell (HC) loss due to loud noise, chemotherapy and aging is the major underlying cause. A significant proportion of these individuals are dissatisfied with available treatment options which include hearing aids and cochlear implants. An alternative approach to restore hearing would be to regenerate HCs. Such therapy would require a recapitulation of the complex architecture of the organ of Corti, necessitating regeneration of both mature HCs and supporting cells (SCs). Transcriptional profiles of the mature cell types in the cochlea are necessary to can provide a metric for eventual regeneration therapies. To assist in this effort, we sought to provide the first single-cell characterization of the adult cochlear SC transcriptome. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq on FACS-purified adult cochlear SCs from the Lfng&lt;sup&gt;EGFP&lt;/sup&gt; adult mouse, in which SCs express GFP. We demonstrate that adult cochlear SCs are transcriptionally distinct from their perinatal counterparts. We establish cell-type-specific adult cochlear SC transcriptome profiles, and we validate these expression profiles through a combination of both fluorescent immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization co-localization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of adult cochlear SCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the relevance of these profiles to the adult human cochlea through immunofluorescent human temporal bone histopathology. Finally, we demonstrate cell cycle regulator expression in adult SCs and perform pathway analyses to identify potential mechanisms for facilitating mitotic regeneration (cell proliferation, differentiation, and eventually regeneration) in the adult mammalian cochlea. Our findings demonstrate the importance of characterizing mature as opposed to perinatal SCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One of the main risk factors for brain diseases is aging. Recent studies have shown that aging is a progressive degenerative process associated with chronic low-level inflammation. The ATP-gated P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays an important role in inflammation and has been associated with different brain (e.g., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s) or other age-related (osteoporosis, arthritis, cancer) diseases. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P2RX7 gene have been identified, including the loss-of-function 1513A&amp;gt;C and 1405A&amp;gt;G SNPs, and the gain-of-function 489C&amp;gt;T and 1068G&amp;gt;A SNPs. We carried out a literature analysis to verify an association between P2RX7 SNPs’ frequency and age. In 34 worldwide eligible studies (11.858 subjects) no correlation between 1513CC genotype frequency and age emerged. On the contrary, analysis of European Caucasian cohorts (7.241 subjects) showed a significant increase in 1513CC frequency with age (P = 0.027). In agreement with these findings, analysis of two publicly available datasets, including USA Caucasian cohorts, unveiled an increased frequency of 1513CC and 489CC genotypes with age (P = 0.0055 and P = 0.0019, respectively). Thus, hypomorphic P2RX7 genotypes may be positively selected with age in European and North American Caucasian populations. We hypothesize that Caucasian individuals bearing an anti-inflammatory P2X7R phenotype and living in high-income countries may have a longer life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Current evidence indicates that certain immune molecules such as components of the complement system are directly involved in neurobiological processes related to brain development, including neurogenesis, neuronal migration, synaptic remodeling, and response to prenatal or early postnatal brain insults. Consequently, complement system dysfunction has been increasingly implicated in disorders of neurodevelopmental origin, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Rett syndrome. However, the mechanistic evidence for a causal relationship between impaired complement regulation and these disorders varies depending on the disease involved. Also, it is still unclear to what extent altered complement expression plays a role in these disorders through inflammation-independent or -dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, pathogenic mutations in specific complement components have been implicated in the etiology of 3MC syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive developmental disorder. The aims of this review are to discuss the current knowledge on the roles of the complement system in sculpting brain architecture and function during normal development as well as after specific inflammatory insults, such as maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy, and to evaluate the existing evidence associating aberrant complement with developmental brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive concept of the biological basis of reward, social and emotional behavior, and language requires a deeper understanding of the microstructure and connectivity of the underlying brain regions. Such understanding could provide deeper insights into their role in functional networks, and form the anatomical basis of the functional segregation of this region as shown in recent in vivo imaging studies. Here, we investigated the cytoarchitecture of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lateral OFC) in serial histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains by image analysis and a statistically reproducible approach to detect borders between cortical areas. Profiles of the volume fraction of cell bodies were therefore extracted from digitized histological images, describing laminar changes from the layer I/layer II boundary to the white matter. As a result, four new areas, Fo4–7, were identified. Area Fo4 was mainly found in the anterior orbital gyrus (AOG), Fo5 anteriorly in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), Fo6 in the lateral orbital gyrus (LOG), and Fo7 in the lateral orbital sulcus. Areas differed in cortical thickness, abundance and size of pyramidal cells in layer III and degree of granularity in layer IV. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to quantify cytoarchitectonic differences between them. The 3D-reconstructed areas were transformed into the single-subject template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), where probabilistic maps and a maximum probability map (MPM) were calculated as part of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas. These maps served as reference data to study the functional properties of the areas using the BrainMap database. The type of behavioral tasks that activated them was analyzed to get first insights of co-activation patterns of the lateral OFC and its contribution to cognitive networks. Meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) showed that functional decoding revealed activation in gustatory perception in Fo4; reward and somesthetic perception in Fo5; semantic processing and pain perception in Fo6; and emotional processing and covert reading in Fo7. Together with existing maps of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas, the new maps can now be used as an open-source reference for neuroimaging studies, allowing to further decode brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Richard H. Masland––Dick to all who knew him––died on December 13, 2019, from cancer, four years after his initial diagnosis. During this interval, while enduring major fluctuations in health, Dick managed to start and complete an approachable and reflective book, We Know It When We See It: What the Neurobiology of Vision Tells Us About How We Think (March 2020). We are gladdened, though not surprised, that his wife, Jean, reports, “Dick was truly amazing the way he faced his illness, never showing signs of depression or anger but soldiering on with a positive attitude toward life.”</content>

Innervation allows the gastrointestinal tract to sense and respond to diverse stimuli, adjusting motility and secretion, but also affecting our physiology, behaviour and immunity. The mechanisms underlying the formation of gastrointestinal neurons are beginning to be elucidated; those that keep them plastic over an organism’s lifetime remain to be explored. Here, we review the effects of microbiota, nutrients, sex and ageing on the morphology and function of gastrointestinal innervation in mammals, and discuss how this plasticity shapes gut-brain crosstalk and whole-body physiology.

 &lt;p&gt;LAMA2-related congenital muscular dystrophy, also known as MDC1A, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the alpha2 chain of Laminin-211. Loss of this protein interrupts the connection between the muscle cell and its extracellular environment and results in an aggressive, congenital-onset muscular dystrophy characterized by severe hypotonia, lack of independent ambulation, and early mortality driven by respiratory complications and/or failure to thrive. Of the pathomechanisms of MDC1A, the earliest and most prominent is widespread and rampant fibrosis. Here, we will discuss some of the key drivers of fibrosis including TGF-beta and renin–angiotensin system signaling and consequences of these pathways including myofibroblast transdifferentiation and matrix remodeling. We will also highlight some of the differences in fibrogenesis in congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with that seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Finally, we will connect the key signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of MDC1A to the current status of the therapeutic approaches that have been tested in the preclinical models of MDC1A to treat fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain structural plasticity is an extraordinary tool that allows the mature brain to adapt to environmental changes, to learn, to repair itself after lesions or disease, and to slow aging. A long history of neuroscience research led to fascinating discoveries of different types of plasticity, involving changes in the genetically determined structure of nervous tissue, up to the ultimate dream of neuronal replacement: a stem cell-driven “adult neurogenesis” (AN). Yet, this road does not seem a straight one, since mutable dogmas, conflicting results and conflicting interpretations continue to warm the field. As a result, after more than 10,000 papers published on AN, we still do not know its time course, rate or features with respect to other kinds of structural plasticity in our brain. The solution does not appear to be behind the next curve, as differences among mammals reveal a very complex landscape that cannot be easily understood from rodents models alone. By considering evolutionary aspects, some pitfalls in the interpretation of cell markers, and a novel population of undifferentiated cells that are not newly generated [immature neurons (INs)], we address some conflicting results and controversies in order to find the right road forward. We suggest that considering plasticity in a comparative framework might help assemble the evolutionary, anatomical and functional pieces of a very complex biological process with extraordinary translational potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hemiparkinsonism-hemiatrophy syndrome (HPHA) and hemidystonia-hemiatrophy syndrome (HDHA) are rare movement disorders composed of hemidystonia or hemiparkinsonism that present with unilateral limb, face, trunk, or cerebral hemiatrophy and mostly occur following head trauma or postanoxic events. However, relatively little is known about the pathogenesis of these conditions. In our case series, we present three HPHA patients and one HDHA patient who underwent detailed neuropsychological, radiological, motor, and non-motor functional assessments with a mean follow-up of 2 years. We followed two patients who showed differences in their progression for more than 2 years: one barely progressed with no treatment, and the other exhibited levodopa-induce dyskinesia (LID) and definitive progression while receiving multiple adjunctive therapies. In addition, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in one HPHA patient who showed bilaterally symmetrical uptake of FDG with no significant increase or decrease in the cerebral hemispheres, including the striatum, but exhibited a significant reduction in the uptake of 18F-DOPA in the contralateral posterior striatum. In this study, we followed HPHA patients who showed different disease courses to explore the clinical characteristics and pathogenesis of HPHA and HDHA and illustrate the clinical heterogeneity of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains one of the most debilitating types of stroke and is characterized by a sudden bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel. ICH often results in high mortality and in survivors, permanent disability. Most studies have focused on neuroprotective strategies designed to minimize secondary consequences and prevent further pathology. Lacking is an understanding of how ICH acutely affects cerebrovascular components and their response to therapeutic interventions. We hypothesized that ICH alters cortical vessel complexity in the parenchyma adjacent to site of the initial vascular disruption and that vascular abnormalities would be mitigated by administration of the PDGFR inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Briefly, ICH was induced in male adult rats by injection of collagenase into basal ganglia, followed by Gleevec administration (60 mg/kg) 1 h after injury. Rats were then perfused using vessel painting methodology (Salehi et al., 2018b) to stain whole brain vascular networks at 1 day post-ICH. Axial and coronal wide field fluorescence microscopy was performed. Analyses for vascular features were undertaken and fractal analysis for vascular complexity. Data were collected from four groups of rats: Sham + Vehicle; Sham + Gleevec; ICH + Vehicle; ICH + Gleevec. Microscopy revealed that cortical vessels in both ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres exhibited significantly reduced density and branching by 22 and 34%, respectively. Fractal measures confirmed reduced complexity as well. Gleevec treatment further reduced vascular parameters, including reductions in vessel density in tissues adjacent to the ICH. The reductions in brain wide vascular networks after Gleevec in the current study after ICH is contrasted by previous reports of improved behavioral outcomes and decreased lCH lesion volumes Reductions in the vascular network after Gleevec may be involved in long-term repair mechanisms by pruning injured vessels to ultimately promote new vessel growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;The astrocytic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-arachidonic acid (AA) pathway is crucial in understanding the reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) prior to cognitive deterioration. In complementary and alternative medicine, manual acupuncture (MA) is used as one of the most important therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The beneficial effects of MA on CBF were reported in our previous study. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of MA on the astrocytic PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway in SAMP8 mice hippocampi.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;SAMP8 mice were divided into the SAMP8 control (Pc) group, the SAMP8 MA (Pm) group and the SAMP8 donepezil (Pd) group. SAMR1 mice were used as the SAMRl control (Rc) group. Mice in the Pd group were treated with donepezil hydrochloride at 0.65 μg/g. In the Pm group, MA was applied at Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) for 20 min. The above treatments were administered once a day for 26 consecutive days. The Morris water maze was applied to assess spatial learning and memory. Immunofluorescence staining, western blot and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to investigate the expression of related proteins and measure the contents of the metabolic intermediates of the PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with that in the Rc group, the escape latency in the Pc group significantly increased (p &amp;lt; 0.01); whereas, the platform crossover number and percentage of time and swimming distance in the platform quadrant decreased (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The hippocampal expression of PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, cyclooxygenase-1, cytochrome P450 proteins 2C23 and the levels of AA, prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids of the Pc group was drastically higher than that in the Rc group (p &amp;lt; 0.01). These changes were reversed by MA and donepezil (p &amp;lt; 0.01 or p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MA can effectively improve the learning and memory abilities of SAMP8 mice and has a negative regulatory effect on the PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway. We propose that the increase of the arterial tone, which is induced by the inhibition of vasodilatory pathway, may be a reason for the beneficial effect of MA on CBF.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Processing of positron emission tomography (PET) data typically involves manual work, causing inter-operator variance. Here we introduce the Magia toolbox that enables processing of brain PET data with minimal user intervention. We investigated the accuracy of Magia with four tracers: [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]MADAM, and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PiB. We used data from 30 control subjects for each tracer. Five operators manually delineated reference regions for each subject. The data were processed using Magia using the manually and automatically generated reference regions. We first assessed inter-operator variance resulting from the manual delineation of reference regions. We then compared the differences between the manually and automatically produced reference regions and the subsequently obtained binding potentials and standardized-uptake-value-ratios. The results show that manually produced reference regions can be remarkably different from each other, leading to substantial differences also in outcome measures. While the Magia-derived reference regions were anatomically different from the manual ones, Magia produced outcome measures highly consistent with the average of the manually obtained estimates. For [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PiB there was no bias, while for [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]MADAM Magia produced 3–5% higher binding potentials. Based on these results and considering the high inter-operator variance of the manual method, we conclude that Magia can be reliably used to process brain PET data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is revolutionizing Neuroscience, but an often neglected effect of light stimulation of the brain is the generation of heat. In extreme cases, light-generated heat kills neurons, but mild temperature changes alter neuronal function. To date, most in vivo experiments rely on light stimulation of neural tissue using fiber-coupled lasers of various wavelengths. Brain tissue is irradiated with high light power that can be deleterious to neuronal function. Furthermore, absorbed light generates heat that can lead to permanent tissue damage and affect neuronal excitability. Thus, light alone can generate effects in neuronal function that are unrelated to the genuine “optogenetic effect.” In this work, we perform a theoretical analysis to investigate the effects of heat transfer in rodent brain tissue for standard optogenetic protocols. More precisely, we first use the Kubelka-Munk model for light propagation in brain tissue to observe the absorption phenomenon. Then, we model the optothermal effect considering the common laser wavelengths (473 and 593 nm) used in optogenetic experiments approaching the time/space numerical solution of Pennes' bio-heat equation with the Finite Element Method. Finally, we then modeled channelrhodopsin-2 in a single and spontaneous-firing neuron to explore the effect of heat in light stimulated neurons. We found that, at commonly used light intensities, laser radiation considerably increases the temperature in the surrounding tissue. This effect alters action potential size and shape and causes an increase in spontaneous firing frequency in a neuron model. However, the shortening of activation time constants generated by heat in the single firing neuron model produces action potential failures in response to light stimulation. We also found changes in the power spectrum density and a reduction in the time required for synchronization in an interneuron network model of gamma oscillations. Our findings indicate that light stimulation with intensities used in optogenetic experiments may affect neuronal function not only by direct excitation of light sensitive ion channels and/or pumps but also by generating heat. This approach serves as a guide to design optogenetic experiments that minimize the role of tissue heating in the experimental outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue sodium levels increase during migraine. However, little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms of sodium homeostasis disturbance in the brain during the onset and propagation of migraine. Exploring the cause of sodium dysregulation in the brain is important, since correction of the altered sodium homeostasis could potentially treat migraine. Under the hypothesis that disturbances in sodium transport mechanisms at the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) and/or the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are the underlying cause of the elevated CSF and brain tissue sodium levels during migraines, we developed a mechanistic, differential equation model of a rat's brain to compare the significance of the BCSFB and the BBB in controlling CSF and brain tissue sodium levels. The model includes the ventricular system, subarachnoid space, brain tissue and blood. Sodium transport from blood to CSF across the BCSFB, and from blood to brain tissue across the BBB were modeled by influx permeability coefficients P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, while sodium movement from CSF into blood across the BCSFB, and from brain tissue to blood across the BBB were modeled by efflux permeability coefficients PBCSFB′ and PBBB′, respectively. We then performed a global sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the ventricular CSF, subarachnoid CSF and brain tissue sodium concentrations to pathophysiological variations in P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt;, PBCSFB′ and PBBB′. Our results show that the ventricular CSF sodium concentration is highly influenced by perturbations of P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt;, and to a much lesser extent by perturbations of PBCSFB′. Brain tissue and subarachnoid CSF sodium concentrations are more sensitive to pathophysiological variations of P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBBB′ than variations of P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBCSFB′ within 30 min of the onset of the perturbations. However, P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; is the most sensitive model parameter, followed by P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBBB′, in controlling brain tissue and subarachnoid CSF sodium levels within 3 h of the perturbation onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hemianopia is characterized by blindness in one half of the visual field and is a common consequence of stroke and unilateral injury to the visual cortex. There are few effective rehabilitative strategies that can relieve it. Using the cat as an animal model of hemianopia, we found that blindness induced by lesions targeting all contiguous areas of the visual cortex could be rapidly reversed by a non-invasive, multisensory (auditory-visual) exposure procedure even while animals were anesthetized. Surprisingly few trials were required to reinstate vision in the previously blind hemisphere. That rehabilitation was possible under anesthesia indicates that the visuomotor behaviors commonly believed to be essential are not required for this recovery, nor are factors such as attention, motivation, reward, or the various other cognitive features that are generally thought to facilitate neuro-rehabilitative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The mood disorders, major depression (MD) and bipolar disorder (BD), have a high lifetime prevalence in the human population and accordingly generate huge costs for health care. Efficient, rapidly acting, and side-effect-free pharmaceuticals are hitherto not available, and therefore, the identification of new therapeutic targets is an imperative task for (pre)clinical research. Such a target may be the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), which is localized in the central nervous system (CNS) at microglial and neuroglial cells mediating neuroinflammation. MD and BD are due to neuroinflammation caused in the first line by the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) from the microglia. IL-1β in turn induces the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and in consequence the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, which together with a plethora of further cytokines/chemokines lead to mood disorders. A number of biochemical/molecular biological measurements including the use of P2X7R- or IL-1β-deficient mice confirmed this chain of events. More recent studies showed that a decrease in the astrocytic release of ATP in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is a major cause of mood disorders. It is an attractive hypothesis that compensatory increases in P2X7Rs in these areas of the brain are the immediate actuators of MD and BD. Hence, blood-brain barrier-permeable P2X7R antagonists may be promising therapeutic tools to improve depressive disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no effective treatment of proteinopathies, as well as their diagnosis in the early stages of the disease until the first clinical symptoms appear. The proposed model of fibrillation of the Aβ peptide and its fragments not only describes molecular rearrangements, but also offers models of processes that occur during the formation of amyloid aggregates. Since this model is also characteristic of other proteins and peptides, a new potential target for drug development in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other proteinopathies is proposed on the basis of this model. In our opinion, it is oligomers that are promising targets for innovative developments in the treatment of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The inducible nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide (iNOS/NO) signaling pathway and inflammatory cytokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced fatigue. Studies have found that Mongolian warm acupuncture (WA) could alleviate exercise-induced fatigue. However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Mongolian WA on iNOS/NO signaling pathway and proinflammatory cytokines in a chronic exhaustive swimming-induced fatigue rat model. Animals were randomly divided into Control group, Ctrl + WA group, Model group, and Model + WA group. The body weight, exhaustive swimming time test, and Morris water maze test were performed before and after the chronic exhaustive swimming. The serum levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and iNOS were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and iNOS in the hippocampus were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, the protein expression of iNOS in the hippocampus was measured by western blot, and the NO productions in the serum and hippocampus were detected by Griess reaction system. Chronic exhaustive exercise significantly reduced the body weight and exhaustive swimming time, and induced impairment in learning and memory, and which were reversed by WA treatment. Chronic exhaustive exercise also increased the expressions of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines, while WA treatment significantly decreased the level of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines. However, chronic exhaustive exercise did not affect the NO production. These findings demonstrated that WA could alleviate the chronic exhaustive swimming-induced fatigue and improve the learning and memory ability, and the actions might be related to the reduction of inflammatory response and iNOS expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that combing with color properties may be used as part of the display presented to BCI users in order to improve performance. Build on this, we explored the effects of combinations of face stimuli with three primary colors (RGB) on BCI performance which is assessed by classification accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR). Furthermore, we analyzed the waveforms of three patterns.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We compared three patterns in which semitransparent face is overlaid three primary colors as stimuli: red semitransparent face (RSF), green semitransparent face (GSF), and blue semitransparent face (BSF). Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) was used to construct the individual classifier model. In addition, a Repeated-measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) and Bonferroni correction were chosen for statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that the RSF pattern achieved the highest online averaged accuracy with 93.89%, followed by the GSF pattern with 87.78%, while the lowest performance was caused by the BSF pattern with an accuracy of 81.39%. Furthermore, significant differences in classification accuracy and ITR were found between RSF and GSF (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and between RSF and BSF patterns (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The semitransparent faces colored red (RSF) pattern yielded the best performance of the three patterns. The proposed patterns based on ERP-BCI system have a clinically significant impact by increasing communication speed and accuracy of the P300-speller for patients with severe motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
