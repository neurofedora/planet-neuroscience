 Individuals who have Down syndrome (caused by trisomy of chromosome 21), have a greatly elevated risk of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, in which amyloid-{beta}; accumulates in the brain. Amyloid-{beta}; is a product of the chromosome 21 gene APP (amyloid precursor protein) and the extra copy or 'dose' of APP is thought to be the cause of this early-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, other chromosome 21 genes likely modulate disease when in three-copies in people with Down syndrome. Here we show that an extra copy of chromosome 21 genes, other than APP, influences APP/A{beta}; biology. We crossed Down syndrome mouse models with partial trisomies, to an APP transgenic model and found that extra copies of subgroups of chromosome 21 gene(s) modulate amyloid-{beta}; aggregation and APP transgene-associated mortality, independently of changing amyloid precursor protein abundance. Thus, genes on chromosome 21, other than APP, likely modulate Alzheimer's disease in people who have Down syndrome.</content>

 Background: Functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI) noise is usually assumed to have constant volatility. However this assumption has been recently challenges with a few studies examining heteroscedasticity arising from head motion and physiological noise. However, to our knowledge no studies have studied heteroscedasticity in scanner noise. Thus the aim of this study was to estimate the smoothness of fMRI scanner noise using latest methods from the field of financial mathematics. Methods: A multi-echo fMRI scan was performed on a phantom using two 3 tesla MRI units. The echo times were used as intra-time point data to estimate realised volatility. Smoothness of the realised volatility processes was examined by estimating the Hurst, H , parameter in the rough Bergomi model using neural network calibration. Results: All H &amp;lt; 0.5 and on average fMRI scanner noise was very rough with H {approx} 0.03. Substantial variability was also observed, which was caused by edge effects, whereby H was larger near the edges of the phantoms. Discussion: The findings challenge the assumption that fMRI scanner noise has constant volatility and add to the steady accumulation of studies suggesting implementing methods to model heteroscedasticity may improve fMRI data analysis. Additionally, the present findings add to previous work showing that the mean and normality of fMRI noise processes show edge effects, such that signal near the edges of the images is less likely to meet the assumptions of current modelling methods.</content>

 Sudden changes in visual scenes often indicate important events for behavior. For their quick and reliable detection, the brain must be capable to process these changes as independent as possible from its current activation state. In motion-selective area MT, neurons respond to instantaneous speed changes with pronounced transients, often far exceeding the expected response as derived from their speed tuning profile. We here show that this complex, non-linear behavior emerges from the combined temporal dynamics of excitation and divisive inhibition, and provide a comprehensive formal analysis. A central prediction derived from this investigation is that attention increases the steepness of the transient response irrespective of the activation state prior to a stimulus change, and irrespective of the sign of the change. Extracellular recordings of attention-dependent representation of both speed increments and decrements confirmed this prediction and suggest that improved change detection derives from basic computations in a canonical cortical circuitry.</content>

 The success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the survival of HIV-infected patients significantly. However, significant numbers of patients on ART whose HIV disease is well controlled show peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN), suggesting that ART may cause PSN. Although the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), one of the vital components of ART, are thought to contribute to PSN, the mechanisms underlying the PSN induced by NRTIs are unclear. In this study, we developed a Drosophila model of NRTI-induced PSN that recapitulates the salient features observed in patients undergoing ART: PSN and nociceptive hypersensitivity. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that pathways known to suppress PSN induced by chemotherapeutic drugs are ineffective in suppressing the PSN or nociception induced by NRTIs. Instead, we found that increased dynamics of a peripheral sensory neuron may underlie NRTI-induced PSN and nociception. Our model provides a solid platform in which to investigate further mechanisms of ART-induced PSN and nociceptive hypersensitivity.</content>

 Neuroimaging tools have been widely adopted to study the anatomical and functional properties of the brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG), a neuroimaging method prized for its high temporal resolution, records magnetic field changes due to brain activity and has been used to study the cognitive processes underlying various tasks. As the research community increasingly embraces the principles of open science, a growing amount of MEG data has been published online. However, the prevalence of MEG data sharing may pose unforeseen privacy issues. We argue that an individual may be identified from a segment of their MEG recording even if their data has been anonymized. From our standpoint, individual identifiability is closely related to individual variability of brain activity, which is itself a widely studied scientific topic. In this paper, we propose three interpretable spatial, temporal, and frequency MEG featurizations that we term brainprints (brain fingerprints). We show using multiple datasets that these brainprints can accurately identify individuals, and we reveal consistent components of these brainprints that are important for identification. We also investigate how identification accuracy varies with respect to the abundance of data, the level of preprocessing, and the state of the brain. Our findings pinpoint how individual variability expresses itself through MEG, a topic of scientific interest, while raising ethical concerns about the unregulated sharing of brain data, even if anonymized.</content>

 Anesthetics, although necessary for many modern procedures, exert neurotoxic effects in various experimental models; the underlying mechanisms, however, remain unknown. In the absence of this information, any in vivo mitigation strategy would be challenging. To help address these gaps, we sought to determine whether preserving mitochondrial network integrity with a non-toxic, short-life synthetic peptide, P110, could protect cortical neurons against both inhalational and intravenous anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity. This study provides the first direct comparative account of three key general anesthetics (desflurane, propofol, and ketamine) under identical conditions and demonstrates their impact on cellular viability, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic network assembly on neonatal rat cortical neurons. Further, we discovered that the inhibition of Fis1 receptor-mediated fission reverses anesthetic-induced aberrations in an agent-specific manner. Our data thus underscore the importance of a reductionist approach, offering unique opportunities to explore non-toxic, mitochondria-based therapeutic tools for mitigating anesthetic-induced harm to the developing brain.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Purpose: We examined the relationship between axial length and the thickness and volume of the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the retina, and related these measures to the size of the optic chiasm. Methods: We used optical coherence tomography to measure the thickness of the GCL over a 50 degree extent of the horizontal meridian in 50 normally-sighted participants with a wide range of axial lengths. Using a model eye informed by individual biometry, we converted GCL thickness to tissue volume per square degree. The volume of the optic chiasm was measured for 40 participants using magnetic resonance imaging. Results: While GCL thickness decreases with increasing axial length, there is a positive relationship between GCL tissue volume and axial length, leading us to conclude that increasing axial length is associated with decreased retinal ganglion cell packing, increased cell size, or both. We characterize how retinal ganglion cell tissue varies systematically in volume and spatial distribution as a function of axial length. This model allows us to remove the effect of axial length from individual difference measures of GCL volume. We find that variation in GCL volume correlates well with the size of the optic chiasm as measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusions: Our results provide the volume of ganglion cell tissue in the retina, adjusted for the effects of axial length upon ganglion cell size and/or packing. The resulting volume measure accounts for individual differences in the size of the optic chiasm, supporting its use to characterize the post-retinal visual pathway.</content>

 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with widespread tau pathology in about one third of patients. We previously found that TBI induces a transmissible tau pathology (tauTBI ), with late cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunction. To understand whether tauTBI  is a marker of ongoing neurodegeneration or a driver of functional decline, we employed C. elegans. Brain homogenates from chronic TBI mice, or from mice in which tauTBI  had been transmitted by intracerebral inoculation, impaired C. elegans motility and neuromuscular synaptic transmission. Brain homogenates from tau P301L transgenic mice, or pre-aggregated recombinant tau, induced a similar toxic response. Protease digestion or pre-incubation of homogenates with anti-tau antibodies abolished toxicity, and TBI brain homogenates from tau knock-out mice had no toxic effect. These results support a vital role of abnormal tau species in chronic neurodegeneration after TBI and set the groundwork for the development of a C. elegans-based platform for screening anti-tau compounds.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Normal aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are accompanied by large-scale alterations in brain organization that undermine brain function. Although hemispheric asymmetry is a global organizing feature of cortex thought to promote brain efficiency, current descriptions of cortical thinning in aging and AD have largely overlooked cortical asymmetry. Consequently, the foundational question of whether and where the cerebral hemispheres change at different rates in aging and AD remains open. First, applying vertex-wise data-driven clustering in a longitudinal discovery sample (aged 20-89; 2577 observations; 1851 longitudinal) we identified cortical regions exhibiting similar age-trajectories of asymmetry across the adult lifespan. Next, we sought replication in 4 independent longitudinal aging cohorts. We show that higher-order regions of cortex that exhibit pronounced asymmetry at age ~20 also show asymmetry change in aging. Results revealed that both leftward and rightward asymmetry is progressively lost on a similar time-scale across adult life. Hence, faster thinning of the (previously) thicker homotopic hemisphere is a feature of aging. This simple organizational principle showed high consistency across multiple aging cohorts in the Lifebrain consortium, and both the topological patterns and temporal dynamics of asymmetry-loss were markedly similar across replicating samples. Finally, we show that regions exhibiting gradual asymmetry-loss over healthy adult life exhibit faster asymmetry-change in AD. Overall, our results suggest a system-wide breakdown in the adaptive asymmetric organization of cortex across adult life which is further accelerated in AD, and may implicate thickness asymmetry as a viable marker for declining hemispheric specialization in aging and AD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Reward processing abnormalities may underlie characteristic pleasure and motivational impairments in schizophrenia. Some neural measures of reward processing show strong age-related modulation, highlighting the importance of considering age effects on reward sensitivity. We compared event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting reward anticipation (stimulus-preceding negativity, SPN) and evaluation (reward positivity, RewP; late-positive potential, LPP) across individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC), with an emphasis on examining effects of chronological age, brain age (i.e., predicted age based on neurobiological measures), and illness phase. Methods: Subjects underwent EEG while completing a slot-machine task for which rewards were not dependent on performance accuracy, speed, or other preparatory demands. Slot-machine task EEG responses were compared between 54 SZ and 54 HC individuals, ages 19 to 65. Reward-related ERPs were analyzed with respect to chronological age, categorically-defined illness phase (early; ESZ versus chronic schizophrenia; CSZ), and were used to model brain age relative to chronological age. Results: Illness phase-focused analyses indicated there were no group differences in average SPN or RewP amplitudes. However, a group x reward outcome interaction revealed that ESZ differed from HC in later outcome processing, reflected by greater LPP responses following loss versus reward (a reversal of the HC pattern). While brain age estimates did not differ among groups, depressive symptoms in SZ were associated with older brain age estimates while controlling for negative symptoms. Conclusions: ESZ and CSZ did not differ from HC in reward anticipation or early outcome processing during a cognitively undemanding reward task, highlighting areas of preserved functioning. However, ESZ showed altered later reward outcome evaluation, pointing to selective reward deficits during the early illness phase of schizophrenia. Further, an association between ERP-derived brain age and depressive symptoms in SZ extends prior findings linking depression with reward-related ERP blunting. Taken together, both illness phase and age may impact reward processing in SZ, and brain aging may offer a promising, novel marker of reward dysfunction that warrants further study.</content>

Recent advances in instrumentation have moved analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) closer to a possible validation in a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) environment. In order for AUC to be validated for a GMP environment, stringent requirements need to be satisfied; analysis procedures must be evaluated for consistency and reproducibility, and GMP capable data acquisition software needs to be developed and validated. These requirements extend to multiple regulatory aspects, covering documentation of instrument hardware functionality, data handling and software for data acquisition and data analysis, process control, audit trails and automation. Here we review the requirements for GMP validation of data acquisition software and illustrate software solutions based on UltraScan that address these requirements as far as they relate to the operation and data handling in conjunction with the latest analytical ultracentrifuge, the Optima AUC by Beckman Coulter. The software targets the needs of regulatory agencies, where AUC plays a critical role in the solutionbased characterization of biopolymers and macromolecular assemblies. Biopharmaceutical and regulatory agencies rely heavily on this technique for characterizations of pharmaceutical formulations, biosimilars, injectables, nanoparticles, and other soluble therapeutics. Because of its resolving power, AUC is a favorite application, despite the current lack of GMP validation. We believe that recent advances in standards, hardware, and software presented in this work manage to bridge this gap and allow AUC to be routinely used in a GMP environment. AUC has great potential to provide more detailed information, at higher resolution, and with greater confidence than other analytical techniques, and our software satisfies an urgent need for AUC operation in the GMP environment. The software, including documentation, are publicly available for free download from Github. The multi-platform software is licensed by the LGPL v.3 open source license and supports Windows, Mac and Linux platforms. Installation instructions and a mailing list are available from ultrascan.aucsolutions.com.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qH8I92puJMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A high quality benchmark for small variants encompassing 88 to 90% of the reference genome has been developed for seven Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) reference samples. However a reliable benchmark for large indels and structural variants (SVs) is more challenging. In this study, we manually curated 1235 SVs, which can ultimately be used to evaluate SV callers or train machine learning models. We developed a crowdsourcing app—SVCurator—to help GIAB curators manually review large indels and SVs within the human genome, and report their genotype and size accuracy. SVCurator displays images from short, long, and linked read sequencing data from the GIAB Ashkenazi Jewish Trio son [NIST RM 8391/HG002]. We asked curators to assign labels describing SV type (deletion or insertion), size accuracy, and genotype for 1235 putative insertions and deletions sampled from different size bins between 20 and 892,149 bp. ‘Expert’ curators were 93% concordant with each other, and 37 of the 61 curators had at least 78% concordance with a set of ‘expert’ curators. The curators were least concordant for complex SVs and SVs that had inaccurate breakpoints or size predictions. After filtering events with low concordance among curators, we produced high confidence labels for 935 events. The SVCurator crowdsourced labels were 94.5% concordant with the heuristic-based draft benchmark SV callset from GIAB. We found that curators can successfully evaluate putative SVs when given evidence from multiple sequencing technologies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yYwFuZlsBC4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The auditory neural code is resilient to acoustic variability and capable of recognizing sounds amongst competing sound sources, yet, the transformations enabling noise robust abilities are largely unknown. We report that a hierarchical spiking neural network (HSNN) optimized to maximize word recognition accuracy in noise and multiple talkers predicts organizational hierarchy of the ascending auditory pathway. Comparisons with data from auditory nerve, midbrain, thalamus and cortex reveals that the optimal HSSN predicts several transformations of the ascending auditory pathway including a sequential loss of temporal resolution and synchronization ability, increasing sparseness, and selectivity. The optimal organizational scheme enhances performance by selectively filtering out noise and fast temporal cues such as voicing periodicity, that are not directly relevant to the word recognition task. An identical network arranged to enable high information transfer fails to predict auditory pathway organization and has substantially poorer performance. Furthermore, conventional single-layer linear and nonlinear receptive field networks that capture the overall feature extraction of the HSNN fail to achieve similar performance. The findings suggest that the auditory pathway hierarchy and its sequential nonlinear feature extraction computations enhance relevant cues while removing non-informative sources of noise, thus enhancing the representation of sounds in noise impoverished conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DD252m6Ocbo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Curli play critical roles in biofilm formation, host cell adhesion, and colonization of inert surfaces in many Enterobacteriaceae. In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, curli biogenesis requires 7 curli-specific gene (&lt;i&gt;csg&lt;/i&gt;) products—CsgA through G—working in concert. Of them, CsgG and CsgF are 2 outer membrane (OM)-localized components that consists of the core apparatus for secretion and assembly of curli structural subunits, CsgB and CsgA. Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of CsgG in complex with CsgF from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. The structure reveals that CsgF forms a stable complex with CsgG via a 1:1 stoichiometry by lining the upper lumen of the nonameric CsgG channel via its N-terminal 27 residues, forming a funnel-like entity plugged in the CsgG channel and creating a unique secretion channel with 2 constriction regions, consistent with the recently reported structure of the CsgG-CsgF complex. Functional studies indicate that export of CsgF to the cell surface requires the CsgG channel, and CsgF not only functions as an adaptor that bridges CsgB with CsgG but also may play important roles in controlling the rates of translocation and/or polymerization for curli structural subunits. Importantly, we found that a series of CsgF-derived peptides are able to efficiently inhibit curli production to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; when administrated exogenously, highlighting a potential strategy to interfere biofilm formation in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RmDTSjyQvcY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Dopamine guides behavior and learning through pleasure, according to classic understanding. Dopaminergic neurons are traditionally thought to signal positive or negative prediction errors (PEs) when reward expectations are, respectively, exceeded or not matched. These signed PEs are quite different from the unsigned PEs, which report surprise during sensory processing. But mounting theoretical accounts from the predictive processing framework postulate that dopamine, as a neuromodulator, could potentially regulate the postsynaptic gain of sensory neurons, thereby scaling unsigned PEs according to their expected precision or confidence. Despite ample modeling work, the physiological effects of dopamine on the processing of surprising sensory information are yet to be addressed experimentally. In this study, we tested how dopamine modulates midbrain processing of unexpected tones. We recorded extracellular responses from the rat inferior colliculus to oddball and cascade sequences, before, during, and after the microiontophoretic application of dopamine or eticlopride (a D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptor antagonist). Results demonstrate that dopamine reduces the net neuronal responsiveness exclusively to unexpected sensory input without significantly altering the processing of expected input. We conclude that dopaminergic projections from the thalamic subparafascicular nucleus to the inferior colliculus could encode the expected precision of unsigned PEs, attenuating via D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptors the postsynaptic gain of sensory inputs forwarded by the auditory midbrain neurons. This direct dopaminergic modulation of sensory PE signaling has profound implications for both the predictive coding framework and the understanding of dopamine function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JHDPF6zB2SM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;HSPGs glypican‐1 and glypican‐4 are human neuronal proteins characteristic of different neural phenotypes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/888e0a08-e0cf-4e0e-a9ba-fcfe803a1061/jnr24666-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glypican‐1 (GPC1) and ‐4 (GPC4) have previously been reported as markers of lineage‐specific neural stem cells. Here, their pheonotypical characteristics were further examined under neuronal differentiation conditions in the presence of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and platelet‐derived growth factor‐B (PDGF‐B). GPC1 and GPC4 demonstrated differential localized expression during long‐term (40–60 days) neuronal differentiation, suggesting different functions within neural cells. Under BDNF conditions, higher GPC4 to GPC1 gene expression ratio correlated with increased heterogeneity, increased proliferation, and increased GABAergic marker expression. In contrast, PDGF conditions resulted in higher GPC1 to GPC4 gene expression ratio and resulting in decreased heterogeneity, increased spontaneous activity, and increased dopaminergic marker expression. Our results confirm GPC1 and GPC4 as human neural proteins providing a potential set of novel markers to characterize different neural cell populations in terms of maturity, heterogeneity, and subtype differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating neurons from human stem cells has potential for brain damage therapy and neurogenesis modeling, but current efficacy is limited by culture heterogeneity and the lack of markers. We have previously reported the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) glypican‐1 (GPC1) and ‐4 (GPC4) as the markers of lineage‐specific human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and mediators of hNSC lineage potential. Here, we further examined phenotypical characteristics and GPC1 and GPC4 during neural differentiation of hNSCs in the presence of two neurogenic growth factors reported to bind to heparan sulfate: brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and platelet‐derived growth factor‐B (PDGF‐B). In hNSC neural cultures, GPC1 and GPC4 were expressed along neurites and cell bodies in long‐term (40–60 days) neural differentiation cultures demonstrating the areas of differential localization—suggesting potentially different functions. Neural differentiation cultures in the presence of BDNF or PDGF‐B generated phenotypically different neural cells with BDNF treatment associated with higher &lt;i&gt;GPC4 &lt;/i&gt; versus &lt;i&gt;GPC1 &lt;/i&gt; expression, increased heterogeneity, and differential neuron subtype marker expression to PDGF‐B cultures. PDGF‐B cultures exhibited higher levels of spontaneous activity and reduced heterogeneity over long‐term culture associated with decreased &lt;i&gt;GPC4 &lt;/i&gt;. Untreated neural cultures were highly variable, supporting the use of neuroregulatory growth factors for guided differentiation. Targeted siRNA downregulation of GPC1/4 reduced neural differentiation markers and altered response to exogenous BDNF and PDGF‐B. This work confirms GPC1 and GPC4 as regulators of human neural differentiation and supports their use as novel markers of neural cell characterization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Contemporary accounts of ongoing thought recognise it as a heterogeneous and
multidimensional construct, varying in both form and content. An emerging body
of evidence demonstrates that distinct types of experience are associated with
unique neurocognitive profiles, that can be described at the whole-brain level
as interactions between multiple large-scale networks. The current study sought
to explore the possibility that whole-brain functional connectivity patterns at
rest may be meaningfully related to patterns of ongoing thought that occurred
over this period. Participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic
resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) followed by a questionnaire retrospectively
assessing the content and form of their ongoing thoughts during the scan. A
non-linear dimension reduction algorithm was applied to the rs-fMRI data to
identify components explaining the greatest variance in whole-brain
connectivity patterns, and ongoing thought patterns during the resting-state
were measured retrospectively at the end of the scan. Multivariate analyses
revealed that individuals for whom the connectivity of the sensorimotor system
was maximally distinct from the visual system were most likely to report
thoughts related to finding solutions to problems or goals and least likely to
report thoughts related to the past. These results add to an emerging
literature that suggests that unique patterns of experience are associated with
distinct distributed neurocognitive profiles and highlight that unimodal
systems may play an important role in this process.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The traditional approach to face anti-spoofing sees it as a binary
classification problem, and binary classifiers are trained and validated on
specialized anti-spoofing databases. One of the drawbacks of this approach is
that, due to the variability of face spoofing attacks, environmental factors,
and the typically small sample size, such classifiers do not generalize well to
previously unseen databases. Anomaly detection, which approaches face
anti-spoofing as a one-class classification problem, is emerging as an
increasingly popular alternative approach. Nevertheless, in all existing work
on anomaly detection for face anti-spoofing, the proposed training protocols
utilize images from specialized anti-spoofing databases only, even though only
common images of real faces are needed. Here, we explore the use of in-the-wild
images, and images from non-specialized face databases, to train one-class
classifiers for face anti-spoofing. Employing a well-established technique, we
train a convolutional autoencoder on real faces and compare the reconstruction
error of the input against a threshold to classify a face image accordingly as
either client or imposter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the inclusion in the training set of in-the-wild images
increases the discriminating power of the classifier significantly on an unseen
database, as evidenced by a large increase in the value of the Area Under the
Curve. In a limitation of our approach, we note that the problem of finding a
suitable operating point on the unseen database remains a challenge, as
evidenced by the values of the Half Total Error Rate.

 &lt;p&gt;The article considers the problem of the optimal control of a wind power
plant based on fuzzy control and automation of generating the fuzzy rule base.
Fuzzy rules by experts do not always provide a maximum power output of the wind
plant and fuzzy rule bases require an adjustment in the case of changing the
parameters of the wind power plant or the environment. This research proposes
the method for optimizing the fuzzy rules base compiled by various experts. The
method is based on balancing weights of fuzzy rules into the base by the
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The experiment has shown that the
proposed method allows forming the fuzzy rule base as an exemplary optimal base
from a non-optimized set of fuzzy rules. The optimal fuzzy rule base has been
taken under consideration for the concrete control loop of wind power plant and
the concrete fuzzy model of the wind.

 &lt;p&gt;Higher-order connectivity in complex systems described by simplexes of
different orders provides a geometry for simplex-based dynamical variables and
interactions. Simplicial complexes that constitute a functional geometry of the
human connectome can be crucial for the brain complex dynamics. In this
context, the best-connected brain areas, designated as hub nodes, play a
central role in supporting integrated brain function. Here, we study the
structure of simplicial complexes attached to eight global hubs in the female
and male connectomes and identify the core networks among the affected brain
regions. These eight hubs (Putamen, Caudate, Hippocampus and Thalamus-Proper in
the left and right cerebral hemisphere) are the highest-ranking according to
their topological dimension, defined as the number of simplexes of all orders
in which the node participates. Furthermore, we analyse the weight-dependent
heterogeneity of simplexes. We demonstrate changes in the structure of
identified core networks and topological entropy when the threshold weight is
gradually increased. These results highlight the role of higher-order
interactions in human brain networks and provide additional evidence for
(dis)similarity between the female and male connectomes.

 &lt;p&gt;Continuous-depth neural networks can be viewed as deep limits of discrete
neural networks whose dynamics resemble a discretization of an ordinary
differential equation (ODE). Although important steps have been taken to
realize the advantages of such continuous formulations, most current techniques
are not truly continuous-depth as they assume identical layers. Indeed,
existing works throw into relief the myriad difficulties presented by an
infinite-dimensional parameter space in learning a continuous-depth neural ODE.
To this end, we introduce a shooting formulation which shifts the perspective
from parameterizing a network layer-by-layer to parameterizing over optimal
networks described only by a set of initial conditions. For scalability, we
propose a novel particle-ensemble parametrization which fully specifies the
optimal weight trajectory of the continuous-depth neural network. Our
experiments show that our particle-ensemble shooting formulation can achieve
competitive performance, especially on long-range forecasting tasks. Finally,
though the current work is inspired by continuous-depth neural networks, the
particle-ensemble shooting formulation also applies to discrete-time networks
and may lead to a new fertile area of research in deep learning
parametrization.

 &lt;p&gt;The grid cells in the mammalian medial entorhinal cortex exhibit striking
hexagon firing patterns when the agent navigates in the open field. It is
hypothesized that the grid cells are involved in path integral so that the
agent is aware of its self-position by accumulating its self-motion. Assuming
the grid cells form a vector representation of self-position, we elucidate a
minimally simple recurrent model for path integral, which models the change of
the vector representation given the self-motion, and we discern two matrix Lie
algebras and their Lie groups that are naturally coupled together. This enables
us to connect the path integral model to the dimension reduction model for
place cells via group representation theory of harmonic analysis. By
reconstructing the kernel functions for place cells, our model learns hexagon
grid patterns that characterize the grid cells. The learned model is capable of
near perfect path integral, and it is also capable of error correction.

 &lt;p&gt;Recent advances in neuroscience data acquisition allow for the simultaneous
recording of large populations of neurons across multiple brain areas while
subjects perform complex cognitive tasks. Interpreting these data requires us
to index how task-relevant information is shared across brain regions, but this
is often confounded by the mixing of different task parameters at the single
neuron level. Here, inspired by a method developed for a single brain area, we
introduce a new technique for demixing variables across multiple brain areas,
called demixed shared component analysis (dSCA). dSCA decomposes population
activity into a few components, such that the shared components capture the
maximum amount of shared information across brain regions while also depending
on relevant task parameters. This yields interpretable components that express
which variables are shared between different brain regions and when this
information is shared across time. To illustrate our method, we reanalyze two
datasets recorded during decision-making tasks in rodents and macaques. We find
that dSCA provides new insights into the shared computation between different
brain areas in these datasets, relating to several different aspects of
decision formation.

 &lt;p&gt;Understanding principles of neurolocomotion requires the synthesis of neural
activity, sensory feedback, and biomechanics. The nematode $\textit{C.
elegans}$ is an ideal model organism for studying locomotion in an integrated
neuromechanical setting because its nervous system is well characterized and
its forward swimming gait adapts to the surrounding fluid using sensory
feedback. However, it is not understood how the gait emerges from mechanical
forces, neuronal coupling, and sensory feedback mechanisms. Here, an integrated
neuromechanical model of $\textit{C. elegans}$ forward locomotion is developed
and analyzed. The model captures the experimentally observed gait adaptation
over a wide range of parameters, provided that the muscle response to input
from the nervous system is faster than the body response to changes in internal
and external forces. The model is analyzed using the theory of weakly coupled
oscillators to identify the relative roles of body mechanics, neural coupling,
and proprioceptive coupling in coordinating the undulatory gait. The analysis
shows that the wavelength of body undulations is set by the relative strengths
of these three coupling forms. The model suggests that the experimentally
observed decrease in wavelength in response to increasing fluid viscosity is
the result of an increase in the relative strength of mechanical coupling,
which promotes a short wavelength.

 &lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a methodology to extract a low-dimensional
integrate-and-fire model from an arbitrarily detailed conductance-based model.
The method provides a computational bridge between the physiology of a
neuromodulator at the cellular level and its impact in a possibly large
neuronal network. The approach is illustrated on two well-documented examples
of cellular neuromodulation: the transition between Type I and Type II
excitability and the transition between spiking and bursting.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Under Frequency Fitness Assignment (FFA), the fitness corresponding to an
objective value is its encounter frequency in fitness assignment steps and is
subject to minimization. FFA renders optimization processes invariant under
bijective transformations of the objective function value. On TwoMax, Jump, and
Trap functions of scale s, the classical (1+1)-EA with standard mutation at
rate 1/s can have expected runtimes exponential in s. In our experiments, a
(1+1)-FEA, the same algorithm but using FFA, exhibits mean runtimes in
s*s*ln(s). Since Jump and Trap are bijective transformations of OneMax, it
behaves identical on all three. On OneMax, LeadingOnes, and Plateau problems,
it seems to be slower than the (1+1)-EA by a factor linear in s. The (1+1)-FEA
performs much better than the (1+1)-EA on W-Model and MaxSat instances. Due to
the bijection invariance in the objective space, the behavior of an
optimization algorithm using only FFA does not change when the objective values
are encrypted. We verify this by applying the Md5 checksum computation as
transformation to some of the above problems and yield the same behaviors.
Finally, we show that FFA can improve the performance of a Memetic Algorithm
for Job Shop Scheduling.

 &lt;p&gt;The Backpropagation algorithm relies on the abstraction of using a neural
model that gets rid of the notion of time, since the input is mapped
instantaneously to the output. In this paper, we claim that this abstraction of
ignoring time, along with the abrupt input changes that occur when feeding the
training set, are in fact the reasons why, in some papers, Backprop biological
plausibility is regarded as an arguable issue. We show that as soon as a deep
feedforward network operates with neurons with time-delayed response, the
backprop weight update turns out to be the basic equation of a biologically
plausible diffusion process based on forward-backward waves. We also show that
such a process very well approximates the gradient for inputs that are not too
fast with respect to the depth of the network. These remarks somewhat disclose
the diffusion process behind the backprop equation and leads us to interpret
the corresponding algorithm as a degeneration of a more general diffusion
process that takes place also in neural networks with cyclic connections.

 &lt;p&gt;Oja's rule [Oja, Journal of mathematical biology 1982] is a well-known
biologically-plausible algorithm using a Hebbian-type synaptic update rule to
solve streaming principal component analysis (PCA). Computational
neuroscientists have known that this biological version of Oja's rule converges
to the top eigenvector of the covariance matrix of the input in the limit.
However, prior to this work, it was open to prove any convergence rate
guarantee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we give the first convergence rate analysis for the biological
version of Oja's rule in solving streaming PCA. Moreover, our convergence rate
matches the information theoretical lower bound up to logarithmic factors and
outperforms the state-of-the-art upper bound for streaming PCA. Furthermore, we
develop a novel framework inspired by ordinary differential equations (ODE) to
analyze general stochastic dynamics. The framework abandons the traditional
step-by-step analysis and instead analyzes a stochastic dynamic in one-shot by
giving a closed-form solution to the entire dynamic. The one-shot framework
allows us to apply stopping time and martingale techniques to have a flexible
and precise control on the dynamic. We believe that this general framework is
powerful and should lead to effective yet simple analysis for a large class of
problems with stochastic dynamics.

networks (RNNs) can increase their expressiveness and representational
capacity. Two popular enhancements are stacked RNNs, which increases the
capacity for learning non-linear functions, and bidirectional processing, which
exploits acausal information in a sequence. In this work, we explore the
delayed-RNN, which is a single-layer RNN that has a delay between the input and
output. We prove that a weight-constrained version of the delayed-RNN is
equivalent to a stacked-RNN. We also show that the delay gives rise to partial
acausality, much like bidirectional networks. Synthetic experiments confirm
that the delayed-RNN can mimic bidirectional networks, solving some acausal
tasks similarly, and outperforming them in others. Moreover, we show similar
performance to bidirectional networks in a real-world natural language
processing task. These results suggest that delayed-RNNs can approximate
topologies including stacked RNNs, bidirectional RNNs, and stacked
bidirectional RNNs - but with equivalent or faster runtimes for the
delayed-RNNs.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11483"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Developing mathematical models of dynamic systems is central to many
disciplines of engineering and science. Models facilitate simulations, analysis
of the system's behavior, decision making and design of automatic control
algorithms. Even inherently model-free control techniques such as reinforcement
learning (RL) have been shown to benefit from the use of models, typically
learned online. Any model construction method must address the tradeoff between
the accuracy of the model and its complexity, which is difficult to strike. In
this paper, we propose to employ symbolic regression (SR) to construct
parsimonious process models described by analytic equations. We have equipped
our method with two different state-of-the-art SR algorithms which
automatically search for equations that fit the measured data: Single Node
Genetic Programming (SNGP) and Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP). In
addition to the standard problem formulation in the state-space domain, we show
how the method can also be applied to input-output models of the NARX
(nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input) type. We present the approach
on three simulated examples with up to 14-dimensional state space: an inverted
pendulum, a mobile robot, and a bipedal walking robot. A comparison with deep
neural networks and local linear regression shows that SR in most cases
outperforms these commonly used alternative methods. We demonstrate on a real
pendulum system that the analytic model found enables a RL controller to
successfully perform the swing-up task, based on a model constructed from only
100 data samples.

 &lt;p&gt;Phase synchronization measures are widely used for investigating inter-regional functional connectivity (FC) of brain oscillations, but which phase synchronization measure should be chosen for a given experiment remains unclear. Using neuromagnetic brain signals recorded from healthy participants during somatosensory stimuli, we compared the performance of four phase synchronization measures, imaginary part of phase-locking value, imaginary part of coherency (ImCoh), phase lag index and weighted phase lag index (wPLI), for detecting stimulus-induced FCs between the contralateral primary and ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortices. The analyses revealed that ImCoh exhibited the best performance for detecting stimulus-induced FCs, followed by the wPLI. We found that amplitude weighting, which is related to computing both ImCoh and wPLI, effectively attenuated the influence of noise contamination. A simulation study modeling noise-contaminated periodograms replicated these findings. The present results suggest that the amplitude-dependent measures, ImCoh followed by wPLI, may have the advantage in detecting stimulus-induced FCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique able to modulate cortical excitability. This modulation may influence areas and networks responsible for specific cognitive processes, and the repetition of the induced temporary changes can produce long-lasting effects. TMS effectiveness may be enhanced when used in conjunction with cognitive training focused on specific cognitive functions. Playing video games can be an optimal cognitive training since it involves different cognitive components and high levels of engagement and motivation. The goal of this study is to assess the synergistic effects of TMS and video game training to enhance cognition, specifically, working memory and executive functions. We conducted a randomized 2 × 3 repeated measures (stimulation × time) study, randomly assigning 27 healthy volunteers to an active intermittent theta-burst stimulation or a sham stimulation group. Participants were assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery before, immediately after, and 15 days after finishing the video game+TMS training. The training consisted of 10 sessions where participants played a 3D platform video game for 1.5 h. After each gaming session, TMS was applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). All participants improved their video gaming performance, but we did not find a synergistic effect of stimulation and video game training. Neither had we found cognitive improvements related to the stimulation. We explored possible confounding variables such as age, gender, and early video gaming experience through linear regression. The early video gaming experience was related to improvements in working memory and inhibitory control. This result, although exploratory, highlights the influence of individual variables and previous experiences on brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists are fond of talking about brain systems for the processing of “what” and “where” information about objects and their locations. What is critically missing is the concept of a “who” system dedicated to the neural processing of information about social agents—both the self and others—and their interactions. I propose here the characterization of such a system, one that functions not only in perception but in production as well, such as when recounting stories about oneself and others. The most human-specific features of the “who” system are two complementary systems that I refer to as the other-as-self mechanism and the self-as-other mechanism. The major function of the other-as-self mechanism is to perceive other people egocentrically as proxies of the self, as occurs through the processes of mentalizing and empathizing in both everyday life and in the experience of the theatrical and literary arts. The major function of the self-as-other mechanism is to overtly depict other people during acts of communication through vocal and gestural processes of mimicry, such as occurs during quotation in conversation and through acting in the theatrical arts. Overall, the “who” system of the human brain mediates both perceptual and behavioral aspects of social cognition, and establishes the existential distinction between self and other in human cognition. I present neural models for the instantiation of the “who” system in the human brain and conclude with a discussion of how narrative serves as a foundation for human cognition more generally, what I refer to as narrative-based cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Pain is one of the most significant causes of suffering and disability world-wide, and arguably the most burdensome global health challenge. The growing number of patients suffering from chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, migraine and irritable bowel syndrome, not only reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of pain types, but also our lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have emerged as viable targets for effective chronic pain therapy. However, DRG’s contain different classes of primary sensory neurons including pain-associated nociceptive neurons, non-nociceptive temperature sensing, mechanosensory and chemoreceptive neurons, as well as multiple types of immune and endothelial cells. This cell-population heterogeneity makes investigations of individual subgroups of DRG neurons, such as nociceptors, difficult. In attempts to overcome some of these difficulties, a limited number of immortalized DRG-derived cell lines have been generated over the past few decades. In vitro experiments using DRG-derived cell lines have been useful in understanding sensory neuron function. In addition to retaining phenotypic similarities to primary cultured DRG neurons, these cells offer greater suitability for high throughput assays due to ease of culture, maintenance, growth efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For accurate interpretation and translation of results it is critical, however, that phenotypic similarities and differences of DRG-derived cells lines are methodically compared to native neurons. Published reports to date show notable variability in how these DRG-derived cells are maintained and differentiated. Understanding the cellular and molecular differences stemming from different culture methods, is essential to validate past and future experiments, and enable these cells to be used to their full potential. This review describes currently available DRG-derived cell lines, their known sensory and nociceptor specific molecular profiles, and summarize their morphological features related to differentiation and neurite outgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Exercise may be the most commonly offered yet least consistently followed therapeutic advice for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Epidemiological studies of prospectively followed cohorts have shown a lower risk for later developing PD in healthy people who report moderate to high levels of physical activity, and slower rates of motor and non-motor symptom progression in people with PD who report higher baseline physical activity. In animal models of PD, exercise can reduce inflammation, decrease α-synuclein expression, reduce mitochondrial dysfunction, and increase neurotrophic growth factor expression. Randomized controlled trials of exercise in PD have provided clear evidence for short-term benefits on many PD measurements scales, ranging from disease severity to quality of life. In this review, we present these convergent epidemiological and laboratory data with particular attention to translationally relevant features of exercise (e.g., intensity requirements, gender differences, and associated biomarkers). In the context of these findings we will discuss clinical trial experience, design challenges, and emerging opportunities for determining whether exercise can prevent PD or slow its long-term progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Previously we showed that 31/1,032 (3%) asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCW) from a large teaching hospital in Cambridge UK tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in April 2020. 26/169 (15%) HCWs with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also tested positive (Rivett et al., 2020). Here we show that the proportion of both asymptomatic and symptomatic HCWs testing positive rapidly declined to near-zero between 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April and 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020, corresponding with a decline in patient admissions with COVID-19 during the ongoing UK 'lockdown'. These data demonstrate how infection prevention and control measures including staff testing may help prevent hospitals from becoming independent 'hubs' of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and illustrate how, with appropriate precautions, organisations in other sectors may be able to resume on-site work safely.</content>

 P bodies are archetypal biomolecular condensates that concentrate proteins and RNA without a surrounding membrane. While dozens of P body proteins are known, the concentrations of components in the compartment have not been measured. We used live cell imaging to generate a quantitative inventory of the major proteins in yeast P bodies. Only 7 proteins are highly concentrated in P bodies (5.1-15 uM); the 24 others examined are appreciably lower (most ≤ 2.6 uM). P body concentration correlates inversely with cytoplasmic exchange rate. Sequence elements driving Dcp2 concentration into P bodies are distributed across the protein and act synergistically. Our data indicate that P bodies, and probably other condensates, are compositionally simpler than suggested by proteomic analyses, with implications for specificity, reconstitution and evolution.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Adipocytes arise from distinct progenitor populations during development and adult, but little is known about how developmental progenitors differ from adult progenitors. Here, we investigate the role of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) in the divergent regulation of the two different adipose progenitor cells (APCs). Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; adipose lineage tracking and deletion mouse models, we found that developmental PDGFRα+ cells are adipogenic and differentiated into mature adipocytes, and the deletion of &lt;i&gt;Pdgfra&lt;/i&gt; in developmental adipose lineage disrupted white adipose tissue (WAT) formation. Interestingly, adult PDGFRα+ cells do not significantly contribute to adult adipogenesis, and deleting &lt;i&gt;Pdgfra&lt;/i&gt; in adult adipose lineage did not affect WAT homeostasis. Mechanistically, embryonic APCs require PDGFRα for fate maintenance, and without PDGFRα, they underwent fate change from adipogenic to fibrotic lineage. Collectively, our findings indicate that PDGFRα+ cells and &lt;i&gt;Pdgfra&lt;/i&gt; gene itself are differentially required for WAT development and adult WAT homeostasis.</content>

 Functional characterisation of cell-type specific regulatory networks is key to establish a causal link between genetic variation and phenotype. The osteoclast offers a unique model for interrogating the contribution of co-regulated genes to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; phenotype as its multinucleation and resorption activities determine quantifiable skeletal traits. Here we took advantage of a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-regulated gene network (MMnet, macrophage multinucleation network) which we found to be significantly enriched for GWAS variants associated with bone-related phenotypes. We found that the network hub gene &lt;i&gt;Bcat1&lt;/i&gt; and seven other co-regulated MMnet genes out of 13, regulate bone function. Specifically, global (&lt;i&gt;Pik3cb&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Atp8b2&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Igsf8&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eml1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Appl2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Deptor&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and myeloid-specific &lt;i&gt;Slc40a1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice displayed abnormal bone phenotypes. We report opposing effects of MMnet genes on bone mass in mice and osteoclast multinucleation/resorption in humans with strong correlation between the two. These results identify MMnet as a functionally conserved network that regulates osteoclast multinucleation and bone mass.</content>

 Layering has been a long-appreciated feature of higher order mammalian brain structures but the extent to which it plays an instructive role in synaptic specification remains unknown. Here we examine the formation of synaptic circuitry under cellular heterotopia in hippocampal CA1, using a mouse model of the human neurodevelopmental disorder Type I Lissencephaly. We identify calbindin-expressing principal cells which are mispositioned under cellular heterotopia. Ectopic calbindin-expressing principal cells develop relatively normal morphological features and stunted intrinsic physiological features. Regarding network development, a connectivity preference for cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons to target calbindin-expressing principal cells is diminished. Moreover, in vitro gamma oscillatory activity is less synchronous across heterotopic bands and mutants are less responsive to pharmacological inhibition of cholecystokinin-containing interneurons. This study will aid not only in our understanding of how cellular networks form but highlight vulnerable cellular circuit motifs that might be generalized across disease states.</content>

 SARS-CoV-2 is an unprecedented worldwide health problem that requires concerted and global approaches to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). Our results demonstrate that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication and production of infectious de-novo virus particles.</content>

 The acoustic startle response is an evolutionary conserved avoidance behavior. Disruptions in startle behavior, in particular startle magnitude, are a hallmark of several human neurological disorders.  While the neural circuitry underlying startle behavior has been studied extensively, the repertoire of genes and genetic pathways that regulate this locomotor behavior has not been explored using an unbiased genetic approach. To identify such genes, we took advantage of the stereotypic startle behavior in zebrafish larvae and performed a forward genetic screen coupled with whole genome analysis. This identified mutants in eight genes critical for startle behavior, including two genes encoding proteins associated with human neurological disorders, Dolichol kinase (Dolk), a broadly expressed regulator of the glycoprotein biosynthesis pathway, and the potassium Shaker-like channel subunit Kv1.1. We demonstrate that Kv1.1 acts independently of supraspinal inputs to regulate locomotion, suggesting its site of action is within spinal circuitry. Moreover, we show that Kv1.1 protein is mis-localized in dolk mutants, suggesting they act in a common genetic pathway to regulate movement magnitude. Combined, our results identify a diverse set of eight genes all associated with human disorders that regulate zebrafish startle behavior and reveal a previously unappreciated role for Dolk and Kv1.1 in regulating movement magnitude via a common genetic pathway.</content>

 The meaning of a word depends on its lexical semantics and on the context in which it is embedded. At the basis of this lays the distinction between lexical retrieval and integration, two basic operations supporting language comprehension. In this paper, we investigate how lexical retrieval and integration are implemented in the brain by comparing MEG activity to word representations generated by computational language models. We test both non-contextualized embeddings, representing words independently from their context, and contextualized embeddings, which instead integrate contextual information in their representations. Using representational similarity analysis over cortical regions and over time, we observed that brain activity in the left anterior temporal pole and inferior frontal regions shows higher similarity with contextualized word embeddings compared to non-contextualized embeddings,  between 300 and 500 ms after word presentation. On the other hand, non-contextualized word embeddings show higher similarity with brain activity in the left lateral and anterior temporal lobe at earlier latencies -- areas and latencies related to lexical retrieval. Our results highlight how lexical retrieval and context integration can be tracked in the brain using word embeddings obtained with computational models. These results also suggest that the distinction between lexical retrieval and integration might be framed in terms of context-independent and contextualized representations.</content>

 The human linguistic system is characterized by modality invariance and attention selectivity. Previous studies have examined these properties independently and reported perisylvian region involvement for both; however, their relationship and the linguistic information they harbor remain unknown. Participants were assessed by functional MRI, while spoken narratives (auditory) and written texts (visual) were presented, either separately or simultaneously. Participants were asked to attend to one stimulus when both were presented. We extracted phonemic and semantic features from these auditory and visual modalities, to train multiple, voxel-wise encoding models. Cross-modal examinations of the trained models revealed that perisylvian regions were associated with modality-invariant semantic representations. Attentional modulation was quantified by examining the modeling performance for attended and unattended conditions. We have determined that perisylvian regions exhibited attention selectivity. Both modality invariance and attention selectivity are both prominent in models that use semantic but not phonemic features. Modality invariance was significantly correlated with attention selectivity in some brain regions; however, we also identified cortical regions associated with only modality invariance or only attention selectivity. Thus, paying selective attention to a specific sensory input modality may regulate the semantic information that is partly processed in brain networks that are shared across modalities.</content>

 Larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an ideal organism to study color vision, as their eye possesses four types of cone photoreceptors, covering most of the visible range and into the UV [1,2]. Additionally, their entire eye and nervous system are accessible to imaging, given they are naturally transparent [3-5]. Relying on this advantage, recent research has found that, through a set of color specific horizontal, bipolar and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) [6-8], the eye then relays tetrachromatic information to several retino-recipient areas (RAs) [9,10]. The main RA is the optic tectum, receiving 97% of the RGC axons via the neuropil mass termed Arborization Field 10 (AF10) [11,12]. In this work, we aim to understand the processing of color signals at the interface between RGCs and their targets in the brain. We used 2-photon calcium imaging to separately measure the responses of RGCs and neurons in the dorsal brain to stimulation with four different colors in awake animals. We find that color information is widespread throughout the larval brain, with a large variety of color responses among RGCs, and an even greater diversity in their targets. Specific combinations of response types are localized to specific nuclei, but we observe no single color processing structure. In the main interface in this pathway, the connection between Arborization Field 10 and the tectum, we observe key elements of color processing such as enhanced signal decorrelation and improved decoding [13,14]. Finally, when presenting a richer set of stimuli, we identify parallel processing of color, motion and luminance information in the same cells/terminals, evidence of a rich color vision machinery in this small vertebrate brain.</content>

 The delayed match-to-sample task (DMS) is used to probe working memory (WM) across species. While the involvement of the PFC in this task has been established, limited information exists regarding the recruitment of broader circuitry, especially under the low- versus high- WM load. We sought to address this question by using a variable-delay operant DMS task. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained and tested to determine their baseline WM performance across all (0-24s) delays. Next, rats were tested in a single DMS test with either 0s or 24s fixed delay, to assess low-/high-load WM performance. c-Fos mRNA expression was quantified within cortical and subcortical regions and correlated with WM performance. High WM load upregulated overall c-Fos mRNA expression within the PrL, as well as within a subset of mGlu5+ cells, with load-dependent, local activation of protein kinase C as the proposed underlying molecular mechanism. The PrL activity negatively correlated with choice accuracy during high load WM performance. A broader circuitry, including several subcortical regions, was found to be activated under low and/or high load conditions. These findings highlight the role of mGlu5 and/or PKC dependent signaling within the PrL, and corresponding recruitment of subcortical regions during high-load WM performance.</content>

 Quantitative models of sensory encoding help reveal how neural systems process naturalistic stimuli. In the early visual system, standard models assume that a neuron linearly filters incoming stimuli through its receptive field, but artificial stimuli, such as reversing gratings, often reveal nonlinear spatial processing that is not compatible with linear receptive fields. To investigate whether nonlinear processing is relevant for natural stimulus encoding, we recorded spiking activity of ganglion cells in mouse retina under natural images. We found that linear receptive field models failed to fully capture activity for cells sensitive to fine spatial contrast and that nonlinearities acting in the receptive field center govern this spatial contrast sensitivity. We furthermore identified a ganglion cell type whose spatial nonlinearity makes it particularly sensitive to spatially homogeneous stimuli. Our work highlights receptive field nonlinearities as crucial components for understanding early sensory encoding in the context of natural stimuli.</content>

 A remarkable feature of the developing central nervous system is the generation of spontaneous network activity (SNA) at the onset of synaptogenesis. In the spinal cord (SC) of the mouse embryo, SNA occurs around the 12th embryonic day (E12.5) and involves a recurrent functional loop between motoneurons (MNs) and GABAergic interneurons. We previously showed that Renshaw cells (V1R), which constitute a functionally homogeneous population in the adult, are the first neurons enriched with GABA in the mouse embryonic lumbar SC. V1R make synaptic-like contacts with MNs and likely participate to the genesis of SNA. However, how electrophysiological intrinsic properties of V1R evolve during early development remains poorly understood. Here, using patch-clamp recordings, cluster analysis and biophysical modeling, we analyzed the mechanisms underlying the firing patterns of V1R between E11.5 and E16.5. This developmental period covers the initial phase of development of SC activity (E11.5-E14.5) when SNA is present, and a pivotal period (E14.5-E16.5) when locomotor-like activity emerges. We discovered that V1R can be subdivided into different clusters before E13.5 and that many cells are capable of sustaining repetitive firing or plateau potentials. These V1R then lose transiently this firing ability, which is later recovered at E16.5. This is in contrast to the classical developmental scheme, i.e. an increase of firing capability with time. Combining pharmacology and computational modeling, we showed that the firing patterns of embryonic V1R rely on the synergy between two opposing voltage-dependent currents, namely the slowly inactivating persistent sodium current and the delayed rectifier potassium current. These two currents are responsible for the repetitive firing of action potentials in a vast majority of neurons. Such a synergy is sufficient to explain the clustering of embryonic V1R and determines the developmental trajectories of the electrical phenotype. Taken together our findings reveal a simple mechanism that is at the core of the heterogeneity of firing patterns. Such a mechanism must be tuned later on to eventually achieve firing pattern homogeneity.</content>

 Tracking statistical regularities of the environment is important for shaping human behavior and perception. Evidence suggests that the brain learns environmental dependencies using Bayesian principles. However, much remains unknown about the employed algorithms, for somesthesis in particular. Here, we describe the cortical dynamics of the somatosensory learning system to investigate both the form of the generative model as well as its neural surprise signatures. Specifically, we recorded EEG data from 40 participants subjected to a somatosensory roving-stimulus paradigm and performed single-trial modeling across peri-stimulus time in both sensor and source space. Our Bayesian model selection procedure indicates that evoked potentials are best described by a non-hierarchical learning model that tracks transitions between observations using leaky integration. From around 70ms post-stimulus onset, secondary somatosensory cortices are found to represent confidence-corrected surprise as a measure of model inadequacy. Primary somatosensory cortex is found to encode Bayesian surprise, reflecting model updating, from around 140ms. As such, this dissociation indicates that early surprise signals may control subsequent model update rates. In sum, our findings support the hypothesis that early somatosensory processing reflects Bayesian perceptual learning and contribute to an understanding of its precise mechanisms.</content>

 In response to corpus callosum (CC) demyelination, subventricular zone-derived neural progenitors (SVZdNP) are mobilized and generate new myelinating oligodendrocytes. Here, we examine the putative immunomodulatory properties of endogenous SVZdNP during demyelination in the cuprizone model. We observed that SVZdNP density is higher in the lateral and rostral CC regions that show weaker demyelination and is inversely correlated with activated microglia density and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels. Single-cell RNA-sequencing further revealed CC areas with high SVZdNP mobilization are enriched in a microglial cell subpopulation with immunomodulatory signature. We identified ligand/receptor couple MFGE8 (milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-8)/integrin {beta}3 as a ligand/receptor couple implicated in SVZdNP/microglia dialog. MFGE8 is highly enriched in immature SVZdNP mobilized to the demyelinated CC and promotes myelin debris phagocytosis in vitro. Altogether these results demonstrate that beyond their cell replacement capacity endogenous progenitors display immunomodulatory properties highlighting a new role for endogenous SVZdNP in myelin regeneration.</content>

		<content type="html">
 alpha-Synuclein (a-Syn) is a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson s disease (PD). It is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds acidic phospholipids. Growing evidence supports a role for a-Syn in membrane trafficking, including, mechanisms of endocytosis and exocytosis, although the exact role of a-Syn in these mechanisms is currently unclear. Here we have investigated the role of a-Syn in membrane trafficking through its association with acidic phosphoinositides (PIPs), such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI3,4P2). Our results show that a-Syn colocalizes with PIP2 and the phosphorylated active form of the clathrin adaptor AP2 at clathrin-coated pits. Using endocytosis of transferrin, an indicator of clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME), we find that a-Syn involvement in endocytosis is specifically mediated through PI4,5P2 levels. We further show that the rate of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis is differentially affected by a-Syn mutations. In accord with their effects on PI4,5P2 levels at the plasma membrane, the PD associated E46K and A53T mutations further enhance SV endocytosis. However, neither A30P mutation, nor Lysine to Glutamic acid substitutions at the KTKEGV repeat domain of a-Syn, that interfere with phospholipid binding, affect SV endocytosis. This study provides evidence for a critical involvement of PIPs in a-Syn-mediated membrane trafficking.</content>

 Music listening plays a pivotal role for children and adolescents, yet surprisingly few neuroimaging studies have studied the underlying functional dynamics. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 17 preadolescents aged 10-11 years old while listening to music. We subsequently tracked the occurrence of functional brain networks over time by using a recent method that detects recurrent BOLD phase-locking states: the Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA). In particular, we compared the probabilities of occurrence and switching profiles of different patterns of BOLD phase-locking between music and no music. Moreover, we used an adapted version of the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (BMRQ) to measure the music reward sensitivity of the participants. Our results showed significantly increased occurrence of a BOLD phase-locking pattern during music listening compared to no music, characterized by a phase-shift in the BOLD signals of the medial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices - a brain subsystem associated to reward processing - from the rest of the brain. Moreover, we observed a significantly higher probability of switching to this pattern while listening to music. We also found a positive correlation between the individual musical reward sensitivity and the tendency to switch to this reward state during music. Our findings highlight the involvement of a brain subsystem involved in hedonic processing during music listening in the early adolescent brain. These results offer novel insight into the neural underpinnings of musical reward in early adolescence and may help us to understand the importance of music at this delicate age.</content>

 Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and is characterized by the death of retinal ganglion cells. Reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only therapeutic mechanism available to slow disease progression. However, glaucoma can continue to progress despite normalization of IOP. New treatments are needed to reduce vision loss and improve outcomes for patients who have exhausted existing therapeutic avenues. Recent studies have implicated neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases of both the retina and the brain, including glaucoma and Parkinson's disease. Pro-inflammatory A1 astrocytes contribute to neuronal cell death in multiple disease processes and have been targeted therapeutically in mouse models of Parkinson's disease. Microglial release of pro-inflammatory cytokines C1q, IL-1, and TNF- is sufficient to drive the formation of A1 astrocytes. The role of A1 astrocytes in glaucoma pathogenesis has not been explored. Using a mouse model of glaucoma, we demonstrated that IOP elevation was sufficient to trigger production of C1q, IL-1, and TNF- by infiltrating macrophages followed by resident microglia. These three cytokines drove the formation of A1 astrocytes in the retina. Furthermore, cytokine production and A1 astrocyte transformation persisted following IOP normalization. Ablation of this pathway, by either genetic deletions of C1q, IL-1, and TNF-, or treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist NLY01, reduced A1 astrocyte transformation and RGC death. Together, these results highlight a new neuroinflammatory mechanism behind glaucomatous neurodegeneration that can be therapeutically targeted by NLY01 administration.</content>

 Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a common health concern with significant social, psychological, and cognitive implications. Moderate levels of acoustic overstimulation associated with tinnitus and impaired speech perception cause cochlear synaptopathy, characterized physiologically by reduction in wave I of the suprathreshold auditory brainstem response (ABR) and reduced number of synapses between sensory hair cells and auditory neurons. The unfolded protein response (UPR), an endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway, has been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of NIHL as well as neurodegeneration and synaptic damage in the brain. In this study, we used the small molecule UPR modulator ISRIB (Integrated Stress Response InhiBitor) to treat noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy in a mouse model. Mice pretreated with ISRIB prior to noise-exposure were protected against noise-induced synapse loss. Male, but not female, mice also exhibited ISRIB-mediated protection against noise-induced suprathreshold ABR wave-I amplitude reduction. Female mice had higher baseline wave-I amplitudes but greater sensitivity to noise-induced wave-I reduction. Our results suggest that the UPR is implicated in noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy, and can be targeted for treatment.</content>

 It has been established that an overactive orexin (OX) system is associated with neurogenic hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). However, the chronology and mechanism of such association between orexin system and hypertension is unclear. We hypothesized that an aberrant surge of OX neurons in SHRs precedes the aberrant increase of arterial blood pressure (ABP) during postnatal development, which was primarily contributed by the exaggerated postnatal OX neurogenesis. We found that (1) SHRs experienced a greater surge in the number of orexin neurons than normotensive Wistar41 Kyoto (WKY) rats before P16, which led to significantly more OX neurons than age42 matched controls by P15-16 (3680+/-219 vs 2407+/-182, respectively, P=0.002). (2) Exaggerated OX neurogenesis, marked by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), was the primary contributor to excessive OX neurons in SHRs during development. (3) In contrast, SHRs and normotensive control rats have similar mean arterial blood pressure (ABP) at P15, and a significantly higher ABP in SHR than WKY emerges at P20 (74.8 +/- 2.5 vs 66.9 +/- 4.4 mmHg in wakefulness, respectively, P&amp;lt;0.05), a few days following the surge of OX activity. (4) Selectively eliminating excess (~30%) orexin neurons, via a targeted neurotoxin, in SHRs between P30 and P40 results in a significantly lowered ABP compared to non-lesioned SHRs at P40. We suggest that the postnatal surge of OX neurons, primarily attributed to the exaggerated postnatal OX neurogenesis, may be necessary for the development of higher ABP in SHRs, and modulation of the overactive OX system may have a preventative effect during the pre-hypertensive period.</content>

 Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina, allow us to perceive our visual environment. RGCs respond to rod/cone input through the retinal circuitry, however, a small population of RGCs are in addition intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and project to unique targets in the brain to modulate a broad range of subconscious visual behaviors such as pupil constriction and circadian photoentrainment. Despite the discovery of ipRGCs nearly two decades ago, there is still little information about how or if conventional RGCs (non-ipRGCs) target ipRGC-recipient nuclei to influence subconscious visual behavior. Using a dual recombinase color strategy, we showed that conventional RGCs innervate many subconscious ipRGC-recipient nuclei, apart from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We revealed previously unrecognized stratification patterns of retinal innervation from ipRGCs and conventional RGCs in the ventral portion of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Further, we found that the percent innervation of ipRGCs and conventional RGCs across ipsi- and contralateral nuclei differ. Our data provide a blueprint to understand how conventional RGCs and ipRGCs innervate different brain regions to influence subconscious visual behaviors.</content>

 Team flow occurs when a group of people reaches high task engagement while sharing a common goal as in sports teams and music bands. While team flow is a superior enjoyable experience to individuals experiencing flow or regular socialization, the neural basis for such superiority is still unclear. Here, we addressed this question utilizing a music rhythm task and electroencephalogram hyper-scanning. Experimental manipulations held the motor task constant while disrupted the hedonic musical correspondence to blocking flow or occluded the partner's body and task feedback to block social interaction. The manipulations' effectiveness was confirmed using psychometric ratings and an objective measure for the depth of flow experience through the inhibition of the auditory-evoked potential to a task-irrelevant stimulus. Spectral power analysis revealed higher beta/gamma power specific to team flow at the left temporal cortex. Causal interaction analysis revealed that the left temporal cortex receives information from areas encoding individual flow or socialization. The left temporal cortex was also significantly involved in integrated information at both the intra- and inter-brains levels. Moreover, team flow resulted in enhanced global inter-brain integrated information and neural synchrony. Thus, our report presents neural evidence that team flow results in a distinct brain state and suggests a neurocognitive mechanism by which the brain creates this unique experience.</content>

 Underage alcohol drinking increases the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). In rodents, adolescent ethanol exposure augments ethanol consumption and anxiety-like behavior while reducing social interaction. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these adaptations are not understood. The dopamine and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) systems in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are implicated in affective disorders and AUD, with studies showing augmented KOR function and reduced dopamine transmission in ethanol-dependent adult animals. Thus, this study examined the impact of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure on dopamine transmissionand KOR function. Rats were exposed to water or ethanol (4 g/kg, intragastrically) every-other-day during early (PD25-45) or late (PD45-65) adolescence. While AIE exposure during early-mid adolescence (early AIE) did not alter dopamine release in male and female rats, AIE exposure during late adolescence (late AIE) resulted in greater dopamine release in males and lower dopamine release in females. To determine the impact of AIE exposure on KOR function, we bath applied cumulative concentrations of KOR agonist, U50,488 (0.01-1.0 uM), and measured its effects on dopamine release. Early AIE exposure potentiated KOR-mediated inhibition of dopamine release in female rats, while late AIE exposure attenuated this effect in male rats. Together these data suggest that AIE-exposure impact on neural processes is dependent on sex and exposure timing. These differences likely arise from differential developmental timing in males and females. This is the first study to show changes in KOR function following AIE exposure.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Understanding how one-shot learning can be accomplished through synaptic plasticity in neural networks of the brain is a major open problem. We propose that approximations to BPTT in recurrent networks of spiking neurons (RSNNs) such as e-prop cannot achieve this because their local synaptic plasticity is gated by learning signals that are rather ad hoc from a biological perspective: Random projections of instantaneously arising losses at the network outputs, analogously as in Broadcast Alignment for feedforward networks. In contrast, synaptic plasticity is gated in the brain by learning signals such as dopamine, which are emitted by specialized brain areas, e.g. VTA. These brain areas have arguably been optimized by evolution to gate synaptic plasticity in such a way that fast learning of survival-relevant tasks is enabled. We found that a corresponding model architecture, where learning signals are emitted by a separate RSNN that is optimized to facilitate fast learning, enables one-shot learning via local synaptic plasticity in RSNNs for large families of learning tasks. The same learning approach also supports fast spike-based learning of posterior probabilities of potential input sources, thereby providing a new basis for probabilistic reasoning in RSNNs. Our new learning approach also solves an open problem in neuromorphic engineering, where on-chip one-shot learning capability is highly desirable for spike-based neuromorphic devices, but could so far not be achieved. Our method can easily be mapped into neuromorphic hardware, and thereby solves this problem.</content>

 A remarkable molecular and functional heterogeneity of the primary sensory neurons and dorsal horn interneurons transmits pain- and or itch-relevant information, but the molecular signature of the projection neurons that convey the messages to the brain is unclear. Here, using retro-TRAP (translating ribosome affinity purification) and RNA-seq we reveal extensive molecular diversity of spino- and trigeminoparabrachial projection neurons, which to date are almost exclusively defined by their expression of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R). Among the many genes identified, we highlight distinct subsets of Cck+, Nptx2+, Nmb+, and Crh+ expressing projection neurons. By combining in situ hybridization of retrogradely labeled neurons with Fos-based assays we also demonstrate significant functional heterogeneity, including both convergence and segregation of pain- and itch-provoking inputs onto molecularly diverse subsets of NK1R- and non-NK1R-expressing projection neurons. The current study provides the first comprehensive investigation into the molecular profiles and functional properties of projection neuron subtypes.</content>

 Impaired memory is a hallmark of prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Prior knowledge associated with the memoranda has proved to have a powerful effect on memory in healthy subjects. Yet, barely nothing is known about its effect in early AD. We used functional MRI to ask whether prior knowledge enhanced memory encoding in early AD and whether the nature of prior knowledge mattered. Early AD patients and healthy controls underwent a task-based fMRI experiment, being scanned while learning face-scene associations. Famous faces carried Pre-Experimental Knowledge (PEK) while unknown faces repeatedly familiarized prior to learning carried Experimental Knowledge (EK). As expected, PEK increased subsequent memory in healthy elderly. However, patients did not benefit from PEK. Partly non-overlapping brain networks supported PEK vs. EK encoding in healthy controls. Patients displayed impaired activation in a right subhippocampal region where activity predicted successful associative memory formation of PEK stimuli. These findings call for a thorough consideration of how prior knowledge impacts learning and suggest a possible underestimation of the extent of associative memory impairment in early AD.</content>

Centriolar satellites are dynamic, membraneless granules composed of over 200 proteins. They store, modify, and traffic centrosome and primary cilium proteins, and help to regulate both the biogenesis and some functions of centrosomes and cilium. In most cell types, satellites cluster around the perinuclear centrosome, but their integrity and cellular distribution are dynamically remodeled in response to different stimuli, such as cell cycle cues. Dissecting the specific and temporal functions and mechanisms of satellites and how these are influenced by their cellular positioning and dynamics has been challenging using genetic approaches, particularly in ciliated and proliferating cells. To address this, we developed a chemical-based trafficking assay to rapidly and efficiently redistribute satellites to either the cell periphery or center, and fuse them into stable clusters in a temporally controlled way. Induced satellite clustering at either the periphery or center resulted in antagonistic changes in the pericentrosomal levels of a subset of proteins, revealing a direct and selective role for their positioning in protein targeting and sequestration. Systematic analysis of the interactome of peripheral satellite clusters revealed enrichment of proteins implicated in cilium biogenesis and mitosis. Importantly, induction of peripheral satellite targeting in ciliated cells revealed a function for satellites not just for efficient cilium assembly but also in the maintenance of steady-state cilia and in cilia disassembly by regulating the structural integrity of the ciliary axoneme. Finally, perturbing satellite distribution and dynamics inhibited their mitotic dissolution, and mitotic progression was perturbed only in cells with centrosomal satellite clustering. Collectively, our results for the first time showed a direct link between satellite functions and their pericentrosomal clustering, suggested new mechanisms underlying satellite functions during cilium assembly, and provided a new tool for probing temporal satellite functions in different contexts&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/as_vmQeA6ks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic of the temporal correlations between brain areas, called functional connectivity (FC), undergoes complex transformations through the life span. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of these changes in the nonpathological brain from fetal life to advanced age. After a brief description of the main methods, we propose that FC development can be divided into four main phases: first, before birth, a strong change in FC leads to the emergence of functional proto‐networks, involving mainly within network short‐range connections. Then, during the first years of life, there is a strong widespread organization of networks which starts with segregation processes followed by a continuous increase in integration. Thereafter, from adolescence to early adulthood, a refinement of existing networks in the brain occurs, characterized by an increase in integrative processes until about 40 years. Middle age constitutes a pivotal period associated with an inversion of the functional brain trajectories with a decrease in segregation process in conjunction to a large‐scale reorganization of between network connections. Studies suggest that these processes are in line with the development of cognitive and sensory functions throughout life as well as their deterioration. During aging, results support the notion of dedifferentiation processes, which refer to the decrease in functional selectivity of the brain regions, resulting in more diffuse and less specialized FC, associated with the disruption of cognitive functions with age. The inversion of developmental processes during aging is in accordance with the developmental models of neuroanatomy for which the latest matured regions are the first to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Conditional and biased regeneration of cone photoreceptor types in the zebrafish retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4d4de5a9-a196-4a96-a4c8-916cae871fef/cne24933-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regenerative capacity of the zebrafish, and the stereotypic organization of its retinal cell populations, enable examination of the specificity by which retinal Müller glial cells replace neurons that are lost. Zebrafish have four cone types, with peak sensitivities to red, green, blue, and ultraviolet wavelengths. Using a targeted cell ablation approach, we found that Müller glia produced cones of all types when all cones, red cones and UV cones were ablated. In contrast, blue cone ablation largely failed to generate cones. The relative proportions of regenerated cells of each type depended on the cone types that were ablated, and was biased toward the major cone type that was lost.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in regenerative medicine is replacing cells lost through injury or disease. While significant progress has been made, much remains unknown about the accuracy of native regenerative programs in cell replacement. Here, we capitalized on the regenerative capacity and stereotypic retinal organization of zebrafish to determine the specificity with which retinal Müller glial cells replace lost neuronal cell types. By utilizing a targeted genetic ablation technique, we restricted death to all or to distinct cone photoreceptor types (red, blue, or UV‐sensitive cones), enabling us to compare the composition of cones that are regenerated. We found that Müller glia produce cones of all types upon nondiscriminate ablation of these photoreceptors, or upon selective ablation of red or UV cones. Pan‐ablation of cones led to regeneration of the various cone types in relative abundances that resembled those of nonablated controls, that is, red &amp;gt; green &amp;gt; UV ~ blue cones. Moreover, selective loss of red or UV cones biased production toward the cone type that was ablated. In contrast, ablation of blue cones alone largely failed to induce cone production at all, although it did induce cell division in Müller glia. The failure to produce cones upon selective elimination of blue cones may be due to their low abundance compared to other cone types. Alternatively, it may be that blue cone death alone does not trigger a change in progenitor competency to support cone genesis. Our findings add to the growing notion that cell replacement during regeneration does not perfectly mimic programs of cell generation during development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Amyloidosis is associated with thicker myelin and increased oligodendrogenesis in the adult mouse brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7ff1cdb7-bdb8-4881-9331-29b65c1b829f/jnr24672-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myelin structure is altered in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing a pathological variant of the human amyloid precursor protein (&lt;i&gt;APP&lt;sup&gt;SwInd&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;APP &lt;/i&gt; mice have longer paranodes, thicker myelin, and shorter nodes of Ranvier than wildtype mice by 3 months of age, however, total axon density and the proportion of axons that were myelinated was normal. Between 4 and 6 months of age, &lt;i&gt;APP &lt;/i&gt; mice have more new oligodendrocytes added to the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria, while total oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell density remained stable, suggesting that new oligodendrocytes may be produced to replace oligodendrocytes lost due to amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaque formation is associated with the focal death of oligodendrocytes and soluble amyloid β impairs the survival of oligodendrocytes in vitro. However, the response of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to early amyloid pathology remains unclear. To explore this, we performed a histological, electrophysiological, and behavioral characterization of transgenic mice expressing a pathological form of human &lt;i&gt;amyloid precursor protein &lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;APP &lt;/i&gt;), containing three single point mutations associated with the development of familial Alzheimer's disease (&lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;, also known as J20 mice). &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice had impaired survival from weaning, were hyperactive by 2 months of age, and developed amyloid plaques by 6 months of age, however, their spatial memory remained intact over this time course. Hippocampal OPC density was normal in P60‐P180 &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice and, by performing whole‐cell patch‐clamp electrophysiology, we found that their membrane properties, including their response to kainate (100 µM), were largely normal. However, by P100, the response of hippocampal OPCs to GABA was elevated in &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice. We also found that the nodes of Ranvier were shorter, the paranodes longer, and the myelin thicker for hippocampal axons in young adult &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice compared with wildtype littermates. Additionally, oligodendrogenesis was normal in young adulthood, but increased in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria of &lt;i&gt;PDGFB‐APP&lt;sup&gt;Sw.Ind&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice as pathology developed. As the new oligodendrocytes were not associated with a change in total oligodendrocyte number, these cells are likely required for cell replacement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine associations of molecular markers of brain insulin signaling with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognition, among older persons with or without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clinical‐pathologic study was derived from a community‐based cohort study, the Religious Orders Study. We studied 150 individuals (mean age‐at‐death =87 years, 48% women): 75 with and 75 without diabetes (matched by sex on age‐at‐death and education). Using ELISA, immunohistochemistry and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo &lt;/i&gt; stimulation of brain tissue with insulin, we assessed insulin signaling in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus cortex. Postmortem data documented AD neuropathology. Clinical evaluations documented cognitive function proximate‐to‐death, based on 17 neuropsychological tests. In adjusted regression analyses, we examined associations of brain insulin signaling with diabetes, AD and level of cognition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain IRS1 phosphorylation (pS&lt;sup&gt;307&lt;/sup&gt;IRS1 /total IRS1) and AKT phosphorylation (pT&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1 /total AKT1) were similar in persons with or without diabetes. AKT phosphorylation was associated with the global AD pathology score (&lt;i&gt;p = &lt;/i&gt; 0.001). In contrast, IRS1 phosphorylation was not associated with AD (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.536). No other associations of insulin signaling were found with the global AD score, including when using the &lt;i&gt;ex vivo &lt;/i&gt; brain insulin stimulation method. In secondary analyses, normalized pT&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1 was positively correlated with both the amyloid burden and tau tangle density, and no other associations of brain insulin signaling with neuropathology were observed. Moreover, normalized pT&lt;sup&gt;308&lt;/sup&gt;AKT1 was associated with a lower level of global cognitive function (estimate = −0.212, SE = 0.097; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.031).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain AKT phosphorylation, a critical node in the signaling of insulin and other growth factors, is associated with AD neuropathology and lower cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hitherto undescribed phenotype of early onset muscular dystrophy associated with sensorineural hearing loss and primary ovarian insufficiency was initially identified in 2 siblings and in subsequent patients with a similar constellation of findings. The goal of this study was to understand the genetic and molecular etiology of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied whole exome sequencing (WES) superimposed on shared haplotype regions to identify the initial biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; followed by &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; Sanger sequencing or WES in 5 additional families with the same phenotype. Molecular modeling, biochemical analysis, laser membrane injury assay, and the generation of a Y259C knock‐in mouse were done.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 11 patients in 6 families carrying 5 different biallelic pathogenic variants in specific domains of &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; were identified. &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; encodes geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase in the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway, which catalyzes the synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, the lipid precursor of geranylgeranylated proteins including small guanosine triphosphatases. In addition to proximal weakness, all but one patient presented with congenital sensorineural hearing loss, and all postpubertal females had primary ovarian insufficiency. Muscle histology was dystrophic, with ultrastructural evidence of autophagic material and large mitochondria in the most severe cases. There was delayed membrane healing after laser injury in patient‐derived myogenic cells, and a knock‐in mouse of one of the mutations (Y259C) resulted in prenatal lethality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of specific &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; mutations defines the cause of a unique form of muscular dystrophy with hearing loss and ovarian insufficiency and points to a novel pathway for this clinical constellation. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Prosomeric mappings of &lt;i&gt;Dlx5 &lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;6‐LacZ &lt;/i&gt; expression plus relevant gene/protein markers delineated genoarchitectural subdivisions of the adult mouse prethalamus, identified boundaries with hypothalamus, thalamus, and underlying tegmental field, and produced an advanced morphologic model of the mammalian prethalamus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present here a thorough and complete analysis of mouse P0‐P140 prethalamic histogenetic subdivisions and corresponding nuclear derivatives, in the context of local tract landmarks. The study used as fundamental material brains from a transgenic mouse line that expresses &lt;i&gt;LacZ &lt;/i&gt; under the control of an intragenic enhancer of &lt;i&gt;Dlx5 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dlx6 &lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dlx5 &lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;6‐LacZ &lt;/i&gt;). Subtle shadings of LacZ signal, jointly with pan‐DLX immunoreaction, and several other ancillary protein or RNA markers, including &lt;i&gt;Calb2 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nkx2.2 &lt;/i&gt; ISH (for the prethalamic eminence, and derivatives of the rostral zona limitans shell domain, respectively) were mapped across the prethalamus. The resulting model of the prethalamic region postulates tetrapartite rostrocaudal and dorsoventral subdivisions, as well as a tripartite radial stratification, each cell population showing a characteristic molecular profile. Some novel nuclei are proposed, and some instances of potential tangential cell migration were noted.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as markers of early multiple system atrophy (MSA) and to contrast findings to Lewy body synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;METHODS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a discovery cohort of well‐characterized early MSA patients (n = 24) and matched healthy controls (CON, n = 14) we utilized ELISA to measure NFL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF. We confirmed findings in a separate prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with early MSA (n = 38), Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 16), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), and CON subjects (n = 15).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;discovery cohort &lt;/i&gt;, NFL was markedly elevated in MSA patients with perfect separation from CON. ASyn‐PMCA was non‐reactive in all CON, while all MSA samples were positive. In the &lt;i&gt;confirmatory cohort &lt;/i&gt;, NFL again perfectly separated MSA from CON, and was significantly lower in PD and DLB compared to MSA. PMCA was again non‐reactive in all CON, and positive in all but 2 MSA cases. All PD and all but 2 DLB samples were also positive for αSyn aggregates but with markedly different reaction kinetics than MSA: aggregation occurred later but maximum fluorescence was higher, allowing for perfect separation of reactive samples between MSA and Lewy body synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFL and αSyn oligomers in CSF faithfully differentiate early MSA not only from CON but also from Lewy body synucleinopathies. The findings support the role of these markers as diagnostic biomarkers, and have important implications for understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been known that age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) is more common, more severe, and with an earlier onset in men compared to women. Even in the absence of confounding factors such as noise exposure, these sexdifferences in susceptibility to ARHL remain. In the last decade, insight into the pleiotrophic nature by which estrogen signaling can impact multiple signaling mechanisms to mediate downstream changes in gene expression and/or elicit rapid changes in cellular function has rapidly gathered pace, and a role for estrogen signaling in the biological pathways that confer neuroprotection is becoming undeniable. Here I review the evidence why we need to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) when investigating the etiology of ARHL. Loss of auditory function with aging is frequency‐specific and modulated by SABV. Evidence also suggests that differences in cochlear physiology between women and men are already present from birth. Understanding the molecular basis of these sex differences in ARHL will accelerate the development of precision medicine therapies for ARHL.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Direct arterial damage and neurovascular unit disruption by mechanical thrombectomy in a rat stroke model&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d80db5c3-99c5-4465-b96e-7d075819dde1/jnr24671-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that MT causes mechanical damage of vessel intima, as well as neutrophil, VEGF, and MMP9 upregulation, which results in NVU disruption leading to the increase of infarct volume and hemorrhagic complications in acute ischemic stroke, when combined with tPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke that could cause hemorrhagic complications. We aimed to evaluate the pathology of MT‐induced arterial damage and neurovascular unit (NVU) disruption in relation to tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA) injection for acute ischemic stroke. We induced transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in male SHR/Izm rats for 2 hr. This was followed by reperfusion with/without tPA (3 mg/kg) and “rough suture” insertion that mimicked MT once or thrice (MT1 or MT3). Compared with the control group, the tPA + MT3 group presented with an increase in the cerebral infarct and hemorrhage with severer IgG leakage. Moreover, structural damage reaching the tunica media was detected in the MT3 and tPA + MT3 groups. The tPA + MT3 group presented with increased matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP‐9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression with some MMP9‐positive cells expressing a neutrophil marker myeloperoxidase. Furthermore, basal lamina detachment from astrocyte foot processes was observed in the tPA + MT1 and tPA + MT3 groups. These findings suggest that MT causes direct arterial damage, as well as VEGF and MMP9 upregulation, which results in NVU disruption and hemorrhagic complications in acute ischemic stroke, especially when combined with tPA.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Most machine learning models for structured data encode the structural
knowledge of a node by leveraging simple aggregation functions (in neural
models, typically a weighted sum) of the information in the node's
neighbourhood. Nevertheless, the choice of simple context aggregation
functions, such as the sum, can be widely sub-optimal. In this work we
introduce a general approach to model aggregation of structural context
leveraging a tensor-based formulation. We show how the exponential growth in
the size of the parameter space can be controlled through an approximation
based on the Tucker tensor decomposition. This approximation allows limiting
the parameters space size, decoupling it from its strict relation with the size
of the hidden encoding space. By this means, we can effectively regulate the
trade-off between expressivity of the encoding, controlled by the hidden size,
computational complexity and model generalisation, influenced by
parameterisation. Finally, we introduce a new Tensorial Tree-LSTM derived as an
instance of our framework and we use it to experimentally assess our working
hypotheses on tree classification scenarios.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In this work we solve the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP). DVRP is a
modification of the Vehicle Routing Problem, in which the clients' requests
(cities) number and location might not be known at the beginning of the working
day Additionally, all requests must be served during one working day by a fleet
of vehicles with limited capacity. In this work we propose a Monte Carlo method
(MCTree), which directly approaches the dynamic nature of arriving requests in
the DVRP. The method is also hybridized (MCTree+PSO) with our previous
Two-Phase Multi-swarm Particle Swarm Optimization (2MPSO) algorithm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our method is based on two assumptions. First, that we know a bounding
rectangle of the area in which the requests might appear. Second, that the
initial requests' sizes and frequency of appearance are representative for the
yet unknown clients' requests. In order to solve the DVRP we divide the working
day into several time slices in which we solve a static problem. In our Monte
Carlo approach we randomly generate the unknown clients' requests with uniform
spatial distribution over the bounding rectangle and requests' sizes uniformly
sampled from the already known requests' sizes. The solution proposal is
constructed with the application of a clustering algorithm and a route
construction algorithm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MCTree method is tested on a well established set of benchmarks proposed
by Kilby et al. and is compared with the results achieved by applying our
previous 2MPSO algorithm and other literature results. The proposed MCTree
approach achieves a better time to quality trade-off then plain heuristic
algorithms. Moreover, a hybrid MCTree+PSO approach achieves better time to
quality trade-off then 2MPSO for small optimization time limits, making the
hybrid a good candidate for handling real world scale goods delivery problems.

 &lt;p&gt;We theoretically analyse the limits of robustness to test-time adversarial
and noisy examples in classification. Our work focuses on deriving bounds which
uniformly apply to all classifiers (i.e all measurable functions from features
to labels) for a given problem. Our contributions are three-fold. (1) In the
classical framework of adversarial attacks, we use optimal transport theory to
derive variational formulae for the Bayes-optimal error a classifier can make
on a given classification problem, subject to adversarial attacks. We also
propose a simple algorithm for computing the corresponding universal (i.e
classifier-independent) adversarial attacks, based on maximal matching on
bipartite graphs. (2) We derive explicit lower-bounds on the Bayes-optimal
error in the case of the popular distance-based attacks. These bounds are
universal in the sense that they depend on the geometry of the
class-conditional distributions of the data, but not on a particular
classifier. This is in contrast with the existing literature, wherein
adversarial vulnerability of classifiers is derived as a consequence of nonzero
ordinary test error. (3) For our third contribution, we study robustness to
random noise corruption, wherein the attacker (or nature) is allowed to inject
random noise into examples at test time. We establish nonlinear data-processing
inequalities induced by such corruptions, and use them to obtain lower-bounds
on the Bayes-optimal error.

 &lt;p&gt;Recent research in the field of spiking neural networks (SNNs) has shown that
recurrent variants of SNNs, namely long short-term SNNs (LSNNs), can be trained
via error gradients just as effective as LSTMs. The underlying learning method
(e-prop) is based on a formalization of eligibility traces applied to leaky
integrate and fire (LIF) neurons. Here, we show that the proposed approach
cannot fully unfold spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). As a consequence,
this limits in principle the inherent advantage of SNNs, that is, the potential
to develop codes that rely on precise relative spike timings. We show that
STDP-aware synaptic gradients naturally emerge within the eligibility equations
of e-prop when derived for a slightly more complex spiking neuron model, here
at the example of the Izhikevich model. We also present a simple extension of
the LIF model that provides similar gradients. In a simple experiment we
demonstrate that the STDP-aware LIF neurons can learn precise spike timings
from an e-prop-based gradient signal.

 &lt;p&gt;Though effective in the segmentation, conventional multilevel thresholding
methods are computationally expensive as exhaustive search are used for optimal
thresholds to optimize the objective functions. To overcome this problem,
population-based metaheuristic algorithms are widely used to improve the
searching capacity. In this paper, we improve a popular metaheuristic called
cuckoo search using a ring topology based fully informed strategy. In this
strategy, each individual in the population learns from its neighborhoods to
improve the cooperation of the population and the learning efficiency. Best
solution or best fitness value can be obtained from the initial random
threshold values, whose quality is evaluated by the correlation function.
Experimental results have been examined on various numbers of thresholds. The
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more accurate and efficient
than other four popular methods.

 &lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the third generation NNs, have come under the
spotlight for machine learning based applications due to their biological
plausibility and reduced complexity compared to traditional artificial Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs). These SNNs can be implemented with extreme energy
efficiency on neuromorphic processors like the Intel Loihi research chip, and
fed by event-based sensors, such as DVS cameras. However, DNNs with many layers
can achieve relatively high accuracy on image classification and recognition
tasks, as the research on learning rules for SNNs for real-world applications
is still not mature. The accuracy results for SNNs are typically obtained
either by converting the trained DNNs into SNNs, or by directly designing and
training SNNs in the spiking domain. Towards the conversion from a DNN to an
SNN, we perform a comprehensive analysis of such process, specifically designed
for Intel Loihi, showing our methodology for the design of an SNN that achieves
nearly the same accuracy results as its corresponding DNN. Towards the usage of
the event-based sensors, we design a pre-processing method, evaluated for the
DvsGesture dataset, which makes it possible to be used in the DNN domain.
Hence, based on the outcome of the first analysis, we train a DNN for the
pre-processed DvsGesture dataset, and convert it into the spike domain for its
deployment on Intel Loihi, which enables real-time gesture recognition. The
results show that our SNN achieves 89.64% classification accuracy and occupies
only 37 Loihi cores.

 &lt;p&gt;In the past decade, advances in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have
allowed them to perform extremely well for a wide range of tasks. In fact, they
have reached human parity when performing image recognition, for example.
Unfortunately, the accuracy of these ANNs comes at the expense of a large
number of cache and/or memory accesses and compute operations. Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs), a type of neuromorphic, or brain-inspired network, have
recently gained significant interest as power-efficient alternatives to ANNs,
because they are sparse, accessing very few weights, and typically only use
addition operations instead of the more power-intensive multiply-and-accumulate
(MAC) operations. The vast majority of neuromorphic hardware designs support
rate-encoded SNNs, where the information is encoded in spike rates.
Rate-encoded SNNs could be seen as inefficient as an encoding scheme because it
involves the transmission of a large number of spikes. A more efficient
encoding scheme, Time-To-First-Spike (TTFS) encoding, encodes information in
the relative time of arrival of spikes. While TTFS-encoded SNNs are more
efficient than rate-encoded SNNs, they have, up to now, performed poorly in
terms of accuracy compared to previous methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, in this work, we aim to overcome the limitations of TTFS-encoded
neuromorphic systems. To accomplish this, we propose: (1) a novel optimization
algorithm for TTFS-encoded SNNs converted from ANNs and (2) a novel hardware
accelerator for TTFS-encoded SNNs, with a scalable and low-power design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, our work in TTFS encoding and training improves the accuracy of SNNs
to achieve state-of-the-art results on MNIST MLPs, while reducing power
consumption by 1.29$\times$ over the state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware.

 &lt;p&gt;To more flexibly balance between exploration and exploitation, a new
meta-heuristic method based on Uncertainty Principle concepts is proposed in
this paper. UP is is proved effective in multiple branches of science. In the
branch of quantum mechanics, canonically conjugate observables such as position
and momentum cannot both be distinctly determined in any quantum state. In the
same manner, the branch of Spectral filtering design implies that a nonzero
function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. After
delving into such concepts on Uncertainty Principle and their variations in
quantum physics, Fourier analysis, and wavelet design, the proposed framework
is described in terms of algorithm and flowchart. Our proposed optimizer's idea
is based on an inherent uncertainty in performing local search versus global
solution search. A set of compatible metrics for each part of the framework is
proposed to derive preferred form of algorithm. Evaluations and comparisons at
the end of paper show competency and distinct capability of the algorithm over
some of the well-known and recently proposed metaheuristics.

 &lt;p&gt;We discuss a model of genome as a program with functional architecture and
consider the approach to Darwinian evolution as a learning problem for
functional programming. In particular we introduce a model of learning for some
class of functional programs. This approach is related to information geometry
-- the learning model uses some kind of distance in the information space (the

 &lt;p&gt;The dynamic characteristics of functional network connectivity have been
widely acknowledged and studied. Both shared and unique information has been
shown to be present in the connectomes. However, very little has been known
about whether and how this common pattern can predict the individual
variability of the brain, i.e. &quot;brain fingerprinting&quot;, which attempts to
reliably identify a particular individual from a pool of subjects. In this
paper, we propose to enhance the individual uniqueness based on an autoencoder
network. More specifically, we rely on the hypothesis that the common neural
activities shared across individuals may lessen individual discrimination. By
reducing contributions from shared activities, inter-subject variability can be
enhanced. Results show that that refined connectomes utilizing an autoencoder
with sparse dictionary learning can successfully distinguish one individual
from the remaining participants with reasonably high accuracy (up to 99:5% for
the rest-rest pair). Furthermore, high-level cognitive behavior (e.g., fluid
intelligence, executive function, and language comprehension) can also be
better predicted using refined functional connectivity profiles. As expected,
the high-order association cortices contributed more to both individual
discrimination and behavior prediction. The proposed approach provides a
promising way to enhance and leverage the individualized characteristics of
brain networks.

 &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent
seizures accompanied by excessive synchronous brain activity. The process of
structural and functional brain alterations leading to increased seizure
susceptibility and eventually spontaneous seizures is called epileptogenesis
(EPG) and can span months or even years. Detecting and monitoring the
progression of EPG could allow for targeted early interventions that could slow
down disease progression or even halt its development. Here, we propose an
approach for staging EPG using deep neural networks and identify potential
electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers to distinguish different phases of EPG.
Specifically, continuous intracranial EEG recordings were collected from a
rodent model where epilepsy is induced by electrical perforant pathway
stimulation (PPS). A deep neural network (DNN) is trained to distinguish EEG
signals from before stimulation (baseline), shortly after the PPS and long
after the PPS but before the first spontaneous seizure (FSS). Experimental
results show that our proposed method can classify EEG signals from the three
phases with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93, 0.89, and 0.86. To
the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful attempt to
stage EPG prior to the FSS using DNNs.

 &lt;p&gt;This paper tackles the age-old question of derivative free optimization in
neural networks. This paper introduces AdaSwarm, a novel derivative-free
optimizer to have similar or better performance to Adam but without
&quot;gradients&quot;. To support the AdaSwarm, a novel Particle Swarm Optimization
Exponentially weighted Momentum PSO (EM-PSO), a derivative-free optimizer, is
also proposed which tackles constrained and unconstrained single objective
optimization problems and looks at applying the proposed momentum particle
swarm optimization on benchmark test functions, engineering optimization
problems and habitability scores for exoplanets which show speed and
convergence of the technique. The EM-PSO is extended by approximating the
gradient of a function at any point using the parameters of the particle swarm
optimization. This is a novel technique to simulate gradient descent, an
extremely popular method in the back-propagation algorithm, using the
approximated gradients from the particle swarm optimization parameters.
Mathematical proofs of gradient approximation by EM-PSO, thereby bypassing the
gradient computation, are presented. The AdaSwarm is compared with various
optimizers and the theory and algorithmic performance are supported by
promising results.

 &lt;p&gt;Automated algorithm selection promises to support the user in the decisive
task of selecting a most suitable algorithm for a given problem. A common
component of these machine-trained techniques are regression models which
predict the performance of a given algorithm on a previously unseen problem
instance. In the context of numerical black-box optimization, such regression
models typically build on exploratory landscape analysis (ELA), which
quantifies several characteristics of the problem. These measures can be used
to train a supervised performance regression model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First steps towards ELA-based performance regression have been made in the
context of a fixed-target setting. In many applications, however, the user
needs to select an algorithm that performs best within a given budget of
function evaluations. Adopting this fixed-budget setting, we demonstrate that
it is possible to achieve high-quality performance predictions with
off-the-shelf supervised learning approaches, by suitably combining two
differently trained regression models. We test this approach on a very
challenging problem: algorithm selection on a portfolio of very similar
algorithms, which we choose from the family of modular CMA-ES algorithms.

 &lt;p&gt;The reliability redundancy allocation problem (RRAP) is a well-known tool in
system design, development, and management. The RRAP is always modeled as a
nonlinear mixed-integer non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard)
problem. To maximize the system reliability, the integer (component active
redundancy level) and real variables (component reliability) must be determined
to ensure that the cost limit and some nonlinear constraints are satisfied. In
this study, a bi-objective RRAP is formulated by changing the cost constraint
as a new goal, because it is necessary to balance the reliability and cost
impact for the entire system in practical applications. To solve the proposed
problem, a new simplified swarm optimization (SSO) with a penalty function, a
real one-type solution structure, a number-based self-adaptive new update
mechanism, a constrained nondominated-solution selection, and a new pBest
replacement policy is developed in terms of these structures selected from
full-factorial design to find the Pareto solutions efficiently and effectively.
The proposed SSO outperforms several metaheuristic state-of-the-art algorithms,
e.g., nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective
particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), according to experimental results for four
benchmark problems involving the bi-objective active RRAP.

 &lt;p&gt;Multi-Radio Multi-Channel Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have emerged as a
scalable, reliable, and agile wireless network that supports many types of
innovative technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicular
networks. Due to the limited number of orthogonal channels, interference
between channels adversely affects the fair distribution of bandwidth among
mesh clients, causing node starvation in terms of insufficient bandwidth, which
impedes the adoption of WMN as an efficient access technology. Therefore, a
fair channel assignment is crucial for the mesh clients to utilize the
available resources. However, the node starvation problem due to unfair channel
distribution has been vastly overlooked during channel assignment by the extant
research. Instead, existing channel assignment algorithms either reduce the
total network interference or maximize the total network throughput, which
neither guarantees a fair distribution of the channels nor eliminates node
starvation. To this end, the Fairness-Oriented Semi-Chaotic Genetic
Algorithm-Based Channel Assignment Technique (FA-SCGA-CAA) was proposed in this
paper for Nodes Starvation Problem in Wireless Mesh Networks. FA-SCGA-CAA
optimizes fairness based on multiple-criterion using a modified version of the
Genetic Algorithm (GA). The modification includes proposing a semi-chaotic
technique for creating the primary chromosome with powerful genes. Such a
chromosome was used to create a strong population that directs the search
towards the global minima in an effective and efficient way. The outcome is a
nonlinear fairness oriented fitness function that aims at maximizing the link
fairness while minimizing the link interference. Comparison with related work
shows that the proposed FA_SCGA_CAA reduced the potential nodes starvation by
22% and improved network capacity utilization by 23%.

 &lt;p&gt;Interest in biologically inspired alternatives to backpropagation is driven
by the desire to both advance connections between deep learning and
neuroscience and address backpropagation's shortcomings on tasks such as
online, continual learning. However, local synaptic learning rules like those
employed by the brain have so far failed to match the performance of
backpropagation in deep networks. In this study, we employ meta-learning to
discover networks that learn using feedback connections and local, biologically
inspired learning rules. Importantly, the feedback connections are not tied to
the feedforward weights, avoiding biologically implausible weight transport.
Our experiments show that meta-trained networks effectively use feedback
connections to perform online credit assignment in multi-layer architectures.
Surprisingly, this approach matches or exceeds a state-of-the-art
gradient-based online meta-learning algorithm on regression and classification
tasks, excelling in particular at continual learning. Analysis of the weight
updates employed by these models reveals that they differ qualitatively from
gradient descent in a way that reduces interference between updates. Our
results suggest the existence of a class of biologically plausible learning
mechanisms that not only match gradient descent-based learning, but also
overcome its limitations.

			<subtitle type="html">Nature Reviews Neuroscience is the leading review journal in the neurosciences. It publishes articles that review recent progress in brain and nervous system research. Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry. One of the unique features of Nature Reviews Neuroscience is its extraordinary breadth and depth of coverage. This very broad scope – from molecules to mind – captures the essence of modern neuroscience, and allows the journal to attract readers from all areas of this ever-expanding discipline.</subtitle>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder in which children present prefrontal cortex (PFC) related functions deficit. Proactive cognitive control is a process that anticipates the requirement of cognitive control and crucially depends on the maturity of the PFC. Since this process is important to ADHD symptomatology, we here test the hypothesis that children with ADHD have proactive cognitive control impairments and that these impairments are reflected in the PFC oscillatory activity. We recorded EEG signals from 29 male children with ADHD and 25 typically developing (TD) male children while they performed a Go-Nogo task, where the likelihood of a Nogo stimulus increased while a sequence of consecutive Go stimuli elapsed. TD children showed proactive cognitive control by increasing their reaction time (RT) concerning the number of preceding Go stimuli, whereas children with ADHD did not. This adaptation was related to modulations in both P3a potential and lateral prefrontal theta oscillation for TD children. Children with ADHD as a group did not demonstrate either P3a or theta modulation. But, individual variation in theta activity was correlated with the ADHD symptomatology. The results depict a neurobiological mechanism of proactive cognitive control impairments in children with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Functional diversification along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus is a rapidly growing concept. Modulation of synaptic transmission by neurotransmitter receptors may importantly contribute to specialization of local intrinsic network function along the hippocampus. In the present study, using transverse slices from the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus of adult rats and recordings of evoked field postsynaptic excitatory potentials (fEPSPs) from the CA1 stratum radiatum, we aimed to compare modulation of synaptic transmission between the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus. We found that transient heterosynaptic depression (tHSD, &amp;lt;2 s), a physiologically relevant phenomenon of regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission induced by paired stimulation of two independent inputs to stratum radiatum of CA1 field, has an increased magnitude and duration in the ventral hippocampus, presumably contributing to increased input segregation in this segment of the hippocampus. GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, adenosine A1 receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels appear to contribute differently to tHSD in the two hippocampal segments; GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs play a predominant role in the ventral hippocampus while both GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and A1Rs play important roles in the dorsal hippocampus. Activation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors by an exogenous agonist, baclofen, robustly and reversibly modulated both the initial fast and the late slow components of excitatory synaptic transmission, expressed by the fEPSPslope and fEPSP decay time constant (fEPSP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively. Specifically, baclofen suppressed fEPSP slope more in the ventral than in the dorsal hippocampus and enhanced fEPSP&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt; more in the dorsal than in the ventral hippocampus. Also, baclofen enhanced paired-pulse facilitation in the two hippocampal segments similarly. Blockade of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors did not affect basal paired-pulse facilitation in either hippocampal segment. We propose that the revealed dorsal-ventral differences in modulation of synaptic transmission may provide a means for specialization of information processing in the local neuronal circuits, thereby significantly contributing to diversifying neuronal network functioning along the dorsal-ventral axis of hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Acute central nervous system (CNS) disease is very common and with high mortality. Many basic studies have confirmed the molecular mechanism of early brain injury (EBI) after acute CNS disease. Neuron death and dysfunction are important reasons for the neurological dysfunction in patients with acute CNS disease. Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of cell death, the classical characteristic of which is based on the iron-dependent accumulation of toxic lipid reactive oxygen species. Previous studies have indicated that this mechanism is critical in the cell death events observed in many diseases, including cancer, tumor resistance, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Ferroptosis may also play a very important role in EBI after acute CNS disease. Unresolved issues include the relationship between ferroptosis and other forms of cell death after acute CNS disease, the specific molecular mechanisms of EBI, the strategies to activate or inhibit ferroptosis to achieve desirable attenuation of EBI, and the need to find new molecular markers of ferroptosis that can be used to detect and study this process in vivo after acute CNS disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Shortage of oxygen and nutrients in the brain induces the release of glutamate and ATP that can cause excitotoxicity and contribute to neuronal and glial damage. Our understanding of the mechanisms of ATP release and toxicity in cerebrovascular diseases is incomplete. This review aims at summarizing current knowledge about the participation of key elements in the ATP-mediated deleterious effects in these pathologies. This includes pannexin-1 hemichannels, calcium homeostasis modulator-1 (CALHM1), purinergic P2X7 receptors, and other intermediaries of CNS injury downstream of ATP release. Available data together with recent pharmacological developments in purinergic signaling may constitute a new opportunity to translate preclinical findings into more effective therapies in cerebrovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects substantia nigra dopamine neurons. Many studies have documented the role of oxidative stress and angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of PD. Metformin (MTF) is an antidiabetic medication and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulator that has shown antioxidant and antiangiogenic properties in many disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the neuroprotective effect of MTF in a mouse model of rotenone-prompted PD with a highlight on its influence on the AMPK/forkhead box transcription factor O3 (FOXO3) pathway and striatal angiogenesis. In the running study, PD was induced in mice using repeated doses of rotenone and concomitantly treated with MTF 100 or 200 mg/kg/day for 18 days. Rotarod and pole tests were used to examine the animals’ motor functionality. After that, animals were sacrificed, and brains were isolated and processed for immunohistochemical investigations or biochemical analyses. Oxidant stress and angiogenic markers were measured, including reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), hemoxygenase-1, thioredoxin, AMPK, FOXO3, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Results indicated that MTF improved animals’ motor function, improved striatal glutathione, Nrf2, hemoxygenase-1, and thioredoxin. Furthermore, MTF upregulated AMPK-FOXO3 proteins and reduced VEGF and cleaved caspase 3. MTF also increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)–stained neurons in the substantia nigra neurons and in striatal neuronal terminals. This study is the first to highlight that the neuroprotective role of MTF is mediated through activation of AMPK-FOXO3 signaling and inhibition of the proangiogenic factor, VEGF. Further studies are warranted to confirm this mechanism in other models of PD and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglial cells have emerged as crucial players in synaptic plasticity during development and adulthood, and also in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions. Here we found that decreased levels of Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2) deacetylase in microglia affects hippocampal synaptic plasticity under inflammatory conditions. The results show that long-term potentiation (LTP) magnitude recorded from hippocampal slices of wild type mice does not differ between those exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pro-inflammatory stimulus, or BSA. However, LTP recorded from hippocampal slices of microglial-specific Sirt2 deficient (Sirt2&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice was significantly impaired by LPS. Importantly, LTP values were restored by memantine, an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These results indicate that microglial Sirt2 prevents NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity in hippocampal slices in response to an inflammatory signal such as LPS. Overall, our data suggest a key-protective role for microglial Sirt2 in mnesic deficits associated with neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Improving the clinical translation of animal-based neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) therapies to humans requires an understanding of intrinsic human and animal cell characteristics. We report a novel in vitro method to assess spinal cord NSPCs from a small (rodent) and large (porcine) animal model in comparison to human NSPCs. To extract live adult human, porcine, and rodent spinal cord tissue, we illustrate a strategy using an anterior or posterior approach that was simulated in a porcine model. The initial expansion of primary NSPCs is carried out using the neurosphere assay followed by a pharmacological treatment phase during which NSPCs derived from humans, porcines, and rodents are assessed in parallel using the same defined parameters. Using this model, NSPCs from all species demonstrated multi-lineage differentiation and self-renewal. Importantly, these methods provide conditions to enable the direct comparison of species-dependent cell behavior in response to specific exogenous signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with no definite treatment. The expression of miR-29 family is significantly reduced in AD, suggesting a part for the family members in pathogenesis of the disease. The recent emergence of microRNA (miRNA)–based therapeutic approaches is emphasized on the efficiency of miRNA transfer to target cells. The endogenously made secretory vesicles could provide a biological vehicle for drug delivery. Characteristics such as small sizes, the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, the specificity in binding to the right target cells, and most importantly the capacity to be engineered as drug carriers have made exosomes desirable vehicles to deliver genetic materials to the central nervous system. Here, we transfected rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and HEK-293T cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) with recombinant expression vectors, carrying either mir-29a or mir-29b precursor sequences. A significant overexpression of miR-29 and downregulation of their targets genes, BACE1 (β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) and BIM [Bcl−2 interacting mediator of cell death (BCL2-like 11)], were confirmed in the transfected cells. Then, we confirmed the packaging of miR-29 in exosomes secreted from the transfected cells. Finally, we investigated a possible therapeutic effect of the engineered exosomes to reduce the pathological effects of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in a rat model of AD. Aβ–treated model rats showed some deficits in spatial learning and memory. However, in animals injected with miR-29–containing exosomes at CA1 (cornu ammonis area), the aforementioned impairments were prevented. In conclusion, our findings provide a new approach for the packaging of miR-29 in exosomes and that the engineered exosomes might have a therapeutic potential in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep learning methods have shown their great capability of extracting high-level features from image and have been used for effective medical imaging classification recently. However, training samples of medical images are restricted by the amount of patients as well as medical ethics issues, making it hard to train the neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end three-dimensional (3D) attention-based residual neural network (ResNet) architecture to classify different subtypes of subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) with single-shot T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence. Our aim is to develop a convolutional neural network to provide a convenient and effective way to assist doctors in the diagnosis and early treatment of the different subtypes of SVCI. The experiment data in this paper are collected from 242 patients from the Neurology Department of Renji Hospital, including 78 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), 70 nonamnestic MCI (na-MCI), and 94 no cognitive impairment (NCI). The accuracy of our proposed model has reached 98.6% on a training set and 97.3% on a validation set. The test accuracy on an untrained testing set reaches 93.8% with robustness. Our proposed method can provide a convenient and effective way to assist doctors in the diagnosis and early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The restoration of sensory feedback in amputees plays a fundamental role in the prosthesis control and in the communication on the afferent channel between hand and brain. The literature shows that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be a promising non-invasive technique to elicit sensory feedback in amputees, especially in the lower limb through the phenomenon of apparent moving sensation (AMS). It consists of delivering a sensation that moves along a specific part of the body. This study proposes to use TENS to elicit tactile sensations and adopt AMS to reproduce moving sensations on the hand, such as those related to an object moving in the hand or slipping upward or downward. To this purpose, the developed experimental protocol consists of two phases: (i) the mapping of the evoked sensations and (ii) the generation of the AMS. In the latter phase, the pulse amplitude variation (PAV), the pulse width variation (PWV), and the interstimulus delay modulation (ISDM) methods were compared. For the comparative analysis, the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test with Bonferroni correction (P &amp;lt; 0.016) was carried out on the success rate and on the ranking of methods expressed by the subjects. Results from the mapping protocol show that the delivered sensations were mostly described by the subjects as almost natural and superficial tingling. Results from the AMS protocol show that, for each movement direction, the success rate of ISDM method is higher than that of PWV and PAV and significantly higher than that of PAV for the ulnar-median direction. It recreates an AMS in the hand that effectively allows discriminating the type of sensation and distinguishing the movement direction. Moreover, ISDM was ranked by the subjects as the favorite method for recreating a well-defined and comfortable moving sensation only in the median-ulnar direction. For the ranking results, there was not a statistically significant difference among the methods. The experiments confirmed the good potential of recreating an AMS in the hand through TENS. This encourages to push forward this study on amputees and integrate it in the closed-loop control of a prosthetic system, in order to enable full control of grasp stability and prevent the objects from slippage.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Mind-wandering is associated with switching our attention to internally directed thoughts and is by definition an intrinsic, self-generated cognitive function. Interestingly, previous research showed that it may be possible to modulate its propensity externally, with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting different regions in the default mode and executive control networks (ECNs). However, these studies used highly heterogeneous montages (targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), or both concurrently), often showed contradicting results, and in many cases failed to replicate. Our study aimed to establish whether tDCS of the default mode network (DMN), via targeting the right IPL alone, could modulate mind-wandering propensity using a within-subjects double-blind, counterbalanced design. Participants completed sustained attention to response task (SART) interspersed with thought-probes to capture their subjective reports of mind-wandering before and after receiving anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the right IPL (with the reference over the left cheek). We found evidence for the lack of an effect of stimulation on subjective reports of mind-wandering (JZS-BF&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.19), as well as on performance on the SART task (errors (JZS-BF&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.79) and reaction time (JZS-BF&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.94). Overall, we failed to replicate previous reports of successful modulations of mind-wandering propensity with tDCS over the IPL, instead of providing evidence in support of the lack of an effect. This and other recent unsuccessful replications call into question whether it is indeed possible to externally modulate spontaneous or self-generated cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The mammillary body (MB) has been thought to implement mnemonic functions. Although recent animal studies have revealed dissociable roles of the lateral and medial parts of the MB, the dissociable roles of the lateral/medial MB in the human brain is still unclear. Functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a unique opportunity to noninvasively inspect the intricate functional organization of the human MB with a high degree of spatial resolution. The present study divided the human MB into lateral and medial parts and examined their functional connectivity with the hippocampal formation, tegmental nuclei, and anterior thalamus. The subiculum of the hippocampal formation was more strongly connected with the medial part than with the lateral part of the MB, whereas the pre/parasubiculum was more strongly connected with the lateral part than with the medial part of the MB. The dorsal tegmental nucleus was connected more strongly with the lateral part of the MB, whereas the ventral tegmental nucleus showed an opposite pattern. The anterior thalamus was connected more strongly with the medial part of the MB. These results confirm the extant animal literature on the lateral/medial MB and provide evidence on the parallel but dissociable systems involving the MB that ascribe mnemonic and spatial-navigation functions to the medial and lateral MBs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: The vagus nerve plays an important role in the regulation of food intake. Modulating vagal activity via electrical stimulation (VNS) in patients and animal studies caused changes in food intake, energy metabolism, and body weight. However, the moderating impact of cognitive processes on VNS effects on eating behavior has not been investigated so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis: We hypothesized that transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) affects food intake by altering cognitive functions relevant to the processing of food-related information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Using a repeated-measurement design, we applied tVNS and a sham stimulation for 2 h on two different days in normal-weight subjects. We recorded standard scalp EEG while subjects watched food and object pictures presented in an oddball task. We analyzed the event-related potentials (ERPs) P1, P2, N2, and LPP and also examined the amount of consumed food and eating duration in a free-choice test meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significant differences between stimulations were observed for the P1, P2, and N2 amplitudes. However, we found no tVNS-dependent modulation of food intake nor a specific food-related stimulation effect on the ERPs. Further analyses revealed a negative relationship between P2 amplitude and food intake for the sham stimulation. Significant effects are additionally confirmed by Bayesian statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study demonstrates tVNS’ impact on visual processing. Since the effects were similar between food and object stimuli, a general effect on visual perceptual processing can be assumed. More detailed investigations of these effects and their relationship with food intake and metabolism seem reasonable for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is involved in odor discrimination, odor-associative multimodal memory, and neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders. It receives direct axonal projections from both olfactory bulb (OB) output neurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. However, the cellular targets in LEC receiving direct synaptic input from OB output neuron, the functional characteristics of these synapses, and whether or how dopamine (DA) modulates the OB-LEC pathway remain undetermined. We addressed these questions in the present study by combing optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches with four major findings: (1) selective activation of OB input elicited glutamate-mediated monosynaptic responses in all fan cells, the major output neurons in layer II of the LEC; (2) this excitatory synaptic transmission exhibited robust paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), a presynaptically derived short-term synaptic plasticity; (3) DA dramatically attenuated the strength of the OB input-fan cell synaptic transmission via activation of D1 receptors; and (4) DA altered the PPF of this transmission but neither intrinsic properties of postsynaptic neurons nor the kinetic profile of postsynaptic responses, suggesting that presynaptic mechanisms underlie the DA inhibitory actions. This study for the first time demonstrates the FCs in the LEC layer II as the postsynaptic target of direct OB input and characterizes DA modulation of the OB input-fan cell pathway. These findings set the foundation for future studies to examine the synaptic transmission from the OB output neuron axon terminals to other potential cell types in the LEC and to pinpoint the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying olfactory deficits associated with DA-relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder in which the striatum is the most affected brain region. Although a chronic inflammatory microglial reaction that amplifies disease progression has been described in HD patients, some murine models develop symptoms without inflammatory microglial activation. Thus, dysfunction of non-inflammatory microglial activity could also contribute to the early HD pathological process. Here, we show the involvement of microglia and particularly fractalkine signaling in the striatal synaptic dysfunction of R6/1 mice. We found reduced fractalkine gene expression and protein concentration in R6/1 striata from 8 to 20 weeks of age. Consistently, we also observed a down-regulation of fractalkine levels in the putamen of HD patients and in HD patient hiPSC-derived neurons. Automated cell morphology analysis showed a non-inflammatory ramified microglia in the striatum of R6/1 mice. However, we found increased PSD-95-positive puncta inside microglia, indicative of synaptic pruning, before HD motor symptoms start to manifest. Indeed, microglia appeared to be essential for striatal synaptic function, as the inhibition of microglial activity with minocycline impaired the induction of corticostriatal long-term depression (LTD) in wild-type mice. Notably, fractalkine administration restored impaired corticostriatal LTD in R6/1 mice. Our results unveil a role for fractalkine-dependent neuron-microglia interactions in the early striatal synaptic dysfunction characteristic of HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;While the proximal dentatothalamocortical tracts are considered pivotal in the occurrence of cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) after medulloblastoma resection, how the cerebellum participates in motor–speech networks through direct structural connectivity is still unclear. Via tractography, we provide evidence of cerebellar streamlines projecting into the left inferior frontal gyrus majorly connecting Broca’s complex and the bilateral Crus lobes. The streamlines, named Crus–Broca tracts, originated from the bilateral Crus lobes, synapsed onto the dentate nucleus, ascended into the superior cerebellar peduncle (where these streamlines were closely superior to the superior border of the supratonsillar cleft and the superolateral roof of the fourth ventricle), surprisingly bypassed the left red nucleus and the left thalamus, and ended at the subregions of Broca’s complex. The streamlines, named Broca–Crus tracts, originated from the subregions of Broca’s complex and ended predominantly at the right Crus lobes. If verified, the existence of these connections would support the notion of the bilateral cerebellums’ participation in motor–speech planning, and the anatomical relationship of Broca–Crus tracts with the supratonsillar cleft would merit consideration for further studies aimed at further elucidating CMS mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: We aimed to determine whether the combination of two parameters: (a) score of axial impairment and limb rigidity (SAILR) with (b) EEG global relative median power in the frequency range theta 4–8 Hz (GRMPT) predicted cognitive outcome in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) better than each of these measures alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 47 non-demented patients with PD were examined and re-examined after 3 years. At both time-points, the patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neurological assessment and EEG in eyes-closed resting-state condition. The results of cognitive tests were normalized and individually summarized to obtain a “global cognitive score” (GCS). Change of GCS was used to represent cognitive changes over time. GRMPT and SAILR was used for further analysis. Linear regression models were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: GRMPT and SAILR independently predicted cognitive change. Combination of GRMPT and SAILR improved the significance of the regression model as compared to using each of these measures alone. GRMPT and SAILR only slightly correlate between each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The combination of axial signs and rigidity with quantitative EEG improves early identification of patients with PD prone to severe cognitive decline. GRMPT and SAILR seem to reflect different disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance Combination of EEG and axial motor impairment assessment may be a valuable marker in the cognitive prognosis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 To reveal steps in the evolution of translation, we identified ciliates as a model with high coding capacity of the mitochondrial genome and characterized its mitoribosomes by cryo-EM. It revealed a 94-protein and 4-rRNA assembly with an additional protein mass of ~700 kDa on the small subunit, while the large subunit lacks 5S rRNA. The structure shows that the small subunit head is constrained, tRNA binding sites are formed by mitochondria-specific protein elements, conserved protein bS1 is excluded, and bacterial RNA polymerase binding site is blocked. We provide evidence for intrinsic protein targeting system through visualization of mitochondria-specific mL105 by the exit tunnel that would facilitate recruitment of a nascent polypeptide. Functional protein uS3m is encoded by three complementary genes from the nucleus and mitochondrion, establishing a link between genetic drift and mitochondrial translation. Finally, we reannotated nine open reading frames in the mitochondrial genome that code for mitoribosomal proteins.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Conspecific negative density dependence is ubiquitous and has long been recognized as an important factor favoring the coexistence of competing species at local scale. By contrast, a positive density-dependent growth rate is thought to favor species exclusion by inhibiting the growth of less competitive species. Yet, such conspecific positive density dependence often reduces extrinsic mortality (e.g. reduced predation), which favors species exclusion in the first place. Here, using a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, I show that this form of positive density dependence can favor the existence of equilibrium points characterized by species coexistence. Those equilibria are not globally stable, but allow the maintenance of species-rich communities in multispecies simulations. Therefore, conspecific positive density dependence does not necessarily favor species exclusion. On the contrary, some forms of conspecific positive density dependence may even help maintain species richness in natural communities. These results should stimulate further investigations into the precise mechanisms underlying density dependence.</content>

 Life relies on phenomena that range from changes in molecules that occur within nanoseconds to changes in populations that occur over millions of years. Researchers have developed a vast range of experimental techniques to analyze living systems, but a given technique usually only works over a limited range of length or time scales. Therefore, gaining a full understanding of a living system usually requires the integration of information obtained at multiple different scales by two or more techniques. This approach has undoubtedly led to a much better understanding of living systems but, equally, the staggering complexity of these systems, the sophistication and limitations of the techniques available in modern biology, and the need to use two or more techniques, can lead to persistent illusions of knowledge. Here, in an effort to make better use of the experimental techniques we have at our disposal, I propose a broad classification of techniques into six complementary approaches: perturbation, visualization, substitution, characterization, reconstitution, and simulation. Such a taxonomy might also help increase the reproducibility of inferences and improve peer review.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Primary cilia are sensory organelles crucial for cell signaling during development and organ homeostasis. Cilia arise from centrosomes and their formation and function is governed by numerous factors. Through our studies on Townes-Brocks Syndrome (TBS), a rare disease linked to abnormal cilia formation in human fibroblasts, we uncovered the leucine-zipper protein LUZP1 as an interactor of truncated SALL1, a dominantly-acting protein causing the disease. Using TurboID proximity labeling and pulldowns, we show that LUZP1 associates with factors linked to centrosome and actin filaments. Here, we show that LUZP1 is a cilia regulator. It localizes around the centrioles and to actin cytoskeleton. Loss of LUZP1 reduces F-actin levels, facilitates ciliogenesis and alters Sonic Hedgehog signaling, pointing to a key role in cytoskeleton-cilia interdependency. Truncated SALL1 increases the ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation of LUZP1. Together with other factors, alterations in LUZP1 may be contributing to TBS etiology.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The molecular roles of HOX transcriptional activity in human prostate epithelial cells remain unclear, impeding the implementation of new treatment strategies for cancer prevention and therapy. MEIS proteins are transcription factors that bind and direct HOX protein activity. MEIS proteins are putative tumor suppressors that are frequently silenced in aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Here we show that MEIS1 expression is sufficient to decrease proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo murine xenograft models. HOXB13 deletion demonstrates that the tumor-suppressive activity of MEIS1 is dependent on HOXB13. Integration of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data revealed direct and HOXB13-dependent regulation of proteoglycans including decorin (DCN) as a mechanism of MEIS1-driven tumor suppression. These results define and underscore the importance of MEIS1-HOXB13 transcriptional regulation in suppressing prostate cancer progression and provide a mechanistic framework for the investigation of HOXB13 mutants and oncogenic cofactors when MEIS1/2 are silenced.</content>

 Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a unique type of GABAergic interneuron that selectively innervate the axon initial segment (AIS) of excitatory pyramidal neurons; the subcellular domain where action potentials are initiated. The proper genesis and maturation of ChCs is critical for regulating neural ensemble firing in the neocortex throughout development and adulthood. Recently, genetic and molecular studies have shed new light on the complex innerworkings of ChCs in health and disease. This review presents an overview of recent studies on the developmental origins, migratory properties, and morphology of ChCs.</content>

The spread of drug resistance of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; parasites is a challenge towards malaria elimination. &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; has shown an early and severe drug resistance in comparison to &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; in various countries. In fact, &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; differs in its life cycle and treatment in various factors: development and duration of sexual parasite forms differ, symptoms severity are unequal, relapses present only in &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; cases and the Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is only mandatory in &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; cases. We compared the spread of drug resistance for both species through two compartmental models using ordinary differential equations. The model structure describes how sensitive and resistant parasite strains infect a human population treated with antimalarials. We found that an early transmission,i.e., before treatment and low effectiveness of drug coverage, supports the prevalence of sensitive parasites delaying the emergence of resistant &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt;. These results imply that earlier attention of both symptomatic cases and reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; are essential in controlling transmission but also accelerate the spread of drug resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HBlonqsj4cI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We show that logic computational circuits in gene regulatory networks arise from a fibration symmetry breaking in the network structure. From this idea we implement a constructive procedure that reveals a hierarchy of genetic circuits, ubiquitous across species, that are surprising analogues to the emblematic circuits of solid-state electronics: starting from the transistor and progressing to ring oscillators, current-mirror circuits to toggle switches and flip-flops. These canonical variants serve fundamental operations of synchronization and clocks (in their symmetric states) and memory storage (in their broken symmetry states). These conclusions introduce a theoretically principled strategy to search for computational building blocks in biological networks, and present a systematic route to design synthetic biological circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1KEJ3Quw1fY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Facial expressions are important for intentional display of emotions in social interaction. For people with severe paralysis, the ability to intentionally display emotions can be impaired. Current brain‐computer interfaces (BCIs) allow for linguistic communication but are cumbersome for expressing emotions. Here, we investigated the feasibility of a BCI to display emotions by decoding facial expressions. We used electrocorticographic recordings from the sensorimotor cortex of people with refractory epilepsy and classified 5 facial expressions, based on neural activity. The mean classification accuracy was 72%. This approach could be a promising avenue for development of BCI‐based solutions for fast communication of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The DSM-5 definition of autism spectrum disorders includes sensory issues and part of the sensory information that the brain continuously receives comes from kinesthetic reafference, in the form of self-generated motions, including those that the nervous systems produce at rest. Some of the movements that we self-generate are deliberate, while some occur spontaneously, consequentially following those that we can control. Yet, some motions occur involuntarily, largely beneath our awareness. We do not know much about involuntary motions across development, but these motions typically manifest during resting state in fMRI studies. Here we ask in a large data set from the Autism Brain Imaging Exchange repository, whether the stochastic signatures of variability in the involuntary motions of the head typically shift with age. We further ask if those motions registered from individuals with autism show a significant departure from the normative data as we examine different age groups selected at random from cross-sections of the population. We find significant shifts in statistical features of typical levels of involuntary head motions for different age groups. Further, we find that in autism these changes also manifest in non-uniform ways, and that they significantly differ from their age-matched groups. The results suggest that the levels of random involuntary motor noise are elevated in autism across age groups. This calls for the use of different age-appropriate statistical models in research that involves dynamically changing signals self-generated by the nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent progress in tissue engineering has led to increasingly complex approaches to investigate human neurodegenerative diseases in vitro, such as Alzheimer’s disease, aiming to provide more functional and physiological models for the study of their pathogenesis, and possibly the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical and retinal organoids represent a novel class of in vitro three-dimensional models capable to recapitulate with a high similarity the structure and the complexity of the native brain and retinal tissues, thus providing a framework for better mimicking in a dish the patient’s disease features. This review aims to discuss progress made over the years in the field of in vitro three-dimensional cell culture systems, and the benefits and disadvantages related to a possible application of organoids for the study of neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer’s disease, providing a promising breakthrough toward a personalized medicine approach and the reduction in the use of humanized animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and at the cellular level by the formation of Lewy bodies in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the onset of the disease is believed to be localized to peripheral organs, particularly the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the olfactory bulb sooner before neuropathological changes occur in the CNS. Patients already in the pre-motor stage of PD suffer from various digestive problems and/or due to significant changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiome in this early stage of the disease. Detailed analyses of patient biopsies and autopsies as well as animal models of neuropathological changes characteristic of PD provided important information on the pathology or treatment of PD symptoms. However, presently is not clarified (i) the specific tissue in the GIT where the pathological processes associated with PD is initiated; (ii) the mechanism by which these processes are disseminated to the CNS or other tissues within the GIT; and (iii) which neuropathological changes could also serve as a reliable diagnostic marker of the premotor stages of PD, or (iv) which type of GIT tissue would be the most appropriate choice for routine examination of patient biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We present a multi-objective optimization method for electroencephalographic (EEG) channel selection based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) for epileptic-seizure classification. We tested the method on EEG data of 24 patients from the CHB-MIT public dataset. The procedure starts by decomposing the EEG data from each channel into different frequency bands using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) or the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and then for each sub-band four features are extracted; two energy values and two fractal dimension values. The obtained feature vectors are then iteratively tested for solving two unconstrained objectives by NSGA-II or NSGA-III; to maximize classification accuracy and to reduce the number of EEG channels required for epileptic seizure classification. Our results have shown accuracies of up to 1.00 with only one EEG channel. Interestingly, when using all the EEG channels available, lower accuracies were achieved compared to the case when EEG channels were selected by NSGA-II or NSGA-III; i.e., in patient 19 we obtained an accuracy of 0.95 using all the channels and 0.975 using only two channels selected by NSGA-III. The results obtained are encouraging and it has been shown that it is possible to classify epileptic seizures using a few electrodes, which provide evidence for the future development of portable EEG seizure detection devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Sleep is commonly assessed by recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the sleeping brain. As sleep assessments in a lab environment are cumbersome for both the participant and researcher, it would be highly desirable to record sleep EEG with a user-friendly and mobile device. Dry electrodes that are reusable, low-cost, and easy to apply would be an essential component of such a device. In this study, we developed a testing protocol to investigate the performance of novel flat-type dry electrodes for sleep EEG recordings in free-living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Overnight sleep EEG, electrooculogram and electromyogram of four young and healthy participants were recorded at home. Two identical ambulatory recording devices, one using novel flat-type dry electrodes, the other using self-adhesive pre-gelled electrodes, simultaneously recorded sleep EEG. Between both electrode types, we then compared the signal quality, the incidence of artifacts, the sensitivity, specificity and inter-scoring reliability (Cohen’s kappa) of sleep staging, as well as the agreement of important characteristics of sleep-specific EEG microstructure features, such as slow waves (0.5–4 Hz) and sleep spindles (10–16 Hz).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our testing protocol comprehensively compared the two electrode types on a macro- and microstructure level of sleep. The dry and pre-gelled electrodes both had comparable signal quality and sleep staging was feasible with both electrodes. Also, slow-wave and spindle characteristics were similar. However, sweat artifacts were more prevalent in the flat-type dry electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;With a reliable testing protocol, the performance of dry electrodes can be compared to reference technologies and objectively assessed also in free-living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by prominent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and aggregation of the protein α-synuclein within intraneuronal inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Ninety percent of PD cases are idiopathic while the remaining 10% are associated with gene mutations that affect cellular functions ranging from kinase activity to mitochondrial quality control, hinting at a multifactorial disease process. Mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA (the gene coding for α-synuclein) cause monogenic forms of autosomal dominant PD, and polymorphisms in either gene are also associated with increased risk of idiopathic PD. Although Lewy bodies are a defining neuropathological feature of PD, an appreciable subset of patients with LRRK2 mutations present with a clinical phenotype indistinguishable from idiopathic PD but lack Lewy pathology at autopsy, suggesting that LRRK2-mediated PD may occur independently of α-synuclein aggregation. Here, we examine whether LRRK2 and α-synuclein, as mediators of neurodegeneration in PD, exist in common or distinct pathways. Specifically, we review evidence from preclinical models and human neuropathological studies examining interactions between the two proteins. Elucidating the degree of interplay between LRRK2 and α-synuclein will be necessary for treatment stratification once effective targeted disease-modifying therapies are developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease, characterized by the degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons. Despite decades of research, we still to date lack a cure or disease modifying treatment, emphasizing the need for a much-improved insight into disease mechanisms and cell type vulnerability. Altered neuronal excitability is a common phenomenon reported in ALS patients, as well as in animal models of the disease, but the cellular and circuit processes involved, as well as the causal relevance of those observations to molecular alterations and final cell death, remain poorly understood. Here, we review evidence from clinical studies, cell type-specific electrophysiology, genetic manipulations and molecular characterizations in animal models and culture experiments, which argue for a causal involvement of complex alterations of structure, function and connectivity of different neuronal subtypes within the cortical and spinal cord motor circuitries. We also summarize the current knowledge regarding the detrimental role of astrocytes and reassess the frequently proposed hypothesis of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity with respect to changes in neuronal excitability. Together, these findings suggest multifaceted cell type-, brain area- and disease stage- specific disturbances of the excitation/inhibition balance as a cardinal aspect of ALS pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) in neuropathic pain due to brachial plexus avulsion injury (BPAI) and related changes in the metabolic brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Neuropathic pain model due to BPAI was established in adult female Sprague–Dawley rats. EA stimulations (2/15 Hz, 30 min/day, 5-day intervention followed by 2-day rest in each session) were applied to the fifth–seventh cervical “Jiaji” acupoints on the noninjured side from 1st to 12th weeks following BPAI (EA group, n = 8). Three control groups included sham EA (nonelectrical acupuncture applied to 3 mm lateral to the real “Jiaji” acupoints), BPAI-only, and normal rats (no particular intervention; eight rats in each group). Thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of the noninjured forepaw was regularly tested to evaluate the threshold of thermalgesia. Small animal [fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;-glucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG) PET/CT scans of brain were conducted at the end of 4th, 12th, and 16th weeks to explore metabolic alterations of brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the EA group, the TWL of the noninjured forepaw significantly decreased following BPAI and then increased following EA stimulation, compared with sham EA (P &amp;lt; 0.001). The metabolic brain connectivity among somatosensory cortex (SC), motor cortex (MC), caudate putamen (Cpu), and dorsolateral thalamus (DLT) in bilateral hemispheres decreased throughout the 16 weeks’ observation in the BPAI-only group, compared with the normal rats (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In the EA group, the strength of connectivity among the above regions were found to be increased at the end of 4th week following BPAI modeling, decreased at 12th week, and then increased again at 16th week (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The changes in metabolic connectivity were uncharacteristic and dispersed in the sham EA group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The study revealed long-term and extensive changes of metabolic brain connectivity in EA-treated BPAI-induced neuropathic pain rats. Bilateral sensorimotor and pain-related brain regions were mainly involved in this process. It indicated that modulation of brain metabolic connectivity might be an important mechanism of analgesic effect in EA stimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cortical layer 1 (L1) contains a population of GABAergic interneurons, considered a key component of information integration, processing, and relaying in neocortical networks. In fact, L1 interneurons combine top–down information with feed-forward sensory inputs in layer 2/3 and 5 pyramidal cells (PCs), while filtering their incoming signals. Despite the importance of L1 for network emerging phenomena, little is known on the dynamics of the spike initiation and the encoding properties of its neurons. Using acute brain tissue slices from the rat neocortex, combined with the analysis of an existing database of model neurons, we investigated the dynamical transfer properties of these cells by sampling an entire population of known “electrical classes” and comparing experiments and model predictions. We found the bandwidth of spike initiation to be significantly narrower than in L2/3 and 5 PCs, with values below 100 cycle/s, but without significant heterogeneity in the cell response properties across distinct electrical types. The upper limit of the neuronal bandwidth was significantly correlated to the mean firing rate, as anticipated from theoretical studies but not reported for PCs. At high spectral frequencies, the magnitude of the neuronal response attenuated as a power-law, with an exponent significantly smaller than what was reported for pyramidal neurons and reminiscent of the dynamics of a “leaky” integrate-and-fire model of spike initiation. Finally, most of our in vitro results matched quantitatively the numerical simulations of the models as a further contribution to independently validate the models against novel experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) was associated with poorer cognitive function and increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, objective evidence for the relationship between osteoporosis and AD in humans has not been extensively described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the relationships between BMD and the cortical volumes of brain regions vulnerable to AD; hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and angular gyrus, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), to investigate the association between bone loss and AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A cohort of 149 consecutive elderly participants who complained of memory disturbance underwent high-resolution structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We used SPM12 software to conduct a voxel-based multiple regression analysis to examine the association between femoral neck BMD values and regional gray matter volume (rGMV) on structural T1-weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After adjusting for subject age, gender, total brain volume (TBV), and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, the multiple regression analysis showed significant correlations between BMD loss and rGMV decline in the left precuneus, which is an important neural network hub vulnerable to AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These data suggest that the bone and brain communicate with each other, as in “bone-brain crosstalk,” and that control of BMD factors could contribute to cognitive function and help prevent AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Postmenopausal women have a higher incidence of stroke compared to the age-matched males, and the estrogen was thought to be the main cause of such difference. However, estrogen replacement therapy for the prevention of postmenopausal stroke shows controversial results and is widely disputed because of its serious side effects after chronic administration. Genistein (Gen), a natural phytestrogen with fewer side effects, has a protective effect against cerebral ischemia damage. However, whether Gen could effectively prevent postmenopausal stroke has not been elucidated. In the current study, reproductively senescent mice were treated with Gen (10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks before having transient cerebral ischemia insults. Neurological scores, infarct volumes, and cell apoptosis were evaluated 24 h after reperfusion. The levels of inflammatory factors and nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-related proteins were also examined. The results showed that Gen treatment reduced infarct volumes, improved neurological scores, attenuated apoptosis, and decreased inflammatory factor release. The expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins in microglia was downregulated by Gen. However, the overexpression of NLRP3 in microglia abrogated the Gen-induced inhibition of inflammatory factor release and reversed the neuroprotective effect of Gen. Taken together, the results suggest that Gen treatment could attenuate the acute injury induced by cerebral ischemia in reproductively senescent mice via the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia, indicating that Gen could be a candidate drug for the treatment of stroke in postmenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) is the key coactivator because of its transcriptional activity. Previous studies have shown that SRC-1 is abundant in the hippocampus and has been implicated in cognition. SRC-1 is also related to some major risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), such as a decline in estrogen and aging, however, whether SRC-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear. In this study, we established SRC-1 knockout in AD mice by cross breeding SRC-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice with APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and investigated the expression of some synaptic proteins, the amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, and activation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1×SRC-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. The results showed that SRC-1 knockout neither affects the Aβ plaque and activation of glia, nor changes the expression of synaptic proteins in AD model mice. The above results suggest that the complete deletion of SRC-1 in the embryo exerts no effect on the pathogenesis of APP/PS1 mice. Nevertheless, this study could not eliminate the possible role of SRC-1 in the development of AD due to the lack of observation of other events in AD such as tau hyperphosphorylation and the limitation of the animal model employed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Traditional cultivation approaches in microbiology are labor-intensive, low-throughput, and yield biased sampling of environmental microbes due to ecological and evolutionary factors. New strategies are needed for ample representation of rare taxa and slow-growers that are often outcompeted by fast-growers in cultivation experiments. Here we describe a microfluidic platform that anaerobically isolates and cultivates microbial cells in millions of picoliter droplets and automatically sorts them based on colony density to enhance slow-growing organisms. We applied our strategy to a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) donor stool using multiple growth media, and found significant increase in taxonomic richness and larger representation of rare and clinically relevant taxa among droplet-grown cells compared to conventional plates. Furthermore, screening the FMT donor stool for antibiotic resistance revealed 21 populations that evaded detection in plate-based assessment of antibiotic resistance. Our method improves cultivation-based surveys of diverse microbiomes to gain deeper insights into microbial functioning and lifestyles.</content>

 Animals and humans replay neural patterns encoding trajectories through their environment, both whilst they solve decision-making tasks and during rest. Both on-task and off-task replay are believed to contribute to flexible decision making, though how their relative contributions differ remains unclear. We investigated this question by using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study human subjects while they performed a decision-making task that was designed to reveal the decision algorithms employed. We characterised subjects in terms of how flexibly each adjusted their choices to changes in temporal, spatial and reward structure. The more flexible a subject, the more they replayed trajectories during task performance, and this replay was coupled with re-planning of the encoded trajectories. The less flexible a subject, the more they replayed previously preferred trajectories during rest periods between task epochs. The data suggest that online and offline replay both participate in planning but support distinct decision strategies.</content>

		<link href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56910"/>

		<content type="html">
 The type one interferon induced restriction factor Myxovirus resistance B (MxB) restricts HIV-1 nuclear entry evidenced by inhibition of 2-LTR but not linear forms of viral DNA. The HIV-1 capsid is the key determinant of MxB sensitivity and cofactor binding defective HIV-1 capsid mutants P90A (defective for cyclophilin A and Nup358 recruitment) and N74D (defective for CPSF6 recruitment) have reduced dependency on nuclear transport associated cofactors, altered integration targeting preferences and are not restricted by MxB expression. This has suggested that nuclear import mechanism may determine MxB sensitivity. Here we have use genetics to separate HIV-1 nuclear import cofactor dependence from MxB sensitivity. We provide evidence that MxB sensitivity depends on HIV-1 capsid conformation, rather than cofactor recruitment. We show that depleting CPSF6 to change nuclear import pathway does not impact MxB sensitivity, but mutants that recapitulate the effect of Cyclophilin A binding on capsid conformation and dynamics strongly impact MxB sensitivity. We demonstrate that HIV-1 primary isolates have different MxB sensitivities due to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) selected differences in Gag sequence but similar cofactor dependencies. Overall our work demonstrates a complex relationship between cyclophilin dependence and MxB sensitivity likely driven by CTL escape. We propose that cyclophilin binding provides conformational flexibility to HIV-1 capsid facilitating simultaneous evasion of capsid-targeting restriction factors including TRIM5 as well as MxB.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Calcium ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) are essential for many cellular signaling mechanisms and enter the cytosol mostly through voltage-gated calcium channels. Here, using high-speed Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging up to 20 kHz in the rat layer 5 pyramidal neuron axon we found that activity-dependent intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) in the axonal initial segment was only partially dependent on voltage-gated calcium channels. Instead, [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; changes were sensitive to the specific voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channel blocker tetrodotoxin. Consistent with the conjecture that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; enters through the Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel pore, the optically resolved &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; in the axon initial segment overlapped with the activation kinetics of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels and heterologous expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in HEK-293 cells revealed a tetrodotoxin-sensitive [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; rise. Finally, computational simulations predicted that axonal [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; transients reflect a 0.4% Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+ &lt;/sup&gt;conductivity of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels. The findings indicate that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeation through Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels provides a submillisecond rapid entry route in Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;-enriched domains of mammalian axons.</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the expression of HCN ion channels leading to changes in &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; function and neuronal excitability are considered to be possible mechanisms involved in epileptogenesis in kinds of human epilepsy. In previous animal studies of febrile seizures and temporal lobe epilepsy, changes in the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 channels at different time points and in different parts of the brain were not consistent, suggesting that transcriptional disorders involving HCNs play a crucial role in the epileptogenic process. Therefore, we aimed to assess the transcriptional regulation of HCN channels in Medial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE‐HS) patients. This study included eight nonhippocampal sclerosis patients and 40 MTLE‐HS patients. The mRNA expression of HCN channels was evaluated by qRT‐PCR, while the protein expression was quantitatively analyzed by Western blotting. The subcellular localization of HCN channels in the hippocampus was explored by immunofluorescence. We demonstrated that the mRNA and protein expression of HCN1 and HCN2 are downregulated in controls compared to that in MTLE‐HS patients. In the hippocampal CA1/CA4 subregion and GCL, in addition to a large decrease in neurons, the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 on neuronal cell membranes was also downregulated in MTLE‐HS patients. These findings suggest that the expression of HCN channels are downregulated in MTLE‐HS, which indicates that the decline in HCN channels in the hippocampus during chronic epilepsy in MTLE‐HS patients leads to the downregulation of &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current density and function, thereby reducing the inhibitory effect and increasing neuronal excitability and eventually causing disturbances in the electrical activity of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;We found PD patients had lower CSF t‐tau (median = 157.7 pg/mL,range = 80.9–467.0), p‐tau (median = 13.4 pg/mL,range = 8.0–40.1) and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; (median = 846.2 pg/mL,range = 238.8–3707.0) than HC at baseline (CSF t‐tau median = 173.5 pg/mL,range = 82.0–580.8; p‐tau median = 15.4 pg/mL,range = 8.1–73.6; Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; median = 926.5 pg/mL,range = 239.1–3297.0;p &amp;lt; 0.05–0.001) and a moderate‐to‐strong correlation among these biomarkers in both PD and HC (Rho = 0.50–0.97; p &amp;lt; 0.001). 31.5% of PD had pathologically‐low levels of CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; baseline and these PD patients had lower p‐tau levels (median = 10.8 pg/mL, range = 8.0–32.8) compared to 27.7% of HC with pathologically‐low CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; (CSF p‐tau median = 12.8 pg/mL, range 8.2–73.6;p &amp;lt; 0.03)&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt; In longitudinal CSF analysis, we found PD had greater decline in CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; (mean difference = −41.83 pg/ml; p = 0.03) and CSF p‐tau (mean difference = −0.38 pg/ml; p = 0.03) at year three compared to HC. Baseline CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; values predicted small but measurable decline on cognitive, autonomic and motor function in early PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest baseline CSF AD biomarkers may have prognostic value in early PD and that the dynamic change of these markers, while modest over a three‐year period, suggest biomarker profiles in PD may deviate from healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Activity-responsive changes in the actin cytoskeleton are required for the biogenesis, motility, and remodeling of dendritic spines. These changes are governed by proteins that regulate the polymerization, depolymerization, bundling, and branching of actin filaments. Thus, processes that have been extensively characterized in the context of non-neuronal cell shape change and migration are also critical for learning and memory. In this review article, we highlight actin regulatory proteins that associate, at least transiently, with the dendritic plasma membrane. All of these proteins have been shown, either in directed studies or in high—throughput screens, to undergo palmitoylation, a potentially reversible, and stimulus-dependent cysteine modification. Palmitoylation increases the affinity of peripheral proteins for the membrane bilayer and contributes to their subcellular localization and recruitment to cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Purpose&lt;p&gt;In the clinical routine, detection of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) by visual inspection is challenging. Still, information about the presence and location of FCD is highly relevant for prognostication and treatment decisions. Therefore, this study aimed to develop, describe and test a method for the calculation of synthetic anatomies using multiparametric quantitative MRI (qMRI) data and surface-based analysis, which allows for an improved visualization of FCD.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Quantitative T1-, T2- and PD-maps and conventional clinical datasets of patients with FCD and epilepsy were acquired. Tissue segmentation and delineation of the border between white matter and cortex was performed. In order to detect blurring at this border, a surface-based calculation of the standard deviation of each quantitative parameter (T1, T2, and PD) was performed across the cortex and the neighboring white matter for each cortical vertex. The resulting standard deviations combined with measures of the cortical thickness were used to enhance the signal of conventional FLAIR-datasets. The resulting synthetically enhanced FLAIR-anatomies were compared with conventional MRI-data utilizing regions of interest based analysis techniques.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The synthetically enhanced FLAIR-anatomies showed higher signal levels than conventional FLAIR-data at the FCD sites (p = 0.005). In addition, the enhanced FLAIR-anatomies exhibited higher signal levels at the FCD sites than in the corresponding contralateral regions (p = 0.005). However, false positive findings occurred, so careful comparison with conventional datasets is mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Synthetically enhanced FLAIR-anatomies resulting from surface-based multiparametric qMRI-analyses have the potential to improve the visualization of FCD and, accordingly, the treatment of the respective patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by muscle weakness due to the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons. Neuroinflammation is known as a prominent pathological feature of ALS. Although neuroinflammation cannot trigger ALS, activated central nervous system (CNS) microglia and astrocytes, proinflammatory periphery monocytes/macrophages and T lymphocytes, and infiltrated monocytes/macrophages and T lymphocytes, as well as the immunoreactive molecules they release, are closely related to disease progression. The crosstalk between the peripheral and CNS immune components mentioned above significantly correlates with survival in patients with ALS. This review provides an update on the role of this crosstalk between the CNS and peripheral immune responses in ALS. Additionally, we discuss changes in the composition of gut microbiota because these can directly or indirectly influence this crosstalk. These recent advances may well provide innovative ways for targeting the molecules associated with this crosstalk and breaking the current treatment impasse in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Patterns of neuronal activity that induce synaptic plasticity and memory storage activate kinase cascades in neurons that are thought to be part of the mechanism for synaptic modification. One such cascade involves induction of phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in neurons due to synaptic activation of AKT/mTOR and via a different pathway, activation of MAP kinase/ERK1/2. Here, we show that phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 can also be strongly activated by high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (hfrTMS). HfrTMS was delivered to lightly anesthetized rats using a stimulation protocol that is a standard for inducing LTP in the perforant path in vivo (trains of 8 pulses at 400 Hz repeated at intervals of 1/10 s). Stimulation produced stimulus-locked motor responses but did not elicit behavioral seizures either during or after stimulation. After as little as 10 min of hfrTMS, immunostaining using phospho-specific antibodies for the phosphorylated form of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) revealed robust induction of rpS6 phosphorylation in large numbers of neurons in the cortex, especially the piriform cortex, and also in thalamic relay nuclei. Quantification revealed that the extent of the increased immunostaining depended on the number of trains and stimulus intensity. Of note, immunostaining for the immediate early genes Arc and c-fos revealed strong induction of IEG expression in many of the same populations of neurons throughout the cortex, but not the thalamus. These results indicate that hfrTMS can robustly activate molecular pathways critical for plasticity, which may contribute to the beneficial effects of TMS on recovery following brain and spinal cord injury and symptom amelioration in human psychiatric disorders. These molecular processes may be a useful surrogate marker to allow optimization of TMS parameters for maximal therapeutic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stroke is the most common cause of complex disability in Taiwan. After stroke onset, persistent physical practice or exercise in the rehabilitation procedure reorganizes neural assembly for reducing motor deficits, known as neuroplasticity. Neuroimaging literature showed rehabilitative effects specific to the brain networks of the sensorimotor network (SMN) and default-mode network (DMN). However, whether between-network interactions facilitate the neuroplasticity after stroke rehabilitation remains a mystery. Therefore, we conducted the longitudinal assessment protocol of stroke rehabilitation, including three types of clinical evaluations and two types of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques (resting state and grasp task). Twelve chronic stroke patients completed the rehabilitation protocol for at least 24 h and finished the three-time assessments: before, after rehabilitation, and 1 month after the cessation of rehabilitation. For comparison, age-matched normal controls (NC) underwent the same fMRI evaluation once without repeated measure. Increasing scores of the Fugl–Meyer assessment (FMA) and upper extremity performance test reflected the enhanced motor performances after the stroke rehabilitation process. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) results showed that the connections between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and iM1 were persistently enhanced in contrast to the pre-rehabilitation condition. The interactions between PCC and SMN were positively associated with motor performances. The enhanced cross-network connectivity facilitates the motor recovery after stroke rehabilitation, but the cross-network interaction was low before the rehabilitation process, similar to the level of NCs. Our findings suggested that cross-network connectivity plays a facilitatory role following the stroke rehabilitation, which can serve as a neurorehabilitative biomarker for future intervention evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;Precise quantification of cerebral arteries can help with differentiation and prognostication of cerebrovascular disease. Existing image processing and segmentation algorithms for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are limited to the analysis of either 2D maximum intensity projection images or the entire 3D volume. The goal of this study was to develop a fully automated, hybrid 2D-3D method for robust segmentation of arteries and accurate quantification of vessel radii using MRA at varying projection thicknesses.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A novel algorithm that employs an adaptive Frangi filter for segmentation of vessels followed by estimation of vessel radii is presented. The method was evaluated on MRA datasets and corresponding manual segmentations from three healthy subjects for various projection thicknesses. In addition, the vessel metrics were computed in four additional subjects. Three synthetically generated angiographic datasets resembling brain vasculature were also evaluated under different noise levels. Dice similarity coefficient, Jaccard Index, F-score, and concordance correlation coefficient were used to measure the segmentation accuracy of manual versus automatic segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our new adaptive filter rendered accurate representations of vessels, maintained accurate vessel radii, and corresponded better to manual segmentation at different projection thicknesses than prior methods. Validation with synthetic datasets under low contrast and noisy conditions revealed accurate quantification of vessels without distortions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated a method for automatic segmentation of vascular trees and the subsequent generation of a vessel radii map. This novel technique can be applied to analyze arterial structures in healthy and diseased populations and improve the characterization of vascular integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are linked to autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), and genetic variations at the LRRK2 locus are associated with an increased risk for sporadic PD. This gene encodes a kinase that is physiologically multiphosphorylated, including clusters of both heterologous phosphorylation and autophosphorylation sites. Several pieces of evidence indicate that LRRK2's phosphorylation is important for its pathological and physiological functioning. These include a reduced LRRK2 heterologous phosphorylation in PD brains or after pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity as well as the appearance of subcellular LRRK2 accumulations when this protein is dephosphorylated at heterologous phosphosites. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms governing LRRK2 phosphorylation levels and the cellular consequences of changes in LRRK2 phosphorylation remain incompletely understood. In this review, we present current knowledge on LRRK2 phosphorylation, LRRK2 phosphoregulation, and how LRRK2 phosphorylation changes affect cellular processes that may ultimately be linked to PD mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) can lead to cognitive impairment. Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a (Mfsd2a) is a newly discovered protein that is essential for maintaining BBB integrity. However, the role of Mfsd2a in vascular cognitive impairment has not been explored yet. In this study, a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) was established by producing permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) in rats. We found that after the 2VO procedure, the rats exhibited cognitive impairment, showed increased BBB leakage within the hippocampus, and had reduced expression of the Mfsd2a protein. The overexpression of Mfsd2a in the rat hippocampus reversed these changes. Further investigations using transmission electron microscopy revealed a significantly increased rate of vesicular transcytosis in the BBB of the hippocampus of the CCH rats; the rate reduced after overexpression of Mfsd2a. Moreover, Mfsd2a overexpression did not cause changes in the expression of tight junction-associated proteins and in the ultrastructures of the tight junctions. In conclusion, Mfsd2a attenuated BBB damage and ameliorated cognitive impairment in CCH rats, and its protective effect on the BBB was achieved via inhibition of vesicular transcytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Trust plays a critical role in nearly every aspect of social life. Parental investment theory and social role theory predict that women trust less than men due to a higher sensitivity to risk and betrayal, while men trust more than women to maximize resources and to signal their willingness to lose something. However, the underlying neuropsychological underpinnings for this gender difference are still obscure. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural signatures of gender differences in trust by simultaneously scanning 11 male and 11 female same-gender, fixed dyads who played a multi-round binary trust game with varying levels of payoff (low/moderate/high) as an indicator of social risk. Our results showed that men trusted more than women and payoff level moderated the effect of gender on trust. While men trusted the same at all payoff levels, women trusted less with higher payoff levels. This pattern was supported by our neuroimaging finding: men showed a higher activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) and right precuneus than women, indicating that men exert more effort to inhibit the information of payoff levels and to use self-referencing to infer the strategies of partners with the goal of maximizing profit. Furthermore, men showed equivalent activation in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex across payoff levels, whereas women showed a decreased activation with increasing payoff level – indicating decreased group bonding with higher risk in women. In conclusion, our results imply that women are more sensitive to social risk while trusting, which has implications for financial interactions, interpersonal relationships, and social involvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Theta-burst stimulation (TBS), a variant of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), can potentially benefit the treatment of swallowing disorders. However, the after-effects of TBS on the swallowing motor cortex remain uncertain. The newly developed graph-based analysis of the centrality approach has been increasingly used to explore brain networks. The purpose of this study was to identify degree centrality (DC) alterations in the brain network after different TBS protocols were performed over the suprahyoid muscles motor cortex in healthy subjects. A total of 40 right-handed healthy subjects (mean age: 23.73 ± 2.57 years, range: 21–30, 20 females) were included in this study and randomly assigned to two groups, including the continuous TBS (cTBS) group and the intermittent TBS (iTBS) group. All of the subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scanning before and after TBS implementation. Compared to the baseline, cTBS resulted in increased DC values in the left inferior frontal gyrus (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In the iTBS group, decreased DC was observed in the left cerebellum and left medial frontal gyrus; However, increased DC was observed in several brain areas including the right superior temporal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, right postcentral gyri and left paracentral lobule (P &amp;lt; 0.01). These results indicated that cTBS mainly results in increasing DC in the ipsilateral. However, iTBS is capable of facilitating the excitability of the swallowing motor cortex and increasing the connectivity of multiple brain regions, including the bilateral sensorimotor network, and might have therapeutic potential in the treatment of swallowing disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Determining how neurons transform synaptic input and encode information in action potential (AP) firing output is required for understanding dendritic integration, neural transforms and encoding. Limitations in the speed of imaging 3D volumes of brain encompassing complex dendritic arbors in vivo using conventional galvanometer mirror-based laser-scanning microscopy has hampered fully capturing fluorescent sensors of activity throughout an individual neuron's entire complement of synaptic inputs and somatic APs. To address this problem, we have developed a two-photon microscope that achieves high-speed scanning by employing inertia-free acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) for laser beam positioning, enabling random-access sampling of hundreds to thousands of points-of-interest restricted to a predetermined neuronal structure, avoiding wasted scanning of surrounding extracellular tissue. This system is capable of comprehensive imaging of the activity of single neurons within the intact and awake vertebrate brain. Here, we demonstrate imaging of tectal neurons within the brains of albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles labeled using single-cell electroporation for expression of a red space-filling fluorophore to determine dendritic arbor morphology, and either the calcium sensor jGCaMP7s or the glutamate sensor iGluSnFR as indicators of neural activity. Using discrete, point-of-interest scanning we achieve sampling rates of 3 Hz for saturation sampling of entire arbors at 2 μm resolution, 6 Hz for sequentially sampling 3 volumes encompassing the dendritic arbor and soma, and 200–250 Hz for scanning individual planes through the dendritic arbor. This system allows investigations of sensory-evoked information input-output relationships of neurons within the intact and awake brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;GABAergic transmission regulates neuronal excitability, dendritic integration of synaptic signals and oscillatory activity, thought to be involved in high cognitive functions. By anchoring synaptic receptors just opposite to release sites, the scaffold protein gephyrin plays a key role in these tasks. In addition, by regulating GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor trafficking, gephyrin contributes to maintain, at the network level, an appropriate balance between Excitation (E) and Inhibition (I), crucial for information processing. An E/I imbalance leads to neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism. In this article, we exploit a previously published computational method to fit spontaneous synaptic events, using a simplified model of the subcellular pathways involving gephyrin at inhibitory synapses. The model was used to analyze experimental data recorded under different conditions, with the main goal to gain insights on the possible consequences of gephyrin block on IPSCs. The same approach can be useful, in general, to analyze experiments designed to block a single protein. The results suggested possible ways to correlate the changes observed in the amplitude and time course of individual events recorded after different experimental protocols with the changes that may occur in the main subcellular pathways involved in gephyrin-dependent transsynaptic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The maintenance of the excitability of neurons and circuits is a fundamental process for healthy brain functions. One of the main homeostatic mechanisms responsible for such regulation is synaptic scaling. While this type of plasticity is well-characterized through a robust body of literature, there are no systematic evaluations of the methodological and reporting features from these studies. Our review yielded 168 articles directly investigating synaptic scaling mechanisms, which display relatively high impact, with a median impact factor of 7.76 for the publishing journals. Our methodological analysis identified that 86% of the articles made use of inhibitory interventions to induce synaptic scaling, while only 41% of those studies contain excitatory manipulations. To verify the effects of synaptic scaling, the most assessed outcome was miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) recordings, performed in 71% of the articles. We could also observe that the field is mostly focused on mechanistic studies of the synaptic scaling pathways (70%), rather than the interaction with other types of plasticity, such as Hebbian processes (4%). We found that more than half of the articles failed to describe simple features, such as regulatory compliance statements, ethics committee approval, or statements of conflict of interests. In light of these results, we discuss the strengths and pitfalls existing in synaptic scaling literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent studies have suggested the neuroinvasive potential of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Notably, neuroinvasiveness might be involved in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some studies have demonstrated that synapse-connected routes may enable coronaviruses to access the central nervous system (CNS). However, evidence related to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS, its direct impact on the CNS, and the contribution to symptoms suffered, remain sparse. Here, we review the current literature that indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the nervous system. We also describe the neural circuits that are potentially affected by the virus and their possible role in the progress of COVID-19. In addition, we propose several strategies to understand, diagnose, and treat the neurological symptoms of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The study aimed to investigate the aberration of brain spontaneous activity and synchronization in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients homozygous for the apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε3 allele. In the APOE-ε3 homozygotes, 37 T2DM patients and 37 well-matched healthy controls (HC) were included to acquire blood sample measurements, neuropsychological tests, and brain functional MRI data. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) analysis was conducted to identify the brain areas with abnormal spontaneous activity. Then, the identified brain areas were taken as seeds to compute their functional connectivity (FC) with other brain regions. The two-sample t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test were applied to reveal significant differences in acquired measurements between the two groups. The potential correlations among the three types of measurements were explored using partial correlation analysis in the T2DM group. The T2DM group had elevated glycemic levels and scored lower on the cognitive assessment but higher on the anxiety and depression tests (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The T2DM group exhibited higher ALFF in the left middle occipital gyrus, and the left middle occipital gyrus had lower FC with the left caudate nucleus and the left inferior parietal gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.05). No significant correlations were observed. T2DM patients homozygous for the APOE-ε3 allele exhibited aberrant brain spontaneous activity and synchronization in brain regions associated with vision-related information processing, executive function, and negative emotions. The findings may update our understanding of the mechanisms of brain dysfunction in T2DM patients in a neuroimaging perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) exerts neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Conventional stimulation techniques entail limited stimulation time and restricted movement of animals, warranting the need for optimizing the SCS regimen to address the progressive nature of the disease and to improve its clinical translation to PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the limitations of conventional stimulation, we now investigated the effects of continuous SCS in freely moving parkinsonian rats.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We developed a small device that could deliver continuous SCS. At the start of the experiment, thirty female Sprague-Dawley rats received the dopamine (DA)-depleting neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine, into the right striatum. The SCS device was fixed below the shoulder area of the back of the animal, and a line from this device was passed under the skin to an electrode that was then implanted epidurally over the dorsal column. The rats were divided into three groups: control, 8-h stimulation, and 24-h stimulation, and behaviorally tested then euthanized for immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The 8- and 24-h stimulation groups displayed significant behavioral improvement compared to the control group. Both SCS-stimulated groups exhibited significantly preserved tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive fibers and neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), respectively, compared to the control group. Notably, the 24-h stimulation group showed significantly pronounced preservation of the striatal TH-positive fibers compared to the 8-h stimulation group. Moreover, the 24-h group demonstrated significantly reduced number of microglia in the striatum and SNc and increased laminin-positive area of the cerebral cortex compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated the behavioral and histological benefits of continuous SCS in a time-dependent manner in freely moving PD animals, possibly mediated by anti-inflammatory and angiogenic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00147"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Neurofeedback (NF) training, as a method of self-regulation of brain activity, may be beneficial in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this pilot study, we investigated whether a sensorimotor (SMR)/theta NF training could improve cognitive performance and brain electrical activity in elderly patients with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty elderly patients with MCI were assigned to 20 consecutive sessions of sensorimotor (SMR)/theta NF training, during 10 weeks, on a basis of two sessions each week. Neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires, as well as electroencephalogram (EEG), were performed and compared between baseline (T0), after the last NF training session at 10 weeks (T1), and 1-month follow-up (T2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that from baseline to post-intervention, participants showed significant improvement in the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCa, F = 4.78; p = 0.012), the delayed recall of the Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT, F = 3.675; p = 0.032), the Forward digit span (F = 13.82; p &amp;lt; 0.0001), the Anxiety Goldberg Scale (F = 4.54; p = 0.015), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Score–Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; F = 24.75; p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and the Mac Nair score (F = 4.47; p = 0.016). EEG theta power (F = 4.44; p = 0.016) and alpha power (F = 3.84; p = 0.027) during eyes-closed resting-state significantly increased after the NF training and showed sustained improvement at a 1-month follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results suggest that NF training could be effective to reduce cognitive deficits in elderly patients with MCI and improve their EEG activity. If these findings are confirmed by randomized controlled studies with larger samples of patients, NF could be seen as a useful non-invasive, non-pharmacological tool for preventing further decline, rehabilitation of cognitive function in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: This pilot study was a preliminary step before the trial registered in www.ClinicalTrials.gov, under the number of NCT03526692.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Academic centers utilize sequential clinical and neuroimaging assessments, including morphometric ratios, to obtain an unequivocal diagnosis of the non-synucleinopathic forms of Parkinsonism, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), however, a 1–2 year follow-up is required. The on-going long-lasting trials using anti-tau antibodies for PSP patients might therefore be biased by the incorrect enrollment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients manifesting early axial signs. This perspective study aimed at achieving two major goals: first, to summarize the established biomarker candidates found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in probable PSP patients, including low p-tau and altered neurofilaments. Second, we share our recent data, from CSF samples of well-selected PSP subjects, attributable to both main variants (and revisited in light of MDS criteria), who were followed for 1 year before and 2 years after lumbar puncture. We found a significantly high level of noradrenaline (NE) in these patients, similar to controls, when compared to PD patients. In contrast, CSF samples, in PD, showed a significant reduction in CSF NE and its major metabolite, which confirmed that PD is a multi-system disease involving several endogenous pathways. The NE axis impairments were prominent in PSP featuring worse NPI. It might represent a counterpart to the early and peculiar psycho-pathological profiles that are observed in tauopathies. In conclusion, we highlight that CSF biomarkers, which are easy to collect, can provide rapid insights as diagnostic tools. Early alterations in endogenous NE machinery in atypical Parkinsonism may represent a specific risk trait in forms characterized by a worse prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Within deep tissue sites, extracellular bacterial pathogens often replicate in clusters that are surrounded by immune cells. Disease is modulated by interbacterial interactions as well as bacterial-host cell interactions resulting in microbial growth, phagocytic attack and secretion of host antimicrobial factors. To overcome the limited ability to manipulate these infection sites, we established a system for &lt;i&gt;Yersinia pseudotuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Yptb) &lt;/i&gt;growth in microfluidics-driven microdroplets that regenerates microbial social behavior in tissues. Chemical generation of nitric oxide (NO) in the absence of immune cells was sufficient to reconstruct microbial social behavior, as witnessed by expression of the NO-inactivating protein Hmp on the extreme periphery of microcolonies, mimicking spatial regulation in tissues. Similarly, activated macrophages that expressed inducible NO synthase (iNOS) drove peripheral expression of Hmp, allowing regeneration of social behavior observed in tissues. These results argue that topologically correct microbial tissue growth and associated social behavior can be reconstructed in culture.</content>

 Only a limited number of animal species lend themselves to becoming model organisms in multiple biological disciplines: one of these is the great pond snail, &lt;i&gt;Lymnaea stagnalis&lt;/i&gt;. Extensively used since the 1970s to study fundamental mechanisms in neurobiology, the value of this freshwater snail has been also recognised in fields as diverse as host–parasite interactions, ecotoxicology, evolution, genome editing and 'omics', and human disease modelling. While there is knowledge about the natural history of this species, what is currently lacking is an integration of findings from the laboratory and the field. With this in mind, this article aims to summarise the applicability of &lt;i&gt;L. stagnalis&lt;/i&gt; and points out that this multipurpose model organism is an excellent, contemporary choice for addressing a large range of different biological questions, problems and phenomena.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Disturbance from whale-watching can cause significant behavioural changes with fitness consequences for targeted whale populations. However, the sensory stimuli triggering these responses are unknown, preventing effective mitigation. Here, we test the hypothesis that vessel noise level is a driver of disturbance, using humpback whales (&lt;i&gt;Megaptera novaeangliae&lt;/i&gt;) as a model species. We conducted controlled exposure experiments (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;= 42) on resting mother-calf pairs on a resting ground off Australia, by simulating whale-watch scenarios with a research vessel (range 100 m, speed 1.5 knts) playing back vessel noise at control/low (124/148 dB), medium (160 dB) or high (172 dB) LF-weighted source levels (re 1 μPa RMS@1m). Compared to control/low treatments, during high noise playbacks the mother's proportion of time resting decreased by 30%, respiration rate doubled and swim speed increased by 37%. We therefore conclude that vessel noise is an adequate driver of behavioural disturbance in whales and that regulations to mitigate the impact of whale-watching should include noise emission standards.</content>

 Chromatin remodelling plays important roles in gene regulation during development, differentiation and in disease. The chromatin remodelling enzyme CHD4 is a component of the NuRD and ChAHP complexes that are involved in gene repression. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens &lt;/i&gt;CHD4 engaged with a nucleosome core particle in the presence of the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP at an overall resolution of 3.1 Å. The ATPase motor of CHD4 binds and distorts nucleosomal DNA at superhelical location (SHL) +2, supporting the 'twist defect' model of chromatin remodelling. CHD4 does not induce unwrapping of terminal DNA, in contrast to its homologue Chd1, which functions in gene activation. Our structure also maps CHD4 mutations that are associated with human cancer or the intellectual disability disorder Sifrim-Hitz-Weiss syndrome.</content>

 Microbial fitness screens are a key technique in functional genomics. We present an all-in-one solution, &lt;i&gt;pyphe&lt;/i&gt;, for automating and improving data analysis pipelines associated with large-scale fitness screens, including image acquisition and quantification, data normalisation, and statistical analysis. &lt;i&gt;Pyphe&lt;/i&gt; is versatile and processes fitness data from colony sizes, viability scores from phloxine B staining or colony growth curves, all obtained with inexpensive transilluminating flatbed scanners. We apply &lt;i&gt;pyphe&lt;/i&gt; to show that the fitness information contained in late endpoint measurements of colony sizes is similar to maximum growth slopes from time series. We phenotype gene-deletion strains of fission yeast in 59,350 individual fitness assays in 70 conditions, revealing that colony size and viability provide complementary, independent information. Viability scores obtained from quantifying the redness of phloxine-stained colonies accurately reflect the fraction of live cells within colonies. &lt;i&gt;Pyphe&lt;/i&gt; is user-friendly, open-source and fully documented, illustrated by applications to diverse fitness analysis scenarios.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Despite anecdotal reports of the astonishing homing abilities in dogs, their homing strategies are not fully understood. We equipped 27 hunting dogs with GPS collars and action cams, let them freely roam in forested areas, and analyzed components of homing in over 600 trials. When returning to the owner (homewards), dogs either followed their outbound track (‘tracking’) or used a novel route (‘scouting’). The inbound track during scouting started mostly with a short (about 20 m) run along the north-south geomagnetic axis, irrespective of the actual direction homewards. Performing such a ‘compass run’ significantly increased homing efficiency. We propose that this run is instrumental for bringing the mental map into register with the magnetic compass and to establish the heading of the animal.</content>

		<content type="html">
 From humans to vinegar flies, exposure to diets rich in sugar and fat lowers taste sensation, changes food choices, and promotes feeding. However, how these peripheral alterations influence eating is unknown. Here we used the genetically tractable organism &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; to define the neural mechanisms through which this occurs. We characterized a population of protocerebral anterior medial dopaminergic neurons (PAM DANs) that innervates the β’2 compartment of the mushroom body and responds to sweet taste. In animals fed a high sugar diet, the response of PAM-β’2 to sweet stimuli was reduced and delayed, and sensitive to the strength of the signal transmission out of the sensory neurons. We found that PAM-β’2 DANs activity controls feeding rate and satiation: closed-loop optogenetic activation of β’2 DANs restored normal eating in animals fed high sucrose. These data argue that diet-dependent alterations in taste weaken satiation by impairing the central processing of sensory signals.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Decisions are often made by accumulating ambiguous evidence over time. The brain’s arousal systems are activated during such decisions. In previous work in humans, we found that evoked responses of arousal systems during decisions are reported by rapid dilations of the pupil and track a suppression of biases in the accumulation of decision-relevant evidence (de Gee et al., 2017). Here, we show that this arousal-related suppression in decision bias acts on both conservative and liberal biases, and generalizes from humans to mice, and from perceptual to memory-based decisions. In challenging sound-detection tasks, the impact of spontaneous or experimentally induced choice biases was reduced under high phasic arousal. Similar bias suppression occurred when evidence was drawn from memory. All of these behavioral effects were explained by reduced evidence accumulation biases. Our results point to a general principle of interplay between phasic arousal and decision-making.</content>

 Counteracting innate immunity is essential for successful viral replication. Host cyclophilins (Cyps) have been implicated in viral evasion of host antiviral responses, although the mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we show that hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-opts the host protein CypA to aid evasion of antiviral responses dependent on the effector protein kinase R (PKR). Pharmacological inhibition of CypA rescues PKR from antagonism by HCV NS5A, leading to activation of an interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1)-driven cell intrinsic antiviral program that inhibits viral replication. These findings further the understanding of the complexity of Cyp-virus interactions, provide mechanistic insight into the remarkably broad antiviral spectrum of Cyp inhibitors, and uncover novel aspects of PKR activity and regulation. Collectively, our study identifies a novel antiviral mechanism that harnesses cellular antiviral immunity to suppress viral replication.</content>

 CaV2 channels provide Ca2+ for triggering neurotransmitter release at central synapses. Held et al. remove all CaV2s and Ca2+ entry and find that synaptic protein nano-assemblies persist and synapse ultrastructure is unimpaired despite abolishing synaptic transmission. Rescue experiments establish that CaV2 C-termini are important for channel anchoring at active zones.</content>

Influenza epidemics cause substantial morbidity and mortality every year worldwide. Currently, two influenza A subtypes, A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), and type B viruses co-circulate in humans and infection with one type/subtype could provide cross-protection against the others. However, it remains unclear how such ecologic competition via cross-immunity and antigenic mutations that allow immune escape impact influenza epidemic dynamics at the population level. Here we develop a comprehensive model-inference system and apply it to study the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the three influenza types/subtypes in Hong Kong, a city of global public health significance for influenza epidemic and pandemic control. Utilizing long-term influenza surveillance data since 1998, we are able to estimate the strength of cross-immunity between each virus-pairs, the timing and frequency of punctuated changes in population immunity in response to antigenic mutations in influenza viruses, and key epidemiological parameters over the last 20 years including the 2009 pandemic. We find evidence of cross-immunity in all types/subtypes, with strongest cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2). Our results also suggest that A(H3N2) may undergo antigenic mutations in both summers and winters and thus monitoring the virus in both seasons may be important for vaccine development. Overall, our study reveals intricate epidemiological interactions and underscores the importance of simultaneous monitoring of population immunity, incidence rates, and viral genetic and antigenic changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ubSc_LS7KRU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A longstanding question in sensory neuroscience is what types of stimuli drive neurons to fire. The characterization of effective stimuli has traditionally been based on a combination of intuition, insights from previous studies, and luck. A new method termed XDream (EXtending DeepDream with real-time evolution for activation maximization) combined a generative neural network and a genetic algorithm in a closed loop to create strong stimuli for neurons in the macaque visual cortex. Here we extensively and systematically evaluate the performance of XDream. We use ConvNet units as &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; models of neurons, enabling experiments that would be prohibitive with biological neurons. We evaluated how the method compares to brute-force search, and how well the method generalizes to different neurons and processing stages. We also explored design and parameter choices. XDream can efficiently find preferred features for visual units without any prior knowledge about them. XDream extrapolates to different layers, architectures, and developmental regimes, performing better than brute-force search, and often better than exhaustive sampling of &amp;gt;1 million images. Furthermore, XDream is robust to choices of multiple image generators, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameters, suggesting that its performance is locally near-optimal. Lastly, we found no significant advantage to problem-specific parameter tuning. These results establish expectations and provide practical recommendations for using XDream to investigate neural coding in biological preparations. Overall, XDream is an efficient, general, and robust algorithm for uncovering neuronal tuning preferences using a vast and diverse stimulus space. XDream is implemented in Python, released under the MIT License, and works on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uIdW2-WaCkg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Interactive data visualization is imperative in the biological sciences. The development of independent layers of interactivity has been in pursuit in the visualization community. We developed bigPint, a data visualization package available on Bioconductor under the GPL-3 license (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bigPint.html). Our software introduces new visualization technology that enables independent layers of interactivity using Plotly in R, which aids in the exploration of large biological datasets. The bigPint package presents modernized versions of scatterplot matrices, volcano plots, and litre plots through the implementation of layered interactivity. These graphics have detected normalization issues, differential expression designation problems, and common analysis errors in public RNA-sequencing datasets. Researchers can apply bigPint graphics to their data by following recommended pipelines written in reproducible code in the user manual. In this paper, we explain how we achieved the independent layers of interactivity that are behind bigPint graphics. Pseudocode and source code are provided. Computational scientists can leverage our open-source code to expand upon our layered interactive technology and/or apply it in new ways toward other computational biology tasks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cykp_rbj-8c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Guosheng Yi, Warren M. Grill&lt;/p&gt;

The delivery of kilohertz frequency alternating current (KHFAC) generates rapid, controlled, and reversible conduction block in motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves, but causes transient activation of action potentials at the onset of the blocking current. We implemented a novel engineering optimization approach to design blocking waveforms that eliminated the onset response by moving voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGSCs) to closed-state inactivation (CSI) without first opening. We used computational models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to design a charge-balanced 10 kHz biphasic current waveform that produced conduction block without onset firing in peripheral axons at specific locations and with specific diameters. The results indicate that it is possible to achieve onset-free KHFAC nerve block by causing CSI of VGSCs. Our novel approach for designing blocking waveforms and the resulting waveform may have utility in clinical applications of conduction block of peripheral nerve hyperactivity, for example in pain and spasticity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xd2g5jk0DrE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Metabolism underpins the pathogenic strategy of the causative agent of TB, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb), and therefore metabolic pathways have recently re-emerged as attractive drug targets. A powerful approach to study Mtb metabolism as a whole, rather than just individual enzymatic components, is to use a systems biology framework, such as a Genome-Scale Metabolic Network (GSMN) that allows the dynamic interactions of all the components of metabolism to be interrogated together. Several GSMNs networks have been constructed for Mtb and used to study the complex relationship between the Mtb genotype and its phenotype. However, the utility of this approach is hampered by the existence of multiple models, each with varying properties and performances. Here we systematically evaluate eight recently published metabolic models of Mtb-H37Rv to facilitate model choice. The best performing models, sMtb2018 and iEK1011, were refined and improved for use in future studies by the TB research community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aWK9BLHMFas&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;p&gt;Vision therapy in the form of ocular motor training is increasingly used to treat visual complaints, particularly in the setting of persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this review we discuss the rationale behind this intervention and the evidence for its efficacy. While the efficacy of exercises for primary convergence insufficiency is plausible and supported by data, there is not yet strong evidence of benefit for the post‐traumatic variant. It is not established that abnormalities in fixation, pursuit and saccades in mTBI are the cause of post‐concussive symptoms, or that these abnormalities arise from ocular motor damage rather than being secondary effects of cognitive problems with attention or executive control. The few studies to date have significant methodological weaknesses. More substantial evidence is required before vision therapy can be accepted as a useful tool in the rehabilitation of patients with brain trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25822?af=R"/>
		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25822?af=R</id>
		<updated>2020-06-15T17:20:48+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathodal direct current stimulation (cDCS) induces long‐term depression (LTD)‐like reduction of cortical excitability (DCS‐LTD), which has been tested in the treatment of epilepsy with modest effects. In part, this may be due to variable cortical neuron orientation relative to the electric field. We tested, &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;, whether DCS‐LTD occurs throughout the cortical thickness, and if not, then whether drug‐DCS pairing can enhance the uniformity of the cortical response and the cDCS antiepileptic effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cDCS‐mediated changes in cortical excitability were mesured &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; in mouse motor cortex (M1) and in human postoperative neocortex, &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), and in a mouse kainic acid (KA)‐seizure model. Contributions of NMDA‐type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to cDCS‐mediated plasticity was tested with application of NMDAR blockers (memantine/D‐AP5).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cDCS reliably induced DCS‐LTD in superficial cortical layers, while a long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like enhancement (DCS‐LTP) was recorded in deep cortical layers. Immunostaining confirmed layer‐specific increase of phospho‐S6 ribosomal protein in mouse M1. Similar non‐uniform cDCS aftereffects on cortical excitability were also found in human neocortex &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; and in S1 of alert mice &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;. Application of mematine/D‐AP5 either produced a more uniform DCS‐LTD throughout the cortical thickness or at least abolished DCS‐LTP. Moreover, a combination of memantine and cDCS suppressed KA‐induced seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cDCS aftereffects are not uniform throughout cortical layers, which may explain the incomplete cDCS clinical efficacy. NMDAR antagonists may augment cDCS efficacy in epilepsy and other disorders where regional depression of cortical excitability is desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25817?af=R"/>
		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25817?af=R</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insula epilepsy is rare and can be evaluated effectively by Stereotactic intracerebral EEG (SEEG). Many previous studies of insulo‐opercular seizures have been unable to separate insular and opercular onset. With adequate sampling of the insula, this study shows this is possible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analysed intra‐insular dynamics and extra‐insular propagation in twelve patients with “pure” insula epilepsy (n = 9) or insular and only deepest opercular involvement (n = 3) at seizure onset. Review of semiology defined clinical groups, agglomerative cluster and principal component analysis of semiological features was performed. Quantitative epileptogenicity, intrainsular and extrainsular propagation was computed via time frequency analysis and epileptogenicity mapping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizure onset patterns were heterogeneous, the seizure onset zone was focal. Seizure onset and first ictal change within insula functional subdivision correlated with aura and reflex component. No paninsular spread occurred, contralateral insular spread was very early. Whilst the discharge was intrainsular, clinical signs related to aura or vegetative signs. Extra‐insular propagation was early and related to emergence of majority of clinical signs. Cluster analysis found an anterior, intermediate and posterior insula seizure onset group. The largest principle component separated anterior insula manifestations including early hypermotor signs, early recovery and no aura from posterior insula features of early dystonia, early tonic motor features and sensorimotor aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aura is vital to identifying seizure onset and relates to insula functional subdivision. Seizures are heterogenous, extra‐insula propagation occurs early accounting for most of the semiology. With adequate sampling ‘pure insula’ epilepsy can be identified and focal curative resection is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25788?af=R"/>
		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25788?af=R</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function, and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α‐/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND (Tübingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration) study participants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among risk and prodromal markers, physical activity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical activity, sex, constipation, possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical activity showed an interaction effect. Among other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Physical inactivity and constipation were highest in individuals with the &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes &lt;/i&gt;‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the &lt;i&gt;Prevotella &lt;/i&gt;‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical activity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history, and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.

		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00021</id>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Immunolabeling for adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) is high in hippocampal area CA2 in adult rats, and the potentiating effects of caffeine or other A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-selective antagonists on synaptic responses are particularly robust at Schaffer collateral synapses in CA2. Interestingly, the pronounced staining for A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs in CA2 is not apparent until rats are 4 weeks old, suggesting that developmental changes other than receptor distribution underlie the sensitivity of CA2 synapses to A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonists in young animals. To evaluate the role of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated postsynaptic signals at these synapses, we tested whether A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R agonists regulate synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral inputs to CA2 and CA1. We found that the selective A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist CCPA caused a lasting depression of synaptic responses in both CA2 and CA1 neurons in slices obtained from juvenile rats (P14), but that the effect was observed only in CA2 in slices prepared from adult animals (~P70). Interestingly, blocking phosphodiesterase activity with rolipram inhibited the CCPA-induced depression in CA1, but not in CA2, indicative of robust phosphodiesterase activity in CA1 neurons. Likewise, synaptic responses in CA2 and CA1 differed in their sensitivity to the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, in that it increased synaptic transmission in CA2, but had little effect in CA1. These findings suggest that the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated synaptic depression tracks the postnatal development of immunolabeling for A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and that the enhanced sensitivity to antagonists in CA2 at young ages is likely due to robust adenylyl cyclase activity and weak phosphodiesterase activity rather than to enrichment of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in school closures and distancing requirements that have disrupted both work and family life for many. Concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally. Many medical journals have published papers on the pandemic, which were generated by researchers facing the challenges of these disruptions. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the gender distribution of authors on 1893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with first authors and last authors from the United States. Using mixed-effects regression models, we estimated that the proportion of COVID-19 papers with a woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the same journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested that women’s representation as first authors of COVID-19 research was particularly low for papers published in March and April 2020. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women, especially early-career women, has been affected more than the research productivity of men.</content>

 The surface of insects is coated in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs); variations in the composition of this layer affect a range of traits including adaptation to arid environments and defence against pathogens and toxins. In the African malaria vector, &lt;i&gt;Anopheles gambiae&lt;/i&gt; quantitative and qualitative variance in CHC composition have been associated with speciation, ecological habitat and insecticide resistance. Understanding how these modifications arise will inform us of how mosquitoes are responding to climate change and vector control interventions. CHCs are synthesised in sub-epidermal cells called oenocytes that are very difficult to isolate from surrounding tissues. Here we utilise a transgenic line with fluorescent oenocytes to purify these cells for the first time. Comparative transcriptomics revealed the enrichment of biological processes related to long chain fatty acyl-CoA biosynthesis and elongation of mono-, poly-unsaturated and saturated fatty acids and enabled us to delineate, and partially validate, the hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathway in &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; gambiae&lt;/i&gt;.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Splicing is a vital cellular process that modulates important aspects of animal physiology, yet roles in regulating innate immunity are relatively unexplored. From genetic screens in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, we identified splicing factor RNP-6/PUF60 whose activity suppresses immunity, but promotes longevity, suggesting a tradeoff between these processes. Bacterial pathogen exposure affects gene expression and splicing in a &lt;i&gt;rnp-6&lt;/i&gt; dependent manner, and &lt;i&gt;rnp-6&lt;/i&gt; gain and loss-of-function activities reveal an active role in immune regulation. Another longevity promoting splicing factor, SFA-1, similarly exerts an immuno-suppressive effect, working downstream or parallel to RNP-6. RNP-6 acts through TIR-1/PMK-1/MAPK signaling to modulate immunity. The mammalian homolog, PUF60, also displays anti-inflammatory properties, and its levels swiftly decrease after bacterial infection in mammalian cells, implying a role in the host response. Altogether our findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved modulation of immunity by specific components of the splicing machinery.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Redistribution of inhibitory force feedback between a long toe flexor and the major ankle extensor muscles following spinal cord injury&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6bce8381-5195-4567-8af7-a9bd9a8f8cd3/jnr24630-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golgi tendon organ pathways contribute to coordination of limb extensors during motor tasks including locomotion. Normally, these inhibitory force feedback pathways are flexibly weighted. We show that following spinal cord injury, force feedback is permanently reorganized. Balance is lost and biased inhibition emerges from toe flexors onto ankle extensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory pathways from Golgi tendon organs project widely between muscles crossing different joints and axes of rotation. Evidence suggests that the strength and distribution of this intermuscular inhibition is dependent on motor task and corresponding signals from the brainstem. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether this sensory network is altered after spinal cord hemisection as a potential explanation for motor deficits observed after spinal cord injury (SCI). Force feedback was assessed between the long toe flexor and ankle plantarflexor (flexor hallucis longus), and the three major ankle extensors, (combined gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles) in the hind limbs of unanesthetized, decerebrate, female cats. Data were collected from animals with intact spinal cords (control) and lateral spinal hemisections (LSHs) including chronic LSH (4–20 weeks), subchronic LSH (2 weeks), and acute LSH. Muscles were stretched individually and in pairwise combinations to measure intermuscular feedback between the toe flexor and each of the ankle extensors. In control animals, three patterns were observed (balanced inhibition between toe flexor and ankle extensors, stronger inhibition from toe flexor to ankle extensor, and vice versa). Following spinal hemisection, only strong inhibition from toe flexors onto ankle extensors was observed independent of survival time. The results suggest immediate and permanent reorganization of force feedback in the injured spinal cord. The altered strength and distribution of force feedback after SCI may be an important future target for rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Role of 5‐HT1A and 5‐HT3 receptors in serotonergic activation of sensory neurons in relation to itch and pain behavior in the rat&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/655b86f5-a9ee-4cf5-9773-1c05b065ca34/jnr24633-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. We focused on the identification of the signaling pathways involved in the activation of rat primary afferent neurons by 5‐HT and their involvement in itch and pain sensing. Transient responses evoked by 5‐HT are mediated by ionotropic 5‐HT3 receptors. Sustained responses to 5‐HT require activation of 5‐HT1A receptors coupled to Gi/o, leading to a decrease in membrane conductance, membrane depolarization, opening of voltage‐gated calcium channels and calcium entry. Both responses appear to be involved in triggering serotonergic itch in both male and female Wistar rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. The serotonergic receptors expressed by primary afferent neurons involved in these sensory functions are not fully identified and appear to be to a large extent species dependent. Moreover, the mechanisms through which 5‐HT receptor activation is coupled to changes in neuronal excitability have not been completely revealed. Using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; (calcium and voltage imaging and patch‐clamp) and &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; behavioral methods, we used both male and female Wistar rats to provide evidence for the involvement of two 5‐HT receptor subtypes, 5‐HT1A and 5‐HT3, in mediating the sustained and transient effects, respectively, of 5‐HT on rat primary afferent neurons involved in pain and itch processing. In addition, our results are consistent with a model in which sustained serotonergic responses triggered via the 5‐HT1A receptor are due to closure of background potassium channels, followed by membrane depolarization and action potentials, during which the activation of voltage‐gated calcium channels leads to calcium entry. Our results may provide a better understanding of mammalian serotonergic itch signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Sex differences in the brains of capuchin monkeys (Sapajus [Cebus] apella)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a3d4c737-172b-4626-b874-c2fb5c61559e/cne24950-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A voxel‐based morphometry analysis of 20 capuchin T1‐magnetic resonance imaging scans identified several sex differences in gray matter morphology. Male capuchins showed enlargement in a region of the posterior hypothalamus, possibly including the mammillary bodies, paraventricular nucleus, and/or lateral hypothalamus. Female capuchins showed enlargement in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, likely Crus II, and in the left occipitotemporal cortex, possibly including V2, V3, V4, TEO, and/or MT. These female‐enlarged regions have shown experience‐dependent plasticity in prior primate studies, and tractography indicated that they connect with a distributed network of perceptual and association regions. We postulate that capuchin brains, like human brains and in contrast to rodent brains, may show sex differences related to differential lifetime experience on top of more innate sex differences.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reports an analysis of 20 T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans from tufted capuchin monkeys (5 male, 15 female). We carried out a data‐driven, whole‐brain volumetric analysis on regional gray matter anatomy using voxel‐based morphometry. This revealed that males showed statistically significant expansion of a region of the hypothalamus, while females showed significant expansion in a distributed set of regions, including the cerebellum, early visual cortex, and higher‐order visual regions spanning occipital and temporal cortex. In order to elucidate the network connectivity of these regions, we employed probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. This showed that the female‐enlarged regions connect with distributed association networks across the brain. Notably, this contrasts with rodent studies, where sex differences are focused in deep, ancestral limbic regions involved in the control of reproductive behavior. Additionally, in our data set, for several regions, male and female volumetric measures were completely nonoverlapping. This contrasts with human studies, where sex differences in cortical regions have been reported but are characterized by overlapping rather than divergent male and female values. We suggest that these results can be understood in the context of the different lifetime experiences of males and females, which may produce increased experience‐dependent cortical plasticity in capuchins compared to rodents, and in humans compared to capuchins.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Suppression of active phase voluntary wheel running in male rats by unilateral chronic constriction injury: Enduring therapeutic effects of a brief treatment of morphine combined with TLR4 or P2X7 antagonists&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e432c985-ce9b-4864-ad26-78bb225a72ce/jnr24645-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voluntary wheel running was assessed after peripheral nerve injury. Active phase running distance and speed are also measured in response to morphine alone, or in combination with antagonists of either P2X7R or TLR4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present series of studies examine the impact of systemically administered therapeutics on peripheral nerve injury (males; unilateral sciatic chronic constriction injury [CCI])‐induced suppression of voluntary wheel running, across weeks after dosing cessation. Following CCI, active phase running distance and speed are suppressed throughout the 7‐week observation period. A brief course of morphine, however, increased active phase running distance and speed throughout this same period, an effect apparent only in sham rats. For CCI rats, systemic co‐administration of morphine with antagonists of either P2X7 (A438079) or TLR4 ((+)‐naloxone) (receptors critical to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and consequent inflammatory cascades) returned running behavior of CCI rats to that of shams through 5+ weeks after dosing ceased. This is a striking difference in effect compared to our prior CCI allodynia results using systemic morphine plus intrathecal delivery of these same antagonists, wherein a sustained albeit partial suppression of neuropathic pain was observed. This may point to actions of the systemic drugs at multiple sites along the neuraxis, modulating injury‐induced, inflammasome‐mediated effects at the injured sciatic nerve and/or dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and potentially higher levels. Given that our data to date point to morphine amplifying neuroinflammatory processes put into motion by nerve injury, it is intriguing to speculate that co‐administration of TLR4 and/or P2X7 antagonists can intervene in these inflammatory processes in a beneficial way. That is, that systemic administration of such compounds may suppress inflammatory damage at multiple sites, rapidly and persistently returning neuropathic animals to sham levels of response.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The neurodiagnostic criteria of Leigh syndrome have not yet been clearly redefined based on the expanding of molecular etiologies. We aimed to analyze 20 years of clinical, genetic, and magnetic resonance studies from our Leigh syndrome cohort to provide a detailed description of central nervous system lesions in Leigh syndrome and their biological evolution in view of their genetic and clinical findings. Our study adds new neurodiagnostic insights to the current knowledge of Leigh syndrome, including association with overlapping syndromes, and the correlation of pathogenic genetic variants with neuroimaging phenotypes.

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a medial temporal lobe structure in the brain and is widely studied for its role in memory and learning, in particular, spacial memory and emotional responses. It was thought to be a homogenous structure but emerging evidence shows differentiation along the dorsoventral axis and even microdomains for functional and cellular markers. We have examined in two cell‐types of the hippocampal projection neurons, the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons, if the GABA‐activated tonic current density varied between the dorsal (septal) and the ventral (temporal) poles of the male mouse hippocampus. Tonic synaptic currents, arising from spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC, mIPSC), and extrasynaptic tonic currents were evaluated. The results revealed different levels of sIPSC but not mIPSC density between the dorsal and ventral hippocampal neurons for both the DG granule cells and the CA3 pyramidal neurons. The extrasynaptic tonic current density was larger in the DG granule cells as compared to the CA3 pyramidal neurons but did not vary between the dorsal and ventral regions. IPSC bursting was observed in both cell‐types in the ventral hippocampus but was more common in the CA3 pyramidal neurons. Only in the dorsal DG granule cells was the level of the sIPSC and mIPSC density similar. The results indicate that the tonic GABAergic inhibition is particularly strong in the ventral hippocampal DG granule cells and enhanced in the dorsal as compared to the ventral hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In March 2020, we treated a cohort of 26 critically ill hospitalized SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients who received EEGs to assess unexplained altered mental status, loss of consciousness, or poor arousal and responsiveness. Of the 26 patients studied, 5 patients had EEGs that showed Periodic Discharges (PD) consisting of high amplitude frontal monomorphic delta waves with absence of epileptic activity. These findings may suggest CNS injury potentially related to COVID‐19 in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 A recent paper by Carter et al. identifies a novel organelle, the ribosome-associated vesicle (RAV), that might serve as a portable, local factory for producing proteins destined for the secretory pathway. The appearance of RAVs in dendrites suggests they may serve to generate membrane and secreted proteins in distal processes.</content>

Helping a friend move house, donating to charity, volunteering assistance during a crisis. Humans and other species alike regularly undertake prosocial behaviors—actions that benefit others without necessarily helping ourselves. But how does the brain learn what acts are prosocial? Basile and colleagues show that removal of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) prevents monkeys from learning what actions are prosocial but does not stop them carrying out previously learned prosocial behaviors. This highlights that the ability to learn what actions are prosocial and choosing to perform helpful acts may be distinct cognitive processes, with only the former depending on ACC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZkflowchtXg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A key feature of most social relationships is that we like seeing good things happen to others. Research has implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in attaching value to social outcomes. For example, single neurons in macaque ACC selectively code reward delivery to the self, a partner, both monkeys, or neither monkey. Here, we assessed whether the ACC’s contribution to social cognition is causal by testing rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) on a vicarious reinforcement task before and after they sustained ACC lesions. Prior to surgery, actors learned that 3 different visual cues mapped onto 3 distinct reward outcomes: to self (“Self”), to the other monkey (“Other”), or to neither monkey (“Neither”). On each trial, actors saw a cue that predicted one of the 3 juice offers and could accept the offer by making a saccade to a peripheral target or reject the offer by breaking fixation. Preoperatively, all 6 actors displayed prosocial preferences, indicated by their greater tendency to give reward to Other relative to Neither. Half then received selective, bilateral, excitotoxic lesions of the ACC, and the other half served as unoperated controls. After surgery, all monkeys retained the social preferences they had demonstrated with the preoperatively learned cues, but this preference was reduced in the monkeys with ACC lesions. Critically, none of the monkeys in the ACC lesion group acquired social preferences with a new set of cues introduced after surgery. These data indicate that the primate ACC is necessary for acquisition of prosocial preferences from vicarious reinforcement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3igHUMWRxWg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Ciliary melanin‐concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is widely distributed in the murine CNS in a sex‐independent manner&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b7a204ba-6ff7-40a0-ae87-fe7db0de4e3c/jnr24651-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report the distribution of a receptor found in primary cilia, describing an unprecedent wide distribution in the nervous system, differences between rodent species, and a lack of differences between males and females. Our results suggest melanin‐concentrating hormone may be used to target cilia in a large number of areas of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanin‐concentrating hormone (MCH) is a ubiquitous vertebrate neuropeptide predominantly synthesized by neurons of the diencephalon that can act through two G protein‐coupled receptors, called MCHR1 and MCHR2. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Mchr1 &lt;/i&gt; has been investigated in both rats and mice, but its synthesis remains poorly described. After identifying an antibody that detects MCHR1 with high specificity, we employed immunohistochemistry to map the distribution of MCHR1 in the CNS of rats and mice. Multiple neurochemical markers were also employed to characterize some of the neuronal populations that synthesize MCHR1. Our results show that MCHR1 is abundantly found in a subcellular structure called the primary &lt;i&gt;cilium &lt;/i&gt;, which has been associated, among other functions, with the detection of free neurochemical messengers present in the extracellular space. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in a wide range of areas, including the olfactory bulb, cortical mantle, &lt;i&gt;striatum &lt;/i&gt;, hippocampal formation, amygdala, midline thalamic nuclei, periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, midbrain areas, and in the spinal cord. No differences were observed between male and female mice, and interspecies differences were found in the caudate‐putamen nucleus and the subgranular zone. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in close association with several neurochemical markers, including tyrosine hydroxylase, calretinin, kisspeptin, estrogen receptor, oxytocin, vasopressin, and corticotropin‐releasing factor. Given the role of neuronal primary &lt;i&gt;cilia &lt;/i&gt; in sensing free neurochemical messengers in the extracellular fluid, the widespread distribution of ciliary MCHR1, and the diverse neurochemical populations who synthesize MCHR1, our data indicate that nonsynaptic communication plays a prominent role in the normal function of the MCH system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Caudate nuclei volume alterations and cognition and mood dysfunctions in adolescents with single ventricle heart disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/645d37fb-a21b-4030-a702-8435937a7408/jnr24667-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) adolescents accompany smaller caudate nuclei volumes, localized in the rostral, mid‐dorsolateral, and caudal sites, regions that have projections to memory and mood regulatory areas. These data suggest that SVHD adolescents have brain structural basis for deficient functions in the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolescents with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) exhibit mood and cognitive deficits, which may result from injury to the basal ganglia structures, including the caudate nuclei. However, the integrity of the caudate in SVHD adolescents is unclear. Our aim was to examine the global and regional caudate volumes, and evaluate the relationships between caudate volumes and cognitive and mood scores in SVHD and healthy adolescents. We acquired two high‐resolution T1‐weighted images from 23 SVHD and 37 controls using a 3.0‐Tesla MRI scanner, as well as assessed mood (Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 [PHQ‐9]; Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]; Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning–2; General Memory Index [GMI]) functions. Both left and right caudate nuclei were outlined, which were then used to calculate and compare volumes between groups using ANCOVA (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size), as well as perform 3D surface morphometry. Partial correlations (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size) were used to examine associations between caudate volumes, cognition, and mood scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD subjects showed significantly higher PHQ‐9 and BAI scores, indicating more depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as reduced GMI scores, suggesting impaired cognition, compared to controls. SVHD patients showed significantly reduced caudate volumes (left, 3,198.8 ± 490.1 vs. 3,605.0 ± 480.4 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.004; right, 3,162.1 ± 475.4 vs. 3,504.8 ± 465.9 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.011) over controls, and changes were localized in the rostral, mid‐dorsolateral, and caudal areas. Significant negative correlations emerged between caudate volumes with PHQ‐9 and BAI scores and positive correlations with GMI and MoCA scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD adolescents show significantly reduced caudate volumes, especially in sites that have projections to regulate mood and cognition, which may result from developmental and/or hypoxia‐/ischemia‐induced processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The endocannabinoid system (ECS) acts as a negative feedback mechanism to suppress synaptic transmission and plays a major role in a diverse range of brain functions including, for example, the regulation of mood, energy balance, and learning and memory. The function and dysfunction of the ECS are strongly implicated in multiple psychiatric, neurological, and neurodegenerative diseases. Cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in the brain and, as for any synaptic receptor, CB1R needs to be in the right place at the right time to respond appropriately to changing synaptic circumstances. While CB1R is found intracellularly throughout neurons, its surface expression is highly polarized to the axonal membrane, consistent with its functional expression at presynaptic sites. Surprisingly, despite the importance of CB1R, the interacting proteins and molecular mechanisms that regulate the highly polarized distribution and function of CB1R remain relatively poorly understood. Here we set out what is currently known about the trafficking pathways and protein interactions that underpin the surface expression and axonal polarity of CB1R, and highlight key questions that still need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Physical or psychological stress can cause an immunologic imbalance that disturbs the central nervous system followed by neuroinflammation. The association between inflammation and depression has been widely studied in recent years, though the molecular mechanism is still largely unknown. Thus, targeting the signaling pathways that link stress to neuroinflammation might be a useful strategy against depression. The current study investigated the protective effect of melatonin against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and depression. Our results showed that LPS treatment significantly induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Moreover, LPS-treatment enhanced oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, NF-κB phosphorylation, and glial cell activation markers including GFAP and Iba-1 in the brain of mice. Melatonin treatment significantly abolished the effect of LPS, as indicated by improved depressive-like behaviors, reduced cytokines level, reduced oxidative stress, and normalized LPS-altered Sirt1, Nrf2, and HO-1 expression. However, the melatonin protective effects were reduced after luzindole administration. Collectively, it is concluded that melatonin receptor-dependently protects against LPS-induced depressive-like behaviors via counteracting LPS-induced neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This review focuses on the purinergic ionotropic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) as a potential target for developing drugs that delay the onset and/or disease progression in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Description of clinical and genetic ALS features is followed by an analysis of advantages and drawbacks of transgenic mouse models of disease based on mutations in a bunch of proteins, particularly Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43), Fused in Sarcoma/Translocated in Sarcoma (FUS), and Chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72). Though of limited value, these models are however critical to study the proof of concept of new compounds, before reaching clinical trials. The authors also provide a description of ALS pathogenesis including protein aggregation, calcium-dependent excitotoxicity, dysfunction of calcium-binding proteins, ultrastructural mitochondrial alterations, disruption of mitochondrial calcium handling, and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Understanding disease pathogenic pathways may ease the identification of new drug targets. Subsequently, neuroinflammation linked with P2X7Rs in ALS pathogenesis is described in order to understand the rationale of placing the use of P2X7R antagonists as a new therapeutic pharmacological approach to ALS. This is the basis for the hypothesis that a P2X7R blocker could mitigate the neuroinflammatory state, indirectly leading to neuroprotection and higher motoneuron survival in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients is highly dependent on the precise localization of the target structures such as subthalamic nucleus (STN). Most commonly, microelectrode single unit activity (SUA) recordings are performed to refine the target. This process is heavily experience based and can be technically challenging. Local field potentials (LFPs), representing the activity of a population of neurons, can be obtained from the same microelectrodes used for SUA recordings and allow flexible online processing with less computational complexity due to lower sampling rate requirements. Although LFPs have been shown to contain biomarkers capable of predicting patients’ symptoms and differentiating various structures, their use in the localization of the STN in the clinical practice is not prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Here we present, for the first time, a randomized and double-blinded pilot study with intraoperative online LFP processing in which we compare the clinical benefit from SUA- versus LFP-based implantation. Ten PD patients referred for bilateral STN-DBS were randomly implanted using either SUA or LFP guided targeting in each hemisphere. Although both SUA and LFP were recorded for each STN, the electrophysiologist was blinded to one at a time. Three months postoperatively, the patients were evaluated by a neurologist blinded to the intraoperative recordings to assess the performance of each modality. While SUA-based decisions relied on the visual and auditory inspection of the raw traces, LFP-based decisions were given through an online signal processing and machine learning pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found a dramatic agreement between LFP- and SUA-based localization (16/20 STNs) providing adequate clinical improvement (51.8% decrease in 3-month contralateral motor assessment scores), with LFP-guided implantation resulting in greater average improvement in the discordant cases (74.9%, n = 3 STNs). The selected tracks were characterized by higher activity in beta (11–32 Hz) and high-frequency (200–400 Hz) bands (p &amp;lt; 0.01) of LFPs and stronger non-linear coupling between these bands (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our pilot study shows equal or better clinical benefit with LFP-based targeting. Given the robustness of the electrode interface and lower computational cost, more centers can utilize LFP as a strategic feedback modality intraoperatively, in conjunction to the SUA-guided targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brand awareness plays an important role in most aspects of marketing. However, consumers’ cognitive process of brand awareness, which plays an important role in purchase decision or product usage experiences, is still unclear in the brain. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), the influences of two different brand awareness on consumers’ cognitive process was investigated. Phone pictures with high or low brand awareness and girl pictures were used to carry out this experiment research. An amended oddball task was designed in which girl photos were taken as target stimuli, and phone pictures were taken as non-target stimuli. Subjects were asked to identify the girl pictures. Smaller ERPs components N2 and P3 along with high brand awareness phone pictures were found compared to the low brand awareness ones. The amplitude variation in N2 and P3 indicated that the cognitive process of identification and attention distribution were changed along with the magnitude of brand awareness, which meant consumers could allocate different attention resources to distinguish high or low brand awareness product unconsciously. This may indicate the identification and attention distribution caused by brand awareness can be detected by N2 and P3, and event-related potentials methodology may be a sensitive measurement technique for brand awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) improves functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and is the standard first-line treatment; however, it is associated with many complications, including cerebral hemorrhage. Cancer patients are susceptible to thrombotic events – collectively referred to as Trousseau syndrome (TS) – owing to their hypercoagulable state. Here, we describe the case of a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension for over 10 years who underwent surgery for removal of a cancer of lower esophagus, with no subsequent treatment. Three months later, he was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with sudden dizziness and incoherent speech. Brain computed tomography revealed multiple cerebral infarctions. The patient was treated by IVT with tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) after the onset of symptoms, which improved by the end of the treatment. However, a few months later, he experienced a recurrence of cerebral infarction and hemorrhage, which has rarely been reported. The clinical course of this case suggests that the suitability of thrombolysis with rtPA in the acute phase of cerebral infarction complicated with TS should be carefully considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that vestibular migraine (VM) is a cerebral disease with recurrent vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is an effective type of physical therapy for minimizing vestibular symptoms, as it improves vestibular compensation in patients with VM. Currently, the cerebral regions that are associated with the pathogenesis of VM are largely unknown. To further understand the underlying mechanisms of VM, we performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after 1 month of VR in 14 patients with VM. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores were included as clinical outcomes. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was assessed to characterize spontaneous brain activity. The correlations between the clinical characteristics and ALFF values were assessed. After 1 month of VR training, the DHI scores in patients with VM were significantly lower than those at baseline (p = 0.03), as were the HAMA scores (p = 0.02). We also found that the ALFF values in the left posterior cerebellum of VM patients increased significantly after 1 month of VR training. Moreover, the ALFF values in the left cerebellum were inversely correlated with the patients’ DHI scores. Overall, this study showed that VR exercise for 1 month has a positive effect on vestibular symptoms in patients with VM. Asymmetric cerebellar hyperactivity might be a functional compensation for vestibular dysfunction in patients with VM.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural synchrony in the brain at rest is usually variable and intermittent, thus intervals of predominantly synchronized activity are interrupted by intervals of desynchronized activity. Prior studies suggested that this temporal structure of the weakly synchronous activity might be functionally significant: many short desynchronizations may be functionally different from few long desynchronizations even if the average synchrony level is the same. In this study, we used computational neuroscience methods to investigate the effects of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on the temporal patterns of synchronization in a simple model. We employed a small network of conductance-based model neurons that were connected via excitatory plastic synapses. The dynamics of this network was subjected to the time-series analysis methods used in prior experimental studies. We found that STDP could alter the synchronized dynamics in the network in several ways, depending on the time scale that plasticity acts on. However, in general, the action of STDP in the simple network considered here is to promote dynamics with short desynchronizations (i.e., dynamics reminiscent of that observed in experimental studies). Complex interplay of the cellular and synaptic dynamics may lead to the activity-dependent adjustment of synaptic strength in such a way as to facilitate experimentally observed short desynchronizations in the intermittently synchronized neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Striatal interneurons and spiny projection (SP) neurons are differentially tuned to spectral components of their input. Previous studies showed that spike responses of somatostatin/NPY-expressing low threshold spike (LTS) interneurons have broad frequency tuning, setting these cells apart from other striatal GABAergic interneurons and SP neurons. We investigated the mechanism of LTS interneuron spiking resonance and its relationship to non-spiking membrane impedance resonance, finding that abolition of impedance resonance did not alter spiking resonance. Because LTS interneurons are pacemakers whose rhythmic firing is perturbed by synaptic input, we tested the hypothesis that their spiking resonance arises from their phase resetting properties. Phase resetting curves (PRCs) were measured in LTS interneurons and SP neurons and used to make phase-oscillator models of both cell types. The models reproduced the broad tuning of LTS interneurons, and the differences from SP neurons. The spectral components of the PRC predicted each cell’s sensitivity to corresponding input frequencies. LTS interneuron PRCs contain larger high-frequency components than SP neuron PRCs, providing enhanced responses to input frequencies above the cells’ average firing rates. Thus, LTS cells can be entrained by input oscillations to which SP neurons are less responsive. These findings suggest that feedforward inhibition by LTS interneurons may regulate SP neurons’ entrainment by oscillatory afferents.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Somatosensation encompasses a variety of essential modalities including touch, pressure, proprioception, temperature, pain, and itch. These peripheral sensations are crucial for all types of behaviors, ranging from social interaction to danger avoidance. Somatosensory information is transmitted from primary afferent fibers in the periphery into the central nervous system via the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The dorsal horn functions as an intermediary processing center for this information, comprising a complex network of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons as well as projection neurons that transmit the processed somatosensory information from the spinal cord to the brain. It is now known that there can be dysfunction within this spinal cord circuitry in pathological pain conditions and that these perturbations contribute to the development and maintenance of pathological pain. However, the complex and heterogeneous network of the spinal dorsal horn has hampered efforts to further elucidate its role in somatosensory processing. Emerging optical techniques promise to illuminate the underlying organization and function of the dorsal horn and provide insights into the role of spinal cord sensory processing in shaping the behavioral response to somatosensory input that we ultimately observe. This review article will focus on recent advances in optogenetics and fluorescence imaging techniques in the spinal cord, encompassing findings from both in vivo and in vitro preparations. We will also discuss the current limitations and difficulties of employing these techniques to interrogate the spinal cord and current practices and approaches to overcome these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Dopaminergic neurons are located in several brain areas including the olfactory bulb (OB) and involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the OB, dopamine (DA) is released exclusively by a population of interneurons termed short axon cells (SACs) in the glomerular layer, the initial synaptic integration site of the whole olfactory system. SACs corelease GABA and extend their processes to many glomeruli forming the interglomerular circuit. Two major groups of DA receptors D1-like (D1LRs) and D2-like (D2LRs) types are differentially distributed in the OB, i.e., D1LRs are broadly present except the most superficial olfactory nerve (ON) layer while D2LRs are predominantly confined to the ON and glomerular layers, suggesting that they mediate different physiological functions. In contrast to the well-known D2LR-mediated presynaptic inhibition of ON terminals in the OB, the cellular and circuit targets of the D1LR-mediated DA actions remain unclear even though D1LR activation improves odor detection and discrimination. We recently demonstrated that endogenous DA released from SACs or exogenous DA excites a population of excitatory glomerular neurons termed external tufted cells (ETCs) via D1LRs. But the physiological significance of this D1LR activation is largely unknown. In the present study, we addressed these questions by a systematic examination of exogenous DA actions on synaptic activities and excitabilities in most glomerular neurons and OB output neurons with the following major findings: (1) DA via D1LRs enhances OB output by potentiating the ETC-mediated feedforward excitation to the OB output neurons but suppresses spontaneous excitatory synaptic activities in both types of inhibitory glomerular interneurons periglomerular (PGCs) and SACs; (2) this suppression of excitatory synaptic activities in PGCs and SACs depends on activation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors; (3) DA via D1LRs augments spontaneous inhibitory synaptic activities in all glomerular neurons and OB output neurons; (4) DA selectively activates SACs via D1LRs. These findings suggest that activation of D1LRs elevates the system’s sensitivity to odor stimuli and provide a mechanistic basis for the functional roles of DA in modulating odor detection and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that the cell-to-cell spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) plays important roles in the development of Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD patients who carry α-syn gene mutations often have an earlier onset and more severe clinical symptoms and pathology than sporadic PD cases who carry the wild-type (WT) α-syn gene. However, the molecular mechanism by which α-syn gene mutations promote PD remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that pathogenic mutations facilitate the intercellular transfer and cytotoxicity of α-syn, favoring an early disease onset and faster progression. We investigated the effects of eight known pathogenic mutations in human α-syn (A18T, A29S, A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D, A53E, and A53T) on its pathological transmission in terms of secretion, aggregation, intracellular level, cytotoxicity, seeding, and induction of neuroinflammation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, cultured rat neurons, and microglia, and the rat substantia nigra pars compacta. We found that 2 of the 8 mutations (H50Q and A53T) significantly increased α-syn secretion while 6 mutations (A18T, A29S, A30P, G51D, A53E, and E46K) tended to enhance it. In vitroα-syn aggregation experiments showed that H50Q promoted while G51D delayed aggregation most strongly. Interestingly, 3 mutations (E46K, H50Q, and G51D) greatly increased the intracellular α-syn level when cultured cells were treated with preformed α-syn fibrils (PFFs) compared with the WT, while the other 5 had no effect. We also demonstrated that H50Q, G51D, and A53T PFFs, but not E46K PFFs, efficiently seeded in vivo and acutely induced neuroinflammation in rat substantia nigra pars compacta. Our data indicate that pathogenic mutations augment the prion-like spread of α-syn at different steps and blockade of this pathogenic propagation may serve as a promising therapeutic intervention for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an important modulatory peptide throughout the CNS acting as a neurotransmitter, neurotrophic or neuroprotective factor. In the hippocampus, a brain area implicated in learning and memory processes, VIP has a crucial role in the control of GABAergic transmission and pyramidal cell activity in response to specific network activity by either VIP-containing basket cells or interneuron-selective (IS) interneurons and this appears to have a differential impact in hippocampal-dependent cognition. At the cellular level, VIP regulates synaptic transmission by either promoting disinhibition, through activation of VPAC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, or enhancing pyramidal cell excitability, through activation of VPAC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. These actions also control several important synaptic plasticity phenomena such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). This paper reviews the current knowledge on the activation and multiple functions of VIP expressing cells in the hippocampus and their role in controlling synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory processes, discussing also the role of VPAC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and VPAC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; VIP receptors in the regulation of these different processes. Furthermore, we address the current knowledge regarding changes in VIP mediated neurotransmission in epileptogenesis and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS), and discuss the therapeutic opportunities of using selective VIP receptor ligands to prevent epileptogenesis and cognitive decline in MTLE-HS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic brain disorder characterized by progressive intellectual decline and memory and neuronal loss, caused mainly by extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, primarily in areas implicated in memory and learning as prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. There are two forms of AD, a late-onset form that affects people over 65 years old, and the early-onset form, which is hereditable and affect people at early ages ~45 years. To date, there is no cure for the disease; consequently, it is essential to develop new tools for the study of processes implicated in the disease. Currently, in vitro AD three-dimensional (3D) models using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons have broadened the horizon for in vitro disease modeling and gained interest for mechanistic studies and preclinical drug discovery due to their potential advantages in providing a better physiologically relevant information and more predictive data for in vivo tests. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a 3D cell culture model of AD in vitro using iPSCs carrying the A246E mutation. We generated human iPSCs from fibroblasts from a patient with AD harboring the A246E mutation in the PSEN1 gene. Cell reprogramming was performed using lentiviral vectors with Yamanaka’s factors (OSKM: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). The resulting iPSCs expressed pluripotency genes (such as Nanog and Oct4), alkaline phosphatase activity, and pluripotency stem cell marker expression, such as OCT4, SOX2, TRA-1-60, and SSEA4. iPSCs exhibited the ability to differentiate into neuronal lineage in a 3D environment through dual SMAD inhibition as confirmed by Nestin, MAP2, and Tuj1 neural marker expression. These iPSC-derived neurons harbored Aβ oligomers confirmed by Western Blot (WB) and immunostaining. With human iPSC-derived neurons able to produce Aβ oligomers, we established a novel human hydrogel-based 3D cell culture model that recapitulates Aβ aggregation without the need for mutation induction or synthetic Aβ exposure. This model will allow the study of processes implicated in disease spread throughout the brain, the screening of molecules or compounds with therapeutic potential, and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuroscience is a relatively new and fashionable word that emerged in the 1950s in several countries, including the UK, to describe a multidisciplinary clinical and laboratory approach to the study of the brain, mind, and neuropsychiatric disorders. However collaborative study of neurological and psychiatric disorders can be traced to the 17th century with roots in antiquity. I describe the evolution of our understanding of epilepsy beginning with the first detailed clinical descriptions, associated with supernatural theories, in Babylonian medicine in the second millennium BC. Interest in natural causation arose in the Greco-Roman period when it was first suggested that “the sacred disease” was a disorder of the brain. However, this theory did not take root until the 17th and 18th centuries AD when epilepsy began to be separated from other “convulsive” diseases, including hysteria. In the 19th century developments in neuropathology and our understanding of cortical localization led to the much-debated separation of idiopathic from symptomatic epilepsy which continues to influence international classifications of seizures and epilepsies. Also in the 19th century, the concept of seizures as electrical discharges in the brain evolved, reinforced in the 20th century by the discovery of the electroencephalogram. For many reasons, people with epilepsy have experienced a high incidence of cognitive and psychosocial disorders. Epilepsy, which is a global problem, has, therefore, remained a bridge between neurology and psychiatry. Furthermore, the study of epilepsy continues to shed light on brain function and other neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with disruptions in the resting-state functional architecture of the brain. Previous studies have primarily focused on age-related declines in the default mode network (DMN) and its implications in Alzheimer’s disease. However, due to mixed findings, it is unclear if changes in resting-state network functional connectivity are linked to cognitive decline in healthy older adults. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of intra-network coherence for four higher-order cognitive resting-state networks on a sensitive measure of cognitive aging (i.e., NIH Toolbox Fluid Cognition Battery) in 154 healthy older adults with a mean age of 71 and education ranging between 12 years and 21 years (mean = 16). Only coherence within the cingulo-opercular network (CON) was significantly related to Fluid Cognition Composite scores, explaining more variance in scores than age and education. Furthermore, we mapped CON connectivity onto fluid cognitive subdomains that typically decline in advanced age. Greater CON connectivity was associated with better performance on episodic memory, attention, and executive function tasks. Overall, the present study provides evidence to propose CON coherence as a potential novel neural marker for nonpathological cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The regenerative capacity of injured peripheral nerves is diminished with aging. To identify factors that contribute to this impairment, we compared the immune cell response in young vs. aged animals following nerve injury. First, we confirmed that macrophage accumulation is delayed in aged injured nerves which is due to defects in monocyte migration as a result of defects in site-specific recruitment signals in the aged nerve. Interestingly, impairment in both macrophage accumulation and functional recovery could be overcome by transplanting bone marrow from aged animals into young mice. That is, upon exposure to a youthful environment, monocytes/macrophages originating from the aged bone marrow behaved similarly to young cells. Transcriptional profiling of aged macrophages following nerve injury revealed that both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes were largely downregulated in aged compared to young macrophages. One ligand of particular interest was macrophage-associated secreted protein (MCP1), which exhibited a potent role in regulating aged axonal regrowth in vitro. Given that macrophage-derived MCP1 is significantly diminished in the aged injured nerve, our data suggest that age-associated defects in MCP1 signaling could contribute to the regenerative deficits that occur in the aged nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the neural mechanisms of the contextual interference effect (CIE) and parameter similarity on motor learning in older adults. Sixty older adults (mean age, 67.68 ± 3.95 years) were randomly assigned to one of six experimental groups: blocked-similar, algorithm-similar, random-similar, blocked-dissimilar, algorithm-dissimilar, and random-dissimilar. Algorithm practice was a hybrid practice schedule (a combination of blocked, serial, and random practice) that switching between practice schedules were based on error trial number, ≤33%. The sequential motor task was used to record the absolute timing for the absolute timing goals (ATGs). In similar conditions, the participants’ performance was near ATGs (1,350, 1,500, 1,650 ms) and in dissimilar conditions, they performed far ATGs (1,050, 1,500, 1,950 ms) with the same spatial sequence for all groups. EEG signals were continuously collected during the acquisition phase and delayed retention. Data were analyzed in different bands (alpha and beta) and scalp locations (frontal: Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4; central: C3, C4; and parietal: P3, P4) with repeated measures on the last factor. The analyses were included motor preparation and intertrial interval (motor evaluation) periods in the first six blocks and the last six blocks, respectively. The results of behavioral data indicated that algorithm practice resulted in medium error related to classic blocked and random practice during the acquisition, however, algorithm practice outperformed the classic blocked and random practice in the delayed retention test. The results of EEG data demonstrated that algorithm practice, due to optimal activity in the frontal lobe (medium alpha and beta activation at prefrontal), resulted in increased activity of sensorimotor areas (high alpha activation at C3 and P4) in older adults. Also, EEG data showed that similar conditions could affect the intertrial interval period (medium alpha and beta activation in frontal in the last six-block), while the dissimilar conditions could affect the motor preparation period (medium alpha and beta activation in frontal in the first six-block). In conclusion, algorithm practice can enhance motor learning and optimize the efficiency of brain activity, resulting in the achievement of a desirable goal in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Although movement ecology has leveraged models of home range formation to explore the effects of spatial heterogeneity and social cues on movement behavior, disease ecology has yet to integrate these potential drivers and mechanisms of contact behavior into a generalizable disease modeling framework. Here we ask how dynamic territory formation and maintenance might contribute to disease dynamics in a territorial, solitary predator for an indirectly transmitted pathogen. We developed a mechanistic individual-based model where stigmergy—the deposition of signals into the environment (e.g., scent marking, scraping)—dictates local movement choices and long-term territory formation, but also the risk of pathogen transmission. Based on a variable importance analysis, the length of the infectious period was the single most important variable in predicting outbreak success, maximum prevalence, and outbreak duration. Host density and rate of pathogen decay were also key predictors. We found that territoriality best reduced maximum prevalence in conditions where we would otherwise expect outbreaks to be most successful: slower recovery rates (i.e., longer infectious periods) and higher conspecific densities. However, for slower pathogen decay rates, stigmergy-driven movement increased outbreak durations relative to random movement simulations. Our findings therefore support a limited version of the “territoriality benefits” hypothesis—where reduced home range overlap leads to reduced opportunities for pathogen transmission, but with the caveat that reduction in outbreak severity may increase the likelihood of pathogen persistence. For longer infectious periods and higher host densities, key trade-offs emerged between the strength of pathogen load, the strength of the stigmergy cue, and the rate at which those two quantities decayed; this finding raises interesting questions about the evolutionary nature of these competing processes and the role of possible feedbacks between parasitism and territoriality. This work also highlights the importance of considering social cues as part of the movement landscape in order to better understand the consequences of individual behaviors on population level outcomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hx7Ij3rh8bk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological data from the last decades point to an exponential growth in the number of obese people. Different behavioral factors, mainly associated with food consumption, appear to contribute significantly to its development. Concomitant with increased obesity rates, an increase in the consumption of fructose has been observed; therefore, fructose consumption has been implicated as an important obesogenic factor. However, changes in brain activity due to fructose consumption are possible, especially in relation to hypothalamic satiety mechanisms. In addition, the obese state may provide an environment of chronic inflammation and further contribute to the discontinuation of satiety mechanisms in the hypothalamus. We briefly review the intrinsic alterations to the increased adipose tissue, its connections with the hypothalamus in the control of energy signaling mechanisms and, consequently, the participation of fructose as a co‐adjuvant or trigger. Presenting the current context with clinical trials involving human and animal studies, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of the role of fructose in the progression of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Sex differences in c‐Fos and EGR‐1/Zif268 activity maps of rat sacral spinal cord following cystometry‐induced micturition&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/59365d1e-090a-4f33-a5bd-09c881c2b050/cne24949-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major part of the circuit that coordinates bladder voiding is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression. Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage and voiding of urine from the lower urinary tract (LUT) must be timed precisely to occur in appropriate behavioral contexts. A major part of the CNS circuit that coordinates this activity is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Immediate early gene (IEG) activity mapping has been widely used to investigate the lumbosacral LUT‐related circuit, but most reports focus on the effects of noxious stimulation in anesthetized female rats. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In females, after cystometry c‐Fos neurons in spinal cord segments L5–S2 were concentrated in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN), dorsal horn laminae II–IV, and dorsal commissural nucleus (SDCom). Comparisons of cystometry and control groups in male and female revealed sex differences. Activity mapping suggested dorsal horn laminae II–IV was activated in females but showed net inhibition in males. However, inhibition in male rats was not detected by EGR‐1 activity mapping, which showed low coexpression with c‐Fos. A class of catecholamine neurons in SPN and SDCom neurons were also more strongly activated by micturition in females. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression. In conclusion, IEG mapping in awake male and female rats has extended our understanding of the functional molecular anatomy of the LUT‐related circuit in spinal cord. Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Central afferents to the nucleus of the solitary tract in rats and mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/73a99d27-e6dd-4eef-ab35-47de72da0bcf/cne24927-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rats and mice have similar patterns of retrogradely labeled neurons that project axons to the NTS.
Afferent neurons in the hypothalamus are glutamatergic, while those in the amygdala are GABAergic.
In the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, NTS afferent neurons are distinct from neuroendocrine neurons.
Injecting retrograde tracers into the medial and lateral NTS subdivisions produce similar patterns of retrograde labeling.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulates life‐sustaining functions ranging from appetite and digestion to heart rate and breathing. It is also the brain's primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top‐down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain‐wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone‐sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS‐projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6 &lt;/i&gt;/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc32a1 &lt;/i&gt;/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington's nucleus, Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral “mind–body” symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether pregnancy is associated with cervical artery dissection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a case–control study using claims data from all nonfederal emergency departments and acute care hospitals in New York and Florida between 2005–2015. Cases were women 12–42 years of age hospitalized with cervical artery dissection, defined using validated diagnosis codes for carotid/vertebral artery dissection. Controls were women 12–42 years of age with a primary diagnosis of renal colic. Cases and controls were matched 1:1 on age, race, insurance, income, state, and visit year. The exposure variable was pregnancy, defined as labor and delivery within 90 days before or 6 months after the index visit. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of pregnancy between cases and controls. We performed a secondary cohort‐crossover study comparing the risk of cervical artery dissection during pregnancy versus the same time period 1 year later.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy was twice as common among 826 women with cervical artery dissection compared to the 826 matched controls with renal colic (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–4.7). In our secondary analysis, pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of cervical artery dissection (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.5), with the heightened risk limited to the postpartum period (IRR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.6–11.7).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy, specifically the postpartum period, was associated with hospitalization for cervical artery dissection. Although these findings may partly reflect ascertainment bias, our results suggest that arterial dissection is one mechanism by which pregnancy can lead to stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Neurofilament-light chain (NF-L) is a well-known clinical biomarker of many neurodegenerative diseases. By analyzing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma, progression of NF-L levels can forecast conversion from the presymptomatic to symptomatic stage and time of survival. The use of plasma for NF-L measurement makes this biomarker exceptionally valuable for clinical studies since sample collection can be performed repeatedly without causing much harm. Detailed analyses of NF-L expression in neurodegenerative disease patient’s samples were already performed, while NF-L levels of preclinical models of ALS, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease as well as lysosomal storage diseases are still widely unknown. We therefore evaluated NF-L levels in the plasma of the ALS models SOD1-G93A low expressor and TAR6/6 mice, the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model 5xFAD, the Parkinson’s disease model Line 61 and the Gaucher disease (GD) model 4L/PS-NA and the CSF of selected models. Our results show that NF-L levels are highly increased in the plasma of ALS, Alzheimer’s and GD models, while in the analyzed Parkinson’s disease model NF-L plasma levels barely changed. Most analyzed models show a progressive increase of NF-L levels. NF-L measurements in the plasma of the neurodegenerative disease mouse models of ALS and AD are thus a good tool to evaluate disease progression. Compared to analyses in human tissues, our results suggest a high translation value of murine NF-L levels and their progression. Furthermore, our data indicate that NF-L might also be a good biomarker for disorders with a neuronal component like some lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Progressive neuronal death during tauopathies is associated with aggregation of modified, truncated or mutant forms of tau protein. Such aggregates are neurotoxic, promote spreading of tau aggregation, and trigger release of pro-inflammatory factors by glial cells. Counteracting such pathogenic effects of tau by simultaneously inhibiting protein aggregation as well as pro-inflammatory glial cell responses would be of significant therapeutic interest. Here, we examined the use of the small heat-shock protein HspB5 for this purpose. As a molecular chaperone, HspB5 counteracts aggregation of a wide range of abnormal proteins. As a TLR2 agonist, it selectively activates protective responses by CD14-expressing myeloid cells including microglia. We show that intracerebral infusion of HspB5 in transgenic mice with selective neuronal expression of mutant human P301S tau has significant neuroprotective effects in the superficial, frontal cortical layers. Underlying these effects at least in part, HspB5 induces several potent neuroprotective mediators in both astrocytes and microglia including neurotrophic factors and increased potential for removal of glutamate. Together, these findings highlight the potentially broad therapeutic potential of HspB5 in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The misfolding of transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions, but also plays a role in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease. It is thought that different truncations at the N- and C-termini of TDP-43 contribute to its misfolding and aggregation in the brain, and that these aberrant TDP-43 fragments contribute to disease. Despite this, little is known about whether different truncation events influence the protein’s transmissibility between cells and how this cell-to-cell transfer occurs. In this study, we use a well-established cellular model to study the efficiency by which full-length and truncated TDP-43 fragments are transferred between neuron-like cells. We demonstrate that preservation of the N-terminus of TDP-43 enhances its transmissibility between cells and that this protein transmission occurs in a manner exclusive of extracellular vesicles, instead requiring cellular proximity for efficient propagation. These data indicate that the N-terminus of TDP-43 might be a useful target in the generation of therapeutics to limit the spread of TDP-43 pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The linearity and stationarity of fMRI time series need to be understood due to their important roles in the choice of approach for brain network analysis. In this paper, we investigated the stationarity and linearity of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time-series data from the Midnight Scan Club datasets. The degree of stationarity (DS) and the degree of non-linearity (DN) were, respectively, estimated for the time series of all gray matter voxels. The similarity and difference between the DS and DN were assessed in terms of voxels and intrinsic brain networks, including the visual network, somatomotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention network, limbic network, frontoparietal network, and default-mode network. The test-retest scans were utilized to quantify the reliability of DS and DN. We found that DS and DN maps had overlapping spatial distribution. Meanwhile, the probability density estimate function of DS had a long tail, and that of DN had a more normal distribution. Specifically, stronger DS was present in the somatomotor, limbic, and ventral attention networks compared to other networks, and stronger DN was found in the somatomotor, visual, limbic, ventral attention, and default-mode networks. The percentage of overlapping voxels between DS and DN in different networks demonstrated a decreasing trend in the order default mode, ventral attention, somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, visual, and limbic. Furthermore, the ICC values of DS were higher than those of DN. Our results suggest that different functional networks have distinct properties of non-stationarity and non-linearity owing to the complexity of rs-fMRI time series. Thus, caution should be taken when analyzing fMRI data (both resting-state and task-activation) using simplified models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Prior studies have shown that there is an inverse association between birth weight and stroke in adulthood; however, whether such association is causal remains yet known and those studies cannot distinguish between the direct fetal effect and the indirect maternal effect. The aim of the study is to untangle such relationship using novel statistical genetic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We first utilized linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and Genetic analysis incorporating Pleiotropy and Annotation (GPA) to estimate the overall genetic correlation between birth weight and stroke. Then, with a set of valid birth-weight instruments which had adjusted fetal and maternal effects, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate its causal effect on stroke based summary statistics from large scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 264,498 for birth weight and 446,696 for stroke). We further validated the MR results with extensive sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Both LDSC and GPA demonstrated significant evidence of shared maternal genetic foundation between birth weight and stroke, with the genetic correlation estimated to −0.176. However, no fetal genetic correlation between birth weight and stroke was detected. Furthermore, the inverse variance weighted MR demonstrated the maternally causal effect of birth weight on stroke was 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.27). The maternal ORs of birth weight on three subtypes of stroke including cardioembolic stroke (CES), large artery stroke (LAS) and small vessel stroke (SVS) were 1.16 (95% CI 0.93–1.43), 1.50 (95% CI 1.14–1.96) and 1.47 (95% CI 1.15–1.87), respectively. In contrast, no fetal causal associations were found between birth weight and stroke or the subtypes. Those results were robust against extensive sensitivity analyses, with Egger regression ruling out the possibility of pleiotropy and multivariable MR excluding the likelihood of confounding or mediation effects of other risk factors of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study provides empirically supportive evidence on the fetal developmental origins of stroke and its subtypes. However, further investigation is warranted to understand the pathophysiological role of low birth weight in developing stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Among dementia-like diseases, Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are two of the most frequent. AD and VD may share multiple neurological symptoms that may lead to controversial diagnoses when using conventional clinical and MRI criteria. Therefore, other approaches are needed to overcome this issue. Machine learning (ML) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of several neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia. To this end, in this study, we investigated, first, whether different kinds of ML algorithms, combined with advanced MRI features, could be supportive in classifying VD from AD and, second, whether the developed approach might help in predicting the prevalent disease in subjects with an unclear profile of AD or VD. Three ML categories of algorithms were tested: artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Multiple regional metrics from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 60 subjects (33 AD, 27 VD) were used as input features to train the algorithms and find the best feature pattern to classify VD from AD. We then used the identified VD–AD discriminant feature pattern as input for the most performant ML algorithm to predict the disease prevalence in 15 dementia patients with a “mixed VD–AD dementia” (MXD) clinical profile using their baseline MRI data. ML predictions were compared with the diagnosis evidence from a 3-year clinical follow-up. ANFIS emerged as the most efficient algorithm in discriminating AD from VD, reaching a classification accuracy greater than 84% using a small feature pattern. Moreover, ANFIS showed improved classification accuracy when trained with a multimodal input feature data set (e.g., DTI + rs-fMRI metrics) rather than a unimodal feature data set. When applying the best discriminant pattern to the MXD group, ANFIS achieved a correct prediction rate of 77.33%. Overall, results showed that our approach has a high discriminant power to classify AD and VD profiles. Moreover, the same approach also showed potential in predicting earlier the prevalent underlying disease in dementia patients whose clinical profile is uncertain between AD and VD, therefore suggesting its usefulness in supporting physicians' diagnostic evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS) allows for responses to changing environmental signals. While the majority of studies on brain plasticity focus on neuronal synapses, myelin plasticity has now begun to emerge as a potential modulator of neuronal networks. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) produce myelin, which provides fast signal transmission, allows for synchronization of neuronal inputs, and helps to maintain neuronal function. Thus, myelination is also thought to be involved in learning. OLs differentiate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which are distributed throughout the adult brain, and myelination continues into late adulthood. This process is orchestrated by numerous cellular and molecular signals, such as axonal diameter, growth factors, extracellular signaling molecules, and neuronal activity. However, the relative importance of, and cooperation between, these signaling pathways is currently unknown. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge about myelin plasticity in the CNS. We discuss new insights into the link between this type of plasticity, learning and behavior, as well as mechanistic aspects of myelin formation that may underlie myelin plasticity, highlighting OPC diversity in the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We recently reported that intravenous bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) transplantation in stroke improves neurological function through improvement of cerebral metabolism. Cerebral metabolism is known to diminish with aging, and the reduction of metabolism is one of the presumed causes of neurological decline in the elderly. We report herein that transcription of glucose transporters, monocarboxylate transporters, and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase is downregulated in the hippocampus of aged mice with impaired neurological functions. Intravenous BM-MNC transplantation in aged mice stimulated the transcription of glucose transporter 1 and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase α1 followed by restoration of neurological function. As glucose transporters and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases are closely related to cerebral metabolism and neurological function, our data indicate that BM-MNC transplantation in aged mice has the potential to restore neurological function by activating transcription of glucose transporter and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase. Furthermore, our data indicate that changes in transcription of glucose transporter and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase could be surrogate biomarkers for age-related neurological impairment as well as quantifying the efficacy of therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Understanding cellular remodeling in response to mechanical stimuli is a critical step in elucidating mechanical activation of biochemical signaling pathways. Experimental evidence indicates that external stress-induced subcellular adaptation is accomplished through dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization. To study the interactions between subcellular structures involved in transducing mechanical signals, we combined experimental and computational simulations to evaluate real-time mechanical adaptation of the actin cytoskeletal network. Actin cytoskeleton was imaged at the same time as an external tensile force was applied to live vascular smooth muscle cells using a fibronectin-functionalized atomic force microscope probe. Moreover, we performed computational simulations of active cytoskeletal networks under an external tensile force. The experimental data and simulation results suggest that mechanical structural adaptation occurs before chemical adaptation during filament bundle formation: actin filaments first align in the direction of the external force by initializing anisotropic filament orientations, then the chemical evolution of the network follows the anisotropic structures to further develop the bundle-like geometry. Our findings present an alternative two-step explanation for the formation of actin bundles due to mechanical stimulation and provide new insights into the mechanism of mechanotransduction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JNg99gy_cCc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mitochondrial metabolic remodeling is a hallmark of the &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; digenetic life cycle because the insect stage utilizes a cost-effective oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to generate ATP, while bloodstream cells switch to aerobic glycolysis. Due to difficulties in acquiring enough parasites from the tsetse fly vector, the dynamics of the parasite’s metabolic rewiring in the vector have remained obscure. Here, we took advantage of in vitro–induced differentiation to follow changes at the RNA, protein, and metabolite levels. This multi-omics and cell-based profiling showed an immediate redirection of electron flow from the cytochrome-mediated pathway to an alternative oxidase (AOX), an increase in proline consumption, elevated activity of complex II, and certain tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, which led to mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Interestingly, these ROS molecules appear to act as signaling molecules driving developmental progression because ectopic expression of catalase, a ROS scavenger, halted the in vitro–induced differentiation. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of the parasite’s mitochondrial rewiring and reinforce the emerging concept that mitochondria act as signaling organelles through release of ROS to drive cellular differentiation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1GfoirEEJbI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In the tumor microenvironment, local immune dysregulation is driven in part by macrophages and dendritic cells that are polarized to a mixed proinflammatory/immune-suppressive phenotype. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is emerging as the possible origin of these events. Here we report that the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α) branch of the UPR is directly involved in the polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo, including the up-regulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-23, Arginase1, as well as surface expression of CD86 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Macrophages in which the IRE1α/X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) axis is blocked pharmacologically or deleted genetically have significantly reduced polarization and CD86 and PD-L1 expression, which was induced independent of IFNγ signaling, suggesting a novel mechanism in PD-L1 regulation in macrophages. Mice with IRE1α- but not Xbp1-deficient macrophages showed greater survival than controls when implanted with B16.F10 melanoma cells. Remarkably, we found a significant association between the IRE1α gene signature and &lt;i&gt;CD274&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages in humans. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) analysis showed that bone marrow–derived macrophages with IRE1α deletion lose the integrity of the gene connectivity characteristic of regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD) and the ability to activate &lt;i&gt;CD274&lt;/i&gt; gene expression. Thus, the IRE1α/Xbp1 axis drives the polarization of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment initiating a complex immune dysregulation leading to failure of local immune surveillance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/BN5X2l_bEwY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Objective: &lt;/b&gt; To foster trial‐readiness of coenzyme Q8A (COQ8A)‐ataxia, we map the clinicogenetic, molecular, and neuroimaging spectrum of COQ8A‐ataxia in a large worldwide cohort, and provide first progression data, including treatment response to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Methods: &lt;/b&gt; Cross‐modal analysis of a multicenter cohort of 59 COQ8A patients, including genotype–phenotype correlations, 3D‐protein modeling, in vitro mutation analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers, disease progression, and CoQ10 response data.&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Results: &lt;/b&gt; Fifty‐nine patients (39 novel) with 44 pathogenic &lt;i&gt;COQ8A &lt;/i&gt; variants (18 novel) were identified. Missense variants demonstrated a pleiotropic range of detrimental effects upon protein modeling and in vitro analysis of purified variants. COQ8A‐ataxia presented as variable multisystemic, early‐onset cerebellar ataxia, with complicating features ranging from epilepsy (32%) and cognitive impairment (49%) to exercise intolerance (25%) and hyperkinetic movement disorders (41%), including dystonia and myoclonus as presenting symptoms. Multisystemic involvement was more prevalent in missense than biallelic loss‐of‐function variants (82–93% vs 53%; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.029). Cerebellar atrophy was universal on MRI (100%), with cerebral atrophy or dentate and pontine T2 hyperintensities observed in 28%. Cross‐sectional (n = 34) and longitudinal (n = 7) assessments consistently indicated mild‐to‐moderate progression of ataxia (SARA: 0.45/year). CoQ10 treatment led to improvement by clinical report in 14 of 30 patients, and by quantitative longitudinal assessments in 8 of 11 patients (SARA: −0.81/year). Explorative sample size calculations indicate that ≥48 patients per arm may suffice to demonstrate efficacy for interventions that reduce progression by 50%.&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Interpretation: &lt;/b&gt; This study provides a deeper understanding of the disease, and paves the way toward large‐scale natural history studies and treatment trials in COQ8A‐ataxia.&lt;/h2&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anatomy and physiology of monosynaptic connections in rodent hippocampal CA1 have been extensively studied in recent decades. Yet, the resulting knowledge remains disparate and difficult to reconcile. Here, we present a data‐driven approach to integrate the current state‐of‐the‐art knowledge on the synaptic anatomy and physiology of rodent hippocampal CA1, including axo‐dendritic innervation patterns, number of synapses per connection, quantal conductances, neurotransmitter release probability, and short‐term plasticity into a single coherent resource. First, we undertook an extensive literature review of paired recordings of hippocampal neurons and compiled experimental data on their synaptic anatomy and physiology. The data collected in this manner is sparse and inhomogeneous due to the diversity of experimental techniques used by different groups, which necessitates the need for an integrative framework to unify these data. To this end, we extended a previously developed workflow for the neocortex to constrain a unifying in silico reconstruction of the synaptic physiology of CA1 connections. Our work identifies gaps in the existing knowledge and provides a complementary resource toward a more complete quantification of synaptic anatomy and physiology in the rodent hippocampal CA1 region.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical feedback pathways are proposed to guide cognition and behavior according to context and goal-direction. At the cellular level, cortical feedback pathways target multiple excitatory and inhibitory populations. However, we currently lack frameworks that link how the cellular mechanisms of cortical feedback pathways underlie their cognitive/behavioral functions. To establish this link, we expand on the framework of signal routing, the ability of cortical feedback pathways to proactively modulate how feedforward signals are propagated throughout the cortex. We propose that cortical feedback modulates routing through multiple mechanisms: preparing intended motor representations, setting the trigger conditions for evoking cortical outputs, altering coupling strengths between cortical regions, and suppressing expected sensory representations. In developing this framework, we first define the anatomy of cortical feedback pathways and identify recent advances in studying their functions at high specificity and resolution. Second, we review the diverse functions of cortical feedback pathways throughout the cortical hierarchy and evaluate these functions from the framework of signal routing. Third, we review the conserved cellular targets and circuit impacts of cortical feedback. Fourth, we introduce the concept of the “cortical landscape,” a graphical depiction of the routes through cortex that are favored at a specific moment in time. We propose that the cortical landscape, analogous to energy landscapes in physics and chemistry, can capture important features of signal routing including coupling strength, trigger conditions, and preparatory states. By resolving the cortical landscape, we may be able to quantify how the cellular processes of cortical feedback ultimately shape cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In animal models, monocular deprivation (MD) by lid closure mimics the effects of unilateral amblyopia in humans. Temporary inactivation of one or both eyes with intraocular administration of tetrodotoxin (TTX) has recently been shown to promote recovery from the anatomical effects of MD at post-critical period ages when standard recovery strategies fail. In the current study, the retinae and optic nerves of animals subjected to 10 days of monocular retinal inactivation were assessed for pathological changes as a means of assessing the viability of this potential new amblyopia therapy. Retinal sections from both eyes were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and were then examined for cell density and soma size in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Sections of the optic nerve from each eye were examined for neurofilament protein, myelin, glial cell density, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Our study revealed no evidence of gross histopathological abnormalities following inactivation for 10 days, nor was there evidence of degeneration of axons or loss of myelin in the optic nerve serving inactivated eyes. On all measurements, the inactivated eye was indistinguishable from the fellow eye, and both were comparable to normal controls. We confirmed that our inactivation protocol obliterated visually-evoked potentials for 10 consecutive days, but visual responses were restored to normal after the effects of inactivation wore off. Notwithstanding the critical need for further assessment of ocular and retinal health following inactivation, these results provide evidence that retinal inactivation as a treatment for amblyopia does not produce significant retinal damage or degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) connect muscle fibers with motor neurons and enable the coordinated contraction of skeletal muscles. The dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC) is an essential component of the postsynaptic machinery of the NMJ and is important for the maintenance of NMJ structural integrity. To identify novel proteins that are important for NMJ organization, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screen for interactors of α-dystrobrevin 1 (aDB1), one of the components of the DGC. The guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Arhgef5 was found to be one of the aDB1 binding partners that is recruited to Tyr-713 in a phospho-dependent manner. We show here that Arhgef5 localizes to the NMJ and that its genetic depletion in the muscle causes the fragmentation of the synapses in conditional knockout mice. Arhgef5 loss in vivo is associated with a reduction in the levels of active GTP-bound RhoA and Cdc42 GTPases, highlighting the importance of actin dynamics regulation for the maintenance of NMJ integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Studies on transcranial current stimulation have shown that a direct current stimulation of the occipital cortex can influence the amplitude size of a visual evoked potential (VEP). The current direction (cathodal or anodal) determines whether the VEP amplitudes increase or decrease. The aim of this study was to design a new experimental setup that will enable a simultaneous ocular direct current stimulation and electroretinogram (ERG) recording which will broaden our understanding of current stimulation effects on the visual system. Furthermore, we examined whether a direct current stimulation on the eye has a similar effect on an ERG as on a VEP. The pattern-reversal ERG was measured with sintered Ag/AgCl skin-electrodes, positioned on the lower eyelid (active), the earlobe (reference), and the forehead (ground). Direct current was applied through a ring rubber electrode placed around the eye and a 5 cm × 5 cm rubber electrode placed at the ipsilateral temple with a current strength of 500 μA and a duration time of 5 min. Fifty-seven healthy volunteers were divided into three groups depending on the current direction (cathodal, anodal, and sham stimulation, n = 19 each). One ERG measurement (ERG 1) was performed before and another (ERG 2) during the direct current stimulation. The difference between ERG 1 and ERG 2 measurements for the characteristic P50, N95 and N95′ (N95 minimum measured from zero line) amplitudes were evaluated by both confidence interval analysis and t-test for related samples (α = 0.05, after Bonferroni correction p&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0055). The P50 amplitude was significantly decreased for ERG 2 measurement in the cathodal and anodal stimulation group (cathodal p = 0.001, anodal p = 0.000). No significant changes could be found in the N95 and N95′ amplitudes as well as in the sham-stimulation group. Additionally, the latencies did not undergo any significant changes. In conclusion, the newly designed experimental setup enables simultaneous current stimulation and ERG recording. The current influenced P50 amplitude although not the N95 and N95′ amplitudes. Furthermore, the amplitude size decreased for both current directions and did not lead to contrary effects as expected.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The core learning mechanisms of neurofeedback (NF) training are associative, implicit, and, consequently, largely impervious to consciousness. Many other aspects of training that determine training outcomes, however, are accessible to conscious processing. The outcomes of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) up-regulation training are related to the strategies reported by participants. The classification methods of individual strategies employed hitherto were possibly under influence of the idiosyncratic interpretation of the rater. To measure and possibly overcome this limitation, we employed independent raters to analyze strategies reported during SMR up-regulation training. Sixty-two healthy young participants took part in a single session of SMR up-regulation training. After completing six blocks of training, in which they received either simple visual feedback or a gamified version thereof, participants were required to report the strategies employed. Their individual learning outcomes were computed as well. Results point out that individual strategies as well as NF learning outcomes were not particularly sensitive to the presence of gamified elements in training the SMR up-regulation. A high degree of consistency across independent raters classifying strategy reports was observed. Some strategies were more typical of responders while other ones were more common among non-responders. In summary, we demonstrate a more objective and transparent way to analyze individual mental strategies to shed more light on the differences between NF responders and non-responders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising brain imaging modality for studying the neural substrates of moral emotions. However, the feasibility of using fNIRS to measure moral emotions has not been established. In the present study, we used fNIRS to detect the brain activation evoked by two typical moral emotions—guilt and shame. We presented the participants with guilt and shame context to evoke emotional responses and measured the brain activity by using fNIRS. The univariate general linear model analysis showed significant activations for both emotions in the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and middle temporal gyrus, and specific activation for guilt in the right temporoparietal junction. The multivariate classification analysis showed an overall recognition accuracy of 52.50%, which was significantly higher than the chance level in classifying the guilt, shame, and neutral emotions. These results suggested the feasibility of using fNIRS to assess the brain activation evoked by guilt and shame and demonstrated the potentials of fNIRS in studying the neural correlates of moral emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder (MDD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are among the most prevalent and frequently co-occurring psychiatric disorders in adults and may have, at least in part, a common etiology. However, the unique and the shared neuroanatomical characteristics of the two disorders have not been fully identified. The aim of this study was to compare the topological organization of gray matter networks between non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients and SAD patients. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 37 non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients, 24 non-comorbid medication-naive SAD patients, and 41 healthy controls. Single-subject gray matter graphs were extracted from structural MRI scans, and whole-brain neuroanatomic organization was compared across the three groups. The relationships between brain network measures and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Relative to healthy controls, both the MDD and the SAD patients showed global decreases in clustering coefficient, normalized clustering coefficient, and small-worldness and locally decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the left insular, lingual, and calcarine cortices. Compared with healthy controls, the SAD patients exhibited increased nodal centralities and morphological connections mainly involving the prefrontal cortex and the sensorimotor network. Furthermore, compared to the SAD patients, the MDD patients showed increased characteristic path length, reduced global efficiency, and decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus. Our findings provide new evidence for shared and specific similarity-based gray matter network alterations in MDD and SAD and emphasize that the psychopathological changes in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus might be different between the two disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The APOE gene alleles modify human aging and the response to the diet at many levels with diverse pleotropic effects from gut to brain. To understand the interactions of APOE isoforms and diet, we analyze how cellular trafficking of apoE proteins affects energy metabolism, the immune system, and reproduction. The age-accelerating APOE4 allele alters the endosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors that mediate lipid and glucose metabolism. The APOE4 allele is the ancestral human allele, joined by APOE3 and then APOE2 in the human species. Under conditions of high infection, uncertain food, and shorter life expectancy, APOE4 may be adaptive for reducing mortality. As humans transitioned into modern less-infectious environments and longer life spans, APOE4 increased risks of aging-related diseases, particularly impacting arteries and the brain. The association of APOE4 with glucose dysregulation and body weight promotes many aging-associated diseases. Additionally, the APOE gene locus interacts with adjacent genes on chromosome 19 in haplotypes that modify neurodegeneration and metabolism, for which we anticipate complex gene-environment interactions. We summarize how diet and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk are altered by APOE genotype in both animal and human studies and identify gaps. Much remains obscure in how APOE alleles modify nutritional factors in human aging. Identifying risk variant haplotypes in the APOE gene complex will clarify homeostatic adaptive responses to environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In this paper, we present a functional spiking-neuron model of human working memory (WM). This model combines neural firing for encoding of information with activity-silent maintenance. While it used to be widely assumed that information in WM is maintained through persistent recurrent activity, recent studies have shown that information can be maintained without persistent firing; instead, information can be stored in activity-silent states. A candidate mechanism underlying this type of storage is short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP), by which the strength of connections between neurons rapidly changes to encode new information. To demonstrate that STSP can lead to functional behavior, we integrated STSP by means of calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in a large-scale spiking-neuron model and added a decision mechanism. The model was used to simulate a recent study that measured behavior and EEG activity of participants in three delayed-response tasks. In these tasks, one or two visual gratings had to be maintained in WM, and compared to subsequent probes. The original study demonstrated that WM contents and its priority status could be decoded from neural activity elicited by a task-irrelevant stimulus displayed during the activity-silent maintenance period. In support of our model, we show that it can perform these tasks, and that both its behavior as well as its neural representations are in agreement with the human data. We conclude that information in WM can be effectively maintained in activity-silent states by means of calcium-mediated STSP.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YEmivJgBl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A longstanding goal of regulatory genetics is to understand how variants in genome sequences lead to changes in gene expression. Here we present a method named Bayesian Annotation Guided eQTL Analysis (BAGEA), a variational Bayes framework to model cis-eQTLs using directed and undirected genomic annotations. We used &lt;i&gt;BAGEA&lt;/i&gt; to integrate directed genomic annotations with eQTL summary statistics from tissues of various origins. This analysis revealed epigenetic marks that are relevant for gene expression in different tissues and cell types. We estimated the predictive power of the models that were fitted based on directed genomic annotations. This analysis showed that, depending on the underlying eQTL data used, the directed genomic annotations could predict up to 1.5% of the variance observed in the expression of genes with top nominal eQTL association p-values &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;. For genes with estimated effect sizes in the top 25% quantile, up to 5% of the expression variance could be predicted. Based on our results, we recommend the use of &lt;i&gt;BAGEA&lt;/i&gt; for the analysis of cis-eQTL data to reveal annotations relevant to expression biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LH4CA4aXWNY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Modern electrophysiological recordings and optical imaging techniques have revealed a diverse spectrum of spatiotemporal neural activities underlying fundamental cognitive processing. Oscillations, traveling waves and other complex population dynamical patterns are often concomitant with sensory processing, information transfer, decision making and memory consolidation. While neural population models such as neural mass, population density and kinetic theoretical models have been used to capture a wide range of the experimentally observed dynamics, a full account of how the multi-scale dynamics emerges from the detailed biophysical properties of individual neurons and the network architecture remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed coarse-graining framework for reduced-dimensional descriptions of neuronal networks to model visual cortical dynamics. We show that, without introducing any new parameters, how a sequence of models culminating in an augmented system of spatially-coupled ODEs can effectively model a wide range of the observed cortical dynamics, ranging from visual stimulus orientation dynamics to traveling waves induced by visual illusory stimuli. In addition to an efficient simulation method, this framework also offers an analytic approach to studying large-scale network dynamics. As such, the dimensional reduction naturally leads to mesoscopic variables that capture the interplay between neuronal population stochasticity and network architecture that we believe to underlie many emergent cortical phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cH8b_BlTI7M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The development of multicellularity is a key evolutionary transition allowing for differentiation of physiological functions across a cell population that confers survival benefits; among unicellular bacteria, this can lead to complex developmental behaviors and the formation of higher-order community structures. Herein, we demonstrate that in the social δ-proteobacterium &lt;i&gt;Myxococcus xanthus&lt;/i&gt;, the secretion of a novel biosurfactant polysaccharide (BPS) is spatially modulated within communities, mediating swarm migration as well as the formation of multicellular swarm biofilms and fruiting bodies. BPS is a type IV pilus (T4P)-inhibited acidic polymer built of randomly acetylated β-linked tetrasaccharide repeats. Both BPS and exopolysaccharide (EPS) are produced by dedicated Wzx/Wzy-dependent polysaccharide-assembly pathways distinct from that responsible for spore-coat assembly. While EPS is preferentially produced at the lower-density swarm periphery, BPS production is favored in the higher-density swarm interior; this is consistent with the former being known to stimulate T4P retraction needed for community expansion and a function for the latter in promoting initial cell dispersal. Together, these data reveal the central role of secreted polysaccharides in the intricate behaviors coordinating bacterial multicellularity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4YmZR26DMMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The proposed mechanism is that the mutation predisposes to conformational change in the expressed protein, leading to the generation of disease-related multichain PrP assemblies that propagate by seeded protein misfolding. Despite considerable experimental support for this hypothesis, to-date spontaneous formation of disease-relevant, transmissible PrP assemblies in transgenic models expressing only mutant human PrP has not been demonstrated. Here, we report findings from transgenic mice that express human PrP 117V on a mouse PrP null background (117VV Tg30 mice), which model the &lt;i&gt;PRNP&lt;/i&gt; A117V mutation causing inherited prion disease (IPD) including Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease phenotypes in humans. By studying brain samples from uninoculated groups of mice, we discovered that some mice (≥475 days old) spontaneously generated abnormal PrP assemblies, which after inoculation into further groups of 117VV Tg30 mice, produced a molecular and neuropathological phenotype congruent with that seen after transmission of brain isolates from IPD A117V patients to the same mice. To the best of our knowledge, the 117VV Tg30 mouse line is the first transgenic model expressing only mutant human PrP to show spontaneous generation of transmissible PrP assemblies that directly mirror those generated in an inherited prion disease in humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7pN5DjjPHiU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway targeting organelles and macromolecules, thereby regulating various cellular functions. Phosphorylation is a key posttranscriptional protein modification implicated in the regulation of biological function including autophagy. Under asynchronous conditions, autophagy activity is predominantly suppressed by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, but whether autophagy-related genes (ATG) proteins are phosphorylated differentially throughout the sequential phases of the cell cycle remains unclear. In this issue, Li and colleagues report that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates the ULK complex during mitosis. This phosphorylation induces autophagy and, surprisingly, is shown to drive cell cycle progression. This work reveals a yet-unappreciated role for autophagy in cell cycle progression and enhances our understanding of the specific phase-dependent autophagy regulation during cellular growth and proliferation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tFg0FHdgWlk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1)–autophagy-related 13 (ATG13) is the most upstream autophagy initiation complex that is phosphorylated by mammalian target-of-rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to induce autophagy in asynchronous conditions. However, their phospho-regulation and functions in mitosis and cell cycle remain unknown. Here we show that ULK1-ATG13 complex is differentially regulated throughout the cell cycle, especially in mitosis, in which both ULK1 and ATG13 are highly phosphorylated by the key cell cycle machinery cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B. Combining mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that CDK1-induced ULK1-ATG13 phosphorylation promotes mitotic autophagy and cell cycle progression. Moreover, double knockout (DKO) of ULK1 and ATG13 could block cell cycle progression and significantly decrease cancer cell proliferation in cell line and mouse models. Our results not only bridge the mutual regulation between the core machinery of autophagy and mitosis but also illustrate the positive function of ULK1-ATG13 and their phosphorylation by CDK1 in mitotic autophagy regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/K9geLmzvZ_w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prospective time‐delayed crossover design trial of GS to assess the efficacy of GS as a first‐line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders took place between December 1, 2015 and September 27, 2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for 4 months followed by GS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐four individuals were assessed at interim review. The genetic origin of 2 patient's leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients were stratified to the immediate intervention group and 23 patients to the delayed‐GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the immediate (5/9 [56%] vs 0/9 [0%]; Wild–Seber, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005) and delayed (control) arms (14/23 [61%] vs 5/23 [22%]; Wild–Seber, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate‐GS group (log‐rank test, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5%, 95% confidence interval = 58.8–89.3%) in &amp;lt;4 months, greater than historical norms of &amp;lt;50% over 5 years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single‐arm observational study.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, first‐line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders. We provide an evidence‐based diagnostic testing algorithm to enable appropriate clinical GS utilization in this population. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection has the potential for targeting the central nervous system, and several neurological symptoms have been described in patients with severe respiratory distress. Here, we described the case of a 60‐year‐old patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection but only mild respiratory abnormalities who developed an akinetic mutism attributable to encephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging was negative, whereas electroencephalography showed generalized theta slowing. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses during the acute stage were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2, positive for pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia, and showed increased interleukin‐8 and tumor necrosis factor‐α concentrations. Other infectious or autoimmune disorders were excluded. A progressive clinical improvement along with a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid parameters was observed after high‐dose steroid treatment, thus arguing for an inflammatory‐mediated brain involvement related to COVID‐19.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peripapillary hyper‐reflective ovoid masslike structures (PHOMS) are a new spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) finding.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prospective, longitudinal study included patients (n = 212) with multiple sclerosis (MS; n = 418 eyes), 59 healthy controls (HCs; n = 117 eyes), and 267 non‐MS disease controls (534 eyes). OCT and diffusion tensor imaging were used.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no PHOMS in HC eyes (0/117, 0%). The prevalence of PHOMS was significantly higher in patients with MS (34/212, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) and MS eyes (45/418, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002) when compared to HCs (0/59, 0/117). The inter‐rater agreement for PHOMS was 97.9% (kappa = 0.951). PHOMS were present in 16% of patients with relapsing–remitting, 16% of patients with progressive, and 12% of patients with secondary progressive disease course (2% of eyes). There was no relationship of PHOMS with age, disease duration, disease course, disability, or disease‐modifying treatments. The fractional anisotropy of the optic radiations was lower in patients without PHOMS (0.814) when compared to patients with PHOMS (0.845, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). The majority of PHOMS remained stable, but increase in size and de novo development of PHOMS were also observed. In non‐MS disease controls, PHOMS were observed in intracranial hypertension (62%), optic disc drusen (47%), anomalous optic discs (44%), isolated optic neuritis (19%), and optic atrophy (12%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that PHOMS are a novel finding in MS pathology. Future research is needed to determine whether development of PHOMS in MS is due to intermittently raised intracranial pressure or an otherwise impaired “glymphatic” outflow from eye to brain.

 &lt;p&gt;This review aims to discuss (1) the refinement of mammalian visual cortical circuits and the maturation of visual functions they subserve in primary visual cortex (V1) and other visual cortical areas, and (2) existing evidence supporting the notion of differential rates of maturation of visual functions in different species. It is well known that different visual functions and their underlying circuitry mature and attain adultlike characteristics at different stages in postnatal development with varying growth rates. The developmental timecourse and duration of refinement varies significantly both in V1 of various species and among different visual cortical areas; while basic visual functions like spatial acuity mature earlier requiring less time, higher form perception such as contour integration is more complex and requires longer postnatal time to refine. This review will highlight the importance of systematic comparative analysis of the differential rates of refinement of visual circuitry and function as that may help reveal underlying key mechanisms necessary for healthy visual development during infancy and adulthood. This type of approach will help future studies to establish direct links between various developmental aspects of different visual cortical areas in both human and animal models; thus enhancing our understanding of vision related neurological disorders and their potential therapeutic remedies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The role of ion channels in neurons and muscles has been well characterized. However, recent work has demonstrated both the presence and necessity of ion channels in diverse cell types for morphological development. For example, mutations that disrupt ion channels give rise to abnormal structural development in species of flies, frogs, fish, mice, and humans. Furthermore, medications and recreational drugs that target ion channels are associated with higher incidence of birth defects in humans. In this review we establish the effects of several teratogens on development including epilepsy treatment drugs (topiramate, valproate, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), nicotine, heat, and cannabinoids. We then propose potential links between these teratogenic agents and ion channels with mechanistic insights from model organisms. Finally, we talk about the role of a particular ion channel, Kir2.1, in the formation and development of bone as an example of how ion channels can be used to uncover important processes in morphogenesis. Because ion channels are common targets of many currently used medications, understanding how ion channels impact morphological development will be important for prevention of birth defects. It is becoming increasingly clear that ion channels have functional roles outside of tissues that have been classically considered excitable.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that targets motor neurons (MNs) in the brain and spinal cord. It leads to gradual loss of motor signals to muscles leading to atrophy and weakness. Most patients do not survive for more than 3–5 years after disease onset. Current ALS treatments provide only a small delay of disease progression. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to explore new therapeutic approaches. One of the major hindrances in achieving this goal is poor understanding of causes of the disease. ALS has complex pathophysiological mechanisms in its genetic and sporadic forms. Protein aggregates are a common hallmark of ALS regardless of cause making protein pathways attractive therapeutic targets in ALS.

 &lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents one of the major causes of death worldwide and leads to persisting neurological deficits in many of the survivors. One of the most significant long-term sequelae deriving from TBI is neurodegenerative disease, which is a group of incurable diseases that impose a heavy socio-economic burden. However, mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of TBI to neurodegenerative disease remain elusive. The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional unit composed of neurons, neuroglia, vascular cells, and the basal lamina matrix. The key role of NVU dysfunction in many central nervous system diseases has been revealed. Studies have proved the presence of prolonged structural and functional abnormalities of the NVU after TBI. Moreover, growing evidence suggests impaired NVU function is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we propose the Neurovascular Unit Dysfunction (NVUD) Hypothesis, in which the persistent NVU dysfunction is thought to underlie the development of post-TBI neurodegeneration. We deduce NVUD Hypothesis through relational inference and supporting evidence, and suggest continued NVU abnormalities following TBI serve as the pathophysiological substrate and trigger yielding chronic neuroinflammation, proteinopathies and oxidative stress, consequently leading to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The NVUD Hypothesis may provide potential treatment and prevention strategies for TBI and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias (polyQ SCAs) include SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 and constitute a group of adult onset neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat sequence located within the coding region of specific genes, which translates into polyglutamine tract in the corresponding proteins. PolyQ SCAs are characterized by degeneration of the cerebellum and its associated structures and lead to progressive ataxia and other diverse symptoms. In recent years, gene and epigenetic deregulations have been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of polyQ SCAs. Here, we provide an overview of the functions of wild type and pathogenic polyQ SCA proteins in gene regulation, describe the extent and nature of gene expression changes and their pathological consequences in diseases, and discuss potential avenues to further investigate converging and distinct disease pathways and to develop therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Central nervous system (CNS) disorders especially neurodegenerative disorders are the major challenge for public health and demand the great attention of researchers to protect people against them. In past few decades, different treatment strategies have been adopted, but their therapeutic efficacy are not enough and have only shown partial mitigation of symptoms. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BSCFB) guard the CNS from harmful substances and pose as the major challenges in delivering drugs into CNS for treatment of CNS complications such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), stroke, epilepsy, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis (MS), and encephalitis, etc. Nanotechnology has come out as an exciting and promising new platform of treating neurological disorders and has shown great potential to overcome problems related to the conventional treatment approaches. Molecules can be nanoengineered to carry out multiple specific functions such as to cross the BBB, target specific cell or signaling pathway, respond to endogenous stimuli, and act as a vehicle for gene delivery, support nerve regeneration and cell survival. In present review, the role of nanocarrier systems such as liposomes, micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs), dendrimers, and nanoemulsions for delivery of various neurotherapeutic agents has been discussed, besides this, their mechanism of action, and nanoformulation of different neuroprotective agents like curcumin, edaravone, nerve growth factors in CNS disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinsonism, epilepsy, stroke, and brain tumors has been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Stroke has a debilitating effect on the human body and a serious negative effect on society, with a global incidence of one in every six people. According to the World Health Organization, 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide each year. Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Motor and cognitive deficits like hemiparesis, paralysis, chronic pain, and psychomotor and behavioral symptoms can persist long term and prevent the patient from fully reintegrating into society, therefore continuing to add to the costly healthcare burden of stroke. Regenerative medicine using stem cells seems to be a panacea for sequelae after stroke. Stem cell-based therapy aids neuro-regeneration and neuroprotection for neurological recovery in patients. However, the use of stem cells as a therapy in stroke patients still needs a lot of research at both basic and translational levels. As well as the mode of action of stem cells in reversing the symptoms not being clear, there are several clinical parameters that need to be addressed before establishing stem cell therapy in stroke, such as the type of stem cells to be administered, the number of stem cells, the timing of dosage, whether dose-boosters are required, the route of administration, etc. There are upcoming prospects of cell-free therapy also by using exosomes derived from stem cells. There are several ongoing pre-clinical studies aiming to answer these questions. Despite still being in the development stage, stem cell therapy holds great potential for neurological rehabilitation in patients suffering from stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective&lt;p&gt;Previous studies showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves pain symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) patients when programmed for motor-symptom relief. One factor involved in pain processing is sensory perception of stimuli. With the advent of directional leads, we explore whether directional DBS affects quantitative sensory testing (QST) metrics acutely.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;PD patients with subthalamic (STN) DBS and directional leads were tested in 5 settings (DBS-OFF, DBS-ON with omnidirectional stimulation, and DBS-ON) for each of three directional segments of contact used for clinical programming. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) assessed patient’s motor skills at time of study visit at clinical contact and at contact which produced optimal sensory threshold (defined by the greatest tolerance to mechanical stimuli). Correlation analyses were performed between stimulation parameters [amplitude, frequency, pulse width (PW), total electrical energy delivered (TEED)] and outcome metrics.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Sensory thresholds were obtained in nine patients. Directional stimulation did not significantly alter patient perceptions of sensory stimulus [cold pain (p = 0.69), warm pain (p = 0.99), Von frey fibers (p = 0.09), pin-prick (p = 0.88), vibration (p = 0.40), pressure (p = 0.98)]. With correlation analysis, increasing PW at the posterior contact increased pin prick and vibration sensitivity (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Additionally, an increase in TEED caused a decrease in sensitivity to warm detection when using the anterior (p = 0.04), lateral (p = 0.02), and medial contacts (p = 0.03), and also caused a decrease in sensitivity to cold detection when using the medial contact (p = 0.03). UPDRS-III remained stable during testing.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Motor benefit can be acutely maintained at directional contacts, whereas directional stimulation can modulate thermal and mechanical sensitivity. Further investigation will determine whether these changes are maintained chronically or can be improved with optimized programming.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillation (HFO) represents a promising biomarker of epileptogenicity. However, the significant interindividual differences among patients limit its application in clinical practice. Here, we applied and evaluated an individualized, frequency-based approach of HFO analysis in stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data for localizing the epileptogenic zones (EZs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Clinical and SEEG data of 19 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were retrospectively analyzed. The individualized spectral power of all signals recorded by electrode array, i.e., the relative strength of HFO, was computed with a wavelet method for each patient. Subsequently, the clinical value of the relative strength of HFO for identifying the EZ was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Focal increase in the relative strength of HFO in SEEG recordings were identified in all 19 patients. HFOs identified inside the clinically identified seizure onset zone had more spectral power than those identified outside (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and HFOs in 250–500 Hz band (fast ripples) seemed to be more specific identifying the EZ than in those in 80–250 Hz band (ripples) (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The resection of brain regions generating HFOs resulted in a favorable seizure outcome in 17 patients (17/19; 89.5%), while in the cases of other patients with poor outcomes, the brain regions generating HFOs were not removed completely.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The relative strength of HFO, especially fast ripples, is a promising effective biomarker for identifying the EZ and can lead to a favorable seizure outcome if used to guide epilepsy surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of obesity skyrocketed over the past decades to become a significant public health problem. Obesity is recognized as a low-grade inflammatory disease and is linked with several comorbidities such as diabetes, circulatory disease, common neurodegenerative diseases, as well as chronic pain. Adipocytes are a major neuroendocrine organ that continually, and systemically, releases pro-inflammatory factors. While the exact mechanisms driving obesity-induced pain remain poorly defined, nociceptor hypersensitivity may result from the systemic state of inflammation characteristic of obesity as well as weight surplus-induced mechanical stress. Obesity and pain also share various genetic mutations, lifestyle risk factors, and metabolic pathways. For instance, fat pads are often found hyper-innervated and rich in immune cell types of multiple origins. These immunocytes release cytokines, amplifying nociceptor function, which, in turn, via locally released neuropeptides, sustain immunocytes’ function. Here, we posit that along with mechanical stress stemming from extra weight, the local neuro-immune interplay occurring within the fat pads maintains the state of chronic low-grade inflammation and heightens sensory hypersensitivity. Overall, stopping such harmful neuro-immune crosstalk may constitute a novel pathway to prevent obesity-associated comorbidities, including neuronal hypersensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can potentially enable people to non-invasively and directly communicate with others using brain activities. Artifacts generated from body activities (e.g., eyeblinks and teeth clenches) often contaminate EEGs and make EEG-based classification/identification hard. Although independent component analysis (ICA) is the gold-standard technique for attenuating the effects of such contamination, the estimated independent components are still mixed with artifactual and neuronal information because ICA relies only on the independence assumption. The same problem occurs when using independent vector analysis (IVA), an extended ICA method. To solve this problem, we designed an independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA)-based automatic artifact reduction technique that clearly models sources from observations under the independence assumption and a low-rank nature in the frequency domain. For automatic artifact reduction, we combined the signal separation technique with an independent component classifier for EEGs named ICLabel. To assess the comparative efficiency of the proposed method, the discriminabilities of artifact-reduced EEGs using ICA, IVA, and ILRMA were determined using an open-access EEG dataset named OpenBMI, which contains EEG data obtained through three BCI paradigms [motor-imagery (MI), event-related potential (ERP), and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)]. BCI performances were obtained using these three paradigms after applying artifact reduction techniques, and the results suggested that our proposed method has the potential to achieve higher discriminability than ICA and IVA for BCIs. In addition, artifact reduction using the ILRMA approach clearly improved (by over 70%) the averaged BCI performances using artifact-reduced data sufficiently for most needs of the BCI community. The extension of ICA families to supervised separation that leaves the discriminative ability would further improve the usability of BCIs for real-life environments in which artifacts frequently contaminate EEGs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the brain, there is a vast diversity of different structures, circuitries, cell types, and cellular genetic expression profiles. While this large diversity can often occlude a clear understanding of how the brain works, careful analyses of analogous studies performed across different brain areas can hint at commonalities in neuronal organization. This in turn can yield a fundamental understanding of necessary circuitry components that are crucial for how information is processed across the brain. In this review, we outline recent in vivo and in vitro studies that have been performed in different cortical areas to characterize the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and/or calretinin (CR)-expressing cells that specialize in inhibiting GABAergic interneurons. In doing so, we make the case that, across cortical structures, interneuron-specific cells commonly specialize in the synaptic disinhibition of excitatory neurons, which can ungate the integration and plasticity of external inputs onto excitatory neurons. In line with this, activation of interneuron- specific cells enhances animal performance across a variety of behavioral tasks that involve learning, memory formation, and sensory discrimination, and may represent a key target for therapeutic interventions under different pathological conditions. As such, interneuron-specific cells across different cortical structures are an essential network component for information processing and normal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Successful memory involves not only remembering over time but also keeping memories distinct. Computational models suggest that pattern separation appears as a highly efficient process to discriminate between overlapping memories. Furthermore, lesion studies have shown that the dentate gyrus (DG) participates in pattern separation. However, these manipulations did not allow identifying the neuronal mechanism underlying pattern separation. The development of different neurophotonics techniques, together with other genetic tools, has been useful for the study of the microcircuit involved in this process. It has been shown that less-overlapped information would generate distinct neuronal representations within the granule cells (GCs). However, because glutamatergic or GABAergic cells in the DG are not functionally or structurally homogeneous, identifying the specific role of the different subpopulations remains elusive. Then, understanding pattern separation requires the ability to manipulate a temporal and spatially specific subset of cells in the DG and ideally to analyze DG cells activity in individuals performing a pattern separation dependent behavioral task. Thus, neurophotonics and calcium imaging techniques in conjunction with activity-dependent promoters and high-resolution microscopy appear as important tools for this endeavor. In this work, we review how different neurophotonics techniques have been implemented in the elucidation of a neuronal network that supports pattern separation alone or in combination with traditional techniques. We discuss the limitation of these techniques and how other neurophotonic techniques could be used to complement the advances presented up to this date.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia are brain macrophages that mediate neuroinflammation and contribute to and protect against neurodegeneration. The terminal sugar residue of all glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of mammalian cells is normally sialic acid, and addition of this negatively charged residue is known as “sialylation,” whereas removal by sialidases is known as “desialylation.” High sialylation of the neuronal cell surface inhibits microglial phagocytosis of such neurons, via: (i) activating sialic acid receptors (Siglecs) on microglia that inhibit phagocytosis and (ii) inhibiting binding of opsonins C1q, C3, and galectin-3. Microglial sialylation inhibits inflammatory activation of microglia via: (i) activating Siglec receptors CD22 and CD33 on microglia that inhibit phagocytosis and (ii) inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), complement receptor 3 (CR3), and other microglial receptors. When activated, microglia release a sialidase activity that desialylates both microglia and neurons, activating the microglia and rendering the neurons susceptible to phagocytosis. Activated microglia also release galectin-3 (Gal-3), which: (i) further activates microglia via binding to TLR4 and TREM2, (ii) binds to desialylated neurons opsonizing them for phagocytosis via Mer tyrosine kinase, and (iii) promotes Aβ aggregation and toxicity in vivo. Gal-3 and desialylation may increase in a variety of brain pathologies. Thus, Gal-3 and sialidases are potential treatment targets to prevent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cuprizone (CPZ) is a chemical chelator toxic to mitochondria of cells. While inducing oligodendrocyte (OL) loss and demyelination, CPZ caused no fatal damage to the other brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in previous studies, suggesting differential susceptibility and vulnerability of brain cells to the CPZ intoxication. To demonstrate this interpretation, C57BL/6 mice were fed rodent chow without or with CPZ (0.2%, w/w) for 7 days. One day later, mitochondrial function of brain cells was assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS) and biochemical analysis. Another batch of mice were processed to localize the CPZ-induced damage to mitochondrial DNA, label brain cells, and identify apoptotic cells. Compared to controls, CPZ-exposed mice showed significantly lower levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate, phosphocreatine, and ATP detected by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction in brain cells. Susceptibility analysis showed an order of OLs, microglia, and astrocytes from high to low, in terms of the proportion of 8-OHdG labeled cells in each type of these cells in corpus callosum. Vulnerability analysis showed the highest proportion of caspase-3 positive cells in labeled OLs in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where neurons showed no caspase-3 labeling, but the highest proportion of 8-OHdG labeling, indicating a lowest vulnerability but highest susceptibility to CPZ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Immature OLs, microglia, and astrocytes showed adaptive changes in proliferation and activation in response to CPZ-exposure. These data for the first time demonstrated the CPZ-induced mitochondria dysfunction in brain cells of living mouse and specified the differential susceptibility and vulnerability of brain cells to the CPZ intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurexins and neuroligins are common synaptic adhesion molecules that are associated with autism and interact with each other in the synaptic cleft. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) bouton is a well-known model system in neuroscience, and ghost and satellite boutons, respectively, indicate the poor development and overgrowth of the NMJ boutons. However, the Drosophila neurexin (DNrx) and Drosophila neuroligins (DNlgs) are mainly observed in type Ib boutons, indicating the ultrastructural and developmental phenotypes of the Drosophila NMJ. Here, we identified the ultrastructural and developmental features of ghost and satellite boutons by utilizing dneurexin (dnrx) and dneuroligins (dnlgs) fly mutants and other associated fly strains. Ghost boutons contain synaptic vesicles with multiple diameters but very rarely contain T-bar structures and swollen or thin subsynaptic reticulum (SSR) membranes. The muscle cell membrane is invaginated at different sites, stretches to the ghost bouton from different directions, forms several layers that enwrap the ghost bouton, and then branches into the complex SSR. Satellite boutons share a common SSR membrane and present either a typical profile in which a main bouton is encircled by small boutons or two atypical profiles in which the small boutons are grouped together or distributed in beads without a main bouton. Electron and confocal microscopy data showed that dnrx, dnlg1, dnlg2, dnlg3, and dnlg4 mutations led to ghost boutons; the overexpression of dnrx, dnlg1, dnlg2, dnlg3, and dnlg4 led to satellite boutons; and the dnlg2;dnlg3 double mutation also led to satellite boutons. These results suggested that DNrx and DNlgs jointly maintain the development and function of NMJ boutons by regulating the balance of ghost and satellite boutons in Drosophila.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have a high impact on the structure of the central nervous system, as they control neural activity, development, and plasticity. Heterogeneity of astrocytes has been shown before, but so far only a few studies have demonstrated heterogeneous morphology of astrocytes concerning aging. In this study, we examined morphologic differences of astrocyte subpopulations in adult mice and the progression of these differences with age. We surveyed astrocytes in olfactory bulb slices of mice aged 3 months, 1 year and 2 years (three animals each age group), based on their appearance in anti-GFAP immunostaining. Based on this data we established three different types of astrocytes: type I (stellate), type II (elliptic), and type III (squid-like). We found that with the advanced age of the mice, astrocytes grow in size and complexity. Major changes occurred between the ages of 3 months and 1 year, while between 1 and 2 years no significant development in cell size and complexity could be detected. Our results show that astrocytes in the olfactory bulb are heterogeneous and undergo morphological transformation until late adolescence but not upon senescence. Structural plasticity is further substantiated by the expression of vimentin in some astrocyte processes in all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is a disease of neurologic impairment that involves mechanisms of damage similar to other degenerative neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the current era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 replication is well-suppressed, and yet, HIV-1-infected patients still have high levels of chronic inflammation, indicating that factors other than viral replication are contributing to the development of neurocognitive impairment in these patients. The underlying mechanisms of HAND are still unknown, but the HIV-1 protein, Tat, has been highlighted as a potential viral product that contributes to the development of cognitive impairment. In AD, the presence of senescent cells in the CNS has been discussed as a contributing factor to the progression of cognitive decline and may be a mechanism also involved in the development of HAND. This mini-review discusses the viral protein HIV-1 Tat, and its potential to induce senescence in the CNS, contributing to the development of HAND.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the effect of telmisartan, rosuvastatin, or their combination on dementia and to understand the impact of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on the effect of the medications in older patients with hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This is a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial using a 2 × 2 factorial design. Between April 2008 and November 2010, 1,244 hypertensive patients aged ≥60 years without cognitive impairment were recruited from communities in six cities in Shandong area, China. Patients were randomized into telmisartan and rosuvastatin administration after a 2-week washout period. APOE genotype was identified at the baseline. Possible dementia was determined using the combination of the global cognitive function and Assessment of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Over an average follow-up of 7 [interquartile range (IQR): 6.7–7.2] years, telmisartan and rosuvastatin significantly reduced the cognitive impairment progression and the incidence of dementia. There was a synergistic interaction between telmisartan and rosuvastatin to reduce the cognitive impairment and the incidence of dementia (P&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The cognitive impairment progression and the risk of dementia were higher in the hypertensive patients with APOE ε4 allele than in those without APOE ε4 allele. Rosuvastatin medication significantly alleviated the cognitive impairment progression and the risks of dementia in patients with APOE ε4 allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The combination of telmisartan and rosuvastatin might be an effective prevention and/or treatment strategy for cognitive impairment and dementia, especially in hypertensive patients with the APOE ε4 allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, ChiCTR.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR-IOR-17013557.

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the largest group of glial cells in the brain and participate in several essential functions of the central nervous system (CNS). Disruption of their normal physiological function can lead to metabolism disequilibrium and the pathology of CNS. As an important mechanism of aging, cellular senescence has been considered as a primary inducing factor of age-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Senescent astrocytes showed decreased normal physiological function and increased secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, which contribute to Aβ accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Astrocyte senescence also leads to a number of detrimental effects, including induced glutamate excitotoxicity, impaired synaptic plasticity, neural stem cell loss, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. In this review article, we have summarized the growing findings regarding astrocyte senescence and its putative role in the pathologic progress of AD. Additionally, we also focus on the significance of targeting astrocyte senescence as a novel and feasible therapeutic approach for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Demyelination in vascular dementia (VD) is partly attributable to inflammation induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Remyelination contributes to the recovery of cognitive impairment by inducing the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. It was previously reported that Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) promotes cognitive improvement. However, whether NBP can stimulate remyelination and suppress inflammation after CCH remains unclear. To answer this question, the present study investigated the effects of NBP on remyelination in a rat model of CCH established by bilateral carotid artery occlusion. Functional recovery was evaluated with the Morris water maze (MWM) test, and myelin integrity, regeneration of mature oligodendrocytes, and inhibition of astrocyte proliferation were assessed by immunohistochemistry and histologic analysis. Additionally, activation of 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Sirtuin (SIRT)1 and Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways was evaluated by western blotting. The results showed that NBP treatment improved memory and learning performance in CCH rats, which was accompanied by increased myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte regeneration, and reduced astrocyte proliferation and inflammation. Additionally, NBP induced the activation of AMPK/SIRT1 signaling while inhibiting the STAT3/NF-κB pathway. These results indicate that NBP alleviates cognitive impairment following CCH by promoting remyelination and suppressing inflammation via modulation of AMPK/SIRT1 and STAT3/NF-κB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Very short tandem repeats bear substantial genetic, evolutional, and pathological significance in genome analyses. Here, we compiled a census of tandem mono-nucleotide/di-nucleotide/tri-nucleotide repeats (MNRs/DNRs/TNRs) in GRCh38, which we term “polytracts” in general. Of the human genome, 144.4 million nucleotides (4.7%) are occupied by polytracts, and 0.47 million single nucleotides are identified as polytract hinges, i.e., break-points of tandem polytracts. Preliminary exploration of the census suggested polytract hinge sites and boundaries of AAC polytracts may bear a higher mapping error rate than other polytract regions. Further, we revealed landscapes of polytract enrichment with respect to nearly a hundred genomic features. We found MNRs, DNRs, and TNRs displayed noticeable difference in terms of locational enrichment for miscellaneous genomic features, especially RNA editing events. Non-canonical and C-to-U RNA-editing events are enriched inside and/or adjacent to MNRs, while all categories of RNA-editing events are under-represented in DNRs. A-to-I RNA-editing events are generally under-represented in polytracts. The selective enrichment of non-canonical RNA-editing events within MNR adjacency provides a negative evidence against their authenticity. To enable similar locational enrichment analyses in relation to polytracts, we developed a software Polytrap which can handle 11 reference genomes. Additionally, we compiled polytracts of four model organisms into a Track Hub which can be integrated into USCS Genome Browser as an official track for convenient visualization of polytracts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TC2yPlj2Td4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The transition to daylight saving time (DST) is beneficial for energy conservation but at the same time it has been reported to increase the risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular problems. Here, we evaluate the effect of the DST shift on a whole spectrum of diseases—an analysis we hope will be helpful in weighing the risks and benefits of DST shifts. Our study relied on a population-based, cross-sectional analysis of the IBM Watson Health MarketScan insurance claim dataset, which incorporates over 150 million unique patients in the US, and the Swedish national inpatient register, which incorporates more than nine million unique Swedes. For hundreds of sex- and age-specific diseases, we assessed effects of the DST shifts forward and backward by one hour in spring and autumn by comparing the observed and expected diagnosis rates after DST shift exposure. We found four prominent, elevated risk clusters, including cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks), injuries, mental and behavioral disorders, and immune-related diseases such as noninfective enteritis and colitis to be significantly associated with DST shifts in the United States and Sweden. While the majority of disease risk elevations are modest (a few percent), a considerable number of diseases exhibit an approximately ten percent relative risk increase. We estimate that each spring DST shift is associated with negative health effects–with 150,000 incidences in the US, and 880,000 globally. We also identify for the first time a collection of diseases with relative risks that appear to decrease immediately after the spring DST shift, enriched with infections and immune system-related maladies. These diseases’ decreasing relative risks might be driven by the documented boosting effect of a short-term stress (such as that experienced around the spring DST shift) on the immune system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_88UCXPIUkI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;* algorithm provably approximates partition functions for a set of states (e.g., protein, ligand, and protein-ligand complex) to a user-specified accuracy &lt;i&gt;ε&lt;/i&gt;. Often, reaching an &lt;i&gt;ε&lt;/i&gt;-approximation for a particular set of partition functions takes a prohibitive amount of time and space. To alleviate some of this cost, we introduce two new algorithms into the osprey suite for protein design: fries, a Fast Removal of Inadequately Energied Sequences, and &lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;*, an Energy Window Approximation to &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;*. fries pre-processes the sequence space to limit a design to only the most stable, energetically favorable sequence possibilities. &lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* then takes this pruned sequence space as input and, using a user-specified energy window, calculates &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;* scores using the lowest energy conformations. We expect fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* to be most useful in cases where there are many unstable sequences in the design sequence space and when users are satisfied with enumerating the low-energy ensemble of conformations. In combination, these algorithms provably retain calculational accuracy while limiting the input sequence space and the conformations included in each partition function calculation to only the most energetically favorable, effectively reducing runtime while still enriching for desirable sequences. This combined approach led to significant speed-ups compared to the previous state-of-the-art multi-sequence algorithm, &lt;i&gt;BBK&lt;/i&gt;*, while maintaining its efficiency and accuracy, which we show across 40 different protein systems and a total of 2,826 protein design problems. Additionally, as a proof of concept, we used these new algorithms to redesign the protein-protein interface (PPI) of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. The Ras-binding domain of the protein kinase c-Raf (c-Raf-RBD) is the tightest known binder of KRas, a protein implicated in difficult-to-treat cancers. fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* accurately retrospectively predicted the effect of 41 different sets of mutations in the PPI of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. Notably, these mutations include mutations whose effect had previously been incorrectly predicted using other computational methods. Next, we used fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* for prospective design and discovered a novel point mutation that improves binding of c-Raf-RBD to KRas in its active, GTP-bound state (KRas&lt;sup&gt;GTP&lt;/sup&gt;). We combined this new mutation with two previously reported mutations (which were highly-ranked by osprey) to create a new variant of c-Raf-RBD, c-Raf-RBD(RKY). fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* in osprey computationally predicted that this new variant binds even more tightly than the previous best-binding variant, c-Raf-RBD(RK). We measured the binding affinity of c-Raf-RBD(RKY) using a bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay, and found that this new variant exhibits single-digit nanomolar affinity for KRas&lt;sup&gt;GTP&lt;/sup&gt;, confirming the computational predictions made with fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;*. This new variant binds roughly five times more tightly than the previous best known binder and roughly 36 times more tightly than the design starting point (wild-type c-Raf-RBD). This study steps through the advancement and development of computational protein design by presenting theory, new algorithms, accurate retrospective designs, new prospective designs, and biochemical validation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pDB664ObOSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The genetic adaptation of humans to the consumption of milk from dairying animals is one of the most emblematic cases of recent human evolution. While the phenotypic change under selection, lactase persistence (LP), is known, the evolutionary advantage conferred to persistent individuals remains obscure. One informative but underappreciated observation is that not all populations whose ancestors had access to milk genetically adapted to become lactase persistent. Indeed, Central Asian herders are mostly lactase nonpersistent, despite their significant dietary reliance on dairy products. Investigating the temporal dynamic of the −13.910:C&amp;gt;T Eurasian mutation associated with LP, we found that, after its emergence in Ukraine 5,960 before present (BP), the T allele spread between 4,000 BP and 3,500 BP throughout Eurasia, from Spain to Kazakhstan. The timing and geographical progression of the mutation coincides well with the migration of steppe populations across and outside of Europe. After 3,000 BP, the mutation strongly increased in frequency in Europe, but not in Asia. We propose that Central Asian herders have adapted to milk consumption culturally, by fermentation, and/or by colonic adaptation, rather than genetically. Given the possibility of a nongenetic adaptation to avoid intestinal symptoms when consuming dairy products, the puzzle then becomes this: why has LP been selected for at all?&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vh1UQAS97XI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The potential ability of the human brain to represent an artificial limb as a body part (embodiment) has been inspiring engineers, clinicians, and scientists as a means to optimise human–machine interfaces. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we studied whether neural embodiment actually occurs in prosthesis users’ occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). Compared with controls, different prostheses types were visually represented more similarly to each other, relative to hands and tools, indicating the emergence of a dissociated prosthesis categorisation. Greater daily life prosthesis usage correlated positively with greater prosthesis categorisation. Moreover, when comparing prosthesis users’ representation of their own prosthesis to controls’ representation of a similar looking prosthesis, prosthesis users represented their own prosthesis more dissimilarly to hands, challenging current views of visual prosthesis embodiment. Our results reveal a use-dependent neural correlate for wearable technology adoption, demonstrating adaptive use–related plasticity within the OTC. Because these neural correlates were independent of the prostheses’ appearance and control, our findings offer new opportunities for prosthesis design by lifting restrictions imposed by the embodiment theory for artificial limbs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H1ArChGLDVo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Lymphatic filariasis (LF) afflicts over 60 million people worldwide and leads to severe pathological outcomes in chronic cases. The nematode parasites (Nematoda: Filarioidea) that cause LF require both arthropod (mosquito) intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts for their propagation. The invasion and migration of filarial worms through host tissues are complex and critical to survival, yet little is known about the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate directed migration in these medically important species. In order to better understand the role of chemosensory signaling in filarial worm taxis, we employ comparative genomics, transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and chemical approaches to identify putative chemosensory receptor proteins and perturb chemotaxis phenotypes in filarial worms. We find that chemoreceptor family size is correlated with the presence of environmental (extrahost) stages in nematode life cycles, and that filarial worms contain compact and highly diverged chemoreceptor complements and lineage-specific ion channels that are predicted to operate downstream of chemoreceptor activation. In &lt;i&gt;Brugia malayi&lt;/i&gt;, an etiological agent of LF, chemoreceptor expression patterns correspond to distinct parasite migration events across the life cycle. To interrogate the role of chemosensation in the migration of larval worms, arthropod and mammalian infectious stage &lt;i&gt;Brugia&lt;/i&gt; parasites were incubated in nicotinamide, an agonist of the nematode transient receptor potential (TRP) channel OSM-9. Exposure of microfilariae to nicotinamide alters intramosquito migration, and exposure of L3s reduces chemotaxis toward host-associated cues in vitro. Nicotinamide also potently modulates thermosensory responses in L3s, suggesting a polymodal sensory role for &lt;i&gt;Brugia osm-9&lt;/i&gt;. Reverse genetic studies implicate both &lt;i&gt;Brugia osm-9&lt;/i&gt; and the cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channel subunit &lt;i&gt;tax-4&lt;/i&gt; in larval chemotaxis toward host serum, and these ion channel subunits partially rescue sensory defects in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans osm-9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;tax-4&lt;/i&gt; knock-out strains. Together, these data reveal genetic and functional diversification of chemosensory signaling proteins in filarial worms and encourage a more thorough investigation of clade- and parasite-specific facets of nematode sensory receptor biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8K0z3sNB4sE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) infections, such as those responsible for the current severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, cause grave international public health concern. In infected cells, the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). Although double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) appear to be a pan-CoV RO element, studies to date describe an assortment of additional CoV-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remains unclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA synthesis. Here we provide detailed 2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the same membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs) previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sites of replication. Metabolic labeling of newly synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitative electron microscopy (EM) autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cells infected with the beta-CoVs Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV and the gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular or virus-induced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the CoV RO and clearly establish DMVs as the central hub for viral RNA synthesis and a potential drug target in CoV infection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vq0kB884ydE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are abundant antimicrobial T cells in humans and recognize antigens derived from the microbial riboflavin biosynthetic pathway presented by the MHC-Ib-related protein (MR1). However, the mechanisms responsible for MAIT cell antimicrobial activity are not fully understood, and the efficacy of these mechanisms against antibiotic resistant bacteria has not been explored. Here, we show that MAIT cells mediate MR1-restricted antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; clinical strains in a manner dependent on the activity of cytolytic proteins but independent of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or induction of apoptosis in infected cells. The combined action of the pore-forming antimicrobial protein granulysin and the serine protease granzyme B released in response to T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated recognition of MR1-presented antigen is essential to mediate control against both cell-associated and free-living, extracellular forms of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, MAIT cell-mediated bacterial control extends to multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; primary clinical isolates additionally resistant to carbapenems, a class of last resort antibiotics. Notably, high levels of granulysin and granzyme B in the MAIT cell secretomes directly damage bacterial cells by increasing their permeability, rendering initially resistant &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; susceptible to the bactericidal activity of carbapenems. These findings define the role of cytolytic effector proteins in MAIT cell-mediated antimicrobial activity and indicate that granulysin and granzyme B synergize to restore carbapenem bactericidal activity and overcome carbapenem resistance in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LLLbEM92uH0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Peculiar protrusions along tanycyte processes face diverse neural and non‐neural cell types in the hypothalamic parenchyma&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c2b3c809-f3e8-430b-8f35-e4dd861e0694/cne24965-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TAT‐Cre‐mediated transduction of tdTomato in tanycytes, this study morphologically describes peculiar protrusions along tanycyte processes. Combining tdTomato filling, fluorescence immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, the authors show in 3D reconstructions the diverse tanycyte partners as well as the subcellular organelles and transporters present in tanycyte protrusions. 3 V, third ventricle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MVB, multivesicular bodies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanycytes are highly specialized ependymal cells that line the bottom and the lateral walls of the third ventricle. In contact with the cerebrospinal fluid through their cell bodies, they send processes into the arcuate nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus and the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present work, we combined transgenic and immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the neuroanatomical associations between tanycytes and neural cells present in the hypothalamic parenchyma, in particular in the arcuate nucleus. The specific expression of tdTomato in tanycytes first allowed the observation of peculiar subcellular protrusions along tanycyte processes and at their endfeet such as spines, swelling, en passant boutons, boutons or claws. Interestingly, these protrusions contact different neural cells in the brain parenchyma including blood vessels and neurons, and in particular NPY and POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Using both fluorescent and electron microscopy, we finally observed that these tanycyte protrusions contain ribosomes, mitochondria, diverse vesicles, and transporters, suggesting dense tanycyte/neuron and tanycyte/blood vessel communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, our results lay the neuroanatomical basis for tanycyte/neural cell interactions, which will be useful to further understand cell‐to‐cell communications involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt;, encoding the voltage‐gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.3, cause severe childhood‐onset epilepsy and malformation of cortical development. Here, we define the spectrum of clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging features of &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt;‐related neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were ascertained via an international collaborative network. We compared sodium channels containing wild‐type vs. variant Nav1.3 subunits co‐expressed with β1 and β2 subunits using whole‐cell voltage clamp electrophysiological recordings in a heterologous mammalian system (HEK‐293 T cells).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 22 patients with pathogenic &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt; variants, most had treatment‐resistant epilepsy beginning in the first year of life (16/21, 76%; median onset, 2 weeks), with severe or profound developmental delay (15/20; 75%). Many, but not all (15/19; 79%), exhibited malformations of cortical development. Pathogenic variants clustered in transmembrane segments 4–6 of domains II‐IV. Most pathogenic missense variants tested (10/11; 91%) displayed gain of channel function, with increased persistent current and/or a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and all variants associated with malformation of cortical development exhibited gain of channel function. One variant (p.Ile1468Arg) exhibited mixed effects, with gain and partial loss of function. Two variants demonstrated loss of channel function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study defines &lt;i&gt;SCN3A‐ &lt;/i&gt;related neurodevelopmental disorder along a spectrum of severity, but typically including epilepsy and severe or profound developmental delay/intellectual disability. Malformations of cortical development are a characteristic feature of this unusual channelopathy syndrome, present in over 75% of affected individuals. Gain of function at the channel level in developing neurons is likely an important mechanism of disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;An open access mouse brain flatmap and upgraded rat and human brain flatmaps based on current reference atlases&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/be254fc2-2246-4a97-9f28-5ae2c1035804/cne24966-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illustration shows several flatmap representations of the mammalian brain, selected and modified from a collection of new and enhanced flatmap representations of the mouse, rat, and human brain. The human brain flatmap primarily details cortical regionalization. The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are based on current brain reference atlases, and they represent all depths of the divisional hierarchy of central nervous system gray matter represented therein. Also represented for rat and mouse are white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and for the rat a series of flatmaps illustrating stages of brain development. The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are designed to facilitate comparative analysis between these species, and for adaptability to novel parcellation schemas and computational applications. We give examples of these uses, including a proof‐of‐concept workflow demonstrating how the flatmaps could be adapted to form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform to represent a wide variety of brain data.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we present a flatmap of the mouse central nervous system (brain) and substantially enhanced flatmaps of the rat and human brain. Also included are enhanced representations of nervous system white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and an enhanced series of ten flatmaps showing different stages of rat brain development. The adult mouse and rat brain flatmaps provide layered diagrammatic representation of central nervous system divisions, according to their arrangement in corresponding reference atlases: Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4, rat) (Swanson, 2018), and the first version of the Allen Reference Atlas (mouse) (Dong, 2007). To facilitate comparative analysis, both flatmaps are scaled equally, and the divisional hierarchy of gray matter follows a topographic arrangement used in BM4. Also included with the mouse and rat brain flatmaps are cerebral cortex atlas level contours based on the reference atlases, and direct graphical and tabular comparison of regional parcellation. To encourage use of the brain flatmaps, they were designed and organized, with supporting reference tables, for ease‐of‐use and to be amenable to computational applications. We demonstrate how they can be adapted to represent novel parcellations resulting from experimental data, and we provide a proof‐of‐concept for how they could form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform. The mouse, rat, and human brain flatmap vector graphics files (Adobe Reader/Acrobat viewable and Adobe Illustrator editable) and supporting tables are provided open access; they constitute a broadly applicable neuroscience toolbox resource for researchers seeking to map and perform comparative analysis of brain data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Inhibition of neural stem cell aging through the transient induction of reprogramming factors&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/901cb43f-e28f-40bb-9800-25cafc146286/cne24967-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long‐term in vitro culture of neural stem cells (NSCs) resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes. The induction of four reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c‐Myc) could decrease expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes during the long‐term culture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult stem cells age during long‐term &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; culture, and neural stem cells (NSCs), which can self‐renew and differentiate into neurons and glial cells, also display reduced differentiation potential after repeated passaging. However, the mechanistic details underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, we found that long‐term in vitro culture of NSCs resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes, including the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)1β and IL6, the senescence‐associated enzyme matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), and the ER stress‐responsive transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). However, the cyclic and transient induction of four reprogramming factors (POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1, also known as octamer‐binding transcription factor 4; SRY [sex determining region Y]‐box 2; Kruppel‐like factor 4; and myelocytomatosis oncogene; collectively referred to as OSKM) can inhibit NSC aging, as indicated by the decreased expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes. We used ROSA‐4F NSCs, which express OSKM from only one allele, to minimize the potential for full reprogramming or tumor formation during NSC rejuvenation. We expect that this novel rejuvenation method will enhance the potential of NSCs as a clinical approach to the treatment of neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is well known to be essential for declarative memory. However, a growing body of research suggests that MTL structures might be involved in perceptual processes as well. Our previous modeling work suggests that sensory representations in cortex influence the accuracy of episodic memory retrieved from the MTL. We adopt that model here to show that, conversely, episodic memory can also influence the quality of sensory representations. We model the effect of episodic memory as (a) repeatedly replaying episodes from memory and (b) recombining episode fragments to form novel sequences that are more informative for learning sensory representations than the original episodes. We demonstrate that the performance in visual discrimination tasks is superior when episodic memory is present and that this difference is due to episodic memory driving the learning of a more optimized sensory representation. We conclude that the MTL can, even if it has only a purely mnemonic function, influence perceptual discrimination indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, in part because the available treatments are inadequate and do not work for many people. The neurobiology of depression, and the mechanism of action of common antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is not well understood. One mechanism thought to underlie the effects of these drugs is upregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Evidence indicates that vesicular zinc is required for modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, at least under some circumstances. Vesicular zinc refers to zinc that is stored in the synaptic vesicles of certain neurons, including in the hippocampus, and released in response to neuronal activity. It can be eliminated from the brain by deletion of zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3), as is the case in ZnT3 knockout mice. Here, we examined the effects of repeated social defeat stress and subsequent chronic treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and neurogenesis in ZnT3 knockout mice. We hypothesized that fluoxetine treatment would increase neurogenesis and reverse stress‐induced behavioral symptoms in wild type, but not ZnT3 knockout, mice. As anticipated, stress induced persistent depression‐like effects, including social avoidance and anxiety‐like behavior. Fluoxetine decreased social avoidance, though the effect was not specific to the stressed mice, but did not affect anxiety‐like behavior. Surprisingly, stress increased the survival of neurons born 1 day after the last episode of defeat stress. Fluoxetine treatment also increased cell survival, particularly in wild type mice, though it did not affect proliferation. Our results did not support our hypothesis that vesicular zinc is required for the behavioral benefits of fluoxetine treatment. As to whether vesicular zinc is required for the neurogenic effects of fluoxetine, our results were inconclusive, warranting further investigation into the role of vesicular zinc in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rodents, pyramidal cell firing patterns from waking may be replayed in nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM) sleep during hippocampal sharp wave ripples (HC‐SWR). In humans, HC‐SWR have only been recorded with electrodes implanted to localize epileptogenicity. Here, we characterize human HC‐SWR with rigorous rejection of epileptiform activity, requiring multiple oscillations and coordinated sharp waves. We demonstrated typical SWR in those rare HC recordings which lack interictal epileptiform spikes (IIS) and with no or minimal seizure involvement. These HC‐SWR have a similar rate (~12 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; on average, variable across NREM stages and anterior/posterior HC) and apparent intra‐HC topography (ripple maximum in putative stratum pyramidale, slow wave in radiatum) as rodents, though with lower frequency (~85 Hz compared to ~140 Hz in rodents). Similar SWR are found in HC with IIS, but no significant seizure involvement. These SWR were modulated by behavior, being largely absent (&amp;lt;2 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) except during NREM sleep in both Stage 2 (~9 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Stage 3 (~15 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), distinguishing them from IIS. This study quantifies the basic characteristics of a strictly selected sample of SWR recorded in relatively healthy human hippocampi.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ventral portion of the rodent hippocampus (HPC; anterior in primates) has been implicated in the detection and resolution of approach–avoidance conflict, which arises when an organism encounters a stimulus that predicts both positive and negative outcomes. Previous work has found differential regulation of approach–avoidance conflict behavior by the CA3 and CA1 subfields, with inhibition of ventral CA3 increasing approach toward conflicting stimuli and inhibition of the ventral CA1 potentiating avoidance. Here, we sought to extend these findings by investigating the role of the dentate gyrus (DG), the input region of the HPC, in learned approach–avoidance conflict processing in rats. Animals were first trained to acquire three different visuotactile cue‐outcome associations in separate arms of a Y‐maze (appetitive, aversive, and neutral). Postacquisition, they were administered a “conflict test,” in which they were presented with a choice between exploring an arm in which the appetitive and aversive cues were concurrently presented (conflict stimulus), and another arm containing the neutral stimulus. GABAR‐mediated inactivation of the ventral DG, but not dorsal DG, potentiated approach behavior toward the conflict stimulus, similar to the effects of ventral CA3 inactivation. In contrast, dorsal DG, but not ventral DG, inactivation was found to impair performance on a metric spatial discrimination task, which is commonly used as a test of pattern separation. The findings of this study demonstrate a robust double dissociation between the ventral and dorsal aspects of the DG, in line with previous reports of functional differences along the longitudinal axis of the HPC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus encodes distinct contexts with unique patterns of activity. Representational shifts with changes in context, referred to as remapping, have been extensively studied. However, less is known about transitions between representations. In this study, we leverage a large dataset of neuronal recordings taken while rats performed an olfactory memory task with a predictable temporal structure involving trials and intertrial intervals (ITIs), separated by salient boundaries at the trial start and trial end. We found that trial epochs were associated with stable hippocampal representations despite moment‐to‐moment variability in stimuli and behavior. Representations of trial and ITI epochs were far more distinct than spatial factors would predict and the transitions between the two were abrupt. The boundary was associated with a large spike in multiunit activity, with many individual cells specifically active at the start or end of each trial. Both epochs and boundaries were encoded by hippocampal populations, and these representations carried information on orthogonal axes readily identified using principal component analysis. We suggest that the hippocampus orthogonalizes representations of the trial and ITI epochs and the activity spike at trial boundaries might serve to drive hippocampal activity from one stable state to the other.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;α‐Thalassemia X‐linked intellectual disability (ATR‐X) syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;ATRX &lt;/i&gt; gene that encodes a SNF2‐type chromatin‐remodeling protein. The ATRX protein regulates chromatin structure and gene expression in the developing mouse brain and early inactivation leads to DNA replication stress, extensive cell death, and microcephaly. However, the outcome of &lt;i&gt;Atrx &lt;/i&gt; loss of function postnatally in neurons is less well understood. We recently reported that conditional inactivation of &lt;i&gt;Atrx &lt;/i&gt; in postnatal forebrain excitatory neurons (ATRX‐cKO) causes deficits in long‐term hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory. Thus, we hypothesized that ATRX‐cKO mice will display impaired hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity. In the present study, evoked field potentials and current source density analysis were recorded from a multichannel electrode in male, urethane‐anesthetized mice. Three major excitatory synapses, the Schaffer collaterals to basal dendrites and proximal apical dendrites, and the temporoammonic path to distal apical dendrites on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were assessed by their baseline synaptic transmission, including paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF) at 50‐ms interpulse interval, and by their long‐term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta‐frequency burst stimulation. Baseline single‐pulse excitatory response at each synapse did not differ between ATRX‐cKO and control mice, but baseline PPF was reduced at the CA1 basal dendritic synapse in ATRX‐cKO mice. While basal dendritic LTP of the first‐pulse excitatory response was not affected in ATRX‐cKO mice, proximal and distal apical dendritic LTP were marginally and significantly reduced, respectively. These results suggest that ATRX is required in excitatory neurons of the forebrain to achieve normal hippocampal LTP and PPF at the CA1 apical and basal dendritic synapses, respectively. Such alterations in hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity could explain the long‐term spatial memory deficits in ATRX‐cKO mice and provide insight into the physiological mechanisms underlying intellectual disability in ATR‐X syndrome patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal subfield segmentation on in vivo MRI is of great interest for cognition, aging, and disease research. Extant subfield segmentation protocols have been based on neuroanatomical references, but these references often give limited information on anatomical variability. Moreover, there is generally a mismatch between the orientation of the histological sections and the often anisotropic coronal sections on in vivo MRI. To address these issues, we provide a detailed description of hippocampal anatomy using a postmortem dataset containing nine specimens of subjects with and without dementia, which underwent a 9.4 T MRI and histological processing. Postmortem MRI matched the typical orientation of in vivo images and segmentations were generated in MRI space, based on the registered annotated histological sections. We focus on the following topics: the order of appearance of subfields, the location of subfields relative to macroanatomical features, the location of subfields in the uncus and tail and the composition of the dark band, a hypointense layer visible in T2‐weighted MRI. Our main findings are that: (a) there is a consistent order of appearance of subfields in the hippocampal head, (b) the composition of subfields is not consistent in the anterior uncus, but more consistent in the posterior uncus, (c) the dark band consists only of the CA‐stratum lacunosum moleculare, not the strata moleculare of the dentate gyrus, (d) the subiculum/CA1 border is located at the middle of the width of the hippocampus in the body in coronal plane, but moves in a medial direction from anterior to posterior, and (e) the variable location and composition of subfields in the hippocampal tail can be brought back to a body‐like appearance when reslicing the MRI scan following the curvature of the tail. Our findings and this publicly available dataset will hopefully improve anatomical accuracy of future hippocampal subfield segmentation protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

			<subtitle type="html">Nature Reviews Neuroscience is the leading review journal in the neurosciences. It publishes articles that review recent progress in brain and nervous system research. Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry. One of the unique features of Nature Reviews Neuroscience is its extraordinary breadth and depth of coverage. This very broad scope – from molecules to mind – captures the essence of modern neuroscience, and allows the journal to attract readers from all areas of this ever-expanding discipline.</subtitle>
